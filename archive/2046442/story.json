            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take Marc long to notice that he was entering the large, elegant structures of the Gold Division. He gulped. His situation really hinged on who he got assigned to. With Bronze, despite their shortcomings as fighters, they tended to be rather easy to deal with due to not really being used to having access to a servant who would do virtually anything they demanded. Silver, on the other hand, was hit or miss. Some where reasonable while others where abusive. It just depended. Some Silvers were recently promoted and felt that they were owed something while others were to happy making it up the food chain to really care about servants really. But with Gold, most were self-assured bitches that took full advantage of their station to derive as much amusement as possible. It was really like you couldn't win with the ASL top division of fighters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was so engrossed in his thoughts that he didn't even notice the large figure in front of him until is walked right into her. Marc's eyes widened as his vision was obscured by a white furred belly. He quickly looked up, past the large protruding belly and sizable breasts into the amused face of Claudine. The titanic unicorn was looking down at him with an amused expression and eyebrow raised. Claudine was wearing a black tank top and shorts, meaning that she had most likely was coming from or was heading to training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, several memories of the thrashings he received for staring at his past mistresses flashed before his eyes before he jumped back and bowed. Even if she wasn't his new mistress, he rather not receive a beating before he even met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really, really sorry for that, ma'am,\" Marc spoke quickly. \"I got a little lost in thought on my over here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed,\" Claudine intoned softly. \"You wouldn't happen to be Marc, would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was quiet and cultured but it still managed to send shivers up his spine. He couldn't read anything from her tone and from her question, she had to be his new mistress. And his first act was to possibly disrespect her. His mouth suddenly went dry and he couldn't speak, so head nodded to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Claudine stated, looking him over. \"Now what to do with you now?\"</span></div></div>",

I wish to speak to you in private.\" Claudine spoke softly and turned on her heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc jogged to keep up with the unicorn's longer stride. It wasn't long before the two arrived at the door to Claudine's quarters. Once Claudine opened the door, Marc got a good look at the space. The room was rather nice, all things considered. There was a large dining table with a vase full of roses in the center surrounded several large, plush chairs for anthros and even one raised chair fitted for a human with a ladder attached to it. In the far corner of the room was large desk sporting a high tech computer and swivel chair. On the back wall was a large flat screen TV with a comfy looking sofa sitting in front. Against the right wall was a large bookshelf filled to the brim with various books and novels. There was also another doorway, from which Marc could see lead to another set of rooms. Marc was quite surprised just how normal the room seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my humble abode.\" Claudine spoke softly as she walked in with March right behind her. \"Wait here. I am going to change into something more comfortable. I will not be long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the unicorn disappeared into the doorway. leaving Marc standing by himself. He would've plopped down on the plush couch but was too afraid that Claudine would be upset if he did without permission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have long to ponder as soon Claudine came back through the door way, in a blue silk robe. She immediately plopped herself down onto the couch and waved you over. Marc walked around the couch until he was facing his new mistress who was staring at him quite intensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to try and make a good impression. \"Is there anything I can do for you, ma'am?\" He questioned evenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine's eyes never left his as she nodded. \"Yes...\" She drawled smoothly. \"You see...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...if you're going to be my aide, then I need to know a little about you.\" Claudine finished, her gaze boring into Marc. She patted the seat next to her on the couch, inviting him to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the scrutiny he was under, Marc relaxed a little when Claudine said 'aide' and not 'servant' before moving to sit on the couch. He already been through a few other mistresses and as such, had some experience with predicting mannerisms. While views of the those like himself varied from fighter to fighter, most viewed them a glorified toys: to be used, worked, and discarded at a whim. They were another luxury, to be enjoyed but not important in the grand scheme of things and they made that apparent with everything they did and how they spoke. The fact the Claudine even used the word 'aide' was a least an encouraging sign. Not guarantee but reassuring nonetheless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc took a small breath before answering. \"Well not much to say, really,\" he started. \"I signed up to ASL to get some money to go to school and well, being the moron that I am, I didn't read the fine print, I ended up a servant here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine nodded, the look her face seemingly agreeing with the 'moron' statement. \"You should always read fine print.\" Her tone was soft but admonishing, like she was speaking to a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a good bit of Marc's willpower to bite back the retort that bubbled up his throat. He didn't need her to tell him that, he was and had been living it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he first got here, he would've snapped at Claudine but the beatings he received for had drilled into him the importance of watching his tongue. That and the fact that Claudine was at least starting out reasonable so he should atleast try and be cooperative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't that the truth,\" Marc continued evenly, \"Anyway, I got been passed around between sumos, mostly Bronze and Silver, which didn't last too long in the ring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine raised a brow. \"So you've never really been with an ASL member for  anyextended time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc shook his head. \"Not really. All of the ones I've been assigned to eventually got eaten, killed or just quite after taking too many beatings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn snorted, her contempt on full display. \"Such weaklings. Obviously their drive wasn't strong enough. Be rest assured, dear Marc, that I do not have such a problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We'll see,</i> Marc though cynically. After hearing such lines for so long, he just need to see Claudine actually do well before he put that kind of faith in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued this for some time. Claudine would as various questions or make observations and Marc would do his best to elaborate. Marc found the novel experience of simply being able to talk rather freely to be a novel one. Dealing with all the overbearing fighters and his past mistresses, had left him tongue tied and missing general conversation. For Claudine, she just continued to note various things about her new aide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the the time the two stopped it had grown rather late in the day. This was demonstrated when Claudine gave a discrete yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Marc, I do believe that that is enough for today and that we should retire. I want to be up bright and early tomorrow. I will be showing you my training schedule and your expected duties.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Marc nodded. Claudine rose from the couch and motioned for Marc to do the same. She led him through the doorway he spotted earlier. The unicorn showed him to what would be his new room. It was a rather spartan room with but it held a comfy looking bed, a sizable closet and nightstand with drawers and a desk with a laptop on it. There was even a window! The room itself was positioned the opposite of Claudine's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing him his room, Claudine bide Marc a goodnight, telling him to be ready by 8 am the next morning. Marc immediately went to bed, deciding to get some rest for what was probably going to be a long day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

With a welling fear in his chest, he could see every other day working for Claudine tumbling like dominoes by any possible fatigue-driven disaster that tomorrow could bring, and there wasn't a thing he could do about it. All he could do was lay back and stare up at the ceiling, hoping that the gods of sleep would eventually answer his prayers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling itself actually bowed temptingly low by the center, thanks to the mountainous weight of his boss laying above, likely sleeping better than <i>he</i> could. Even though he could stand up straight in the room built beneath her bed, it was still pretty cramped for a human to easily adapt to, and the intimidating bulge in the ceiling only made things harder. <i>How the hell am I not her friggin' tattoo right now?!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a loud, metallic groan hummed through the entire room from the ceiling, which slowly flattened out as the weight on top rolled off the roof, accompanied by a deep <i>WHUMP!</i> on the floor outside. Even from his bed, Marc could feel a heavy set of footsteps trudging from the bed to the door, accompanied by a soft dragging sound along the carpet that he could tell was Claudine's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" Even though the room was 100% less deadly, Marc curiously slid out of bed and went for the door, clad only in a white T-shirt and plaid pajama pants. When he opened the door, Claudine was just leaving her bedroom, her barn-sized back passing through the door. \"Claudine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine either didn't hear him or didn't heed, and kept walking to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc tiptoed as quietly and swiftly as he could to the door, hiding behind the doorframe with his cheek resting on the lip. He watched as Claudine carefully craned her weight into the couch, using an aura of golden magic flaring from her horn to flip the TV on, shining bright light shone upon her and the rest of the room, blaring the melodramatic whining of some random soap opera. A door across the room also opened on its own, from which a tub of ice cream the size of an SUV floated in, joining her on the other end of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's going on?\" Marc whispered to himself as Claudine dig out an ice cream scoop from the bucket, taking a hearty bite of sherbet...</span></div></div>",

Now, he hadn't known her for too long but Claudine seemed so...so composed, self-assured of herself and proud. But currently looking at the Gold-Level fighter, all he could see was someone who looked tired and miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why...\" Claudine mumbled to herself through the sherbet and staring at the tv. \"...why can't I have something like that...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's brow arched into his hairline before looking towards the TV. Just like he thought it was a soap opera. But the scene was what caught his attention. It was a young couple, just talking, laughing...they seemed happy. Marc looked back to Claudine and connected the dots. <i>\"She's lonely...\"</i> Marc realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredible to him. That someone who had everything on a sliver platter didn't have something that basic. Back in the human world, Marc had had plenty of friends. Heck, even had a few ex-girlfriends he could still call friends! But it really seemed like Claudine didn't have any of that. <i>\"It really must be lonely at the top...\"</i> He mused, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this left him with a dilemma. Claudine seemed honestly distressed and if he was right, maybe she just needed a friend or at least someone who showed they cared. He just met her, but he could understand that and sympathized. As a plus, it could really help set the tone with them going down the line, for however long that lasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, something nagged him. What if Claudine really didn't want anyone to know about this? What if she lashed out at him? Every other fighter he'd been assigned to had been a pure bitch in how they acted. Maybe it was better to walk away and try to get some sleep...</span></div></div>",

Marc quickly moved over to couch and took his seat. He turned to look at Claudine's towering figure and saw her expression. Marc had no way of really describing it but sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Marc started. \"You said gold division like it was a curse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine looked down at him for a moment before speaking. \"Marc, I've been here at the ASL for a few years now. I started as a simple Bronze and clawed my way up on nothing but pure skill. No eating other fighters and not even being the biggest fighter around. I wanted to be the best. Here I am now. And what do I have to show for it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn gestured around the luxurious room with a hand. Marc followed it and it was then that he noticed it. Claudine had no pictures in the room. There were expensive looking vases and flowers, paintings and the like but no actual pictures. None of any friends or family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine continued, her tone bitter. \"I've gotten to the top and I'm alone. When I decided to join the ASL, my family weren't what one could call supportive. But it was what I wanted to do, so I broke off with my family. I would be the best, no matter what they said. I was so sure that once I got to the top of ASL, I get some respect and who knows, maybe some friends and maybe get something more than that. But that's not what happened. I'm alone and I'm stuck here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Marc asked, honestly surprised and confused. \"You're one of the best fighters here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine gave a dainty snort. \"I maybe respected, Marc, but that's it. I threw away everything I could have had so that I could come here. Yes, I've gotten into the Gold Division. Despite that, I'm still not the best. The one anthro I could call my friend here, has never been defeated. Like me, she works with skill more than anything else. Yet, she's never lost and I have. And like I said, she's my only friend. Everyone else around here is either afraid of me, envies me, or disgusts me. To add more salt in the wound, I really can't leave. Look at me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine got off of the couch and stood in front of Marc, who blushed a little when noticed that her robe was open, revealing her black bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm huge. This body demands a lot to keep running. Food, exercise and so much more. If I were to leave, how would I support myself. Outside of fighting, I don't have that many skills. The ASL takes care of all our needs and reward our hard work with virtually whatever we want but not real money. I've have if I leave. So again, I'm trapped. Trapped here alone, with no one who cares. You think those fans who cheer my name and stream my matches care? No, I'm entertainment. Good entertainment, but still entertainment nonetheless. If I dropped off the map, no one would.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the unicorn sat down again, her face a mask of misery and disappointment. On Marc's side, he couldn't believe it. He and Claudine had so much in common. Marc wanted to got to college so that he could do something with his life. For that, he was willing to leave his home just to get the money to go. Claudine had done the same. The only difference, she was so much closer to getting what she wanted. It rang a bell with him and he knew that he couldn't let someone so much like himself give up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claudine,\" he said, getting the unicorn's watery gaze upon him. \"We may have just met, but I think you shouldn't just give up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine's look showed she didn't believe that. \"No seriously!\" Marc implored, his tone firm. \"You've come so far. I just met you and I can already tell that. You deserve better. You deserve to be the best. If no cares, I'll care. If no one supports you, I'll still be here. I've met all the wannabes who claim they'll be the best. You're the first one who really seems like she could do it. And I'll help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc watched her as the unicorn regarded him. She smiled after a while. It was small and seemed brittle. \"And how would you do that?\" She intoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't hesitate. \"However you want me to. You want to bulk up, I'll get down to the kitchens and make sure they arrange you a feast like none they ever even dare make. You want muscle, I'll make sure that every single machine in the gym is working and up to date. If I've got to twist a few arms and stand up to even other fighters, I'll help you get to the top.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine stared at him before allowing an actual smile grace her lips. \"Then go get some sleep. You'll need it, because starting tomorrow, the training begins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc smiled, proud that he actually was able to motivate her. He got up off the couch and went to go back to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and Marc?\" Claudine called over his back. He turned a looked back at her. \"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gave her a grin. \"Anytime.\"</span></div></div>",

He had to admit, getting Claudine to put down the fork and go by the hand was a bit of a challenge, but with enough well-worded arguments, he had her going in at full charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith decent progress, too. At first it'd just looked like an optical illusion under her constantly pouring down food by the barrelful, but in the later days of the week he could see the clear feet of weight being added to her hips, creeping out and over the ends of her dining table's end seat. The yellow shirt was a dead giveaway, too, courtesy of the red one she'd outgrown and thrown out, but now this one was about to cross lines with the third as the mouth rode up to the top of her back's lowest trench of fat sitting on top of her gym pants' superstretched belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...5...4...3...2...1!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine's back shot back into her seat, hands laying on her belly as she finally took a long, winded breath of fresh air from her session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great work! How're you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...like a <i>blimp.</i>\" Claudine panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see if that's true. Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine's hooves dug deep into the carpet, not moving as her legs craned her butt up from the chair and straightened her back up at its full length. Given just a week, it wasn't much, but Marc could see just enough extra height on her shoulders to tell that she was taller since they'd last met, but several extra feet of belly bulged away from her spine along its entire curvature, and toned with enough exercise that the flab was tightly rounded out, puffing out in full without any rolls of flab sagging around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even seem any bit winded on her trek from the table to a wide spot of empty rug they'd kept visiting ever since her revelation, and Marc dragged the ladder in place with a tape measure in his teeth. As he climbed the rungs, the ends of the tape were grabbed by blobs of golden magic that threw its length around her body, but with many feet less of excess than yesterday's cramming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Claudine asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on...\" Marc pulled the tape taut , lining up the furthest dashes of the few-dozen feet wrapping around her massive form. \"Damn. 62 feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout seeing her face, Marc could still feel her satisfaction by a contented being loosened out above. \"Perfect...not the biggest, but it's great progress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's just from half a week, if we're going off of tuesday.\" Marc replied as he stepped back down from the ladder. \"So, did you wanna take a break, or anything else?\"</span></div></div>",

The one thing I've learned is that constant training will over create undue stress. A shower would be quite nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc nodded in agreement. Ever since he spoke to Claudine several days ago, her demeanor had changed a little. Whenever she spoke to him, her tone was always friendly and inviting. Even when she game him what amounted to an order, she was never demeaning or overly strict. In return, he did his best to get her what she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Marc also noted how many times Claudine allowed him to relax around her. Many of his past mistresses would run him ragged and rarely gave him a moment's peace. Claudine, on the other hand, allowed him to take breaks when she did. During those moments, he and Claudine would usually find something to do: watching a movie, talking about the latest crazy thing to happen around the ASL or review Claudine's old matches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, when the two made their way back to Claudine's quarters, Marc wondered what they would do this time...</span></div></div>",

However, today she found no solace, rather having something, or more precisely, <i>someone</i>, on her mind. It was something Claudine could no longer deny to herself, even though she had only known him for a week, she found herself smitten with Marc. The past couple of days spent with Marc were some of the best she had since joining the ASL. For the first time, she had someone who she actually call a friend beside Avery. Someone who cared and was happy to see her. After much thought about the matter, Claudine decided that she could not wait any longer, the time to act was now, she let too many opportunities pass her by before, she would not let this one slip by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Claudine finished her shower, she found herself looking at the mirror in her room, wearing nothing but a set of black lace lingerie that now seemed a size or two too small for her. Ironically enough, this was the set she wore when Marc found her at night eating ice cream and being forlorn. To add even more to the irony, the lingerie was gifted to her by Avery as to in her words, <i>\"Help her find a man!\"</i> Claudine was used to Avery's teasing, and so she kept the bra and panties, she used them for when she was in her quarters, and she hated to admit it, but they were very comfortable. As Claudine looked at herself in the mirror, nervousness started to settle in.  Would Marc even share the same feelings she had for him? She started to let reality set in: Not only was she <i>significantly</i> heavier than Marc to say the least, she was also much taller, 20 feet versus 6 feet was a very large margin. \u201cWho knows,\u201d Claudine uttered to herself, attempting to comfort herself, \u201cMaybe Marc likes girls with a figure like mine.\u201d Claudine heard of some assistants coming into the ASL purely to ogle at the wrestlers. As lousy as that sounded, it gave Claudine some faith as she saw her large figure. Her heart was racing as if she was finished with a training session, \u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d Claudine whispered to herself, ready to face whatever may come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marc was a little concerned; normally Claudine was a lot faster in her showers, but he figured he had her reasons, Marc decided to pass the time by scheduling out the rest of Claudine\u2019s regimen. It\u2019s only been a week but she\u2019s made amazing progress so far. Marc himself felt good as well, never before was he so invested in a wrestler, and for the first time in a while, he was actually happy. His thoughts were interrupted when he heard Claudine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Marc? Can you come in please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thought hit Marc, he had never been in Claudine\u2019s room before, he wondered what Claudine could want, and decided to not keep her waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Along the way, Marc questioned how he would even open Claudine\u2019s door, given the size difference between the two.  Thankfully though, the door was left partially open, so Marc didn\u2019t have to worry about that. As Marc opened the door, he saw that the room was\u2026dark?  Marc found that the only light in the room came from candles,  which was a little weird, but that left the question, where was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cClaudine!\u201d  Marc exclaimed, seeing her on the bed with nothing but a black bra and underwear, both of which seemed way too small for her.  Marc was stunned, he didn\u2019t know what to say, he had seen Claudine like this before, but she was covered in a robe at least, was she going to ask him to find it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what are you doing Claudine?\u201d Was all Marc could stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Claudine raised her hand at him, most likely as an attempt to calm him down, \u201cI know this is a little weird Marc, but please, just\u2026sit down and I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d She patted the mattress, inviting him to the bed.  Confused, Marc had no other choice but to join the unicorn. Even though she sat on the bed, Marc still found himself craning his neck to look at her face, which looked just as nervous as Marc was.  Due to Claudine\u2019s sheer weight, as soon as Marc sat on the mattress, he found himself slumped against her side. For a while he attempted to get out of hit, but eventually gave up, wanting to know what Claudine had in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Claudine let out a long sigh, and she began to speak, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of assistants in my time in the ASL, but you\u2026you Marc, you\u2019re really something different. Every day you\u2019re always happy to see me, and you work your best to keep me in shape.  When you look at me, you don\u2019t see me as a boss, but rather a friend.\u201d  Marc was happy to hear this, to be honest; Marc hoped Claudine would consider him as a friend, so this was going even better than he hoped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That\u2019s not what Marc wanted to hear! How did he mess up, what did he do? More importantly, what would Claudine do to him? It was obvious that Claudine saw the panic well up in Marc, as she immediately tried to soothe him, \u201cNo no Marc! You did not do anything wrong! It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Claudine sighed again and shifted her position in bed as to face Marc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDo you remember that romance show you caught me watching  at night, the first day you met me?  As time passed and I got to know you better, I saw that you were nice and kind and\u2026sometimes at night I imagined us doing the things in the show and\u2026\u201d Claudine took a second to compose herself. \u201cI\u2019ve never been good at this, so let me just get to the point, I\u2019ve grown fond over you over the past week, I know this maybe too soon, but I would be remiss if I were to let this chance slip by. I\u2026I want to be more than friends with you Marc,  I\u2026I have feelings for you. My question to you is, do you feel  the same way as I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mark was in shock, he did not expect any of this, perhaps his enthusiasm for Claudine worked a little too well.  He took some time to process what she said, Claudine liked him, enough so that she asked him out! It was a short amount of time, but Marc liked Claudine as well, however, he wasn\u2019t sure if he liked Claudine the way she liked him. Should he give Claudine a chance? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of all the wrestlers Marc worked under, by far he found Claudine to be the best. She was nice and fair to him, and actually treated him like a person. Even though their time had been short, Marc felt the happiest he'd been since working under the ASL. When Marc found Claudine at night alone, he promised her he would do anything to get her to the top, but he also wanted to see her happy. And if he could do anything to help her, then he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It also helped that he thought Claudine was pretty as well. Her white fur was elegant much like herself, and her personality won him over. And although Marc would never admit it, he would give the occasional glance over at Claudine whenever she bent over to stretch. Marc made up his mind: he'd give Claudine a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while Marc was thinking, time went by, and the more time went on, the more Claudine thought Marc's silence meant a refusal to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed,  \"I knew it was a long shot. It's fine Marc, I promise I won't be mad at you.\" By the time Marc got out of his train of thought he saw Claudine nearly in tears.<br>\r\nHe tried to grab her attention, but much like Marc earlier, she was consumed in her own thoughts. \"Claudine!\" he shouted, trying to get her attention but failing, so he decided to grab her attention in another way. He kissed her. Due to the size difference, it took all he had to jump up, so the kiss ended up being a small peck. It wasn't the kiss Marc had in mind, but it was just as effective. \"Marc...what are you...\" Claudine whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claudine, I want you to know that I'd love to be your boyfriend, how can I not? You're kind and sweet, and you actually care about me. Of course I'd go out with you! I'd do anything to make you happy.\"Marc said, meaning every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, Claudine didn't say anything. Finally, she let out a small laugh, which eventually turned into a giggle, which soon turned into a fit of laughter. It was the first time Marc saw her laugh like this, it was different from the elegant nature she usually carried around, but it was goddamned adorable, and he couldn't help but laugh with her. So much so that he didn't even notice Claudine grab him, and by the time he realized, he was face first in her chest, not that that was a bad thing, Marc thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so glad you said yes Marc.\" Claudine cooed to her now boyfriend, lifting him up so they could be face to face. Marc replied, \"I wouldn't have it any other way.\"<br>\r\nClaudine giggled again, and brought Marc closer for another kiss, this time with passion! It was easily the best kiss Marc ever had. Still dazed, Marc asked, \"So, what do you want to do know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine took a moment to think about it, and made her decision. \"Well my little Marc...\"</span></div></div>",

But I can't help but feel like I could get bigger, faster...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc frowned slightly. They had been training hard for the past several days. What more could they really do but stay the course. It wasn't like there was some magic way for her to get larger. Or, at least none that he knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine sighed when she caught his expression. \"I'm sorry Marc, I don't mean to demean any of your efforts. Truly, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even be as big as I'm am now. But I can't help but feel I'm doing as much on my part...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've done nothing but stuffed and worked yourself like crazy! I mean, you've done in a few days what most fighters do in weeks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine nodded. \"Under your encouragement and management we've achieved much. However, there is another way, I was thinking. A way for me to take the a true leap into becoming the best. If I do this...it would be compromising part of my beliefs but it could truly turn out for the better...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's brow arched in surprise before his eyes widened in realization. \"Y-You can't be saying...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine gave solemn nod. \"I am saying that I will agree to do a survival match. Just one, Marc.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man slapped a hand to his forehead. \"Against who?\" He was afraid of the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charla.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Marc's jaw fell. Charla was one of the biggest anthro in the entire facility. She was also one of the best fighters and hungriest to boot. She was always looking to devour more and larger competitors. Charla, however, would also take whatever she could get her claws one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're serious about this aren't you?\" It was all he could say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am.\" Claudine responded. \"I'm going to do it, Marc. You got me to realize that I had fallen into a rut and helped to start getting me out. But you also helped me realize that I need to change my methods. If I don't, then, all of this will mean nothing. I can't allow myself to just plateau out like before. I don't want to simply be one of the best, Marc. I want to be the very best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marc stared in her eyes, he knew Claudine meant every word of that. He need that she might actually be able to do it but he couldn't shake off the feeling that of what if she couldn't? What if things went bad? Claudine was more than just his ticket to an easy time in the hellhole that was the ASL. She had become a dear friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Marc. What I'm asking is if I should wait or should I just go for it? I know enough about Charla, so studying her would be redundant. Also, If I were to try an bulk up even more, I'm just really playing her game aren't I? She's used to being huge, I am not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc bit his bottom lip. He never thought he'd be in this sort of situation. In the end, after about two minutes thinking it over, he gave his answer.</span></div></div>",

She scratched at the bottom of her chin, letting a long moment of silence between the two of them, but then gave a confident nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She finally spoke. \"I'm absolutely sure about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc breathed in, held it in, then let it out, shrugging. \"Alright. I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded again, then pushed her immense weight off of the couch, footsteps seeming to strike just a little bit harder as she dragged her belly across the carpeted floor. The two were silent once again as Claudine pulled out her desk's chair with her magic and sat down, also unrolling a browned sheet of paper from a roll on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after saying yes, something about Claudine's movements were still slow and cautious compared to her average confidence and speed as she took out a pen, licked the tip, dipped the quill in ink, flattened out the paper, checked the pen once more, and then flattened the paper <i>again</i> before scribbling Charla's name into the survival slip. She looked back at Marc, who quietly turned his head the other way, and she looked back down to jot some other notes concerning the match's specifics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the sheet, her quill hit the dotted line, but stuck there for several seconds before swiftly drawing her name in cursive. With all the needed details filled in, Claudine took up the page and observed her handwriting at arm's length, giving it one last, long look until she grabbed a pneumatic tube and unscrewed the lid, using her magic to roll up the scroll and tuck it into the pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc still didn't turn back as she went through one more pause, nor when he heard the pneumatic system's port open up for the tube to be slotted in, which he could hear zoom right into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Marc noted, stepping around to face her. \"I'm in with you all the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Marc.\" Claudine answered, both hands braced on the desk. \"...I've signed us up for tomorrow at midnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Marc asked. \"You know what to do when you go against her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as soon as possible, I was thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

The stadium the match was taking place in was enormous, built to house the largest of competitors.

Their combined energy filled the air and their roars and chants made the entire place vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Marc was ringside. He was at a special lift allowing him to be level with Claudine's neck. The unicorn was seated on a large metal stool fitted for her size, eyes closed and simply meditating. She was blocking out the hoots and roars of the crowd, focusing herself. Her horn pulsed and hummed with energy, ready to fire at a moments notice. Claudine's expression was peaceful if stern. Marc had taken to gently rubbing circles in the crook of the unicorns neck, a small but reassuring gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, while Claudine certainly didn't mind, Marc was honestly doing this for himself. It comforted him to feel Claudine's healthy combination of flab and muscle underneath his palms. It reminded him of how much work they had done and that Claudine was hopped up rookie with a death wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helped him to keep his mind off her opponent who stood eager at the other side of the ring. Charla was an immense form of dinosaur of dinosaur protoplasm and muscle. She was honestly the biggest anthro Marc had ever seen, towering over the ring and much of the stands in the background. She was also some strange hybrid. Her neck and tail reminded him of large hebivores with their immense length. However, he could spot the large and sharp teeth in her smile and the strong claws that were her hands. Marc couldn't even begin to guess at all that was in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take her, Marc.\" Claudine spoke, getting his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc took a deep breath. \"I really want to believe that. I trust you, I really do but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's huge.\" Claudine finished. \"I know. That makes her dangerous but it's also her biggest weakness. Charla is not fast and she needs to get in range to do damage. I'm her worst kind of opponent. I can hammer her energy blast even before she gets near me and I'm used to fighting those bigger than me. It also helps that Charla has been preying on large but inexperienced fighters for some time now. Mainly from the Silver division. She will be rusty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded to her logic. Suddenly, a siren went off, signaling the start of the match. There was no referee as one wasn't need. Once both combatants got into the ring, there was no turning back and to top it off, there were no rules. Only one of the fighters could walk away from a Survival match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine hoisted herself up from her stool. She peered down at Marc and smiled. \"Don't worry. I'll win.\" Her tone was so confident and sincere, Marc felt his doubts start wash away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will.\" He returned the smile with actual feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine nodded and turned, stepping into the ring and her destiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the same time, Claudine's hoof and Charla's claw set foot in the ring, and all the cheers of the audience faded into silence. Even if there wasn't a rulebook, a moment of silence was a common custom for all the other matches in the ASL, especially for the more anticipated or iconic battles, but now, the entire stadium was completely hushed. Not even the usual idiots screaming \"I love you\" to the fighters made a peep, allowing Charla to break the silence first with an amused chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can see somebody's decided to give the high dive a try, then.\" She spoke rather eloquently, to Marc's surprise. \"Why the sudden change of heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's not been a single change, Charla.\" Claudine responded, trying to fit in with what'd probably be first and last sophisticated moment between them. \"I've simply accepted what I should've seen the moment I'd entered the gold division; to advance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I guess moving onto the very top wasn't enough for you, was it?\" She retorted, hitching up her gold-framed belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The top's always beyond our reach, Charla. There truly <i>isn't</i> any end to the journey.\" Claudine hunched over, squashing her stomach along the rings rubber-coated floor as she braced her hands along her legs. \"Once I've beaten you, I'm sure I won't even be halfway there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Charla followed her action, her ambitious smirk never leaving her maw. \"Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"On go!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee waved a flag right down the center line, the terror clear on his face and ready to send him running out of the stare down's path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three...two...one...GO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sloppily threw the flag down, more occupied as he ran for his life into the safety outside of the ring, even though they didn't slam into one another the moment the match began. Charla was the one who gave the first move and, as slow as her weight forced her to be, ran as fast as she could towards Claudine, who didn't move from her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doubts swam back into Marc's mind as Charla threw her arms down, now close enough to rip Claudine in half like a phone book, but her claws only swept through a swarm of pink particles of energy twirling in the air. Having sent a rippling blast of magic from her horn, Claudine's boulder-like form quickly swerved away from the attack and hovered around Charla's side with a trail of rippling, golden-hued waves in her path, her hooves skidding along the ground when she was behind her foe. With another spell, she leapt off of an explosion of yellow light that sent her weightlessly flying towards Charla's back, and she hooked an arm out to connect around the chimera's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharla nearly came tumbling down as she felt Claudine's arm and weight suddenly cling onto her neck, teetering her onto one foot, but with her mind racing she swung her arm down and spun her entire body around so she was facing up, her momentum throwing the unicorn up into the air like a hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON, CLAUDINE!!!\" Marc screamed, both supportive and fearful as Claudine regained her senses in midair. With another spell, her body bounced off a round forcefield of pink that stopped her spinning, and she then dented the metal in the stadium's skeleton as she slammed back into the ground with both hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to what Claudine had said, Charla didn't have that much of an acrobatic way to recover from the shock, and the unicorn was ready with a stunning energy blast that struck her foe's face. The chimera blindly stumbled into the ring, trying to steady her head, and Claudine was quick get on her case with a magic-infused running start that sent her sliding and skidding on her back with a leap, and another gold burst sent her flying up to knock the wind out of Charla's belly with a hoof, soaring overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's screams turned to cheers, melding into those of all the rest of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven better, as Charla'd found her balance, he could see the confidence that she'd been smiling around was waning away, already giving into frustration. Claudine didn't give her a chance to act on it and, only noticed then by the audience and her foe, pulled down on a cord of yellow light stringing from her horn that she'd cast onto Charla's forehead. The larger anthro was yanked onto her side, losing her balance again, but didn't fall, only giving a few zig-zagged stomps to regain control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine didn't even have to superjump to grapple with Charla's neck again as she ran past, and she was allowed to stay for a little while as Charla let her anger get the best of her, now to desperate to claw or swing her sudden archenemy off as she braced her legs onto her scaly backside and leapt off, sending the once-towering behemoth to the ground with a resounding <i>boom.</i></span></div></div>",

How was her supreme and magnificent bulk being thwarted so easily?! She, Charla, was being handed her extremely large ass on a platter! Her vision was somewhat blurry, making it hard to focus. She tried to turn over onto her stomach but nothing happened. Oh sure, she lifted herself up for a second but then quickly fell back to the arena floor with a thundering <i>*boom*</i>. Her limbs felt like lead weights attached to her body, heavy and unresponsive. Even her tail was like onto a limp rod sticking out from her blubbery body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Charla wasn't given too much time to ponder her pitiful condition. Before she knew it, her limbs were moving but not of her will. Her strong and bulbous limbs were being straightened out and pinned to her body. Just as she was about to try and do something, anything, about it, she left the same force that acting on her limbs, seem to wrap itself around her head, specifically, her jaws. Charla's eyes widen as they glimpse a familiar golden glow. The unicorn's magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fuzziness of her brain clears and everything comes back into focus...just in time for her to witness a gaping maw approach her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine, horn shining brightly with power, stretched her jaw as wide as she could before descending onto the tip of Charla\u2019s snout. All the while she maintained her magical bindings on her opponent/prey. Through the spell, Claudine could feel Charla trying to move. It was far too weak to even hope to break the unicorn's hold but she kept them tight, just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine worked her way down Charla\u2019s snout. Unlike many others, who would have drawn out their meal, taking time to savor their opponent, Claudine only cares about ending this. She cares only about her final victory and her true prize. So, she wastes little time. Her focus is absolute. Between her sheer gusto of devouring Charla and maintaining her hold on the dinosaur\u2019s limbs, she barely registers the taste of her competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis may have been her first time ever eating anyone but Claudine was taking to hit easily. She had long studied how to do it, even if she never had employed it. Always better to have knowledge and even if you never intended to use it. You might never know when it may benefit you. But it was clear now, that she had done the right thing if her quick and steady progress was anything to go by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was nearly screaming himself hoarse as he watched his mistress, his friend, his partner work her way through her meal. It was almost surreal watching Claudine\u2019s body distend and grow to accommodate her meal...</span></div></div>",

If just for a few seconds, it no longer looked like she was trying to seem invincible warrior immune to defeat or stress; beneath all the expensive makeup and training, she seemed just like any other anthro, one with a lot of stress tangled in her heart in need of someone to open up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it was <i>only</i> for a few seconds, and she'd caught her guard just as quickly as she'd let it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...what do <i>you</i> care?\" She snapped, tears still flowing down her rounded cheeks as she turned her anger on him. \"What's it to <i>you</i> what I'm going through?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...just...\" He may have expected it, but Marc still found his words tumbling out in the wake of her volume. \"Saw you, and I...Thought I'd...see if I could...help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help?! How could <i>you</i> help?!\" She growled, grabbing the couch's arm as she leaned on her side to leer at him. \"How could you understand what I'm going through?! You haven't even known me for a <i>single day! </i>You don't have any idea what it's like to be <i>totally alone</i> in this dump, surrounded by people who either can't stand you or couldn't care less if you got eaten in the ring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard that, Marc had to supress the urge to give her a sneer of his own, but he managed to keep his voice steady and calm. Right now, she just needed some time to vent. \"I'm...I'm very sorry, Claudine, I only meant to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't need your help!\" She turned back to the TV, crossing her arms along her chest. \"If that's the way the system works, then fine! I don't need <i>anybody!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't say anything else, but Marc stayed in the doorway, watching as she pointed her eyes at the cheerful colors and upbeat music in the gameshow with bitterness and anger. She stayed totally still, the only visible movement from her being that of her blinking, but Marc could still see the streams on her cheeks flowing with new drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let himself look at her before he pulled himself back in the room, suddenly feeling sleepy enough to give a tired sigh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the night, Marc'd never been woken up. The ceiling to his room was still flat when his alarm clock went off, having never had any weight be placed on it after Claudine left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking as much time as he was allowed to waste, Marc got dressed, washed himself up, and steeled himself for having to be face to face with Claudine again, not all to fond of the idea. When he'd left through the bedroom door, which as still as ajar from when it'd been opened over night, Claudine was nowhere to be seen, and the lights were all off behind the doors at the room's other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he caught notice of a white note taped to the TV, and ran over to its cabinet.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marc,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd gone out for a walk around the facility, and I'll be back at ten.

What can I get you, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter who his master was, Emily's smile was always more than enough reprieve whenever he had the rare chance to visit the ASL's coffee shop, the fox girl's portly waistline just the right level of cushy plumpness for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily. Mind hitting me up with a plain bagel with cream cheese, an orange juice, and a candy cookie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...candy cookie.\" She hissed, knowing full well what that meant. \"New boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I made her hate me right on the first night.\" He finished for her, his head slumping into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm sure somebody with your charm'll fix that up in no time!\" She winked, turning around to grab from the bagel shelf. \"Just wait right up, and I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\" Emily replied as she turned around to grab from the bagel shelf, but caught notice of her glove when she brought her paw up, a large hole visible along the palm. \"...just a quick second, and I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time.\" Marc replied, knowing that half an hour still lay before Claudine would return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily bowed politely before trudging off to the back room. Now alone, Marc gently drummed his fingers on the counter to the beat of the elevator music playing from the ceiling, humming along as he cherished the rare privilege of not being the target of anybody's attention. It may have been just bland stock that was playing, but when compared to the nagging voice's of all the masters he had before, it was like one of the most pure symphonies being played in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only detraction from being fully immersed was when the anthro standing behind him came in a little more, coming impatiently close to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm down here.\" Marc said loosely, but with no response. That is, until they came in a little closer, letting him feel the warmth of their body's padding beneath a layer of feathers. \"Mind backing off?\" He spoke again, but was met again with silence. This time, he hunched forward as far as he could to try and ignore them, but now they came forward so much that the breath was squeezed out of him as he was crushed between them and the counter. \"Okay, asshole, I'm sure I'm wasting a ton of your life's time right now, but could you just wait and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Marc felt his heart and soul plunge deeper than the basements of the facility when he angled his head to the side, recognizing the golden color off the feathery cliff wedging him in place. Even worse was an orb-like shape to the halves of adipose clipped around him, and he pulled his head back to verify the worst of his fear coming to life; seeing a bright red and yellow set of tail feathers dangling right at the base of an enormous pair of buttcheeks, the signature belt of the gold division digging tight into each of their owners thighs. Their back alone was wide enough to flatten the entire countertop should they fall back, and he bent himself forward to peek at the very top, and whispered a silent prayer when he saw Amaya's head perched right in the very top, who was busy rambling about some story into her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so I told him 'no way, you crotch jockey!\" and he just stares at me, acting like I'm the one who had the first punch...\" She went on, seemingly oblivious to Marc's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growing hope that Claudine would be the worst he'd have to face today, Marc tried to wriggle forward, to see if there was any space left to move, but found himself hopelessly trapped. Even worse, he could hear Emily mutter a curse as something inside fell to the floor, and she hurriedly bent down to clean it up, taking away even more precious time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily!\" Marc whispered, but Emily was too far away to hear him without alerting Amaya, who went on with her story in the most obnoxious, nasally voice that she could muster. It just fell into white noise to Marc's ears, who came to zone himself out from the rest of the world, desperately trying to keep himself from moving enough to be noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime soon, but after far too much time to not be torturous, Marc could sense the whining of Amaya's voice give a pause. Curiosity gave way beneath the existential terror building up within, and he angled his head back up to see what was going on, but whimpered when he found himself making eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmaya stared right back at him, holding her phone in a way that he could see that it wasn't even on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Marc would've said was snuffed out as Amaya pushed her legs further down around him, crushing all of his body at once within the midpoint of her ass' depth...</span></div></div>",

The center thing noticed he was staring at them and froze up, then her pose relaxed. \"See? You've both awoken out guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where am I?\" Marc demanded, fighting against the ropes, but found they were nice and tight. \"What the hell's going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just business.\" The center one's voice answered, and Marc stopped struggling, his mind now cleared enough to recognize who was speaking and be utterly, utterly terrified of it. \"The <i>only</i> kind of business you can do if you wanna get up in the ASL.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't answer, his lips moving about as he narrated a voiceless prayer. Seeing him stay still, the center one stepped towards the light, the first thing entering being the front of a heavily muscle-packed gut that was armored with sturdy black scales, followed by a large pair of breasts that lay on top in a black tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Roxanne's head entered the light, an all to pleased grin opened up to a line of razor sharp teeth, and she brushed away a lock of her raven hair to bask in his terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She observed, pulling a balisong from her pant's pocket and flicking open the clip, expertly twirling it around between her clawed fingers. \"Now we know who's on what end of the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed impossible, given the situation, but Marc let out a chuckle, albeit a very nervous one. \"T-This is a joke, right? You can't do this to me! There's...I dunno, regulations? Or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne snorted. \"Well, there's definitely 'or something' going on here, that's for sure.\" She looked behind her, motioning her head to the other two standing behind her. \"Girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two started moving, coming into the light at either side of Roxanne, and whatever ability Marc had at finding hope in the situation was cremated when they were fully visible. Predictably, Amaya stood at Roxanne's right, her muscular arms crossed as they sat on top of her immense, room filling stomach, while Roxanne's left was occupied by Sapphire, the very edge of her massive behind nearly knocking the dragoness over when she was present, a sneer of utter distaste along the swan's bill as she stared Marc down,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.\" Roxanne began, still snapping the knife to and fro. \"Here's the deal. You have something we want, and I think you're smart enough to understand the flow of power that's going on around here. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What could that be?\" Marc whispered. \"I'm just a servant! I don't have any ties, or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's where you're wrong, Marky-Mark.\" Roxanne continued as she tossed the balisong up behind her back and reared her head to catch it in her teeth, then spat it up and went right back into a routine as she caught it on her finger. \"A servant's a <i>very</i> important job, and as of yesterday, you're the one of the highest-ranking servants in all the facility!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you want me because I'm around Claudine.\" He observed tonelessly, which Roxanne nodded to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Roxanne answered simply. \"So, if you <i>still </i>want to be the owner of that title, then we thought you'd be able to help us out before out next fights.

I'm her property, not yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Roxanne stopped playing with the knife, but a toying smile still sat on her face as she pocketed it and came towards Marc, bending down on one knee when she was right in front of the chair. He could feel the fiery air waft through her breath as her face came right in front of his, and he bent his head back as far as he could as the slits of her eyes narrowed on him, her grin turning into that of a hardened killer ready to make the pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever it may have said, the law didn't do jack <i>shit </i>to save my boyfriend from me, did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...oh, <b>FUCK.</b></i></span></div></div>",

Extremely obese, but bears large amounts of muscle visible underneath her adipose that render her still mobile, even if her colossal shape can limit certain movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery is among one of the best fighters for her high strength capacity, easily able to subdue opponents by grappling them and is known for using highly trained boxing techniques in her fighting stance. Very sporty, she has great confident in her own techniques and enters any fight with little doubt that she'll win, which given that she's never lost a match since joining the ASL is somewhat justified. However, despite her hard-hitting techniques, size, and strength, she's more in for the action than any relevant prize or fame, and actually sets a specific set of morals on herself as to what she can do in the ring. As such, she refuses to perform survival matches because she feels it's more fun to humiliate challengers with defeat instead of kill them, and solely battles in the gold devision for challenge. Humans, despite her cockiness, have been known to get along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pearl.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Orca.<br>\r\nHeight: 30'1\"<br>\r\nAppearance: Has short, messy brown hair that's beneath a red swimming cap she wears during her fights. Absurdly obese; she bears little muscle beneath ridiculous amounts of fat bloating her body to balloon-like proportions, but can still move, albeit at great expense of her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl just wants to eat. Eat anything at almost every waking hour, putting the staff hired to work for her at great strife in putting her insatiable appetite at bay. Easily rose from the bronze division by ballooning in size and using her own body as a super-weapon on stage. Her entire reason for entering the ALS is the copious amounts of food at hand for the fighters, and even enters survival matches for the sole purpose of being able to eat the other fighter. Humans are asked to approach with great caution.</span></div></div>",

Framed black-and-white photographs of anthros fighting in the ring periodically hung the distance along the crimson wall, bordered with white molding against the ceiling, which arched up in a tall concave with intricately designed gold arches meeting in the center beam, from which lights filled with shining crystals were hanging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pretty classy for giants paid to beat the crap out of each other...</i> Marc snickered as he pulled out a slip of paper out of his pocket, which bore directions to his new mistress' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Hello, </b><u> Marc Youngblood </u><b> ,and welcome to the</b> <u> Gold Division </u> <b>of the Anthro Sumo League!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>You are one of few with the privilege to help maintain the flow of one of the world's greatest pasttime and invigorate the spirit of our reigning champions, bringing excitement to thousands of eager fans spanning across the globe!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Your assigned champion is </b><u> Avery Etherglades </u><b> of chamber </b><u> 722 </u><b>!

The doors were incredibly big, each a couple stories tall and almost as wide. Behind a few he could hear muffled, adamant voices, as though their owners were demanding something or scolding a staff member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a ground-shaking WHAM!!! slamming into the wall behind him made him jump and spin around in shock, just in time to see a framed picture fall and shatter on the ground. By fate's hand, the door's plate read 722. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!!!\"</i> Somebody whooped inside, followed by a chain rattling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his heart pounding from the surprise, Marc uneasily approached the door, fearful of the potential strength of this \"Avery\", and how big she could possibly be against his relatively tiny body. A doorbell was built for his height into the doorframe, which he took a few moments of self-encouragement to press with his thumb. But in an unusually quick instance the door swung open on its own, with nobody to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'min!\" A voice called from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc obeyed, stepping into a room that almost looked like a gymnasium stocked with giant-scaled dumbbells, a bench press, and all other kinds of exercise equipment, with a gold-sized bed standing in the corner. In the left half of the room was a hulking, monster-sized roc whaling into a punching bag chained to the ceiling, rallying into it three times before its chain snapped and it soared into the wall away from her. Her body was covered in spotty gray feathers with a head of straight, decent-lengthed brown hair, sporting a medium-sized curled beak that looked as though it was carved from metal. He couldn't tell how \"XL\" the black t-shirt and gym shorts she was wearing were, but assumed they were far beyond the thousands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, joy...</i> Marc dreaded as he verified his new boss' size. She looked to be near thirty feet tall, and her balloon-body was ludicrously swollen with fat, but beneath her obese exterior he could see copious amounts of muscles that made her limbs even wider than he'd think possible, her legs large enough that her mammoth-sized butt completely filled her body's width. Her shirt's design was blurred as it stretched around her titanic breasts, and only covered about a third of her stomach's surface area as it sprawled out onto the ground. But rather than hang in front of her like a saggy blob, it boasted a firm, orb-like roundness from constant exercise he assumed she always practiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stomped on a button on the ground, which made another punching bag lower from a panel in the ceiling. Tensing her fists, she stroke three more punches into the bag, sending it flying into the growing pile against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...<i>that's</i> the stuff!\" She sighed proudly, then turned her head to look down at Marc. \"So, you that new 'Marco' guy working here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. It's Marc, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha. Name's Avery!\" She picked up a drink the size of an oil drum from a shelf on the wall and took a long swig, wiping her beak upon breaking away. \"Wanna drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly dragged along the floor as she heaved her bulk to a full-body mirror on the wall, staring straight in the eyes of her own reflection. She clenched her fists and slowly raised them in front of her face, then started throwing empty punches at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...anything you need me to do, Avery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But just gobblin' up the competition would make things borin' after awhile.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc approached the roc as she continued on with her exercise, any feelings of unease, disappearing at her casual attitude. \"So what's it really like being in the Gold Division? I've only been around any Gold fighters for really short time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery looked at, not even breaking her rhythm with her weight. \"Not much different than anywhere else.

Avery lifted the barbell back onto its perch and rolled off the platform, walking up to the phone and lifting the earpiece against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Etherglades, Avery. Number 2766.\" She spoke into the mouthpiece. \"Hey, Stan. 'Sup?...Mm-hmm...uh-huh...gotcha. What time?...Alright....sure, I'll be ready. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the earpiece back on its perch, a tall capsule zoomed into the room through a pneumatic tube next to the phone, which she pulled out through the entry point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sponsorship. Gotta fight tonight at eight!\" She unscrewed the lid and pulled out an Avery-sized purple bikini top, unfurling it to show 'Stafie's starlight cafe!' scrawled across each cup in silver letters. Marc instinctively turned his head away as Avery slid off the shirt she was wearing to slide into the halved swimsuit, tossing the shirt over her shoulder so that it flopped onto the ground a few feet in front of him, making him flinch. \"Alright, prep time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged to a red metal canister as big as an SUV with \"PROTEIN SHAKE\" spray-painted on the side, taking the end of a hose attached to that hung on a hook in the wall and holding it in her beak. \"There's a little lever on the bottom, there. Mind gettin' it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc carefully grabbed the lever and pushed it forward, causing a whirring sound to buzz within as its contents began running through the hose and into Avery's beak, who happily chugged down the shake without pausing even to take a breath. He could see her belly slowly crawl forward along the ground as it became distended from her feasting, and creases started to stretch along the sides of the shirt as it stretched around her expanding girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>ulp...ulp...ulp..ulp...</i>MMM!\" Avery flashed Marc a thumb's up, who threw the switch back and cut off the flow. The shake left her gut significantly more bloated, which made it harder for her to evenly walk as she laboriously lurched to a shaking machine in the corner and wrapped the belt around waist, but it was so tight that it dug deep into the flesh of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped the switch that brought the machine to life, sending a steady vibration through the softness of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> is how you bulk up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck out there, Avery!\" I told her as the two of us stood outside the stadium doors.

Every single seat was packed, hundreds of rows surrounded the ring all the way to the furthest regions near the ceiling. The lighting above was arranged over the ring to make it look as though its rubber surface was pure gold, down to the shimmer and sparkle of a gold brick. Dead center above was what looked like a chandelier of LCD screens showing feed of Avery strutting down the aisle, standing tall and firm with great pride as she relished in the excitement from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT <b>ONLY </b>ON ASL, YOU'LL BE SEEING THE ARTISTIC FLAIR OF ONE OF OUR GREATEST FIGHTERS IN ACTION!\" </b>The loudspeakers resounded over the roaring audience. <b>\"WILL SHE PROUDLY STILL CARRY HER MOUNTING STREAK, OR SHALL IT BE BROKEN TONIGHT?

You'll come to find that Avery and myself are of a more reasonable sort.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery have a grunt in affirmation. \"Yep. Marc, Claudine here's one of the most sensible fighters in the entire ASL. She might not be as big a some and she's a bit of a princess, but she got skills.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine puffed out her chest at the praise and smirked. \"If the entire ASL worked even as half as hard as you or I, there wouldn't nearly as many demotions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery just laughed. For his part, Marc was really surprised. Claudine and Avery really got along despite being so different. It was obvious they had some sort history with each each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two really respect each other.\" Marc stated, almost to himself.

We've had several matches and I found myself satisfied, despite my losses to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smiled. \"Claudine's a little stiff but she's real smart and knows here way 'round a scrap. I might've beaten her, but few can give me fight like she can. That and she don't go eatin' everyone in sight like some.\" Avery shook her head in what Marc guessed was disapproval. \"She ain't like Charla or Amaya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine visibly repressed a shiver. \"Those two gluttons are a disgrace!\" She spat. \"All they do is eat any competitor they can get their mouths around! They just get rid of thin out the ranks and destroy potential fighters before they even get going just so that can get fatter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc nodded. Even, in his short time, he had heard about those names more than a few times. Amaya and Charla were feared by just about all in the lower divisions. Everyone once in awhile some stupid newbie would challenge or accept a challenge from one from them to a Survival match and be gulped down for their arrogance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine sighed. \"But bring those two up does raise a kind of point.\" She turned to Avery, who her routine to regard the unicorn. \"I've been thinking of trying something new for my fighting style.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery set the barbell back, giving Claudine her full attention. \"Go on.\" She urged, interest visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite my skill,\" Claudine started, \"I've noticed I have issues with large opponents like yourself.

A relatively tiny armchair big enough for a human stood at its side, so I walked to and joined her as she lounged for Claudine to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally Avery would take a sip from a soda she had sitting on a nearby shelf, which served to give the room its only sign of life as we did nothing.

Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, no biggie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes afterward, Claudine came back, now dressed in a super-super-super-super-super-super-sized pink gym shirt and shiny purple sweat pants, both of which looked too store-quality for them to have been already owned. \"Alright, I think I'm ready. What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first things first...\" Avery pushed down with her legs to elevate her weight at full height. \"I think we should get to work on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All ya really need to do is step it up with as ya get bigger. But ya need ta work on yer size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine gave a nod at the explanation. With that, Avery went over to the corner and grabbed a large metal canister with the words 'Protein Shake' spray-painted on it. It was the size of car and attached to the canister at the top was a hose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A protein shake? Really?\" Marc called over Avery's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned. \"Yep. Had it s'pecially made. Its got fruits, vegetables, lean meat, etc. etc. etc.. All high energy, high nutrient food and all of it fresh to boot. If ya gonna put some meet on yer bones, this is what ya need.\" She took the hose and handed it Claudine who took it with regal grace. The unicorn wasted no time putting the end of the hose in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya good?\" Avery asked her friend. When she got a nod, she reached for Marc and set him hear the canister. \"Kay, Marc, I need ya ta push dat button at the bottom. Be ready to turn it off when we tell ya. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc nodded before finding the button in short order and pushing it. There was a whirling noise before the canister shook. Marc watched as the hose visibly inflated as the canister's contents when up it and into Claudine's waiting mouth. The unicorn's eyes widened as the shake came so fast that her cheeks inflated before she gulped on instinct. It took a second but Claudine settled into a smooth rhythm of swallowing the mixture. Avery watched in satisfaction as Claudine easily took the concoction traveling down into her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Claudine's belly slowly but steadily inflated, causing her shirt to ride up, exposing pure white fur. Claudine gave a soft moan at the feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, \"Avery started. \"We'll keep this up a little while longer. Then, once your done with that, I'm gonna have ya rest for a little and let ya process all that shake. Then we'll have ya do several workouts.

Since the day he'd been switched over she'd become around five feet taller, halfway down the road to Avery's size, and her limbs had thickened out a lot more on heaving amounts of fat and thick, rippling layers of muscle beneath, and never once in her training did it weigh down too much on her. They'd gone through a rainbow of different outfits as she'd grown over time, sending Marc to and fro around the gold division to get anything they'd needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, I'd say just a few days 'till I can get away with a headshot!\" Avery quipped.

We're gonna have another busy week a head of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. I'm ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery barged back into her room, heading for the protein shake canister with hasted. She plucked Marc off her nape and dropped him back onto the table. By the time he'd grabbed the lever and primed himself for the all-go, Avery'd already stuffed the hose into her beak, giving him a thumb's up. Marc pushed the lever down, careful to keep the flow through the hose and into Avery's body as gradual as possible. The roc rapid-fired a stream of gulps to keep up with the high-calorie muscle mass being pumped into her body, and before Marc's eyes her stomach expanded like a hot air balloon, oozing out along the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut'd been stuffed by an extra seven feet's worth of space until Avery gently rapped at the metal table, and Marc switched the vat off. Avery freed her mouth of the hose and took a nice, fresh breath, then heaved herself forward to waddle across the room, generously lurching from side to side along the distended roundness of her belly. She swiveled around and backed onto a shaker machine, taking the end of the strap and wrapping it around her belly, but still had to strain all her might onto the belt to get the buckles to kiss. It was half a minute of effort till the machine snapped into place, with the belt digging deep into her belly's flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grabbed two dumbbells and hit the switch with her beak, flexing her muscles as the belt sent a loud hum of vibrations into her stomach. Above the mechanical buzzing Marc could hear a churning working around inside his boss' body, whose cheeks briefly puffed out before she let out a loud, gaseous belch. The indentation the belt formed softened out into a roll of fat that drooped down and swallowed the strap whole, and he could see her arms struggle to continue flexing as they thickened out with paunch. Nonetheless, Avery kept exercising, working the weights up and down above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me to <b><i>*urp*</i></b> remind the ASL to give ya a raise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any final consensus on Avery as a boss, yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd been too  busy getting her protein shakes as of late to really observe her, but she's still been pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine gave an amused giggle, quaking the shoulder that Marc sat upon. \"Well, whatever that filth is, it's a gold mine. That's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11:57, and still no sign of the Roc that'd laid down the time in the first place. Marc hadn't even seen her in bed that morning, only a thankful note on her bed telling him to take the day off. With nowhere else to really go, he went to check up on Claudine, who was more than welcoming towards her frenemy's helper, even going so far as to make him breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even if he wasn't the one about to be in the center of the stadium, Marc was getting weary. Word' been spreading pretty quickly along a lot of the other fighters about Avery and Claudine going into demigod size to fight one another out of the ring, and many of the league'd gathered in a colorful row some dozens of feet away from the ring, anxious to watch the impending mushroom cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she, by the way?\" Claudine pondered, finally getting concerned. \"She's <i>never</i> late for a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've only got...\" Marc checked his watch. \"Two minutes. I'm sure she's just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WHUMP</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud tremor quaked from past the doorway against the training ring, strong enough to actually send a jiggle through Claudine's flab. Another followed, followed by another, and another, and the distant audience of sumos all broke out in a  roaring applause, shaking their fists in the air with obnoxious whoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Claudine gently plucked Marc off her shoulder and craned him down on the ground. Once free, he didn't waste any time running as far from the ring and audience as he could get while still having a view of the two fighters, and Claudine slowly rose off the ground, bracing her legs into the mat floor and rising her arms into fighter mode. She didn't look look the least bit intimidated; determined, even, ready for whatever opponent could stomp through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery simply walked straight into the doors and let her stomach push them apart. Heaving its weight around cost her several seconds to completely lug her entire body through the door, as it formed a borderline perfect sphere of mass puffing out from her body, save for its droop onto the matted ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc couldn't believe it. Ever since Avery'd gone to bed, she looked like she'd shot up another ten feet, and her body'd been overcome by a noticeable lean towards the flabby half of her body over the muscles she also boasted. A pair of sizable love handles hung down along either side of her belly, along with dimply cellulite hanging underneath her arms and thighs, but still throbbed with ridiculous tanks of muscle underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she was still cramming for the battle or giving her doughy body more character, Avery was choking down a hero sandwich, gagging it down her throat without chewing a bite. She crammed the rest of the end into her mouth and swallowed the whole enchilada in one swig, chasing back up with a soft belch, leering at Claudine with a cocky grin.</span></div></div>",

Not the fame, not the money; just gulp down everything she could; be it other fighters, or \"normal\" food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody knew her thoughts on humans...but that assumed she HAD any thoughts beyond her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great, another throw of the dice,</i> Marc snarked mentally. <i>At least with crazies like Dominique I'd KNOW I'm walking into pain, but with Pearl you never know if she'll eat you first thing or just ignore you all the time.

Without realizing it, he'd been walking down the hallsduring his reverie, and right to a fiighter's door.  Again. <br>\r\nMarc rubbed his aching nose, thankful nobody saw that embarrassment. He REALLY needed to stop spacing out like that... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a moment to listen at the door, hoping to hear something that could clue him in to Pearl: a movie playing, her exercising...or a screaming human getting eaten. But nothing came. Had she soundproofed the door? Weird. <i>Well, better just bite the bullet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling himself, Marc threw open the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...To behold a giant black and white beanbag chair flopped on the couch. <br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He looked around, expecting to see a giant animal woman pounce at him from the side; but no attack came. \"Um, hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beanbag <i>burped.</i> Then it <i>moved.</i><br>\r\nMarc's jaw dropped as the topmost section of bulge swiveled down, and found a pair of beady black eyes staring at him.

She was more like a blob TRYING to look like an anthropromorphic whale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl swallowed whatever she'd had in her mouth, sending rippless down her impossibly fat body. <br>\r\nMarc had to strain to spot her limbs and fins amidst the rolls of blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" she rumbled, \"My human's here.

Her breath reeked, smelling like an ocean full of dead fish and junk food. With one fat finger, Pearl pointed inside, acting as if it was completely reasonable to order a man she just met to climb into her mouth and be swallowed down to his doom. Marc had other ideas. He turned around to run out the door and reached for the doorknob. It took his brain a second to process that there <i>wasn't</i> one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orca groaned. \"You humans are all alike. Why can't you just do what you're told?\" Pearl reached into a roll of fat and pulled out a box of cookies. She ripped open the top, lifted it above her head and poured them all down her waiting gullet. She then followed it up by swallowing the empty box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oorp</i>--whatever,\" she said. \"Guess I gotta do this myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Pearl had the advantage of size, Marc figured he was easily fast enough to outrun this tub of blubber. He had to run to put distance between him and her until he could find some way to fight her off or escape. Maybe he could crawl through the air vents and--Pearl opened her mouth and heaved herself off the couch with impossible speed. Marc hadn't managed to take a step before the avalanche of fat was falling towards him, her mouth perfectly positioned to engulf him up. It was clear this wasn't her first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let out a scream as Pearl landed on her stomach and clamped her jaws around his top half. With practiced ease she slurped up his legs like a noodle. Luckily--for a given definition of \"luckily\"--she didn't mindlessly swallow him like she had the pizza or cookies. If her happy moans were any indication, the obese orca enjoyed the taste of live prey. The rational part of Marc's brain knew it shouldn't be a surprise, what with all the survival matches she'd fought in and won. However, the rational part of Marc's brain had gone bye-bye, and he was screaming for his life as Pearl sucked and slurped on him, drenching him in saliva and running him over her taste buds. As she tasted him, she let out another belch, then another, and another. Marc choked on the scent, even as he struggled in vain to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock, knock,\" a suave anthro velociraptor in a suit barged into Pearl's room without waiting. \"I just came to see if you're ready for--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can' talk, Mistuh Tal'n,\" Pearl slurped. \"Eatin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Dante Talon said, rolling his eyes. \"When are you not--Pearl?! Is that the human you've just been assigned?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Pearl said, unashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Pearl,\" the raptor said. \"You've already eaten the past dozen humans assigned to you this month! Don't you remember our conversation yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raptor sighed. \"I told you that if you ate the human I sent you today, then you've reached your limit for the rest of the season!

Training by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl grunted and the gears in her brain turned as she continued to suck on Marc. On the one hand: food now. On the other hand: work... But on the one hand: FOOD NOW! What to do? She mulled over the question as Marc begged for mercy in her mouth. Now Marc's fate rested on whether the orca's sloth outweighed her gluttony. Judging by the size of her stomach, her sloth would have to be several tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

He was constricted all around by her throat muscles as he plummeted down into her gut. He landed on a mountain of masticated food, some of which he'd just seen her munching on only minutes ago. Her stomach was a landfill of past meals, but her gut was so large, Marc could--and did--take a few stumbling steps forward and began punching at her stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Pearl gave a satisfied sigh as she smacked her lips, tasting her would-be human servant all over again. Mr. Talon rolled his eyes at the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do with you, Pearl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me seconds?\" the orca asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you you've used up all your allotted human slaves!\" the raptor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right... BWAAAAAAAAAAARP!\" She smacked her lips again. \"Worth it... Can you help roll me back on the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Talon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two anthros approached the situation casually, Marc wasn't willing to resign himself to his fate as whale food. He kept hitting at the walls of his fleshy prison, begging for release long after it became clear Pearl had no intention of letting him go. She and Mr. Talon talked about her upcoming match and the only sign of Marc's presence was the gaseous emissions the whale regularly unleashed. Even a full grown man hadn't filled her up for long though, as she kept eating throughout the entire affair, causing bits of food to rain down on Marc's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mr. Talon left and Marc staggered away from the stomach wall, physically and emotionally drained. He sat on a lump of food and immediately jumped up again as something poked him in the butt. He spun around and saw he'd sat on a bone. Specifically a leg bone belonging to a human dressed in casual clothes and sporting an ASL name tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy?\" Marc whimpered, looking at the skeleton. \"I just saw you last night. And now you're--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPPPFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTT</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl sighed in relief from the explosion of flatulence, the only eulogy she bothered to give for poor Andy. He heard an echoing sound as Pearl patted her stomach contentedly. The walls of her gut pulsed all him, and Marc knew that if he didn't find a way out of here soon, he'd end up being just another skeleton found by the next poor sap Pearl ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan Marc escape?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pearl awoke the next day around noon. She stretched her fat, little arms as far as they would stretch, shifted her weight off one cheek to let out some morning gas, and grunted contentedly. She'd had a long sleep and was left feeling refreshed, well-rested, and, most importantly, well-nourished. She took in the piles of clutter crowding her apartment, filled with empty food wrappers, dirty dishes and clothes that needed a wash. She knew that if she had a human servant working for her, the place could've been clean enough to eat off of, which appealed to her considering she did little else <i>but</i> eat off of things. However, no human servant would be coming. Mr. Talon had said so. She'd reached her limit and now she'd have no choice but to do all her work herself for the rest of the season. Still, if she had to choose between free labor or a free lunch, food won out every time. She'd never once eaten something and regretted it. Not even that time she'd eaten an entire ice cream truck and gotten the mother of all brain freezes afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't completely alone though. Not yet, at least. Though it'd been forty-eight hours since she'd swallowed Marc whole and alive, the little guy, to his credit, had not given up on life in all that time. Alternating between begging for his life or pounding at the walls of her stomach in pitiful attempts to make her sick, her human was hard at work trying to find a way to save himself. She didn't mind it. Whenever she devoured her opponents in Survival Matches, she was usually rendered immobile afterwards, since her meals were just as big if not bigger than she was. She could barely enjoy their struggles with them stretching out her insides. Humans, on the other hand, were the perfect size to snack on. They tended to last for at least a day and during that time they gave the nicest internal massages. Plus, every time she burped she could savor their taste again and again. They were like a meal she could savor long after she'd already eaten it. Marc was no different. He tickled her insides in a funny way and had a yummy aftertaste so she left him to his own devices. He wouldn't escape. No one ever had once she'd eaten them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The most important thing</i>, Pearl thought, taking out a gigantic size bottle of soda and guzzling it, <i>is that he's right where all food belongs. In my belly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n=== In Her Belly ===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, drink it all up you fat fish,\" Marc said as the waterfall of soda cascaded into her stomach. Marc had positioned an empty oil drum on the pile of half-digested food in her gut to catch all of the fizzy liquid. From the smell along the inside, the drum had been filled with fish when Pearl had swallowed it. He had no idea how long it'd been in her stomach, but it hadn't digested yet. Marc had been using it to catch every ounce of soda Pearl had drank since yesterday and now it was overflowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few hours trapped inside Pearl had been a nightmare as Marc had given in to blind panic and just kicked, screamed and begged to be let out. Naturally all his efforts were met with nothing but silence and continued snacking from his orca captor. When he'd regained his wits, he'd tried collecting all the food into a mountain tall enough to reach the opening leading back to her throat. Unfortunately, the whole thing was unstable, and though he'd reached the opening, he couldn't actually get it open before the mountain collapsed and he was sent tumbling back into the pool of stomach acid. This time the only reaction he'd gotten was an unimpressed belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that burp had given him inspiration. He'd been around--or rather inside--Pearl for two days now and her expulsions of gas were second in frequency only to her snacking. With the amount of junk food and soda she ate and drank, it was no mystery why. But Marc had to stop himself from laughing with glee when he realized the gas the orca emitted gave him his own built in propulsion system. After he'd found the drum, he began collecting every drop of soda she drank, and now, with the drum full, it was the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish me luck, Andy,\" Marc said to the skeleton of his co-worker, giving him a thumbs up before wrenching off his leg bone. He drove it into the pile of food, under the heavy drum of soda, and pushed down hard. The makeshift lever went down, the drum tipped over, and gallons of carbonated liquid came into contact with Pearl's insides all at once. The effect was immediate. Everything around Marc started shaking. He braced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=== Pearl's Room ===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl clutched her stomach as it rumbled with the force of an earthquake. She felt like her insides were inflating. She'd never felt like this before. She felt... FULL! Not just full, but like she was about to burst! She didn't even feel like this after she'd eaten that ice cream truck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a small burp. Then a larger burp. Then an even larger one after that! They kept coming like miniature hurricanes from her belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was--<i>URAP</i>--it--<i>ORP</i>--something--<i>BBRRAAAAAAPPP</i>--I ate?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't contain herself any longer. Her throat opened involuntarily and the biggest, most earthshaking belch she'd ever made in her life came rumbling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n=== In Her Belly ===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gave a joyous whoop as Pearl's insides contracted and he was sent flying out of her stomach. Up and up he went, riding her burp like a nuclear warhead. He made it all the way up her throat. However, the fleshy tube constricted. His momentum started to slow down. He was worried he might not make it. He'd just crested her throat and got his first look at the outside world in two days when he realized whether or not he'd make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould this be enough for Marc to escape? Did the burp carry him all the way out to freedom or did it land him right back in the whale's mouth, just short of freedom and an easy second helping for Pearl to swallow back down?</span></div></div>",

This was insanity, outright ludicrous; even Morgan didn\u2019t put up the battle that a single human was putting her through. Seven plus three didn\u2019t equal eight. The Earth wasn\u2019t a giant banana floating space. Anything that Pearl eats <i>never comes out uneaten!</i> This wasn\u2019t happening! <b><i>THIS WASN\u2019T HAPPENING!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but Marc hadn\u2019t taken his warm cup of reality that morning. No, even if he got plunged back to whence he\u2019d came, if Pearl gulped him back down like he was just another hunk of beef jerky, he was at least going to get far. If he were going to see the afterlife and be bound to the same realm that he, Andy, and all the other humans who met their end with Pearl shared, he wasn\u2019t going to show face around them without a story to tell. He punched, kicked, even bit back at Pearl\u2019s throat muscles\u2019 attempts to put him in his place, grabbing at the wet, scratchy flesh with but a human\u2019s strength battling that of the vacuum of space, but saw the will to move forward, if at a handful of Pearl\u2019s neck at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl craned her head upwards, massaging her throat to try and drive the feisty little twerp back down, emitting an uncharacteristiccllly sick moan that was mollified when the nigh-constant symphony of all things bodily inside of her digestive tract reached a full crescendo. The reckless abandon she spent in tossing food, living creatures, or even just casually discarded household items into the digestive cauldron that was her stomach filled her insides with a endless surplus of gas that she belched or farted off with no recluse, even allow her to let out a belch or rip one out for three minutes straight if she so intended to, but with a peak of digested air pushing its way against the roof of her belly, a few errands of gas forcing its way in in the form of few choked gurgles underneath her neck folds, at long last did she wish that she\u2019d learn the long-forgotten art of keeping her burps and farts contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other hand massaged her belly folds to alleviate her tummy troubles, but couldn\u2019t register anything past the heaping blankets of adipose swaddled about her body\u2019s nerves to amount to much; with what few there was before, any visible difference between an orca and some horribly misshapen balloon was decreasing even further, her arms and legs getting sucked into her obscenely round middle\u2019s growth spurt, losing what mobility they may have once possessed to keep the battle raging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained was her jaw, the strongest muscle in her body. Her eyes were squeezed shut by her own cheeks puffing up, her neck merging into her billowing self as her limbs had, but she let the tears flow in her fight to keep her maw shut and tongue compressed to the roof of her mouth. Her neck muscled crushed Marc\u2019s twiggy figure in and made it impossible for him to move, whether forwards, backwards, or even to struggle against the rapidly closing passageway they he\u2019d made his victim, but with what little life he had left to live on his last moments of air, he saw victory atop the agonizing pain; he was to die in her throat, not with the indignity of being felt wading about in her stomach, to have screams for freedom that\u2019d only fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP!!!!! !</i></b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl\u2019s entire body ached with great relief as all her pent-up gas exploded from her throat in an invisible geyser of air marinated by the stench of her innards, but she couldn\u2019t relish in the sweet release when a certain speck launched from her mouth at the loud updraft coming from inside of her. Marc screamed, spun, and flung about in his crash-course through Pearl\u2019s room, the light of the world outside of his master agonizing on his face, but past it all, with his ears ringing, his arms and legs flopping like wet noodles on his body, and his body damp with the horrid stench of Pearl\u2019s breath tenfold, he had won. If getting belched up by Pearl meant splattering against the wall in a mess of skin and blood on the wall, then it also meant he\u2019d fought the belly of the beast and came back out the very means he was forced in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rapidly gaining height, soaring to the ceiling at a frightening rate, and the rejoicing in his brief, likely bittersweet victory passed enough to recognize the oncoming roof. The threw his arms over his head, the simple act heavy at the force of the wind battering on him, but as his velocity came to a crawl, he opened his eyes at a ventilation duct that was coming in close, and he flailed his hands about to manage a quick glance at one of the rungs, shivering as he reached up with his other and held on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Marc alive and uneaten, albeit once again trapped by the undoubtedly deathly fall he\u2019d be in for if his grip lessened, Pearl promptly rolled her blobby self from the couch and hurried over under where his stubborn meal hung for life, breathing hoarsely as she hopped upwards with a swing of her fin to snatch him back down, but merely smacked through nothing. Another jump, and she tried to swipe down on Marc again, then again, and again, and again, and again, but Marc didn\u2019t have to pull his legs up to avoid Pearl\u2019s continuous mad flapping. Not even the likes of Dominique or Avery could make the jump if they tried, as adept at moving their bulks around as they were, and Pearl likely weighed twice as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething Pearl would do good with being told with a few hundred times, but as she continued to leap and fail to give her fat feet any meaningful distance off the floor, no doubt driving her neighbors absolutely bonkers as she hammered on her room with her own mass on repeat, twice as many might not have been even a <i>decimal</i> enough of, and Marc saw some solace in his trappings that he at least had a show to go off on. Not that there were many encouraging words he had to use and describe his boss-turned-captor, but when Pearl had a task at hand, he saw that she\u2019d try and see it through no matter with how many and how obvious her failed attempts at catching him were getting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of three hours were spent with Pearl putting up the same fight with no change in strategy, only interrupting herself on occasion to catch her breath, lean against a wall, or sit on the couch to gather her bearings, her workout likely shedding half her entire body\u2019s water weight in sweat. Marc didn\u2019t even want to escape anymore. Heck, all things considered, he already had. Pearl was his prisoner, reduced to a sloshing, quaking mass that was desperately trying to grab for her next meal when she had a fully stocked fridge just a short walk away, and that glazed, half-lidded dullness to her eyes was giving way to desperation, her attempts at leaping to him coming more sluggish than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during one of her many, many breaks that Pearl hunched over, wiping at the waterfall of sweat pouring from her brow as as air hoarsely flew in and out through her drooling maw. Marc frowned, hoping she wasn\u2019t going to give up, but she instead set her fists on her hips and glared with what little intensity her chub-caked face could entail. She pointed her finger at him, opening her mouth to speak, then let her arm fall so she could wipe away at more sweat. Then she pointed at him again, taking on that same rigid stance, then just let both arms drop to take a few more rugged breaths, the cycle repeating itself for ten minutes till, with one more look of demand, she thrust a finned finger out at him and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Aaaaaaaaaaalright!</i>\u201d Pearl bellowed, putting on her big-girl\u2019s voice. \u201cI know a squeaky wheel when it hits an immovable object, I\u2019m gonna cut you a deal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Marc answered, guaranteeing a swift, certain \u2018no\u2019 for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 is you...that\u2019s <i>you,</i> come down <b><i>here,</i></b>\u201d She explained, pointing between him and the floor, \u201cand I\u2019ll eatcha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll cut my losses.\u201d Came Marc\u2019s reply, preferring to gaze up into the vent than watch any further.</span></div></div>",

Look, I'll even make it easy for you and open up nice and wide. See? Ahhhhhhhh,\" Pearl stretched her mouth open as far as it would go and rolled out her tongue like a red carpet event. She pointed into her mouth helpfully, as if Marc was confused where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc watched her, unimpressed. \"Are you really that dumb? Remember the last few days I spent kicking and screaming for you to let me out? Did you think I was pretending? I don't want to be eaten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... <i>Oh!</i> You <i>don't</i> want to be eaten,\" Pearl said, as if suddenly understanding something that had never occurred to her. \"Well why didn't you say so? That's fine! ... Say... why don't you come on down and I promise <i>not</i> to eat you. I'm not even hungry anymore,\" she lied, her stomach immediately proving her wrong by letting out a loud growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>GGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL</i>{ /b}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl giggled sheepishly and shushed her stomach. \"Quiet, girl.

The moment of inattention almost caused Marc to slip from the air vent. He renewed his grip and looked at the orca as she started pleading desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand!\" she bawled. \"You're food! Food is supposed to be eaten! Once it's in my tummy, food can't just be ejected back out the mouth! It's impossible! It's so impossible there's not even a word for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes there is! It's called vomiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl snickered like he was joking. \"That's the most phony-baloney word I've ever heard. Look, you're food and food belongs in my belly. Please just come down so I can eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, Dum-Dum,\" Marc said. \"Look, this has been fun and the bun and all, but I'm gonna pull an action movie and try to escape from this nightmare through the vents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that! No human has ever survived escaping through the ventilation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? And how many have ever survived escaping through your digestive tract?\" Marc asked as he began pulling at the metal grill. Pearl opened her mouth to respond but a loud, bassy <i>BRAAAAAP</i> of flatulence slipped out of her backside. \"That's what I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grill came loose and swung down on a hinge, letting Marc scramble up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't happening!\" Pearl said. \"You can't die! If you do I'll never get to eat you! Food belongs in my belly! It can't be uneaten! YOU CAN'T GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch me, Dum-Dum. Enjoy starving yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Marc snapped, seconds before he could disappear into the air vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a new deal for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was surprised that he almost felt some pity for the obese orca. Sure she was a mindless eating machine who'd reduced countless coworkers--fellow human beings with hopes and dreams and lives--into foul smelling gas for the sake of her own pleasure, but she was just <i>sooooooooooooooo</i> stupid Marc was finding it harder to get joy from her pathetic attempts at persuasion... Harder, but not impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Ah, what the hell. Fire away, Dum-Dum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I\u2019m thinkin' is you... that\u2019s <i>you</i>, come down here,\" she explained, pointing between him and the floor again, \"and I\u2019ll <i>try</i> to eatcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Later, Pearl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT,\" she shouted, causing Marc to stop short, \"if you can escape out the door and into the hall, I won't eatcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt the strangest feeling deja vu as he waited to see if there was anything else. \"... and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL GET YOU OUT OF YOUR CONTRACT WITH THE ASL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" This time Marc stopped in genuine interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your contract with the ASL. I can get you out of it. Marlene owes me a favor. I ask and she'll let you go.\" Seeing she actually had Marc's interest, Pearl decided to double down. She'd never lost a meal before and she wasn't about to lose one now. One way or another, someday, somehow, that human would be back in her belly, digesting where he belonged. She pulled a remote that looked like a garage door opener out of one of her folds of fat and pressed the big, red button, causing the door to the hall to swing open. \"See?\" Pearl said. \"All you have to do is make it out into the hall and you're safe. I'll even back up to give you a head start,\" Pearl said, waddling her massive bulk against the back wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on, Mr. Food</i>, Pearl thought. <i>Come down, back into my belly to join all your food friends. You'll never escape. My belly is your home.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc, oblivious to the orca's true intentions, watched her carefully, torn between his desire to simply escape into the vents and go his own way and the seeming impossibility of simply being let out of his contract. But it just seemed too convenient. Pearl was a terrible liar and her story stunk. Stunk worse than any emission she'd let rip in his presence. On the other hand, it seemed so easy. Just make it into the hall and no longer live under threat of being eaten. His nightmare could finally be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a deal?\" Pearl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Marc do?

He had no guarantee that Pearl would keep to her word. He'd had so many mistresses that promised him something just to snatch it away for shits and giggles. Besides, Pearl had opened the door with a remote. What was stopping her from simply closing with the remote? She was desperate enough for it! Even if he did make it out, there was really no way out of his contract. Since he'd come to ASL, he'd actually taken the time to read over that blasted legal document and while he was no law expert, the thing was air tight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pearl swiveled her blobby head back to it\u2019s original position and procured another foodstuff from thin air, this time a triple-patty hamburger, and gulped it down in one bite, her beady eyes never leaving the blank T.V screen, expecting it to turn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc, not wanting to leave a bad impression on her new mistress, even if all she could presently think about at this time was eating more food, scrambled to get the television on as fast as possible. He shimmied up one of the legs of the table that held up the analogue, cathode tube box of a television, a skill he had gained after years of adapting to anthro sized furniture, and pressed the whole weight of his body on the power button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dated television monitor sprang to life. At first, there was nothing but static, and than the image cleared along with the sound. The semi-familiar sound of the discovery channel logo playing elicited a relieved sigh from Marc. His first task for his new mistress had been done. However, Pearl was not impressed, or at least, she didn\u2019t show it. Instead she gave a wet burp and blinked, noticing that the T.V has been turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Pearl commented. And after that, besides the noise spewing forth from the ancient electronics speakers, there was silence. Marc expected his new mistress to give him new directions, or show him where he would be sleeping for the night, or even just acknowledge that he was alive. But no, Pearl was completely unresponsive save for eating, burping, and blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Marc slided down the table leg and walked towards the base of the couch, where he could scarcely make out Pearl\u2019s bloated legs under her perfect sphere of a stomach. With nothing to do and deciding it would be wise to wait for her close by, he took his seat on the floor, and proceeded to watch Shark Week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes going by of uninterrupted discovery channel, the channel went for commercial, and Pearl turned her head down again to get a good view of her new human servant. \u201cHey, what are you doing down there?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I was just watching T.V with you...should I...should I not do that?\u201d Marc gulped as Pearl\u2019s emotionless eyes gazed at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, Marc thought he saw his new mistress break face, the ends of her mouth creeping up for an amused smile. But than it was filled with a whole cake that met it\u2019s demise as quickly as it appeared. \u201cYou can watch T.V, but not on the floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...alright. Where should I-?\u201d Marc began to ask Pearl where exactly he should sit, but cut himself off as, what he could only guess were her arms under all of that greasy lard, came down and picked him around his sides. And before he could even ask what she was doing, Pearl had deposited his body next to her on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was only one problem with that. Pearl, with her immense size and girth, took up all of the couch alone. What could only be described as \u2018next to her\u2019 was the tiny sliver of sidearm that wasn't engulfed by her thigh flab. The moment she let go of Marc, he was almost instantly wedged between her and the side of the couch itself. Thankfully, her flab was too soft to crush him beyond some uncomfortable seating arrangements, but the thin layer of sweat around her body made it difficult to squeeze himself out without risking falling deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Marc began, trying to break the pregnant silence with some polite small talk. \u201cWhy do you like to eat so much, Mistress Pearl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause food tastes good.\u201d Peal replied after swallowing yet another foodstuff before procuring another. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many Human servant\u2019s have you had before?\u201d Marc tried to make banter again. And it was also important to know where Pearl lied on the ratio of him surviving this stunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, you\u2019re my first.\u201d Pearl confessed, before giving out another burp. \u201cI always wanted a Human around, just to be there, you know. Humans are a lot better than anthros.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m very sorry, Mistress Pearl. Could you repeat that please?\u201d Marc wanted to make sure that he had heard her correctly, or as correctly as possible with one of his ears smothered in Orca blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said Humans are better than anthros.\u201d Pearl actually broker her stare with the stream of infomercials on the television monitor to actually look at what little Marc was un-squished. \u201cAnthros think that they are better than everyone. They get cocky thinking that they have the world\u2019s best body, the strongest or the fattest or stuff like that. And than they digest in some other Anthros gut and they become just like them. I like Humans. They don\u2019t try to pull the wool over your eyes with showy lights. You see a Human, that\u2019s what your gonna get. You see an Anthro, there hiding something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc, who honestly did not think Pearl was capable of saying so many words in a sentence, was struck dumbfounded as he was smooshed a tad more into the couch as she shifted herself. He had been under the employ of many Anthros over the years, and almost all of them were now dead. Fighters came and went on a daily basis, but Pearl seemed to be the only one who wasn't infatuated by it\u2019s high risk lifestyle. She really was here just for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd In case you're wondering: No, I\u2019m not going to eat you.\u201d Pearl move her gaze back to the T.V and popper a fistful of potato chips into her mouth. \u201cYour too small to even be a light snack...plus your kinda cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Pearl really wasn't one for subtlety, that was for sure. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first it was light small talk, but as the minutes went by Marc found himself actually stopping Pearl\u2019s constant train of food to her mouth at times as she listened to him speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the Human servant\u2019s surprise, the black and white blob of an Orca did in fact have a personality besides eating underneath all of that blubber. Although Pearl naturally gravitated to food in their conversation, the two found themselves talking about their favorite moments from the shows they both watched, the best video games that they ever played, and it turned out they had a lot in common as far as an Anthro and a Human are concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt cautiously optimistic about his future as Pearl\u2019s servant. He didn\u2019t want to let his guard down yet, but things are already going so much better than his introduction to his last mistress. He was being squished by a giant wall of whale flesh, but asides from the pressure he was fine, the thigh flab being more of a plush inconvenience than a life impediment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things soon started to take a bad turn for Marc. As sedentary as Pearl was at her massive size, she was still able to move. And each time she wiggled her round rum to get more comfortable on the couch, or swallowed a particularly big piece of food, her layers of blubber move with her, sending small, soft waves of flab to travel along her smooth surface. The human soon found that each time one of these waves reached her thigh, he slipped deeper between her and the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always thought that I\u2019m half shark, you know?\u201d Pearl commented as she watched the Television whist gulping down a whole milkshake in one go, oblivious to her human\u2019s situation. \u201cI mean, I never knew my dad \u2018cause my mom ate him, but he had to be a shark. I\u2019m the most carnivorous gal in the family, yet I\u2019m still the runt compared to my sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoof\u2026that\u2019s uh, really Interesting mistress Pearl.\u201d Marc said as he struggled his arms against the ever encroaching wall of fat, the light layer of sweat on her smooth skin making his resent go faster. He honestly did think that what Pearl said was interesting, the thought of one of the biggest sumos in the ASL being the smallest in her family was certainly a lot to think about. But he was preoccupied with trying to stay afloat in a sea of whale lard. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to ask this if you, but do you think that you could scoot over a tad? It\u2019s starting to get hard to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, the only reason I\u2019m the smallest is because I work out.\u201d Pearl continued as she stuffed more food into her mouth, liking having someone to talk to for once despite unknowingly cutting Marc off. \u201cThey eat less, but they all live back in the South Pacific, where you don\u2019t need so much energy to move \u2018cause you\u2019re in water. All they do is eat and float, getting as big as Islands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmpph!\u201d Marc grunted as he slipped further into the dark crevice. His entire lower todo has been devoured by the hungry blubber, and it wanted more. He hung onto the couch\u2019s sidearm with all his strength, but it wasn't amounting to much. \u201cP-Pearl! That\u2019s real sweet and all, but-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet? Well, yeah, I guess my family is pretty sweet.\u201d Pearl leaned back in total relaxation, comically not hearing how strained Marc\u2019s comments are underneath all the pressure she was putting on him. \u201cThey were really supportive of my decision to move to the surface, see the world and taste the sights. I had to work off a lot of my fat to make it to the beach, but it\u2019ll only be a matter of time before I get back to my old size at the rate I\u2019m eating...geez, I haven\u2019t really told a lot of people this before. You\u2019re a real good listener you know that? Thanks, it means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc could his new mistress chat away above, and he would have loved to respond and say that he was just honored she would share that with him, the moment he tried to open his mouth a cascade of salty, black flesh spilled into it. He had been completely engulfed in Orca thigh fat, and it was not the most pleasant experience ever. Each time he tried to move he sank deeper, like quicksand, only here he had small pockets of air to breath in to keep him going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl continued to eat and talk as she watched the sharks do flips in the water and bite provocative idiot documentarians, while Marc could only groan in discomfort as untold thousands of cushiony blubber presses his body into the hard furniture. Seconds turned to minutes and minutes turned to hours as this ordeal went on. All the human had for company was the sounds of the television, the orca\u2019s jabbering, and the constant sound of food being munched on with the occasional, muffled gurgle from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an untold amount of time, Pearl finally got up from her seating on the poor couch. \u201cI guess since you\u2019re my servant now, it\u2019s your job to refill my food stores. But I think I\u2019ll do it this one, last time, rest a little bit before your real work begins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc\u2019s flattened form suddenly found itself falling onto the Anthro sized couch cushions in the sudden absence of Pearl\u2019s body. He gasped for air, air now no longer being a luxury and in limited supply, into his squashed lungs. He saw his new mistress\u2019s over bloated form waddle to what he assumed was the kitchen as he catches his breath on the sofa cushion. It appeared to the servant that even though the Orca won\u2019t put him in danger on purpose, he was still going to have to keep on his toes around her heavy circumference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Marc felt confident enough to relax on the bent furniture when Pearl didn\u2019t come back. He let out a small smile and reclined himself on the cushion as he watched the T.V play infomercials. He was exhausted after that whole ordeal and was ready to take whatever free time was given to him. But than his whole world began to shake as the fat orca entered the room, each footfall rattling the floor and walls. The familiar sound of her munching and a telltale burp signifies that she once again had food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Some panther is getting eaten by a shark. Neat.\u201d Pearl said nonchalantly as she move around to sit down on the couch...failing to notice Marc relaxing on the cushions. The large, bare ass begins to descend towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Pearl\u2026? Hey, hey Pearl!\u201d Marc shouts as he realizes too late what was happening. Pearl bends her ass down even further, the human\u2019s life flashing before his eyes. \u201cMistress Pearl I\u2019m right here! I\u2019m under you, don\u2019t sit! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Marc\u2019s entire vision was enveloped by rapidly looming darkness. He might as well have been talking to a giant, fatty wall by that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked rear end of the giant whale-sumo made Marc little more than an impression on the same sofa cushions he was content to be on only moments ago. Thankfully for him, as he was flattened against the couch\u2019s fabric, he felt no immense, bone cracking, fatal pain. Just pressure pinning him down. The human works up the courage to open his eyes to find his world gone pitch black. From the few slivers of light he could see two large, smooth cheeks to either side of him. It dawned on him he was stuck between her crack, immobilized but relatively fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...please don\u2019t fart.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The entire room shook when Pearl plopped her gargantuan bottom onto the couch. As she reclined in her seat she couldn't help but notice how much more <i>comfortable</i> her usual spot was. Given her size and weight, it hadn't taken long for her butt cheeks to leave two minivan-size imprints in the cushion. She'd been thinking of getting a new couch for a while now, had even made a mental note to have Marc order a more endurable one, but if the couch had suddenly become this comfy, she might not need to anymore. She wiggled her behemoth, blubbery behind back and forth, getting better situated. The couch made some strange squeaking sounds she'd never heard before, but they were muffled soon enough, allowing the orca to relax in the perfect spot to sit and enjoy her shows. She'd come back with a veritable mountain of food, and had placed it on the table in front of the couch. It looked like enough to feed a small town for a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't have enough food on the property to restore my stock. All I got is just enough for a snack. Sorry but it looks like you'll have to get more food for me after all. Tomorrow though. I'll suffer through these measly portions tonight. Now, where was I? Oh, right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her eyes glued to the TV, Pearl was utterly oblivious to the fact that Marc was buried beneath her metric tons of fat. She began tearing into her food and continuing their conversation where they'd left off. Apparently she really was just looking for a good listener, since she talked for a good half-an-hour without realizing Marc was gone, ignoring the strange squeaks and creaks from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! You see that--<i>BWARP</i>--shark tearing into that gazelle?\" Pearl asked through a mouthful of food. \"I went to high school with her! Biggest--<i>BELCH</i>--you'd ever meet in your life. Used to call me Blowhole. I nearly ate her for that one. She never did that a--<i>URP</i>--gain,\" Pearl said, laughing, crumbs spraying from her mouth with each burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Pearl felt a pressure building in her abdomen, her constant eating finally catching up to her. While she had no problem letting air out from attic in front of her new human servant, she felt a little self conscious letting it out from the basement. She talked a little bit louder, hoping to cover up the sound as she subtly lifted a butt cheek up a little and let one rip, hoping it would be a silent one her human wouldn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for both of them, Marc knew all too well what was about to happen. For the past thirty minutes he'd been in hell. It hadn't been so bad at first, at least not relatively speaking. He'd been wedged in between Pearl's butt cheeks, trapped, but otherwise fine. He'd tried to alert her to his presence beneath her, but his hopes had been dashed when his mistress had wiggled her ass deeper into the couch, wedging him deeper up her crack. Now he was trapped on all sides, contained in her rank, sweaty butt. There was some air, but not much. Marc envied the good old days of an hour ago when he'd merely been pinned between the armrest of the couch and one of her thunder thighs. He tried yelling for help, but his pleas were muffled underneath all of the orca's layers of fat. That and she kept droning on and on. Marc couldn't make out what she was saying but it sounded like she thought he was still there on the couch, listening to her speak. A half an hour had passed in misery, with Marc only being able to make the slightest, pitiful yelps when she adjusted herself in her seat. The absolute worst moment game when he heard ominous groans coming from above, within the bowels of the orca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Oh no! OH NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTT!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl had lifted a butt cheek and let loose with a fart. The gas washed over him like a tsunami of funk. Marc gagged on the stench, eyes watering. He redoubled his efforts at wiggling himself free but he remained just as trapped as ever, only now, he was trapped with the rancid stink of a million dead fishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Pearl blushed. She'd been hoping to pass off whatever noise her passing gas made as another creak of the couch, but this emission had sounded like an explosion. She caught a whiff of it and it burned her own nostrils. There was no way in hell she could hide something so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Pearl muttered, embarrassed. \"I need to gain weight, and that means eating a ton of crappy food, but it plays havoc on my stomach, y'know? ... Marc? ... Marc?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Pearl looked away from the TV to the spot where her human had been sitting only to find him gone. She looked around the room without getting off the couch, craning her neck to try and find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marc? MARC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response. It was as if the human had disappeared. Had something happened to him while she was gone? She knew some of the other wrestlers weren't fond of humans. It wasn't uncommon for a rival to kidnap a wrestler's human servant and haze him as a way of messing with their competitor. Usually these pranks weren't fatal, but they were definitely unpleasant. If that was the case, her new human was in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, Pearl suddenly thought, horrified, had Marc abandoned her? Had he seen his chance to escape while she was gone and was now laughing at her for trusting him? But that couldn't be true, could it? She'd shared her feelings with him, talked about her family with him. They'd watched Shark Week together! Had that meant nothing to him?! The idea he could've betrayed her trust cut deep, and caused dark, angry thoughts to come to the front of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she'd have to track Marc down, but which emotion did Pearl settle on? Worry for her new human friend's safety or blind fury at his perceived treachery?</span></div></div>",

It can be easy to think the worst of people, that they did you wrong, and that the only thing that will make you feel better is to do something drastic, something extreme, something you might regret later. When Pearl couldn't find Marc, her mind was split between two worse case scenarios: A. Marc played with her emotions and hightailed it out if their the moment he go the chance, and B. Someone came into her room and snatched him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Pearl chose to give her human the benefit of the doubt. She knows how the other servants are treated in the ASL. She knows she was a godsend to Marc compared to the other sumos. The question was than If Marc was stolen, who stole him? Bronze League did not have access to this part of the facility, so that narrowed her choices down. Claudine was too dignified and self-respecting to pull such a stunt, Daisy wouldn't dare mess with Pearl after she almost ate her, and than there was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whore hippo who fell in love with human con man back when she was a detective, who put her heart on the line in front of a hardened criminal and thought she could change him. She couldn't, and that broke her. She hates humans, especially the male ones. She took Marc. She had to, no one had more of a motive. The blob of an Orca soon found herself overwhelmed with anger, a strong enough anger to set down the burrito she was in the middle of eating back on the table. She slowly raised herself from her seat on the couch with a determined look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she touches a single hair on his head, I swear to whoever will listen that she will be fat on my ass.\u201d She waddled out of her room and entered the hallway, looking for the way to the silver league to pay a certain pachyderm a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Marc\u2019s stay in hell had gotten even worse. Now that Pearl was off the couch, the pungent eye watering vapors were allowed to dissipate into the air, but the Human was stuck smelling like a rotting car as at the bottom of the ocean. And now she was moving, with him stuck between her cheeks, grinding and wobbling against one another, molding over his body like concrete gelatin. The sweaty, musky whale ass flesh squished him with the force of an Industrial steamroller, making each second Marc found himself not dead from the pressure a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor human\u2019s consolation to all of this while Pearl waddled slowly to her destination was that it was an accident. It didn\u2019t detract away from the massive pain he was being put through, nor was it an excuse for his new Mistresses carelessness, but Marc had been in similar situations under others on purpose. They made sure every second of those experiences were hell on Earth. Even if it was just slightly, the torture the Orca was putting her servant through was far from the worst he\u2019s ever been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell is he? I know you have him.\u201d Marc could make out his involuntary captor demand if someone else. Her voice was muffled under all the layers of lard, but still audible to the human\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about you fat bitch?\u201d Marc heard another voice respond to Pearl, and he instantly recognized it. His blood ran cold as the poor human put the voice to the intimidating and sadistic Dominique the dominator. What the hell was Pearl doing here, he didn\u2019t know. But he did know that it was bad for humans to be just in range of her voice, and began to wiggle his way out of the whale\u2019s vice grip on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got my first human servant this morning. Nice guy. Talked to him, he listened. Watched T.V. Now he\u2019s gone, and you took him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe indigo hippo made a sneering laugh. \u201cOh, is just priceless. You think I took your pathetic chew toy? Wimps like him aren\u2019t worth my time.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one in the ASL hates Humans as much as you do. Give him to me now, or I\u2019ll bulldoze you over and tear up your room looking for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be pretty sure he was kidnapped. How do you know he just left, Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...take that back. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I? His species are a race of pitiful cowards that are only good for a light snack. It\u2019s not my fault you got attached to a sniveling monkey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc heard the two titans bicker back and forth. The both of them were mad-no, royally pissed was a better description, and the human could hear all of the venom and coldness in their voices. They went silent for a moment, Pearl thinking of a reply to Dominique, while the hippo patiently waited. What came out between the Orca\u2019s lips gave her human goosebumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Dominique, it\u2019s not my fault you fell in love with a known criminal and got yourself knocked up, got roped into a shotgun wedding to avoid having a bastard out of wedlock, and let yourself be surprised when you found out he was cheating on you the entire time. It\u2019s not my fault your human left you at the altar while mine was taken by some immature slut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was sure that no one had ever, EVER talked to Dominique like that before. The amount of bluntness and vitriol in those two sentences made the air, as hot and humid is was, ten d greed colder. And he was almost impressed for Pearl to have the guts to say it, if it wasent for what Dominique said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going to eat you. I\u2019m going to eat you right here and now and turn you into fat. Than, I\u2019m going to find your delicate little human and crush him into foam under my foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never eaten a Hippo whole before. I wonder how you\u2019ll taste\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the two were at each other\u2019s throats in an impromptu survival match. Mark's works spun and twirled around as Pearl flung Dominique into the wall, the sound of plaster crumbling to dust ringing in his ears despite where he was. The Hippo retaliated with a punch to the Killer Whale\u2019s face, knocking out a tooth and making her stumble backwards. Marc was afraid she would sit down again, but she regained her balance before she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this action went in, Marc continued to wiggle his way out of Pearl\u2019s ass crack. She was working up a sweat now, and it as foul smelling as it was, it made the fatty flesh slippery enough to move through. He choked down vomit as he mentally promised himself to take a hour long shower after all this, if he got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of it all\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dominique screamed as orca teeth sank into hippo flesh, Pearl grunted in pain as Hippo knee was thrust into Orca stomach, and Marc was being swung around left and right as the two fought, wrestled and rolled over one another, his form flinging about like he was trapped in some sweaty, fleshy carnival ride at the country fair. To try and pull himself free or remain trapped in Pearl\u2019s buttcrack, he couldn\u2019t decide which would guarantee his survival, his senses bombarded with the scent of Pearl\u2019s body odor, the hurricane of colors sweeping around him, and his limbs voming dangerously close to being ripped from their sockets by the centrifuge alone, his mind barely able to comprehend anything but the sheer agony of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and the chants of the surrounding crowd of onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cFIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique\u2019s arms smacked down at both sides of Pearl\u2019s face, the orca dazedly stumbling backwards, vulnerable enough to take a headbutt to the belly that sent her flying backwards, the wall\u2019s crumbling disguising Marc\u2019s shrieks of terror as the plaster surface came close enough to crush his form, but was cushioned enough by Pearl\u2019s ass that he remained a few inches away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her Pearl\u2019s splayed form open for attack, Dominique came in with a barrage of punches and smacks that continuously wrenched the orca\u2019s head left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna say that <i>shit</i> again, you human-fucking <i><b>cunt?!</b></i>\u201d Dominique snarled, pausing in her onslaught, but robbed Pearl of any chance to answer with a left hook to her jaw. \u201cWho\u2019s the one letting herself get surprised <i>NOW?! <b>HUH?!</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique answered for her in one, two, three more smacks, each garnering a cringe from the audience. Despite being crazed, insulted, and hungry for orca blood, Dominique managed to pause again to relish in the fruit of her labor, seeing Pearl\u2019s face be beaten, bruised, and bloodied more than it would\u2019ve been in a genuine match on the ring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but Dominique's smile loosened out in surprise when Pearl managed to peel her eyes open and glare right back, completely unbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...\u201d Pearl groaned, fins clamping around her rival\u2019s tank top and yank her off the ground, the orca\u2019s head swinging down to smash her face right into Dominique\u2019s skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his ears ringing, Marc could tell everything had went silent. Pearl wasn\u2019t spinning about, and even the onlookers were silent as a tomb when...something tried to work its way into his battered eardrums. A voice, his senses were gradually clearing up to understand...somebody feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat of Dominique\u2019s, only now it was muffled as she screamed long and loud. Not in rage, pain, or victory, but in <i>terror.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of the crowd was frozen in whatever excited poses they\u2019d taken during the fight, but their faces were all molded in shock as Pearl reared her head up to gulp Dominique down, arms carrying the hippo\u2019s fat frame upwards to help guide her down, already past the neck and working on the torso. Dominique\u2019s arms flapped to smack at Pearl\u2019s face, a few magic sparkles fluttering around her hands, but the adrenaline in her system made it impossible to string up a single consistent spell, and soon, her arms were swallowed past Pearl\u2019s cheeks, reducing her only movements to paddling her legs about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking air in through her blowhole, Pearl\u2019s eyes watered as she forced Dominique's widest proportions into her cheeks and felt her neck bulge grotesquely around the girth of her new meal, but, being something Pearl was set out to eat, Dominique met her fate and was pulled into the damp, fleshy cavern and was sucked into the catacomb of the Orca\u2019s belly, whose cheeks puffed out in a content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few polite claps rung out from the audience, but unlike the movies, there was no thunderous applause to follow. Everybody either disbanded in awe or trotted past Pearl to give her a congratulatory pat on the side, the Orca\u2019s stomach now even more of a grotesquely swollen ball of whale blubber, arms awkwardly forced upwards by the new width added to her form, breasts clamping around her maw by a new dozen feet of whale blubber protruding out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl barely acknowledged them; neither the disappearing crowd or the painful tautness occupying her body mattered much as something else on her mind. \u201c...Marc? <i>Marc!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified to see what had happened, yet eager to escape, Marc grabbed at Pearl\u2019s thong to pull himself free, his legs gradually pulling free from between her legs, but his weight pulled down on her underwear enough to dangle him a few feet above the ground, a short enough distance that he could let go without breaking his legs, but still landed with enough of a thud to roll over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound, Pearl\u2019s head shot up, fighting against her flabby shoulder to see past her even more enormous frame, and beamed at seeing Marc crawl into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarc! Are you okay?\u201d She asked hurriedly. She tried to move her legs to turn him, also reaching out with her arms to pick him back up, but any tasks that were near impossible at her old form were outright at the moment, and she settled on tilting on her side and holding an open fin out for him to take. \u201cYou, uh...mind getting up yourself, at the moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc managed to guide his aching muscles to stand himself back up, legs aching at the weight of his own body, but barely even realized Pearl was still there until he was grabbed from the ground with her webbed fingers, lungs only full enough to groan in plain as Pearl brought him up to hdr cheek and began nuzzling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Marc, I\u2019m so sorry about whatever Dominique did to you!\u201d She cooed, her absence of a nose or nostrils preventing her from realizing where he was. \u201cGood thing that pocket dimension spell she must\u2019ve used was broken when I ate her, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Pearl?\u201d He mumbled, his brain to battered to understand any sentences more than three words long. \u201cWhat...did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMade sure Dominique\u2019s not gonna hurt you again, pal.\u201d She promised. \u201cDon\u2019t you know what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery little, despite having technically been in the fight himself, but with his hand massaging his forehead, Marc glanced around before seeing what lay past Pearl\u2019s cleavage; that being nearly a dozen feet of orca belly extending out from her body, its curvature occasionally broken by a fist-shaped lump pouncing from her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Pearl?\u201d He mumbled uneasily, the dots connecting. \u201cDid...did you <i>eat</i> Dominique?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna take any chances when she had you, buddy.\u201d She answered. \u201cIt was the only way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl...but I...you...\u201d He babbled, unsure if he should be terrified, angry, probably even thankful. \u201cPearl, Dominique didn\u2019t kidnap me! I was stuck in you butt crack the entire time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl jolted in surprise, eyes opening wider. \u201c...excuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sat on me back at your room! Dominique had nothing to do with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d Pearl raised a finger, but no further argument came from her mouth. Her eyes glanced around a few times, her brow\u2019s expression changing as she turned the situation over in her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth slowly closed, seemingly stunned as the realization of what\u2019d she\u2019d done set in...only to be shaken by a wobbly smile and a giggle working its way from her lungs, shaking Marc around slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh...heh-hahahahahha!\u201d She chuckled festively. \u201cHeh...damn, I\u2019m sorry about that, Marc. Talk about a crazy first day on the job, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl, wha...what\u2019re you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, consider this the beginning of your raise, then. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a triumphant grin, Pearl began dragging her feet across the floor...but didn\u2019t move an inch, her belly\u2019s excess mass keeping her anchored. She barely acknowledged, marching in place like she was leaving a stadium giving her an uproarious applause, but when her eye peeked open, noticing that Marc was observing her with a slack jaw, she gradually came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Pearl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgetting what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc pointed a finger downwards. \u201cDominique.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What about her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was completely innocent!\u201d He snapped back. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even <i>know</i> I was missing till you came to her room, and you <i><b>ate</b></i> her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl glanced down at her ballooned middle, then back up at Marc. \u201c...and?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to <i>do</i> something for her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...but...you...how...\u201d He stuttered incoherently, then shook his head and glared at her. \u201c<i>Spit her up!!!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pearl rolled her eyes so Marc kept talking before she could refuse. \"Look, Pearl, let's forget the fact that Dominique is technically innocent--of this at least--let's focus on the fact that this wasn't a legal match. I mean, sure you two attracted a crowd, but it wasn't a sanctioned Survival Match. The ASL would want to broadcast a fight like that between two of their most popular fighters. You're the nicest boss I've ever had so far, I don't want you to get in trouble over some jerk like Dominique! What if they fired you?\" Marc blinked. \"Wait. If they fired you, do you think they'd fire me too? On second thought--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Marc,\" Pearl said, apparently not hearing what he said. \"She's not worth risking my job over. How else would I get the food I need to maintain my figure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, valid point, yes,\" Marc said. \"But on the other hand--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand back!\" Pearl said dramatically. \"I'm an expert on swallowing food down, not bringing it back up. This might get a little messy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Pearl scrunched her face up in concentration. She compressed her abdomen and Marc watched in horrified fascination as the gargantuan bulge that was Dominique made her way back up the way she'd come. It was happening slowly, too slowly to be frank. By now the hippo was midway between the orca's stomach and esophagus. Pearl's eyes were bulging out of her head and her face was turning red. It took Marc a second to realize she was choking. She tried to swallow Dominique back down, but now that she was so close to freedom, Dominique wasn't going anywhere. Marc had to do something or Pearl was toast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed over behind Pearl, in the space between her backside and Dominique's sofa. Steadying his feet against the couch, he began pushing as hard as he could against her back. With any luck, she'd end up lying on her stomach, making it easier to throw up Dominique than if she was sitting straight. It felt like trying to budge the biggest boulder imaginable. The combined weight of the orca and hippo made it almost impossible to move, but when Pearl noticed what he was doing, she began leaning back and forth, back and forth to build up momentum. Unfortunately she did this without considering that Marc was still behind her. The first time she lurched forward, Marc lost his grip and fell into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT AGAIN!\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was back in the prison he'd only just freed himself from, and he was totally helpless as Pearl swayed back and forth. Each time she would get a little bit closer to rolling on her belly, and Marc would get a little more smooshed between her massive butt cheeks. He didn't even bother trying to escape, not wanting to distract Pearl from her task. At last she landed on her stomach and opened her mouth. Dominique's form was shot out of Pearl's throat like a cork from a champagne bottle, riding a torrent of pent-up gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP !</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique, slick from a fresh coating of orca drool, slid across the floor and crashed into the wall in the outside hall. She got to her feet unsteadily and shot Pearl a look that could kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE DEAD!\" the hippo bellowed. \"BOTH OF YOU! I SWEAR I'LL GET YOU AND THAT HUMAN MAGGOT IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl wiped the spit from her lips and shot her a look of equal venom. \"You hurt a hair on my human's head and I'll send you on a one-way trip back down my digestive system, and this time, you won't be coming out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you wait,\" Dominique said, before staggering away down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people,\" Pearl grumbled. \"Do them a favor and they don't show any gratitude. Ah well. That was a good idea with pitching me forward, Marc. If it wasn't for you I'd be sleeping with the fishes!\" She chuckled at her own choke. \"Thanks for the assist, Marc.... Marc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl listened attentively for any sign of her human when she heard muffled cries coming from behind her and chuckled. She reached behind her and pulled Marc out with a squelching sound. Marc gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marc,\" Pearl said playfully, \"if I didn't know any better, I'd guess you were trying to get there on purpose, you naughty boy!\" She batted her eyelashes at him and Marc gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" he said panicked. \"It was an accident! I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Pearl said, smiling. She didn't sound convinced. \"Well if you play your cards right, maybe you can have another \"accident\" soon.\" She winked and Marc shuddered. \"For now though, I think it's time for you to carry out the first of your duties...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Having thrown up Dominique, Pearl is famished. Marc will feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) It's time for Marc to help Pearl train for an upcoming match.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So...you want to fight against Dominique in a Survival Match\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Marc or his mistress Pearl had ever seen the big boss of the Anthro Sumo League in person, but they have always heard the rumors surrounding her. A mountain of flesh even amongst Anthros with the strength of a Greek God, a champion of hunger in food, wealth, and lust. The human thought she didn\u2019t even exist, just a story to tell servants on their first day to instill fear, while the whale believed that she would turn out to be another run of the mill wrestler like Dominique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their beliefs were disproven as they gazed upon Marlene, the founder, owner, figurehead, and champion of the ASL. Marc thought that Pearl was a Goliath compared to his size, but as he stared dark purple and white colored penguin sitting on a reinforced chair behind her desk, he realized his mistress was half her size. Both her tits and ass were so huge they made the Orca\u2019s waistline look pleasantly plump. Her stomach, cascading onto the ground like a waterfall, was so big that it not only served as her personal surface, it looked like it could fit two of Pearl no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly an intriguing proposition.\u201d She purred, stroking her literal building sized gut absent mindedly. Marc almost felt tempted to leave his perch on Pearl\u2019s shoulder in favor of her prison of a backside under Marlene\u2019s...suggestive glares. One if the biggest rumors surrounding the penguin was her fetish for all things tiny, and at her size humans are the size of an ant to her. \u201cThe two of you have certainly amassed quite the number of followers and fans, a fight like that I could sell seats for thousands of dollars. But why the suddenness, Pearly Wearly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl blushed and grimaced at the cutesy nickname, but decided to suck it up. \u201cAs long as Dominique is alive she breathing, my human isn\u2019t safe.\u201d She gestured to Marc on her left shoulder and nuzzled him gently with her flabby cheek. \u201cAnd knowing her, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in a position to be peaceful...neither am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I understand how you feel, my rising star.\u201d Marlene stood up from her chair, her stomach still glued to the ground, and walked around her desk to Pearl. Each footfall heavy enough that even the Orca could feel the tremors. \u201cHumans certainly are a curious species that most can\u2019t help but fall in love with. So tiny and fragile, yet so cute and innocent. It certainly would be a shame to let Mr. Youngblood...leave our company on bad terms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing.\u201d Marlene suddenly pushed her gargantuan belly into Pear\u2019s in comparison tiny one, her intimidating shadow looking over her like a dark diety. \u201cFights like These takes months of training to prepare for, but I can see by your cuts and bruises that you don\u2019t have that time. I\u2019ll let you have the chance to turn that hippo into blubber...but I can only give you three days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree days?!\u201d Marc shouted in disbelief. Pearl tried to talk, but no words could come out if her agape mouth save for incomprehensible stammering. \u201cThat\u2019s like telling a farmer he has an hour to grow a bumper crop, you can\u2019t ask that of her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure your mistress appreciates your caring of her wellbeing, Marcus.\u201d Marlene smirked, purposely using her employee\u2019s full name to agitate him. Humans were so cute when they got flustered. \u201cBut that\u2019s all the time I can give in your situation. If you want, I can give you a couple months to get ready...if you think Dominique won\u2019t make any moves in the meantime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Pearl spoke up, drawing both her human\u2019s attention and Marlene\u2019s. \u201cShe needs to go, and she needs to go now. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Pearl stood up from her chair and turned around. \u201cC\u2019mon, Marc, we\u2019ve got a long they're days ahead of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene smiled silently as she watched Pearl and Marc walk out of her office with determination. \u201cWhat a sweet couple...I do hope she wins\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNews inside if the ASL facility travel fast, so when Pearl came marching down the halls to the training room, everyone gave her a wide bearth. Sime called her grave behind her back as she walked past, others said she was foolish, and all of them glared at the tiny human on her shoulder. The human that she would kill for. Marc gulped audibly under the scrutiny, never one for the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do I help you train?\u201d Marc asked Pearl as she pressed her ID Card against the scanner and walked into the training center. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could survive a sparring match on the ring, no matter how gentle you handle me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, I just need someone to coach me, tell me to do things and how to do it.\u201d Pearl grabbed Marc from her shoulder and held him to her face. \u201cI need to make sure I\u2019m in my prime for the fight, so your job is to direct and motivate me to get they're. And since you\u2019re my coach, you can decide what I should do first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc looked around the training room to see what training Pearl should start on. It was pretty full, but they're were at least three options for him to choose from that weren\u2019t being used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one did he pick?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok,\" Marc said, looking around the crowded gym and spotting one unused piece of equipment. \"How about the treadmill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl groaned. \"I hate running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed,\" Marc said. Given how often he saw her sitting, Marc thought Pearl disliked movement of any kind. Unless the motion was raising her hand to her mouth to deposit her most recent snack inside. \"Dominique is pretty fast for her size. You should work on your agility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Whatever you say, Coach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl waddled over to the treadmill. The pieces of equipment in the gym ranged in size to accommodate the range of sizes for the anthro fighters, but the treadmill Pearl was going to use was actually pretty big for her. Marc had actually heard stories about another gym deeper in the ASL facilities where kaiju-sized anthros trained. Remembering their encounter with Marlene, Marc wouldn't have been surprised if that was true. Since there was no other treadmill free, they'd have to make the best of this one, even if the controls came up just above Pearl's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't reach, oh well, guess we'll have to do something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a quitter,\" Marc said. \"Lift me up, I'll turn on the machine, and you can tell me when you're feeling exhausted.\" Pearl sighed and lifted Marc above her head and he climbed onto the controls. \"Ready?\" he called down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl groaned again. \"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start you off on the lowest setting,\" Marc said, stomping on the number 1 on the panel. The treadmill started and Pearl began to shuffle her feet. He went over to the Up arrow button and stomped on it to increase the speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl wiped sweat off her forehead. \"This is torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on 2, Pearl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we take a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Marc said. \"Do you want to be eaten by Dominique?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Pearl grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then keep running!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc increased the speed. Instead of a slow trudge, the orca was going at a brisk walk. He turned it up again and she started to jog, her whole body jiggling with the effort. After five minutes she was huffing and puffing and drenched with sweat like she'd just finished running twenty miles. The sight did not inspire much confidence in Marc. It was hard to believe that someone who couldn't last five minutes on a treadmill had bested a fighter as deadly as Dominique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc watched her and felt a wave of guilt. What if her beating Dominique had been a fluke? What if she couldn't do it again? Marc had been the one to convince her to throw the evil hippo up. If Pearl got eaten, it would be Marc's fault for convincing her to show Dominique mercy. He didn't think he could live with her death on his conscience. She was the nicest boss he'd ever had in the ASL. He called down words of encouragement to her. It wasn't anything to write home about, the stock, \"You can do this,\" \"I believe in you,\" routine. It wasn't much but it was enough to get Pearl to run for a solid ten minutes without complaint. As far as Marc was concerned that was a good start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" Pearl gasped. \"Turn it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, give me five more minutes! You can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO I CAN'T!\" she snapped. \"My shoe fell off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc wasn't sure if she was telling the truth or just looking for an excuse to give up early. He leaned out over the edge of the treadmill to a catch sight of her feet. By the time he saw her barefoot, the treadmill jammed and shuddered. Marc was rocked off his perch and sent falling to the treadmill below. Pearl didn't have enough time to stop and Marc didn't have enough time to get out of the way. Marc let out a pitiful scream and raised his arms to protect his head. It didn't do any good. Her foot--as big as his whole body--came crashing down on him. In the split second he had left he was just grateful he was about to be crushed by her barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic, blubbery sole smooshed Marc into the ground. The pain was extraordinary and as she lifted her foot off him, Marc was stuck to the bottom of her foot like a piece of chewed gum. He had only a second of relief before her foot slammed back down, stomping him into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Marc--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't reach the controls--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't turn it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM! SLAM! SLAM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc shouted at her to just hop to the side to get off the machine but his words were muffled as his face was ground into her sole. Though not as bad as being in her backside, the smell coming off her sweaty foot was far from pleasant. He had no choice but to breathe it in as Pearl kept running, mashing him into the ground like a bug with each stride. He prayed that either Pearl would finally realize how simple it was to get off the treadmill or that some fighter would take pity on them and turn off the machine. He thought the latter unlikely. He remembered the death glares and harsh murmurs they'd gotten as the fighters saw Pearl with a human perched on her shoulder. It was more likely they'd leave him there out of amusement. Still, he had to pray for help from somewhere! Pearl was so huge, being stomped under her full weight was unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would Marc get free?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Pearl finally realizes she can just hop off the machine and Marc is freed. They go on to train on another piece of equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Another fighter turns off the machine. Is she friendly or does she have a sinister motive in mind?</span></div></div>",

He could feel his bones rub against each other from the impossible weight they were being put under. And the smell, the funky, sweaty smell of grime and dirt put invaded his nose and made his eyes water. While nowhere near as bad as Pearl\u2019s backside, the Human still wanted to get away from it as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl!\u201d Marc shouted with all of his rapidly fleeting strength. He could only speak in between stomps, and he had no idea if his voice was audible, but at this point he was willing to try anything. \u201cJust...hop...off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to speak up, Marc!\u201d Pearl wheezed like a wild dog, trying to keep her voice at an indoor level. Her whole body was drenched in sweat, definitely not used to this much physical exertion. She could faintly make out what Marc was trying to say over the sound of her own rapid breath, the whirrings of the torture device she was on, and the footfalls that kept him lodged in her sole. \u201cBecause all I heard was \u2018hop\u2019, is that what you me to do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Marc shouted, frustrated at the miscommunication occurring. \u201cHop...off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOff?\u201d Pearl echoed, not particularly understanding what her human servant was trying to say. \u201cMarc, that doesn't make any s-...oh goddamnit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl slapped her fat forehead in internal frustration as she realized what Marc was trying to say, upset that she didn\u2019t think of it sooner and that the solution was so easy. Much to her aching legs satisfaction, the bloated Orca halted her endless run on the treadmill by simply jumping her body to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Pearl peeled Marc off from her blubbery sole, he could here the amused chuckles and hurtful comments being made in his expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood God, she let her Human coach her? Pearl must have more fat than brains if she did something that stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him, covered in sweat and filth. Ugh, where\u2019s pest control when you need them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s still alive after all of that? Piece of trash is durable, I\u2019ll give him that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc sighed and lowered his head down. He was used to this kind of treatment in the ASL. Humans were expendable, used for punching bags and a lite snack. It was just the natural order of things around here. However, someone clearly didn\u2019t inform Pearl of the natural order of things, something that she made quite evident as she waddled her way up to one of the heckling anthros with her human in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t quite hear you earlier over all the fat in my ears. What did you want to say?\u201d Pearl glared venomously at the Anthro in question, a sumo, while still large, only half the Orca\u2019s size. \u201cC\u2019mon, you were talking all that good stuff a moment ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anthro, clearly not expecting any confrontation, gulped audibly as beads of nervous sweat ran down her neck. She swallowed her fear and took a step forward, poking Pearl in her monumental stomach provoking. \u201cI s-said your piece of g-g-garbage human is lucky to be alive, lardass!\u201d She stuttered angrily, obviously not getting the fact that the person she was antagonising was twice her size. \u201cWhen I get ready to fight, I don\u2019t want to see some filthy monk-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl cut the smaller sized sumo off by effortlessly bucking her hips forwards, forcibly grinding her between her gut and the wall behind her. \u201cG-get the hell off of me, You behemoth bitch!\u201d She gave out a cry of anger and fear as she felt her spine press up against her abdomen from the agonizing pressure. \u201cWho do you think you are?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone who worked up an appetite working out.\u201d Pearl licked her lips without a hint of emotion. \u201cAnd you look like you\u2019ll go down easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait a minute!\u201d The sumo said, suddenly realizing how much mortal danger she was in. \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry, okay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl lifted up the hand that held Marc in an Iron grip and shoved it near her face. The human in question shrank down to avoid the Sumo\u2019s glare and merely waved his hand pathetically. \u201cPearl...what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d The Anthro sumo spat with venom. \u201cThere is no way in HELL that you can make me-Gaah!\u201d Pearl thrusted her gargantuan stomach even harder against her, cracks appearing on the wall behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFIND!\u201d The sumo shouted, fearful for the air in her lungs. Pearl stopped increasing pressure, but kept her fat stomach pinned against her, waiting patiently. The sumo looked down at Marc in the Orca\u2019s hand with a look that could kill. Through gritted teeth, she whispered just loud enough for the two of them to hear. \u201c...m\u2019 sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Pearl eased up her grip on the diminutive, yet still large Anthro and trudged her large body backwards. Everyone In The Gym has their eyes on the Whale, some In fear, some in annoyance, and some in respect. The sumo composed herself and walked out of the room with as much dignity as she could muster after such an embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left, Pearl changed her tune from somber and serious to chipper and happy. \u201cHey, Marc. It looks like a new piece of equipment opened up for us. Wanna make a bet which part of my body you\u2019ll get squished to?\u201d The obese Orca chuckled as she gestured to the weight lifting rack formerly used by the heckling Anthro from before. \u201cIt\u2019s like a running gag with you. What has it been, your third time today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...fourth.\u201d Marc rolled his eyes and gave out a sigh as he relayed the events that happened through the course of his first day with Pearl. \u201cYou know, you didn\u2019t have to do that, Pearl. I\u2019m used to people talking to me like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not.\u201d Pearl huffed as she sat her fat ass down on the weight lifting bench, making it cream under her weight. The last piece of equipment was comically oversized, while the rack was undersized. It was obviously made for someone a little under thirty feet, but Pearl took that fact in stride and made due. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when people trash talk my friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I get that, but\u2026\u201d Marc wanted to shut Pearl down for trying to defend him, knowing that it would lead to nothing but more trouble, but trailed off mid sentence to focus on what she had said. \u201cWait a moment...you said friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...yeah, I said friend.\u201d Pearl shrugged as she set Marc down on the arm rest of the bench. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend, Marc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you only met me this morning.\u201d Marc stuttered, not sure how to proceed with the conversation that was unfolding. \u201cI\u2019m just Your servant. I just make sure that I do whatever it is you ask me to do. It\u2019s nothing special, really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Pearl leaned her blubberly back down on the bench, her head hovering over the side of the undersized exercise equipment. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to talk to me about my family. I didn\u2019t ask you to watch T.V with me. You\u2019re also really patient with my...let\u2019s say \u2018clumsiness\u2019. You told me to let out Dominique because you were looking out for me. Is it that what friends are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc blinked as he watched Pearl grasp on to the metallic rod supported by the bench. He didn\u2019t think about it before, but it was true. He had gone beyond what his contract is required of him, which just entailed to be Obedient to his mistress. \u201cI mean...uh, well\u2026\u201d Marc stammered. \u201cDo you, Uh...wanna be friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you already are. Stop acting crazy and tell me to start lifting iron.\u201d Pearl flashed Marc a toothy grin, one of the only that didn\u2019t scream malicious intent throughout his entire career at the ASL. The human servant gave a small smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours consisted of Pearl using different exercise machines and equipment after she got tired of the one she was on. It was tiring, cumbersome, and just downright exhausting for the two of them; the whale because of all the physical exertion, and the human because, true to his mistress's words, he ended getting squished against her body repeatedly. Most of them were on accident, but Marc swore that Pearl meant to sit on him playfully when she lost balance doing yoga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the rest of the fighters decided to leave, either to get a good night\u2019s sleep for their fight tomorrow, or to raid the cafeteria while it was still open for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Marc exclaimed as Peal finally managed to curl her blobbish toso into a sit-up for the twentieth time, no small feet. \u201cI think we\u2019re good for today,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god, finally!\u201d Pearl exclaimed as she let her fat body fall back to the floor with a heavy thud. There was an audible squelch as she did so, the sweat around her body wet enough to drip onto the ground in puddles. She had worked a lot, perhaps the most she ever had done in her whole time as a Sumo. \u201cNow, I hope you enjoyed being my coach today, because now I\u2019m in charge again, and I say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her arms wobbled as she grabbed onto the metal bars to keep balanced, standing on one foot and the underside of her belly whilst she kept the offending fin uncomfortably pointed up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc begged cruel, cruel fate to finally have some mercy, that it at least <i>not</i> be blood in his eyes when he could only see red, that he\u2019d be lucky to survive being smashed, pounded, and felt all of his new mistress\u2019 weight squared on top of him for the second time in a day day. Amidst the buzzing in his ears, there was the vague mumbles of laughter surrounding them, but there were two other voices that he could make out; Pearl\u2019s, and somebody else\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, uh...you okay there?\u201d Came a raspy, but still prominently feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarc...save...human...foot...\u201d Pearl mouthed out between ragged breaths. \u201cHelp...Marc!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc clenched his eyelids shut, relieving his injured eyes of being forced to interact with light and his blurred surroundings, but upon opening them back up, he flinched under the yellow set of eyes that seemed surprised by the presence of the squashed human under Pearl\u2019s foot, their face\u2019s nose and maw substituted by an ebony-hued beak that faded to match the gray of the surrounding feathers, surrounded by meaty cheeks that were curtained by long, brown hair whose tips grazed along her broad shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCringing slightly at his predicament, the avian sumo daintily pinched him between her fingers and pried him loose, but waylaid him returning to solid ground so she could observe him up close. \u201c...you okay there, squirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if getting crushed beneath his mistress\u2019 foot wasn\u2019t enough to make the scene any more surreal, there was the fact that this other girl\u2019s voice carried a hint of <i>concern</i> for him, not unlike the kind Pearl\u2019d generously been loaning him all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking that and expecting more than one possible answer?\u201d He dryly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roc girl, his mind was eased enough to recognize, tilted her head awkwardly, and without haste set Marc down on Pearl\u2019s waiting hand. Marc was relieved that his body was intact enough that his legs didn\u2019t snap right then and there under his weight, but couldn\u2019t really eat up the experience before Pearl snatched him up and cradled him against his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Marc, I\u2019m so, so, so, so sorry!\u201d She pleaded to him, only pausing to smooch him on the side of the face, his bruised face covering up the blush forming on his cheeks. \u201cI promise, I\u2019ll do the treadmill all you want, now! I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!!!\u201d Marc screeched, startling Pearl into giving him some space. \u201cThat...that\u2019s enough treadmill. Forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his savior give a humored sniff at the claim, Marc and Pearl both turned their glances to see the roc wiping her beak on an arm so bloated that her \u2018wings\u2019 were but decorative feathers dangling on the monstrously swollen limb. Marc observed her in curiosity; being around Pearl so much and used to looking down at everything from her shoulders, it was a strange concept for him to grasp that there existed an anthro but a foot away from being the same size, and no less seismic in sheer mass. Similarly, her hips were but a few hearty meals away from enlarging past her vertical height, to think a bird\u2019s legs were even capable of containing so much blubber, rendering her talons but pudgy digits poking out from the girth of her ankles, and abundant breasts pushing against the chest of her shirt to give a feathery canyon in the collar rising around the hem like dough baking in a pan. An absolute behemoth of a stomach protruded out from her shirt and kissed against the face of Pearl\u2019s as the two tried to converse, but whereas the whale\u2019s was a sloshing, vaguely spherical ocean of lardy adipose that flowed onto the floor like a water balloon filled with gelatin, this girl\u2019s sat on the opposite end of the spectrum with a dense underbelly of solid muscle that rounded the surrounding paunch into a perfectly sculpted orb, adding more or less a massive, feathery wrecking ball to her body fit to absorb any hit or blow she may come across in the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, never thought I\u2019d live to see the day ol\u2019 Blowhole decided to roll onto a treadmill.\u201d She playfully quipped. \u201cTo what do I owe the rare privilege?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Avery.\u201d Pearl answered, a mix of amused and miffed at being referred to by that title. \u201c...well, if it really matters that much to you, I\u2019ll let you know that I\u2019m training for a survival match.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re sayin\u2019 that like it\u2019s your first. What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Dominique.\u201d Marc answered for her, the two looking at him on his perch. \u201cThe two of them\u2019d had a brawl earlier this morning, and needless to say, all of us want the outcome to be totally legal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery nodded at the sentiment, but frowned at the prior thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not gonna be easy, then.\u201d She noted. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna be scared, and not in the bad way. She\u2019s gonna pull all the stops to make sure her fight\u2019s got as high ranks as she can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI realized that, so...\u201d In large, heavy steps, Pearl navigated around to face the treadmill, pressing a few buttons to prepare another jog. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got a lot of speed to pick up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, Avery hit the power switch, preventing her from getting another step into her exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReading a home magazine\u2019s not gonna make you an architect.\u201d Avery offered. \u201cAbout as much of one as runnin\u2019 on a treadmill\u2019ll make you any faster. You want speed? You gotta get some mass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMass?!\u201d Marc parroted, almost offended that Avery would tell Pearl to do such. \u201cHow can she have a problem with mass? She\u2019s bigger than you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s in <i>weight.</i>\u201d Avery corrected. \u201cTotally different thing. Lemme show you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up to Pearl\u2019s side, Avery took the whale\u2019s arm and held it upwards, poking a finger into her elbow with enough depth for the entire digit to be swallowed. \u201cSittin\u2019 o a couch, gainin\u2019 on tv and nachos? <i>Weight.</i> But spenin\u2019 years lifting heavy weights and eatin\u2019 yer own weight in red meats a day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery segued from the description by rolling backwards, instinctually landing on her feet to toss a few shadow punches to her right and give a sharp spin-kick to her right, and ended her display by flexing both arms to them, her biceps surging upwards past the height of her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMass.\u201d She emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl scrutinized Avery for her little display, but rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re done showing off your boxing chops for us, I\u2019ve got three days to train, and I can\u2019t spend \u2018em chatting it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery shot up at that, eyes wide. \u201cThree days? That\u2019s <i>nothin\u2019!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s gonna be less than nothing if I spend any more time laying about.\u201d She remarked, taking Marc off the control panel. \u201cC\u2019mon, Marc, let\u2019s try something else to work out with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery watched Pearl exit the machine with that same look of surprise, maybe a little empathy, if one was <i>really</i> looking close. Seeing the other sumo shake her head before setting off on her own business, Marc jolted up as an idea sprung into his mind, and pried himself loose of Pearl\u2019s hand to scramble up onto her shoulder. \u201cHey, Avery, wait up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery and Pearl both stopped in place, their attention focused on him. \u201cYeah, squirt?\u201d Avery asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you could help us!\u201d He offered. \u201cYou\u2019d like to see Dominique out of the picture as much as we would, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...she\u2019s got a face I wouldn\u2019t mind bein\u2019 mauled.\u201d She answered, scratching her beak\u2019s chin in interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s our chance to get her gone for good! You give Pearl a bit more mass, and we can get her out of your hair forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, kid, but there ain\u2019t a whole lotta people \u2018round the facility who <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> mind seeing Dominique gettin\u2019 chomped down, either, and you don\u2019t see me handin\u2019 <i>everybody</i> my secrets.\u201d Avery countered back, setting her hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn...</i> Marc internally resolved, and turned back to admit defeat...but instead sat down, a wily grin forming on his lips. \u201cEh, probably not a big loss, anyways. Considering it\u2019s one of <i>your</i> exercise routines...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh?\u201d Avery uttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s not waste our time on her, Pearl. She just knows that her exercise routine doesn\u2019t stand a chance against Dominique\u2019s. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed by his servant\u2019s words, Pearl gave him the same smile, then threw her head up to stomp the other way. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Marcus. Let\u2019s not waste our time on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know my routine woulda beat that purple bimbo into <i>grape juice!</i>\u201d Avery snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if words bought victories around here, you\u2019d take first prize for sure.\u201d Marc countered. \u201cBut back here in the real world, I think a few more rounds on the treadmill would do us some good. Let\u2019s go, Pearl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orca girl nodded at the claim, and she raised her head in a snooty demeanor to waltz away from Avery. Marc stared backwards, expecting Avery to be snorting steam at the whale lumbering away with the human who\u2019s mocked her fighting style...but instead found nothing of the sort. When she noticed Marc looking back in surprise, Pearl glanced as well to see Avery observing him with an almost admirable look, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Marc asked. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re girlfriend here survives her wittle fight.\u201d Avery managed to make the cheeks of both Pearl and Marc blush hot red from her joking teases. \u201cBut...I have one condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah\u2026\u201d Pearl rolled her eyes and grunted, irritated. \u201cThere\u2019s always a catch, right? Never can help out of the goodness of your heart, Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl, this is the ASL. Our hearts are clogged with fat from eating our opponents.\u201d Avery quipped coolly.\u201d I could just let you be and you two can get back on that treadmill, although I don\u2019t think he can survive another foot mashing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl grumbled something incoherent and sighed dramatically. \u201cFine...what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour human.\u201d Avery folded her bloated arms over her chest, prompting curious gazes from Marc and Pearl. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a human servant for months now, and the moment one gets freed up, someone else\u2019s name was higher up on the list. Frankly...I\u2019m kinda jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t have him!\u201d Pearl clamped a heavy hand on the shoulder Marc was perched on defensively. \u201cI came THIS close to digesting Dominique because I thought she took him from me, and I\u2019ll digest you, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, now Blowhole, take it easy!\u201d Avery raised her wings up in defense. \u201cLet a girl finish her sentence! All I want is that, providing you win, I get to have your human freind for once a week, every week. Nothing crazy, just some chores, a little training and playtime. I wouldn\u2019t lay a claw on him, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl, calm down!\u201d Marc wiggled his way through Pearl\u2019s flabby fingers and stood on top of her hand. \u201cShe justs wants to help, and I think I can handle being someone else\u2019s servant for one day a week. C\u2019mon Pearl, you need this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...but\u2026\u201d Pearl looked down at Marc, and than back at Avery, tapping her talons on the tiled floor. \u201cPearl, it\u2019s me. You know I\u2019m not like Dominique. I just want one day a week, that\u2019s all. Or...you can keep him, and risk losing it all to that indigo cunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...okay.\u201d Pearl nodded, downcast but determined. \u201cYou can have him. Just...what do you have in mind?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grey feathered Roc gave an appreciative grin and turned her back on the duo, motioning for the two of them to follow her out if the gym. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna get one me in here, blowhole. Let\u2019s head Back to my room, I\u2019ll give you something that\u2019ll boost you right up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl and Marc followed Avery back to her quarters, a stark contrast to the morbidly obese orca whale\u2019s. It looked like they had traded the gym for another gym, complete with all the essential training equipment for a sumo like her to stay in shape. \u201cSo what, is this what you do all day? Lift weights and punch bags and...move around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the idea of walking to your fridge for a meat lovers pizza is nauseating, Pearl, but this is what you gotta do to stay ahead of the competition.\u201d Avery shrugged. \u201cYou can use my room to train for the next three days. I could use a sparring partner, and you won\u2019t have to worry about finding stuff your size to use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah...thanks Avery.\u201d Pearl gave the Roc a soft smile, only to be interrupted by the sound of her stomach churning. \u201cUh, not to be an ungracious guest, but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more!\u201d Avery grinned with a hint of micheif in her voice. \u201cI got just the thing to shut up that belly o\u2019 yours, and get you into shape.\u201d She walked over to the side of her bed and grabbed a couple of protein packets from the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically, these things aren\u2019t legal in the ASL, and I\u2019m only really supposed to use it in case of emergencies.\u201d Avery grabbed a bottle of milk from her mini fridge and poured it into an Anthro sized cup. \u201cBut I think a Survival Match on three days notice constitutes as one, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtein shakes?\u201d Marc saw Avery rip open the packets and put brownish powder into the creamy milk. \u201cYou mean Pearl is gonna get as tough as you...by drinking Protein Shakes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are SPECIAL shakes, Marco.\u201d Avery winked and grabbed the cup in her claw. \u201cIt\u2019s like a miracle drug for us Sumos. It fills you up, tastes good, and gives you enough energy to take a sprint to the moon and back.\u201d She hands the cup to Pearl, who clasped the glass with her sweaty, rubbery palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, they're is just a tiny downside. What you\u2019re holding right now has enough calories to keep Siberia warn for a month. Muscle comes from working fat into mass, and this is gonna get you FAT.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, look at me. I don\u2019t think I need any help getting even more fat.\u201d Pearl shook her heavy hips around to emphasize, making the blobby whale jiggle all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl, what is the one thing in the whole word you want to do besides eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're\u2019s your problem.\u201d Avery pushed the shake to Pearl\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re too lethargic. You got winded from just walking here. Dominique can ram down a walk without breaking a sweat. Drink this, and you\u2019ll be golden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl liked skeptical, but shrugged her shoulders anyway, never one to turn down food. She chugged the protein shake in one gulp and let out an unladylike belch, waiting for the promised energy to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Avery, it looks like your miracle drug was a miracle du-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a look of shock slashed over Pearl\u2019s face as she let go of The now empty cup, the glass shattering to the floor. She gave another burp, shorter but deeper. She clasped a hand around her blunted muzzle and another around her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery?!\u201d Marc winded as he looked on at his master doubling over in pain. \u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax.\u201d Avery waved off Marc\u2019s concerns. \u201cSame thing happened to me the first time. Trust me Pearly, in a few minutes all that pain gonna turn into pure power flushing through your veins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl wanted to say something along the lines of equating the pain she was feeling to the concept of giving birth, all that came out was a haggard moan as the Protein Shake runs it\u2019s course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd than, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight gain was barley even noticeable at first, the sliver of flab so inconsequential to the several laters already they're. But what was a sliver became something so much more. Marc stared in shock as Pearl\u2019s massively fat body got even fatter, while Avery smiled, impressed with her handiwork. The Orca\u2019s balloon like proportions became mountainous as her belly made contact with the Roc\u2019s floor and rose up like a pastry in the oven. Her limbs blew up so much that if they weren\u2019t lengthening as well, she would be stuck in a permanent t-pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc found that even he wasent safe from his master\u2019s blubber as she continued to grow. His special perch near Pear\u2019s collarbone soon was invaded my An ever encroaching tide of cheek chub, one of the more pleasant ways his body had been smothered today. By the end of it all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I feel...gooood~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Pearl gets greedy and wants more Protein Shakes, NOW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Pearl exercises to burn that fat into muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Avery drinks a shake too, wanting to join in on the fun.</span></div></div>",

Seeing no friendly twinkle in the demanding whale\u2019s eyes, Avery knew not to reason and poured a glass of milk several times that of what Pearl\u2019d consumed before, dumping in five or so packets of the protein shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery handed over the shake, and Pearl reared her head back and opened up her maw, dumping in its calorie-rich contents and allowing it to flow down intoher belly without any sign of muscle use in her throat. That same look of disappointment overtook her, eager for that filling sensation to enrapture her stomach and mute out that constant hunger of hers, but this time around, it came with a sound akin to a croaking frog being magnified a thousand times louder, a conjoined belch and moan rising up past her neck and out her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps back, with Marc waiting in anticipation on her shoulder, Avery watched as Pearl\u2019s belly puffed out with a little extra distance, forcing its way outwards through her finned fingers, then rapidly billowed out through her hands like a deployed parachute, its grip on the floor growing several times in size as what was once a grandiose waterfall of flesh fully expanded into a monolithic sphere of whale blubber whose shape dominated that of her figure, the rest of her body shrinking behind it whilst her arms and legs fattened up to the point that they barely even registered as limbs anymore, fat feet sinking into the oversized calves whilst her hands lost the ability to touch her own hips by the excessive paunch wrapped around her elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with a confused mess of awe, shock and fear that Marc watched Pearl grow with. He could tell that, whilst the orca girl was becoming obscenely round beyond what\u2019d be possible to move with, she was stretching upwards a few feet as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chins swaddled around Pearls jaw thickened, then gave birth to a thriving family of fleshy rolls, and with a voice weighed down by several more tons around her neck, Pearl\u2019s lips parted to give an earthy hum of pleasure. \u201cMore...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Pearl, sure!\u201d Avery spoke in a much more peppy tone than before, pouring up another glass of milk. This one contained twice the last, and was filled with roughly ten packets of her Doctor Good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooookay, Avery, I think Pearl\u2019s got enough of a kick start to go on...\u201d Marc uneasily butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, it\u2019s okay! Anything for a good friend~\u201d Avery responded in an unusually motherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl\u2019s tongue eagerly rolled out as Avery came up with the third shak, having to carry it in both hands. Pearl stooped down and reached her arms out as far as she could, but met several feet of belly that kept them from reaching past where its ivory white face lay. Avery brought the shake up as high as she could reach, struggling to get it in Pearl\u2019s grip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...oops!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and Avery tipped the glass back and caught the shake in her opened beak, cleanly chugging it all down with the expertise of a professional eater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Pearl snapped, her face barely visible enough for them to see her discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Pearl, but it\u2019s gonna be an \u2018emergency,\u2019 too, if I\u2019m gonna be to small to protect myself when you\u2019re gettin\u2019 as hungry as you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gave an empty swallow, an uneased look crossing his face that Avery caught a glance at, earning a snicker from her, her smirk forming a dimple in her cheeks as they began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like with Pearl, that unsettling croaking noise returns, accompanied by a meager growth spurt in Avery\u2019s tummy, but that small extra poundage rapidly multiplies as much of the muscular definition residing in her form rapidly disappears. Her body\u2019s fat surges outwards, her stomach\u2019s volume skyrocketing like an inflating hot air balloon and cascading across an abundant distance of carpeting in front of her, the bare feathers along its widening face smushing up against Pearl\u2019s glossy whalefat. Marc couldn\u2019t really see much past her body, but a sudden loss of his footing clued him in that Avery was putting on some height as well, probably eight or nine feet, accompanied by the surface of her well-built shoulders becoming noticeably more mushy, arms awkwardly cracking up as their ability to flex inward was hampered by their newfound growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill miffed, but rather impressed herself, Pearl tipped her gaze upwards to see Avery smirking down at her proudly, much fatter, and more softer-looking, but now the bigger fighter of the two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her blood was pumping through her veins at a restless pace, and a sense of energy floored her senses as her body demanded stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery...where the hell did you get that stuff?!\u201d Pearl inspected her arms as she flexed them over her head. They were so bloated in fat that they looked like nuns to the passing eye, but she could move them as if they weighed nothing. Marc looked on from his Perch on Avery\u2019s shoulder incredulously at his mistress. She could easily classify as more blob than Orca at this point, but apparently the Roc wasn\u2019t exaggerating. \u201cI feel...alive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smiled and patted the Orca\u2019s massive belly proudly. \u201cAnything for a friend, Pearly. Now come on, that high isn\u2019t gonna last forever. It\u2019s time we introduce you to some real exercise.\u201d The Roc wiggles her way past Pearl and guided her to stand on a padded mat. \u201cLet\u2019s start off easy with some squats. Stop until your legs feel sore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl was unsure of herself at first, but when she first bent down and rose up with more than relative ease, her confidence skyrocketed. \u201cWow, this so easy! So, I just keep going until I get tired?\u201d The Orca continued to squat up and down on Avery\u2019s mat without breaking a sweat, despite her usual dislike of movement in general and hundreds of pounds in fat clogging her joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Just keep going at it like that, and you\u2019ll be up to take Dominique down in no time!\u201d Avery decided that she was going to have to work off some of her extra fat off as well. She was about to lay down on her bench press to lift some weights when she remembered about the little human atop her shoulder. \u201cHey Pearl...do you mind if I cash in my Marc time a bit early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr...I guess so.\u201d Pearl agreed a little uneasily. \u201cJust play nice, alright? I squished him so many times already and I wouldn't put him through much more.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I only fight rough~\u201d Avery winked at Pearl and carefully grabbed Marc off of his perch on her shoulder. The human gulped audibly as he tried to hide his discomfort. He knew the two meant well, but the way The Orca and the Roc talked about him made him feel like a toy. A glorified toy that they like and don\u2019t want to break, but a toy nonetheless. \u201cAlright Marc, here\u2019s the rules\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat her bloated rear end down on the bench press, the reinforced steel giving just the slightest of creaks. She lowered Marc down on top of the dome of her feathered belly, and the human instantly sank waist deep into the thick as water surface. She chuckled a little at the sight. \u201cThink of it as Hide and Go Seek. I\u2019m gonna hide you, and you\u2019ll have to seek a way out.\u201d The grey feathered Roc effortlessly pushed Marc across her stomach towards her and lifted up her monumental bosom. The two gelatinous spheres wobbled and jiggled over his form ominously. \u201cLet\u2019s make this more interesting. If you can make it out under than minutes, I\u2019ll give you an award. If not, we get to play another game. Ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...s-sure Avery.\u201d Marc stuttered. Of course, he had little to no say in the matter, but it was nice to be polite and give Avery his approval anyways. Avery gave her little human friend once last wink before she slowly engulfed his world in darkness. The roc gently smothered the human underneath her cleavage, cautious that the weight wouldn't be suffocating. Thankfully, most of the pressure pushing down on Marc\u2019s body was canceled out by the fat acting as a sort of buffer. Her feathered breasts were certainly not the worst place to be in, and...\u201cIs that..cinnamon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like it? It\u2019s my personal body wash~\u201d Avery giggled and leaned back on the bench press, eager to start lifting some weights. \u201cYou got ten minutes, little guy. Don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc instantly got the message and began to shimmy his body out of the canyon of Avery\u2019s cleavage. The two walls of flesh didn't make his trip easy for him, constantly filling in any place he makes with his arms. It was also pitch black, so he did not necessary have a sense of direction to go off of. It was hard to tell if he was following the linear line between the two boobs or he was walking straight into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter than minutes of playing this game, Avery decided that now was a good time to stop her weightlifting. She brought up a towel to her forehead and wiped off a bit of sweat. She eyed Pearl on the opposite side of her, still squatting away like there was no tomorrow without any strain on her face. If anything, the Orca looks a tad bored! The Roc gave out a deep belly laugh and tried to think of ways to incorporate some entertainment into the workouts. Remembering her little game of hide and go seek, she looked down at her breasts to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She frowned, hoping that she wouldn\u2019t have to explain to Pearl him asphyxiating on her watch, but she lurched in surprise at a single hand thrusting itself out from the abyss oh her bosom, another one taking suit soon after to help part the flabby, feathery flesh apart for Marc\u2019s head to poke out and suck in some fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTIME!!!\u201d He used his first breath to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery brought up her watch, clicking the timer in at ten minutes and fifty-one seconds. She frowned, pondering whether or not to just give him the win anyway, but she decided to hold true on her own promise and shrugged pityingly. \u201cSorry, Marc. A time limit\u2019s a time limit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn defeat, Marc sank back into Avery\u2019s cinnamon-scented feathers with an exasperated look. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, c\u2019mon, you\u2019ve got a chance to redeem yourself!\u201d Avery insisted, her wings coming down so she could pinch him from her collar and place him atop her belly, standing him up against the strain of her workout shirt. \u201cThis time I\u2019ll only set you up for a minute. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause geez, how bad of things could an anthro squeeze in a minute for a human?\u201d Marc asked, experience having taught him how agonizing <i>half</i> as much could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot worse than you\u2019d assume, bud. C\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and what other realm of \u2018fun\u2019 has ever existed for a human in a place like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, after hours of being treated as casually as a fellow fighter, Marc could see that glimmer of mischief in Avery\u2019s eyes that was familiar with every other anthro about to have fun with their human servant, a smirk etched on her beak as she leaned in closer. \u201cThe living bra!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Pearl had finished doing perhaps more squats in the span of ten minutes than she had footsteps in the span of a year, lardy legs flexing and stretching beneath her gargantuan bulk, craning its immensity up and down with none of the usual hindrance from her weight. When getting out of bed this morning once seemed like some torturous task, she had the fire in her legs to run a hundred marathons to practice for touring the world immediately after. Not even the hunger that made itself a parasite in her belly bothered her; she wanted to leap about, experiment all the realms of possibilities she now possessed without the excuse of her legs being too heavy and ass being too comfy in the couch to allow her to sit around, wasting her life away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree hundred and one! Three hundred and two! Three hundred and three!\u201d She counted aloud, almost unable to speak fast enough to keep up with the autonomous movements of her legs. \u201cThree-oh four, three-oh five, three-oh six...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything turned red, and she pulled Avery\u2019s shirt from over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, but too energized to pause in her workout, Pearl jogged in place as she watched Avery haul her behemothic rump off the bench, her feathery, lard-laden backside facing her as she fidgeted with the cups of her bra. When her wings drooped down to her hips, Avery turned around enough for pearl to see the wiry grin spread along her beak, eyes focused on the very crux of where her breasts touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging there as Marc, dismayed as he held the severed ends of her bra\u2019s cups together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing the living bra game with him?\u201d Pearl questioned. \u201cI told you I wanted you to be careful with him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Pearl, I\u2019m only gonna have him go for a minute.\u201d Avery retorted, setting the timer on her watch. \u201cThat starts now, Marc. Hang in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until now, the Living Bra was some sort of a legend for Marc; he knew all to well it existed, but many of the staff who\u2019d mentioned it to him would only end up shuddering or even bawling before they could get to the real meaty bits of the experience. Many nights in Marc\u2019s bed had been sent long awake at the gruesome theories his mind used to fill the empty details of their stories, cherishing having the night alone before finding out whether the next morning would be the one where he\u2019d be shoved into the hideous truths, but being strapped to Avery\u2019s bust, feeling the plushness of her bosom sitting against his back, Marc rolled his eyes at all the sleepless nights he\u2019d forced on himself. If anything, save for a bit of pain in his wrists, he was starting to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he could hear the sound of a glass being lifted from the table at Avery\u2019s side. Pulling his head as far back as it could go, he watched her upside-down past the hills of her overinflated mammaries  as her finger swabbed the remaining shake from in side and sucked it all down. A grunt of pleasure rattled in her throat as she felt that addictive warmth in her belly before her entirety swelled,  a few extra feet of stomach pushing outwards from below Marc\u2019s feet, more carpet being absorbed beneath its underside. His ears were then washed by the torrent of a rushing waterfall rumbling at either side of him, followed with the pressure on his arms increasing painfully as her already immense breasts ballooned, each churning with enough milk for each to feed an entire town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tendons ached as their ability to keep his arms hooked to his body were tested, but halfway through, he was still going strong. Thirty four seconds, then thirty three, thirty two, thirty one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his arms were stretched even further amongst the sound of Avery opening her mouth to suck in air. Her chest expanded enough for Pearl to see a large pink circle spread from the confines of her bra, accented with taut bulges poking from the centers of either cup that made Marc\u2019s attempts to keep her clothed enough of a feat for him to bear his teeth, growling in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, his torture would only last a few more seconds, a lot less than some of the humiliation he\u2019d endured at so many other mistresses before. Twenty...nineteen...eighteen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Avery shut her beak tight and forced the air out of her lungs. Her cheeks broadened up, but couldn\u2019t contain the sheer amount her lungs could contain, forcing the air in the only place it could...thus putting Avery\u2019s favorite \u201cprivilege\u201d of being a bird to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping a hand beneath either teat, Avery shivered at the sudden tenderness that plagued her upper body, soon to be visible by the naked eye as her milk-filled chest became more tense, then expanded with air, down to the same creaking sound a balloon made when being blown up. Cleavage rose up to engulf her chin, but so much air was left in her lungs yet, and Avery forced every muscle in her chest to constrict and squeezed her aching lungs even further, breasts pulsating again beforce billowing outwards, pushing her beak upwards so she could only see the ceiling and the peaks of the two grossly oversized masses plaguing her torso. Her nipples grew too large to be clothed and popped loose from their confines, reducing Marc to clinging on for what were essentially a group of ropes ties to his arms, pulling him apart like he were in a torture device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother squeeze in her lungs, and Avery\u2019s breasts spread across her stomach to become her body\u2019s widest feature, then inflated <i>again</i> to the point where she was becoming so ridiculously top-heavy that it seemed she\u2019d topple over with the slightest misstep, and Pearl sat and watched the entire time, too caught in a mix of awe and worry to know how to respond until Marc reminded them all of his predicament by an long, high-pitched scream that burned his throat, adding another whole layer of agony to enjoy in Avery\u2019s little \u201cgame...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He started the morning getting assigned to Pearl, the obese Orca Whale that just wants to eat, eat, and eat some more. And while she was undoubtedly the best mistress he has had to serve in his time at the ASL, it didn\u2019t make up for having to spend the rest of the morning being forcibly crushed in her ass, intentional or not. Immediately afterward, he foolishly roped her into picking a survival match with Dominique, got crushed under her sweaty sole and got squashed like a bug trying to train her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Seconds Left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, he felt like he was about to split into two halves from the sheer amount of pressure his body was subjugated to. His body ached all over, from the current torment he was under as well as residual tiredness from everything else. It was times like this Marc wished he could travel back in time to beat his past self to a pulp for not reading that stupid contract. He could have gotten a job flipping burgers, or sweeping floors to go to college, instead of being a literal human floormat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Second Left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt like his arms were about to pop out from their sockets. At the back of his head, he remembered that this whole \u2018game\u2019 was supposed to last a minute. It felt like hours had passed, he no longer had a proper concept of time to go off of. Everything seemed to blur, how much longer would he have to put up with this? He could try letting go of the straps, but he didn't think his hands would respond at this point, too numb to register anything other than pain. Marc was so caught up in his internal monologue that he didn\u2019t notice the timer on Avery\u2019s watch go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Pearl\u2019s relief as her little human\u2019s torture was over with, Avery let out a long, drawn-out exhale of breath as her breasts rapidly deflated, the pressure on Marc\u2019s wrists decreasing substantially. At first, his mind didn't register his tormentor\u2019s feathers forcibly severe his grip on the straps of her bra, letting him free fall right into her open palm. When he did, he began taking in several shallow breaths he didn\u2019t know. He had made it. He was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alive\u2026\u201d Marc wheezed as he was brought onto the surface of the same, cinnamon-scented breasts that he had wiggled through and fought to contain. \u201c...yay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re alive, silly~\u201d Avery let out an amused chuckle as Marc basked in his victory over her as much as he could in his current state. \u201cDo you really think I would put you through something I didn't think you could handle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat scream told a different story,\u201d Pearl stated bluntly, taking a small break from her jog in place to stare daggers at the grey toned Roc. Avery, in response, gave her Orca friend a smile, but her heart wasn't into it. It was the kind of smile one would make after they catch a falling glass vase just inches away from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I went a little overboard\u2026\u201d Avery ran a feather down Marc\u2019s back as he lay face down on her right breast, his body shivering from the sudden alleviation of stress her touch provided. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to say it wasn't fun. And guess what, Marc? You won. Now, name your award, and I\u2019ll make it come true~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc closed his eyes as he sank into the plush breast flesh of the Roc. His body was sore, tired, and overall just done with everything the day had given him. Maybe if he wasn't in such a state, he would have asked for something else as a reward for all he had been put through. But right then and there, there was just one thing his body cried out for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you...just keep doing that back rub thing?\u201d His voice was low and soft, but Avery still heard Marc nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She smirked playfully, pressing her index feather at the base of Marc\u2019s tailbone. \u201cLike...this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Pop\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc\u2019s body almost instantly went jello as relief coursed through his veins. A goofy smile formed on his mug as Avery kept running her pudgy, yet agile feelers up and down his body, putting pressure everywhere he needed it the most. The happy grin on his face made Pearl almost as relieved as him. After what seemed like the longest day, he fell asleep, nestled in the feathers and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Marc opened his eyes to the blinding fluorescent light of Avery\u2019s gym slash quarters. He felt better, much better, more than he had ever felt since he signed up for the ASL. His eyes adjusted to the light, and he noticed he had been placed on a side table to rest while the two anthros continued with their workout. \u201cHow long was I out for,?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA couple of hours, actually.\u201d Marc craned his head to look up at the face of his mistress, Pearl, already in the process of grabbing him from his perch on the table. \u201cAvery wanted to \u2018play\u2019 with you a bit more, but you looked so cozy snoozing like that, so she backed off.\u201d The human took in the orca\u2019s body as he let himself be grasped by her. While still a blob by every meaning of the word, some of the adipose seems to have shrunk down. Her features seemed more defined, even if barely underneath all her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you...just staring at me the whole time I was sleeping?\u201d Marc asked as Pearl put him back on his usual spot on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Pearl smiled innocently as she gave her little human a playful cheek smoosh. \u201cYou\u2019re really cute when you sleep, ya\u2019 know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...thank you?\u201d Marc didn't know exactly how to respond to something like that. He felt his cheeks warm up as a blush came to his face, a fact that Pearl wasn't oblivious to. \u201cSo, what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

Dominique, still struggling inside of the Orca\u2019s stomach, pounded her meaty fists against the stomach wall and tried to cast some dark magical spells, but her movements were to frantic from fear to amount to anything than a internal belly massage. The hippo\u2019s captor turned her attention to her bulging gut and smiled, running a fat hand over the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...now why would I want to go and do that, Marc?\u201d Pearl patted her stomach, much to Dominique\u2019s agony and her human\u2019s confusion. It took a LOT of food to just make sure that the Orca to feel sated, but Dominique had given her so, so much more than that. \u201c You know, I can\u2019t remember the last time I ever felt...full. Wow, it feels so weird to say that. She makes me feel content, not hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...but\u2026\u201d Marc struggled to find the words to describe the situation that was unfolding before him. His mind was still recovering from the torment his body had been accidentally put through. Thebiggest thing he hated about the ASL was how it didn\u2019t even try to cover up it\u2019s perverted hedonism, how people are taught that it\u2019s okay to eat someone alive and whole. \u201cIt\u2019s murder! She didn\u2019t do anything wrong and you\u2019re going to kill her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t do anything wrong?\u201d Pearl echoed with an amused look in her eyes. When Marc folded his arms over his chest and narrowed his face, her smile faded a little and she became a tad serious. \u201cOh sweetie, that\u2019s real cute and all, but you can\u2019t be serious. I\u2019m sure you heard the rumors surrounding this bitch, and I cross my heart that they're all true. You think what I\u2019m doing to her is cruel, well she\u2019s done stuff that makes this look like a slap on the wrist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but...she didn\u2019t do anything to you or me, and\u2026\u201d Marc sat down on Pearl\u2019s cushiony breast flab as he tried to think of a good answer. Ending a life is a permanent thing. There's no way to say \"I'm sorry\", or to make up for it later. Dominique may not be the best person, but for a lot of people it\u2019s just not a line that they wouldn\u2019t cross. \u201cIt just doesn't sit well with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? You know she hates your kind, you know she wouldn\u2019t think twice about eating you.\u201d Pearl reasoned, a little confused that Marc was trying to defend her meal. \u201cShe May have not have hurt you, but she would have, and she hurt a whole crap load of others before you. Didn\u2019t you hear what she would do if I lost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...foam under her foot.\u201d Marc confessed, shuddering as he pictured the grotesque scene in his head. If Pearl let Dominique out now, they're was no way in heaven or hell that she\u2019ll be grateful that a human is the source of her salvation. If anything, that would make her even more angry than she is now, flopping around in gastric juices. \u201cOkay, so maybe she deserved what came to her, can you even move like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can! I didn\u2019t get all the way to the gold league...ugh...without gaining...ooph\u2026some muscle!\u201d Pearl tried to prove to Marc that she was more than strong enough to haul a Dominique filled belly, but to her Surprise her slippery flesh just slid across the hardwood floor without an ounce of friction. \u201cOh...maybe not. Eh, doesn't matter! She\u2019ll be whale blubber soon enough, than I can spend all day with you training!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...how long is will that take?\u201d Marc grimaced as he looked past the horizon of Pearl\u2019s clevage, Dominique unrelenting in her desperate escape as she kicked and screamed into Orca flesh. All he wanted to do right now was take a long bath to get rid of Pearl\u2019s pungent smell and take a nap to rest his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl thumped her stomach to keep it\u2019s noisy prey quiet and gave out a deep yawn as tiredness settled in. \u201cI dunno. A prey as big as her\u2026I guess around a couple hours. I got a knack for putting on weight and being always hungry, so maybe even less. I think I\u2019m gonna crash here for a while, catch some Zs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, In Dominique\u2019s room? Is it that a little...disrespectful? Ah, forget it, she would have taken your room if she had the chance.\u201d Marc relents his moral internal debate, allowing himself to feel comfortable with the sadist hippo\u2019s demise. \u201cCould you at least let me down? My arms feel like they\u2019ll pop out if they're sockets at any moment, and I need to take a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me help you with that.\u201d Pearl offers with a warn grin. Marc didn\u2019t understand what she meant untill after his mistress grabbed him with a free hand and hovered him over her slightly agape mouth. Before he could even let out a single shriek if terror, he was safely deposited on her tongue. She swished his bruised body around her mouth, washing away the foul oder of her sweat and replaced it with the more or less better smell of her saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're you go, clean as a whistle!\u201d Pearl exclaimed as she set Marc back down on her breasts, soaked in spit but otherwise devoid of pungent stench. \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna rest my eyes. See you in the morning or whatever. And Marc?...I\u2019m...really glad that your okay. Thanks for putting up with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour...welcome, Pearl.\u201d Marc said as he observed his new master slowly close her eyes. Before long she was snoring, blowing warm air over his body as he rested on her plush tit flab. Today has been...unexpected for him. He had been squished into a couch, sat and farted on, and just now got a saliva shower. Considering his previous experiences with anthros, however, it wasent that out of the blue. What was out of the blue was the level of sincerity for his well being coming from his master. Humans are basically treated as less than pets, but Pearl\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt nice to be treated like a person, that\u2019s all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc leaned back into Pearl\u2019s orbs and observed her snore, hot breath blowing over him as she breathed in and out, her heavy chest rising and falling like water. It would have been nice if she had set him down on the floor, but being stuck on top of her boobs was better than her mouth or ass. It was relaxing enough to fall asleep on, too. He closed his eyes and soon he joined his mistress in the land of milk and cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when the two wake up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When at last a squirm came from his laid form, Marc\u2019s first feeling of the morning came as instant regret when he rose up to part from his infinitely soft bed, the one that had gifted him his first night of truly wondrous sleep in months. Too wondrous, as were all that he could remember happening the last 24 hours. Being bunked with Pearl, being smothered with kindness by the insatiable sea mammal, one such nonchalant act of compassion to slay the archenemy of every human in the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was yet to celebrate. So much chaos had passed yesterday and with such speed that they felt like some crazy dream, but with every blink as he stared at the ceiling, a little more doubt bled out. He wasn\u2019t waking up from Dominique\u2019s former room and into his own. She wasn\u2019t going to leap from the bushes to laugh him in the face, nor Pearl and the rest of the fighters who were in on some cruel prank. No matter how many times he rubbed his eyes, no anvils were dropped on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gone. It\u2019d finally happened. Whatever way it could be defined, be spiritually, physically, positively, absolutely, undeniably, and <i>reliably,</i> it\u2019d finally happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...she\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDOMINIQUE\u2019S DEAD!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body shot up with his volume, bouncing about with tears and laughter of manic joy as he flapped about in some mad, unrehearsed dance whose flailing toured the edge between an actual dance and a mentally unsound man\u2019s episode of hilarity. He and no other man would never see her name on the slip. Never would his nightmares of being squashed by her come true. He was free! Him and every human to suffer under her name, they were all free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>snore</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was by his very savior that his little party saw an end, her sleeping lungs lurching so to make him loose his footing from atop her breast. A girly bleat later, his center of gravity was thrown off and he tumbled and bounced down towards her face, his head and limbs repeatedly making contact without shattered against her rubbery surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs many definitions of \u2018heavy\u2019 that Pearl was, apparently a sleeper wasn\u2019t one of them. All it took to stir her was Marc landing face-down on her lowest chin to make her stir, giving a twist of her neck before her eyes parted and narrowed on her miniature intruder. With the sight of him came a smile, her pudgy finger affectionately scratching his back. \u201cMornin\u2019, Marc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOD, PEARL, THANK YOU!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onslaught of flattery that Marc threw back at her greeting was more startling to Pearl than endearing, witnessing him hugging and kissing the flab of her neck like it were his last moment of human contact. \u201cOh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You\u2019ve got a life debt out of me, Pearl, I...I can\u2019t say how much this means to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you...?\u201d <i>Oh, right...Dominique.</i> \u201c...ah, c\u2019mon, buddy, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s the first I ate around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well...it\u2019s the first to me.\u201d Marc retorted. \u201cIf I\u2019d ever lost a mistress, it\u2019d never been done for <i>me</i>, and the fact that it took you less than a day...well, you\u2019re wrong. It means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Dominique tasted no more different than any of the nicer fighters she\u2019d eaten, Pearl couldn\u2019t bring herself to say so at the tiny amount of affection that was all the thanks that Marc could give his boss. She grinned warmly and wrapped an arm around her own breast to massage him back. \u201cAw...No prob, Marc.\u201d She doted on him, but waking up enough to feel discomfort, she rocked around on a tight knot in her back \u201cBut listen, my back\u2019s gonna snap in half if I lay here any longer. You wanna get off, or you wanna have a ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly? After that night\u2019s sleep, I\u2019m off solid ground for life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome again, then.\u201d She retorted, smirking, but gave a stiff intake of air as she plated both palms on the ground, dreading the usual routine of rolling up onto her feet. \u201cAlright, time for the next twenty minutes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a single push, twenty minutes went by in the span of five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrca and human alike screamed as instead of Pearl\u2019s usual ordeal of hauling her big ol\u2019 bulk up for the daily grind, the entire planet spun ninety degrees that only the two of them were immune, the foot of Pearl\u2019s stomach hurtling upon the floor with a tectonic roar that rattled the facility all the way down to the damn bronze barracks. Much of the jiggle that her blubber provided absorbed most of the massive shift in speed, but Marc had none of the mental or physical training that an anthro used to avoid the shocks and realities of moving their bulks at such speed. He was catapulted from Pearl\u2019s chest, and she watched him sail away in slow motion, paddling and screaming for a solid surface that wouldn\u2019t be met splattering from the momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and seeing him float away at the speed of flowing molasses, Pearl plucked him in real time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his small body contacting her fins, time was kick-started back to normal speed, both panting heavily and sobered of any sleep for the next few days. Tenderly putting him in a stable spot on her shoulder, Pearl observed herself; <i>really</i> observed herself with the clarity she couldn\u2019t from just waking up. Her stomach was fatter, yes, but stroking her moreso inflated middle gave yield to a surface different than her usual armory of paunch. Heavier it may have been, beneath all that lard was a hive of abdominal muscle that gave even the new excess of calories even more distance that spread outwards in every direction ahead, sculpting the normally waterfall-like sack of blubber into a spheric mass of seismic proportions, its mere presence in the room fusing the carpet into a wide, circular basin on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking her arms up and down its curvature, Pearl realized the extra ease in movement and gave her arm a test as well, and was amazed by similar results; several times the limb\u2019s former weight, and yet twice as easy to lift, her bicep fattening so as to display a backlog of incredible strength to the flab-blanketed limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh...\u201d Avery poked her arm to verify that the musculature inside was not only real, but casting a faint purple glow beneath her slippery sheen. She tested her other arm, then cautiously looked ahead before taking a few sampling steps, discovering that despite still possessing a waddle, it was now only brought on by being so much more wide. If the strength she could feel in her balloon-y legs was trustworthy, she could probably put in a jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...I\u2019m no wizard, but maybe it\u2019s from Dominique\u2019s magic?\u201d Marc offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl herself lacked the expertise to argue back. Dominique may have been strong, but not that strong to assume she had that much muscle to digest. Whatever its source may be, though, came the question of where it would lead her. She\u2019d barely been able to walk with her weight under tow before, now she had weight and speed. Where would it take her? What new territories could she explore beyond the lunchline, or the common trudge it\u2019d take to make it to her fridge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl scoffed, smiling that there could even <i>be</i> a question.</span></div></div>",

That left just a set of cushions standing on four legs, but hey! A couch was still a couch, and Pearl settled for good enough as she leaned back and switched on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc and Pearl Liesurely watched the first channel available, an ASL news report.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Silver Division quarters of the Anthro Sumo League was always busy in the mornings. Still, today, thanks to an individual killer whale, it was downright hectic with the amount of activity coursing through its halls. The many ambitious fighters of the ASL pushed past one another with their human servants, unnervingly chipper in the aftermath of Dominique\u2019s confirmed demise, in the bustling excitement, the air palpable with confusion, frustration, and fear. Everyone was on edge, and everyone had a tense tone of voice when they talked because while the public outside the stadium was kept in the unknown, for now, the news was first broken to them. A petty officer, a particular obese looking lobster, from the consulate for the Confederation of the Ocean traveled up from the city to lazily read the management Pearl\u2019s rights as a dual-citizen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constitution stated that the government protected their predatorial expressionism, even when on the surface. Combined with the fact that she was apart of the Gold Division, notorious for being able to get away with the most rule-breaking, not only were there not going to be any repercussions, Marlene seemed pretty relaxed about it all. Humans and anthros alike whispered rumors under their breath about how the penguin's eyes twinkled at the news the tired-looking lobster gave as if she appreciated the notion of an actual challenge. And there was another person who seemed ecstatic to Pearl\u2019s victory, someone who was given a respectful berth even in all the busyness. Indrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive moth calmly walked down the halls of the Silver Division, much to the surprise of her colleagues. The humans' restrained jubilation over the death of one of the most infamous sadists in the ASL was abruptly put to an end as they were reminded of another, even more, terrifying presence in their midst. Her black fur seemed to suck away the light as she shifted her wrecking ball of a stomach across the linoleum tiled floor, a crooked smile on her face like a jack-o-lantern\u2019s as she breathed in the air around her. She strode purposefully across the tiles, with a set destination in mind as she regrettable restrained herself from indulging in the pure, unadulterated panic that was thickening around her. She was eager to pay a visit to an old friend now taking up residence in a rival\u2019s apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door of Dominique\u2019s, really, now Pearl\u2019s room as she waited for the orca inside to respond. Pearl huffed out a sigh as she heaved herself up from the pitiful remains of the sadist hippopotamus\u2019 couch, the springs that managed to survive under her obscene weight letting out loud sighs of relief. She was careful not to send Marc flying off into the air this time, going slow as she could with all the new energy had in her system thanks to her meal\u2019s magical properties. Still, even then, Pearl surprised herself with just how utterly easy it was to move her legs up and down now. She took a moment to run a bloated fin across her monumentally sized sphere of a stomach, the surface gently bobbing up and down with monochromatic blubber from the tentative pokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her human, staring down at all that cresting blubber was like gazing into an ocean, almost relaxing. The orca caught her little buddy looking down her extra-obese frame and smiled before walking towards the door. The room shook and quivered slightly with each foot she stomped down onto the floor, her weight combined with the heft she absorbed from Dominique, making her a walking earthquake epicenter. Despite being the most physically able she had been in years, maybe even her entire life, Pearl still carried herself slothfully, moving through the room at the same pace Marc would take a light stroll if he were at her size. She opened the door after wiggling her huge gut of the way of the doorknob and let out a soft gasp of surprise as she was greeted by Indrid's imposing, only slightly smaller form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more surprising came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Indy! Long-time no see, girl!\" Marc struggled to keep his jaw from falling from his head as he stared flummoxed at his master, actually brightening up and smiling as she laid her eyes on the gothic moth, the most terror-inducing fighter in the whole ASL. This being the human's first time seeing the ill-fabled insect, as he moved his attention over to her own eyes, like two drops of blood in a puddle of crude oil that was her skull, even then he knew that there was something off about her. He was expecting Indrid to be this sort of eldritch being of pure hunger. Still, with the aura of malice that surrounded her, she was not only matching Pearl's happy, warm smile, but she was wrapping her equally as fat-laden arms around the orca's form in an embrace. \"Marc, this is my friend, Indrid! We go a ways back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human's mind metaphorically shattered with this new load of information heaped onto his fragile form. He involuntarily let out a surprised meep that rang out around the Moth's antenna. Indrid, the reclusive shut-in sorcerer who climbed the ranks of the ASL by inducing raw terror in her enemies...has a friend? And of people, Pearl is that friend?! \"...nice to meet you.\" He offered just loud enough for her to hear him, his voice suddenly sounding far away even to him. \"Um...you're not what I was expecting you to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm, it's nice to meet you too, Marcus Waldreignewizch Youngblood...\" Indrid rolled the human's full name off her tongue without a hint of mispronunciation, sending a shiver of fear down the back of his spine, much to her delight. However, something was missing that spark of terror from reaching its full potency. It could have been because she said it while she was giving his master's extended stomach and overly-long hug, groping and feeling the bouncing fat through her chitlin. It could have been her eyes, still a deeper shade then his blood and bright like a dulled stoplight, carrying a sense of emotion that wasn't hunger, the only feeling she was rumored to get from others. \"Don't you worry, I'm everything you're expecting me to be and more. But I'm not here to get a snack. I'm here to congratulate your fatass of a mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way that Indrid insulted Pearl was didn't have the bitterness or the frustration in her voice for it to be real. It was the sort of playful, teasing banter best friends would only be able to say to one another. In a twisted sense of irony, all of this behavior was only freaking out the human, when she wasn't even trying to be scary. \"Yeah, I'm such a pig. I wish I were as SMALL and THIN as you,\u201d said Pearl with a pretend sigh, though she exaggeratedly raised both of her arms around Ingrid's back to return the friendly embrace, the fat moth letting out pleased coos as her ever so slightly smaller stomach mashed up with Pearl's. It was so surreal for the human to see someone who lived off of the fear of others act like an average person. \"But's what do you mean to congratulate me? What, did you have it out for Dominique?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm...\" Indrid nodded, thoroughly engrossed with the cuddle the two titans were sharing. Blushing a little bit, Pearl let go of her grip on the moth so she could have an actual conversation with her. Only then did the black obsidian insect end the hug, albeit reluctantly. \"She had it coming to her, the hateful thing. If you weren't going to do, I would have...but you're the only person I'm okay with stealing my prey~.\" She winked and invited herself into the hippo's former apartment, Pearl moving aside to give the insect some walking space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to be clear, Indy.\" Pearl got serious for a moment. \"Marc's off-limits, okay? You can do all that magical voodoo stuff with everyone else, but the last person who threatened him ended up as orca food.\" The human that Pearl was referring to allowed himself a smile as he heard his master protect him like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid raised her eyebrows at this, nodding her head but still a little shocked looking. \"Wait...the fight started because of your human?\" She blinked her blood-red orbs slowly. \"I mean, I got it, he's your human, not mine, but why would-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine if Dominique told you that Tiny Tim was shit.\" Pearl cut her off. \"Marc's my Tiny Tim.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence after that. A deep, tentative silence as Indrid's antenna twitched straight up. After what felt like an eternity, she took a deep breath and let out whatever rage was building up in her system for that imaginary scenario. \"...got it.\" Her left eye twitched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I don't mean to be rude here, but...\" Marc suddenly joined in on the conversation, earning the attention of the two gigantic titans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: \"Who's Tiny Tim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: \"Could we get breakfast? I think it's, like, ten or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: \"How do you two know each other?</span></div></div>",

Technically, it has been three weeks since I\u2019ve eaten anything solid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and once again, food wins.\u201d Pearl affirmed with a triumphant nod. As with many of her courses in life, Pearl allowed her stomach to lead her to the door with Marc carried in tow and Indrid a few steps behind...but her very navigator put the three to a staggering halt at the doorway, wood bending against her abdomen as the monochromatic orb met the now-puny width of the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...Indy?\u201d Pearl asked, blushing. \u201cMind helpin\u2019 out a little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid\u2019s eyes widened, but with a flitter of her eyelashes came up behind her friend, hands promptly open to aid. \u201cCertainly, old friend...\u201d The moth rolled forward atop her own belly slightly, enough that her head could sit in the fatty crevice down Pearl\u2019s spine. Snaking her arms around Pearl\u2019s waistband and into the doorframe, her throat rattled with something akin to the ghastly moan of a j-horror flick\u2019s demon, but to Marc, it sounded like some sort of mothy equivalent to a purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing inward, and casting a spell so her own insectoid bulk was similarly compressed, the two titanesses\u2019 bodily masses were pushed upwards. Not enough to keep from being marginally wider than the door, but just enough that their bodies had just enough give that they could snugly fit through. Once outside, both blew out happy sighs as Indrid let go, spring back into their properly globular forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh...Thanks, Indy.\u201d Pearl exhaled, satisfied that her last and only obstacle to the cafeteria was surpassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure,\u201d Indrid teased, and Marc could tell from the subtle hop in her step that it was far from just an expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMORE!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple breakfast omelette was all it took to curb Marc\u2019s need to eat, but had he witnessed first the hunger cure-all that was Pearl eating in public, he ouldn\u2019t have wasted their time and money. Put on display was the sort of whale Marc first expected of Pearl: eyes carved from wood that didn\u2019t differentiate between living creatures and French fries, her booming demands ejecting from her mouth not out of anger or hunger, but just just untamable biological <i>need</i> that all the food in the cafeteria was losing grip on containing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust Pearl and Indrid entering the cafeteria was enough to drive the herds out. Indrid had mastered the art of scaring off crowds with her presence over years of effort, but even the more stupid members of the facility smart enough to see the danger looking over when Pearl was hungry and owned a license to cannibalize the faculty as she pleased. That just left a rather fat coyote chef to brave against Pearl\u2019s hunger with frenzy in her movements, serving the insatiable whale with trays by her very claw tips as she no doubt regretted all the taste-testing that made her so pleasantly round. When trying to conventionally feed her fell ass over tit, she resorted to just piling the often uncooked rations of the kitchen around the whale and let her eat with no relent, but from the outside, Pearl gave no outward Indication that anything that traversed path the mouth physically anymore, or that whatever had plummeted into her cavernous stomach disintegrated into the void before it could feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid herself wasn\u2019t above watching the poor waitress\u2019 plight. She only had her own sampling of the uprooted cafeteria\u2019s remains...that is, if \u2018sampling\u2019 didn\u2019t end after ten platefuls of pasta and eighteen glasses of orange soda, but the mothwoman\u2019s appetite was for a sensation that solid food or even fear couldn\u2019t supply; she drew crosshairs with her eyes that directed right at the core of Pearl\u2019s stomach, studying the black and white sphere with an intensity that could help her write a twenty-page thesis to the fleshy monolith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc observed Indrid in turn, shivering at the sensation of being able to sit near Indrid and not be scared of her...okay, that was a lie. He was <i>terrified</i>, but that terror was mitigated by a subliminal knowledge that he were safe. Like a character in some horror movie, he could watch her in terror, but continue doing so with the knowledge that she would not hurt him, and she in turn let him watch. With her so often secluded in the darkness of her apartment, not more than a few had an opportunity to see what Indrid was like under the glare of a fluorescent, illuminating the patches of fur and skin that would disappear on nightfall. He could see her hair, an unkempt-yet-organized capping with split bangs hanging over her eyes, those cut-ruby irises capped by thick lashes and eyelids shaded a tint or two darker than the rest of her head, the skull of which gave her a nearly blank face. Absent of a nose or any other orifices to breath through but her mouth, her hissing breaths only adding to the ferocity of her staredown with Pearl. Feral, yes. Depraved, certainly. But Indrid sitting at the table had a naked air to her demure, shed of her fearsome bravado and allowing the animal inside to sit in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the many souls of those whose lives she\u2019d ended would forgive him for saying, there was an odd sort of an unkempt beauty that the mothwoman gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mammoth insect was probably not so forgiving, however. Marc remembered all to late that she could\u2019ve been reading his thoughts, and Indrid\u2019s eyes had already flickered to Marc in the way that let him know they were directed to him. This was his chance: some answers to the biggest mysteries of the ASL\u2019s most enigmatic fighter were at his disposal, a luxury denied to even the most pampered fighters served to a mere human. Where did Indrid come from? How and where she obtained her powers? Hell, what fear tasted like? With so many to ask, which was the first one to politely break the ice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen most would take their time, thinking on that took him only five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Indrid...\u201d He chose his words carefully. \u201cWhen you say \u2018Tiny Tim,\u2019 Do you mean the guy whose song was in that one Spongebob episode? <i>That</i> Tiny Tim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrow rose, antennae perked in interest. \u201cWhat\u2019s a \u2018Spongebob?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarc?\u201d Came the owner of a fat fin that poked his side, and Marc saw Pearl much closer to the orca he knew and loved, dismay in her eyes. \u201cI know you\u2019re just bein\u2019 curious, but if curiosity killed the cat, askin\u2019 Indrid about Tiny Tim is peekin\u2019 in the shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Pearl needs to use the can, and trusts Indrid to be alone with Marc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: It\u2019s Indrid who needs to use the bathroom, and while she\u2019s gone, a bunch of Dominique\u2019s friends show up and confront Pearl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Indrid acts a bit too eager for Pearl to eat...and to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Roles reversed: it\u2019s Pearl who wants Indrid to be a bit bigger...<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: Free choice.</span></div></div>",

Granted, she continued with her feast the moment her mouth wasn't occupied with doting words, but her attention was focused solely on her servant perched atop her right shoulder, even as she downed ten pounds worth of uncooked pork into her gullet. The human could see his reflection in those vast, if somewhat beady, eyes, the weight of the undivided attention almost suffocating on his form. \"R-right, sorry...\" He nodded his head firmly with a slight stutter, earning an amused giggle, or the moth equivalent of one, from Indrid. \"So...what's safe to talk about, then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept to Pearl's lips as she rolled her eyes to Indrid. \"Well, you could share how it felt when I accidentally sat on you back when we first met. The way she's been ogling me for the last hour and a half, you'd think she might be a little jealous of 'ya~.\" The leviathan of an orca gave the slightly less colossal moth a wink as she playfully pumped the same she had been staring at into her own. The insectoid Titaness let out a surprised gasp as she felt the monochromatic flesh crest over her fur in waves of fat, forced to shove her chitinous hands deep into the chub to keep balance. \"Sorry about that again, but you did make that ratty old couch a lot comfier with you down there. If you're up to it, you can always ask if you want more 'accidents' happening around with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, pearl managed to block out Marc's immediate protest to such a suggestion, wanting to mitigate the number of times he was going to be squished underneath his mistress's form in the future. Though, even if she did hear him, he knew deep down that it was an inevitability when his job specified he stay at the whale's beck and call at all times, being a cushion was just an unfortunate reality for the humans at the ASL facility. All of Pearl's attention now focused on Indrid as the moth stopped struggling to push the stomach from her, and opted to rest her chin on the blubbery dome with a gentle croon. A quick wiggle back and forth formed a wonderfully comfortable indent in Pearl's belly, her chin coming to rest on the whale's chest as she sighed in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm prepared to admit the possibility of being jealous, I suppose,\" Indrid mumbled, finally working up the energy to answer her old friend. Marc was beginning to feel like something of a third wheel to the scene unfolding before him, the polite thing to do was quietly scuffle away, but on Pearl's shoulder, there was nowhere to go. \"But let me try something here...I want to show you something your human can't...\" The insect was slurring now, finding it harder and harder to keep up the energy to talk. She giggled happily as a blush appeared on Pearl's bloated cheeks, the rosy hue only making her look cuter to the smitten bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, she nodded and did as Indrid asked, turning herself away from the wall she was sitting against and slowly sprawling out onto her back. Marc, to prevent an untimely demise as the floor rapidly came close to his person, gripped hard onto the whale's neck flab to stay on her body. Indrid hugged herself around Pearl's middle to keep balance, crawling further up until her belly was fully splayed beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Indrid's chitinous hands pressed in, rubbing in slow, deep strokes into the squishy chub on either side of her body. Pearl's breathing slowly grew huskier, deep huffs making more warm breath wash over the moth as she kept rubbing. Up and down, side to side, reaching around the curve of the orca's belly and pressing in from both sides, Indrid loved and doted over as much of the whale belly as she could reach. Both her hands were vanishing into the doughy surface with a firm push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got you there, Marc, that feels so good...\" Pearl rumbled in bliss as she lazily reached for some of the assorted foodstuffs that were sprawled around her by the plump wolf cook, her tongue lolling out the side of her mouth as she kept panting loudly. Indrid took the opportunity to flash the human a prideful look, to which he rolled his eyes. Abruptly, she dropped all of herself on the ever-gluttonous leviathan, digging her face in the valley of her cleavage without shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl's belly seemed to settle into a slow rhythm beneath her, the gurgling and steady, wet sloshing continually working away. Indrid's own body was relaxing as well, the moth feeling like she was floating above a waterbed, relaxing deeply against her friend. She barely twitched as the orca's fins draped around her back, holding her close and wiggling into a more comfortable position. They eventually began breathing in unison, Indrid's body rising and falling with each deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two of them could lose control of their senses from the comfort that they provided each other...\" Uh...excuse me?\" And then the moment was ruined. Indrid rose her head from the crook of Pearl's soft bosom to glare red murder at whoever had the gall to interrupt them. It was the lone wolf cook, the nervous canine sweating bullets as Pearl rose to join the moth in the staring, though she looked less angry and more hungry then the smaller of the giants. \"We're...uh, o-out of food, in the kitchen. You ate it all. P-p-please leave.\" The wolf announced nervously after thirty seconds of Pearl eying her up and down to see if she warranted a sizeable snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Pearl said once she'd allowed Indrid to climb down her stomach back onto the floor of the cafeteria. Marc, sensing something was about to happen, released his grip on the orca's neck rolls and fell a short way to the floor as well, just in time for Pearl to rise back to her feet. \"You can't be done... I'm still hungry, and I need more\u2026\" She began to frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I can't help it, you have a v-very healthy appetite.\" The wold gave a small, anxious chuckle. \"You are free to come back in an hour if you'd like, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not enough!\" The floor underneath Pearl splintered into a thousand shards as the same stomach that Indrid had been cuddling slammed down into it with the speed of a meteor. \"More!\" Without warning, Pearl's fin shot out and clapped around the cook's neck, prompting her to croak noiselessly in protest as she was lifted effortlessly into the air and dangled over the whale's salivating maw. The wolf flailed desperately, beating her fists in a futile attempt to loosen the whale's grasp; even biting the fin that held her with everything she could muster did nothing to prevent her slow, helpless descent between her jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave one last look to Indrid, the only person that could have been capable of saving her, who was unfortunately predisposed with the massive influx of fear she was providing her. Despite kicking and squirming, the cook couldn't stop her legs from being caught and slurped into Pearl's mouth, the muscular tongue working to hurry her along a one-way journey into her belly. The same eyes that looked over her human with concern not too long ago now stared hungrily at her new meal, devoid of any emotion, only hunger. It was clear that if Pearl could have swallowed the cook any faster, she would have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressing, slick confines of Pearl's throat tugged on her lower body; the poor wolf could feel her legs had already slipped down into her esophagus, providing enough of a grip that the rest of her could be pulled down with alarmingly little effort. With a loud, echoing slurp, she was gulped further down Pearl's throat. The whale made short work of her puny morsel, and the cook disappeared between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph, that was good,\" Pearl remarked bluntly and jovially as she slapped her stomach heartily, the great organ inside gurgling with renewed vigor as it made short work of its next influx of food. And just like that, the Pearl that Marc knew and loved was back in charge, going from one polar extreme to another as if it was nothing. Noticing that her human was gone, the orca looked around in worry before spying him on the floor. \"Jesus, Marc, you scared me! What are you doing down there for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he's looking for another accident~\" Indrid smiled as she bent down to the floor to grab the human in question. Marc saw his life flash before his eyes as one of the most feared fighters in the ASL casually picked him up from the ground like he was a grain of dust. His mind was automatically assuming that he was going to share the same fate as that cook, with the only difference being that he was going to cook in a moth's belly instead of his own mistress's. \"Here you go~.\" And then he was safely deposited right back atop Pearl's right shoulder as if nothing had happened. He blinked, slowly looking over his shoulder to see Indrid struggling to hold back laughter. To her, the human had to be her easiest source of fear yet. She didn't even have to do anything to scare him to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Pearl wants Marc to feel more comfortable around Indrid. Suddenly, she needs to be somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Indrid continues with rubbing Pear's stomach, feeding off the fear of the cook inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Pearl's still hungry. Cuddles later, food now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Marc somehow gets in another 'accident'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: You know, Rebel Wilson and Karen Gillan would be perfect for Pearl and Indrid~</span></div></div>",

Could you please spit her up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be worried about her,\u201d Indrid offered. \u201cI could read her thoughts. She was abusive to her boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cActually...no, Marc\u2019s right!\u201d She confessed, taking Marc up off her shoulder so she could place him back in the very hands he thought Indrid would use to shove him into her mouth. \u201cHere, Indrid, how about you take Marc and I go spit her up in the bathroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Pearl?

Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid and Marc alike threw back incredulous looks, but with a pat on Indrid\u2019s shoulder and a quick kiss on Marc\u2019s cheek, Pearl left her blushing friends behind and marched onward for a toilet to spit up in, the severe bloating of her gargantuan middle putting her waddle to even more of some sort of clumsy, side-to-side rolling that somehow managed her along the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy,\u201d Indrid emitted when Pearl was out of earshot. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly serious about you and I becoming friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d Marc gave the weakest nod. This was it. In the hands of the deaths to a third of every human in the facility, the two out of sight and out of mind from the only boundary between him and getting eaten by another fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, easy, you don\u2019t have to panic\u201d She insisted, reading him with a barely noticeable amount of annoyance. \u201cI promised Pearl I wouldn\u2019t hurt you, and what little ones I have, I don\u2019t break promises with friends.\u201d She rolled him not one palm, bringing him closer to her face. \u201cIf it means anything to you, you have my word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Anything\u2019 to him being borderline nonexistent, but with what little emotions Indrid could display, they were absent of any quirks to imply she was lying. She could be a damn good liar, Marc knew absolutely despite truly knowing her for but two hours, but it wasn\u2019t like she had to if she wanted an excuse to eat him, and time continued passing without her being submerged in the darkness of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She\u2019s right. Pearl is serious.</i> He surmised in silence. Then came the test. He may have already made physical contact, but only as a floor for him to lay on. Sitting upright, body facing the red-eyed titaness, Marc\u2019s arm extended and stretched ahead with his palm open, head turned aside with his eyes shut as the act of allowing himself to Indrid\u2019s touch pained the remaining fight-or-flight nerves in his brains begging him to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were ten...twenty...thirty full seconds that passed with his arm shivering in the air under its own weight, and wondering why she was taking so long, he poked an eye open to observe Indrid with a rather quirk-eyed look, confused by his pose. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...offering my palm for you to nuzzle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarifying only made her straight-up bamboozled, a pause following that put his discomfort to a full minute, but finally, an act that she herself was scared to do, Indrid brought him in so his palm could lay on the center of her face, his fingers nestling into the coarse, yet soft black fur. A bridging of worlds that lasted for ten seconds in an absolute emptiness of friendship and love, her head gladly pulling away when Marc finally released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease never ask that of me again.\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long, drawing exhale came from Indrid\u2019s mouth, and her face settled on...</span></div></div>",

The moth opted to keep her skull close to the human in her hand without making physical contact, but eye contact was okay. Those two rubies in her noggin that made up her eyeballs focused themselves solely on Marc's own like she was trying to stare into his soul. \"You know...I was stunned when Pearl told me she ate that hippo because she thought she had taken you. I mean, I've been friends with her for as long as I can remember, and I always thought her general attitude towards you humans was indifference. Too small to be food, too small to be seen, too small to care about what happens to them. But I guess I judged her wrong.\" Suddenly, Marc felt something warm and soft creep up on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over his shoulder, the human saw Indrid's chubby fingers gently curling up to press up against his form, not enough to grip his body, but enough to make him stagger on his feet. \"Or...maybe I'm not. Maybe there's just something about you out of all the little hairless monkeys in the world that makes her want to listen to what you have to say, make time for your needs, and ask what you want.\" Marc finally noticed, after prying his eyes away from the moth's gaze, that said moth was smiling. It was the kind of smile someone would make after they had a particularly satisfying meal, but they still wanted just a little more, which made Marc a little unnerved combined with the near-constant attention Indrid was giving him. \"From far away, you look just like all the other insignificant specks, but up close... you're a little cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute?\" Marc echoed with an air of amusement laced with bewilderment in his voice. He was not sheltered from the reality that some anthros had a human fetish, the same way humans had an anthro fetish, but he never took the time to understand the former. He couldn't put it into words correctly, but he would admit, if only to himself, that there were some aspects about anthros that he liked more than his fellow species, regardless of if they were his size or walking mountains of lard like those at the ASL. But the other way around just confused him. \"What exactly is so 'cute' about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid let a wave of warm air escape past her lips as she closed her eyes to contemplate marc's question, the human bearing the full front of it as it washed over his form. He regretted asking her in the first place; he did not think she would take the time to think of a response. \"Well, for one reason, it's because you're incredibly small, at least to someone as big as me. Small things, by their size, tend to pose little danger. One of the critical features that make a thing cute is the absence of feeling threatened.\" Marc blinked, taken a little aback by what Indrid had to say. The human couldn't tell if she was purposely trying to tease him, but he certainly felt like he was being played with as warm blood rose to his cheeks. Was she...flirting with him?! \"Flimsy tiny furniture and other miniature collectibles may seem cute because we know that they could break unless we handle them delicately. I like that you force me to act carefully around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right, but...that doesn't answer my q-question.\" Marc tried to stand still on his two feet without staggering and tried to sound confident without stuttering, failing miserably in both attempts. Now Indrid's eyes drooped down in amusement of all things, making the red blush around his cheeks grow more pronounced. \"You've eaten a lot, and I mean A LOT of other humans before me, and I'm assuming they were all just as small and helpless and breakable as me. What's so 'charming' about me besides that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so If I was excluding how tiny you are, that adorable little stammer in your voice when you get nervous like right now, that rosy hue to your cheeks and your perfectly tussled up hair...\" The human wished he didn't ask so many questions. He wanted to know how to shut up and not drag himself into further humiliation and embarrassment. \"...I don't know; I guess you just have a cutesy nature about you. Pearl seems to like having you around, which means your entertaining enough to keep her attention off food, no small task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well...\" Marc was at a loss to what to say in this situation. There was no doubting it now, Indrid, the massive moth woman who fed off the fear of her victims and was responsible for the demise of countless members of his species, was enthralled in his person. By some miracle of a higher power, he managed to entice this monstrous maiden by acting endearingly to her, something he wasn't even aware he was doing. What does someone possibly say in this scenario? \"...I think you're cute, too, if I'm honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH MY GOD YOU DON'T SAY THAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late; the words have already tumbled out from his mouth. Indrid retreated her head back to its original position, letting five seconds of uninterrupted silence pass by before she let out a giggle, or at least her throaty equivalent of one. And that one laugh was all it took to let the rest of the roaring laughter she was keeping in erupt into the air. At first, she tries covering her mouth, but then she decides to use her free hand to wrap it around her stomach as she gasps for air. \"I'm... I'm sorry, Marc.\" She attempts to calm down. \"I didn't mean to laugh. It's just...that was adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're adorable,\" Marc corrects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease stop talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid looked down at the little human in her open palm like it was the only good thing in the whole world, save Pearl, of course. If she might have been faking being attracted to Marc before, she wasn't faking it now. </span></div></div>",

Has bright green eyes and pointed ears with notch marks on them as well as scars all over her body and blue glowing veins glowing on her cheeks. For clothing, wears little more than a bright blue unitard and a tiara made from skeletons.<br>\r\nDescription: Katherine is an abnormally large lioness who has never lost a single fight since she joined the ASL. Katherine is very antisocial and little is known about her. Instead of standing on her two hind legs, the massive lioness walks on all fours. There\u2019s a rumor that Katherine was originally a human who was experimented on in order to find a way to turn humans into anthers. However, she becomes violent when asked about her past and is implied to have suffered severe trauma. Her skin is very durable and she possesses a powerful roar that can create sonic booms. Her claws are unbreakable and able to cut through solid steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pepper</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Tapir<br>\r\nHeight: 28\u2019 2\u201d<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant, obese and bottom heavy golden yellow-skinned tapir woman resembling a cross between a Brazilian tapir and a baku of Japanese mythology. She has sharp teeth and long blood red hair worn in a ponytail. For clothing, she wears a red shirt, gray jacket and a white mawashi.<br>\r\nDescription: Pepper is a rather lazy tapir who spends most of her time sleeping when she isn\u2019t fighting. While she isn\u2019t particularly hostile when it comes to humans, she has been known to grab and devour humans without provocation when hungry enough. She also hates to be woken up and the last human who made that mistake suffered a fate too horrifying to disguise. Pepper fights mainly using her large rear as a bludgeon, her claws as blades and her supernatural ability to siphon her opponent\u2019s life energy through her snout.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a 26' 4\" high and 5 ton wolf who was undefeated. You remember one match where she managed to devour a tapir who was twice her size. Of course, this undefeated streak made Crumpet really arrogant and she had something of a god complex. She expected her human slaves to outright worship her. Marc gave a gulp because he knew that this was going to be absolute hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marc entered the room, he looked in horror and even screamed at the huge golden-furred, blonde and bespectacled wolf, standing absolutely huge in front of him. But that wasn't the scariest part. Crumpet hadn't noticed Marc just yet, because from the looks of it, she was too busy swallowing her previous human slave. Marc could hear muffled screaming as a human arm was reaching out of the wolf giantess's mouth, trying to escape. It availed that poor sap not because Crumpet nonchalantly pushed the arm back into her mouth with her index finger. Marc then saw a human-sized bulge travel down the 5 ton wolf woman's throat and disappear into her stomach. The next thing Marc new, bumps appeared on the wolf's stomach in the shape of human hands and a face screaming in anguish. Crumpet just smiled evilly and tapped and shook her stomach, as if to hurry the digestion process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's face turned pale white just as Crumpet released an Earth-shattering belch. Marc saw exactly how massive she was. Her stomach looked big enough to contain 20 humans while her ass was even bigger and almost reached her neck. She was resting on a Roman-style that was too small to hold all that wolf booty. The wolf giantess picked her teeth before she looked down and finally noticed Marc. She gave an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Crumpet. \"You're the new little bug they assigned to the unbeatable Crumpet are you? Good. It just so happens I'm in need of one of you humans.\" \"M-My name is M-Mark, Ms. Crumpet, ma'am.\" Crumpet erupted in hysterical laughter and her belly fat jiggled as if she heard a hilarious joke. \"Name?\" asked the enormous wolf. \"How very cute. Oh no, no. You don't get it. As long as you're serving me, your only name is \"Slave\". That's all humans are.\" Marc was about to lose his temper on that remark. \"Now, see hear...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Crumpet's face looked huge in front of Marc and she gave a vicious grin, showing her monstrous teeth. \"It's amazing how adorable humans are when they think they can defy their superiors. Starting to day, you are to refer to me as Goddess Crumpet. You will worship me and obey every order. Remember, little man, slaves who disrespect their goddess become a feast for their goddess. Understand?\" Marc would've spoken out against this insufferable fatass canine, but he realized if he did, he'd be dog food. \"Yes, Crumpet?\" \"What's that?\" asked the wolf smirking as she twitches her ear. Marc let out a sigh. \"Yes, Goddess Crumpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrumpet let out a noblewoman's laugh as she looked down at the tiny human. \"That's more like it. Now for your first chore...\"</span></div></div>",

It easily towered over the young man as two large, furry moons, jiggling with their owner's movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc shook his head to clear away his shock. He didn't even wait for another command. In his experience, most fighters like Crumpet expected him to show initiative in executing their demands. So, it was due course when he started to massage Crumpet's right butt cheek using both his arm to make large sweeping motions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least she keeps her fur clean...</i> Marc thought, trying to keep his own spirit up. It was true, Crumpet's coat was shiny and smooth and his fingers ran through it like liquid gold.

Charla is not only tall but incredibly obese. DD (for her size) breasts, massive gut, and huge thighs. However, she retains a good deal of muscle under her fat. Charla is intelligent, clever and charming. She uses all of this to get into others' heads both in and out the ring. Charla is also interested in bulking up even more and desires Survival and Free-for-All matches so that she can devour other fighters to get bigger quicker. In fact, she purposely aims for larger anthros for this reasons. She is famous for a Free-for-All where she devour all of her opponents. As for humans, Charla is interested in them. Well, she is interested in the males as she is looking for a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ring, she uses her weight to root herself and her long appendages to fend off her opponents and her size to intimidate them. Due to her immense bulk, she is not fast but makes up for it with quick reflexes.

The door was as big as a skyscraper and there were paintings of dinosaur skeletons on it. \"Charla?\" asked Marc in horror. \"I've been assigned to <i>Charla</i>!? Marc felt his chest because he knew about Charla all too well. She was one of the biggest and most powerful anthros in the Anthro Sumo League.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharla wasn't an ordinary anthro but a ginormous dinosaur anthro that stood 42' 9\", making her tower over virtually everyone. She wasn't a normal dinosaur either. She was a chimeric life form that combined traits of dozens of dinosaurs. Some traits stood out more than others. She had the feet of a deinonychus, the jaw of an allosaurus, three-fingered long clawed hands like a therizinosaurus and the long neck of an Amphicoelias. She also had long red feathery hair. Marc wondered if she was the result of mixed breeding or a genetically engineered creature that went horribly right. She was also very obese but with muscles underneath that dinosaur fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc knocked on the door and it opened. Inside, the room was dark. \"That's not a good sign,\" Marc said to himself. \"I really hope that Charla isn't hungry. Marc had every reason to be afraid because Charla was obsessed with devouring large opponents in a free-for-all and getting bigger and fatter than she already was. Marc remembered in particular one match where Charla fought against 9 opponents as big as she was (at the time) and all nine of them ended up in her stomach and made her the enormous dinosaur blob she is today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc walked forward into the darkness and heard a roaring sound before he looked back and the door closed behind him. \"Hello!? Is anybody here?\" \"Right this way, handsome,\" said a seductive contralto voice. \"I've been waiting for you to show up.\" Marc looked up to see a pair of glowing yellow eyes and three sharp and long pink fingernails waving at him. \"Huh?\" asked Marc. Wait? Was Charla flirting with him. Then Marc remembered that Charla had a fetish for human men for some reason and was looking for a tiny boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marc could think anymore on the situation, those same sharp claws grabbed him by the shirt and lifted him up into the air as he grunted. It was there the lights turned on and he saw that he was in front of a large smiling dinosaur's face. Charla looked down at her new tiny servant and opened her jaws. \"You must be Marc. My, aren't you a cutie?\" Marc looked and saw that Charla was stark naked and sitting down on a massive throne made out of dinosaur bones. She was staring down at Marc in lust. \"I hope you like big girls,\" said the dinosaur giantess. \"Because I just love little men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gave a nervous smile right before Charla dropped him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc took a deep breath as he trudged towards the ASL's cafeteria. He'd been given his new assignment and he could already tell that this was going to be an ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I haven't even met her yet and I don't like this</i>,' He thought to himself. Every other fighter he'd been given to had always wanted to meet in their private quarters, usually so they could lay out their little rules. The fact that is new mistress had broken that pattern had not help to put his mind at ease. It left him feeling anxious as his mind pondered just what she could be up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was so deep in thought that he hadn't even noticed that he had entered through the giant gates of the cafeteria or paid any attention to the various eating fighters that were dwelling inside. In fact, he hadn't snapped out of his brooding until a large white object came into his peripheral vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped walking and looked at the object. Actually, it wasn't a single object at all, it was a huge pile of dishes! Marc really shouldn't haven't been surprised, given just how big and fat all the fighters were. But what could be considered shocking was the huge gut that was making it's way out from behind said dishes. Marc felt his eyes widened as the gut maneuvered around the mountain of dishes. As the monstrous belly left the cover of the dishes, Marc was able to make out the figure better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro had leaning back, which had angled her belly to obscure the rest of her while the dished had hidden everything else. She was bigger than the average anthro Marc had seen at the ASL but it was really the proportions that were off. Her belly was so large that it rubbed up against ground as she walked and hidden most of her legs from view. From what Marc could make of her legs was that they were thickly built with bulging muscle. As his gaze traveled upwards he also found that her chest was large with a deep valley of cleavage and that her arms matched her legs in muscle definition. Marc swore her biceps could've stopped bullets! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze finally landed on her face which was round but well defined with plump lips that where set in a large smile as she gazed down at him. Marc found that more than a little unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're my new servant, huh?\" She asked. \"Marc, I believe your name was?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc nodded, a tad surprised that she'd knew his name. \"Yeah, and that would make you Val?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, quick on the uptake.\" Val mocked, grinning all the while. Marc had to restrain a growl. \"But that's good, I guess because I'm really going to need you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal took several more steps towards Marc, until she was almost right on top of him. To his credit, Marc didn't move but did feel a trickle of sweat role down his face as Val's monstrous stomach stood only a few centimeters away from his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya see,\" Val started to say as she loomed of Marc. \"Good help hard to find and I'm hoping that you'll last longer than the last several servants I had. Consider this your first taste of life with me, ok? See, I just got done with a huge feast and I really need you to...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cindy tends to be cocky, but isn't stupid enough to become arrogant and she isn't afraid to back down from a fight, though she's smart enough to know when not to fight someone, as she carries an air of calculated confidence. In this same air, also carries her gas, as she's not scared of letting it rip, giving her a tomboy attitude. Add in the fact that she has an issue with her gas makes her avoidable as possible. Currently she's looking for a romantic partner who can withstand her gas and has a sister named Maya, who works as a maid in an apartment building. She came to ASL when she was younger and reached silver rank before using the money she won to go to college. A few years after getting her diploma and becoming a psychologist, she had a successful business before it dried up and she was almost sent to the poor house before returning to ASL, where she reached gold rank.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When around humans, she doesn't have a problem with them and in fact, finds them cute. The same couldn't be said from them. Pushing aside her disgusting gas, smelly enough to wilt the strongest of plants at its weakest, she's quite clumsy and a bit airheaded around them. There has been situations where the servants working for her has been crushed by her, mostly under her smelly bum and one servant unfortunately was stuck in her ass crack for at least a month after Cindy sat on him on her couch, until a fighter pointed it out during their match. Cindy was clearly embarrassed by this and gave a hellish torture to her opponent for exposing it publicly (it couldn't be called a fight afterwards). The skunk girl apologized profusely, but the human quickly resigned his position, just like his predecessors. When mentioned about eating humans or anthros in general, Cindy becomes slightly nervous (much as surprise to anyone about her nervousness), as she has never eaten anyone before, but she is curious about it is willing to eat a human and have that person get out of her whole unscathed. Anthros are a different story, as she says she can't manage her jaws like that. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fighting style</b>: She fights to quickly take down her opponent and as hard as she can. While it's just street fighting style she used and still uses, Cindy's amazing agility and brute strength makes her a powerful fighter, especially when she kicks or uses her ass. Back when she was younger, she was quite fast and very powerful, but after many years of not fighting, people suggest she may of lost some of it. The exact opposite occurred and her stats rose much higher than before, using people's underestimating her as an advantage for a while. Because of her previous occupation, she researches her target, finding out their habits, behaviour and other things of the like, before fighting her opponent and uses it to psychologically damage them. She'll also push smelly SBDs out of her, to distract and weaken her fellow fighters on the ring. If pushed to a corner, she will spray, blinding them and destroy their sense of smell before destroying them as a last resort.</span></div></div>",

There it is!\" Marc muttered to himself, looking for the room for his new mistress.<br>\r\nWalking up to the huge door, he could only hope that he lucked out on a nice girl and takes a deep breath before knocking, only to immediately regret it. Realizing there was gross, stale smell, Marc became horrified when he finds out it's coming from the door in front of him. Holding his breath, he quickly knocks on it and waits for the owner to come, hopefully soon. Thankfully, to whichever god was listening, the door opened and Marc was taken back by the woman in front of him. The anthro was a red haired skunkette, making sense of the smell around her room and was wearing a white stained shirt and some pinks undies, or that what you think. The really impressive thing about her the massive width of her hips, as it was wider than the doorframe and anybody could tell she had an immersive badonkadonk. Even the thunder thighs appeared to have problems holding her fat backside up and looking at the rest of her, she was a bit chubby, but looked quite lovely.<br>\r\n\"If you're done checking me out, how about you come in?\" She said, leaning on the doorframe, a smirk across her face.<br>\r\nSnapping out of it, you head inside, the skunkess leading the way and you see that her underwear is being eaten by her mammoth asscrack. Planting her ass on the couch she has, the skunk looks at Marc before addressing him, once he has climbed onto the table in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Okay then, let's do introductions. I'm Cindy Sprai and you cutie are...\"<br>\r\n\"Marc.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh god, your nervousness is making you even more adorable! Anyway, as your new boss, you'll be doing some of the chores here and there, like putting away my clothes, help me train, or of the like. You got it?\" She asks, the human following up.<br>\r\n\"Good, you get it, but a warning, I'm kind of gassy most of the time, so just deal with it,\" she explains, leaning to her left and ripping a bubbly fart into the poor couch.<br>\r\nMarc violently coughs, as the tainted air already made its way over to him, clearly explaining why the room smelt so disgusting.<br>\r\n\"Seeing how you haven't passed out yet, there may be some hope for you, so I'll try to hold back on my gas. But for now, I'll let you have a break and settle everything today,\" Cindy causally said, waving her fart away.<br>\r\nQuickly thanking her, you rush off to collect your things (and out of that room filling stench) and left Cindy to her thoughts.<br>\r\n\"He's pretty cute, but I'll let time tell if he's the one and it's nice to have someone to clean out my place, just like my sister. Though she's busy with her job as a maid in an apartment, Maya does give a helpful hand and he does look like the hard worker type as well. Why the hell does an apartment need a maid in the first place? Too hungry to care.\"<br>\r\nA week goes by and does something happen during that time?</span></div></div>",

Marlene sports a pair of breasts and an ass that each put the waistlines to some of the biggest fighters in the facility to shame, but she's mostly bombarded by an utterly titanic belly that perpetually lays on the floor, which she decorates with a variety of colorful tattoos to show off as it hangs out of all her shirts. She's reaching her late forties, but looks to be ten or fifteen years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner, founder, spokeswoman, and undisputed champion of the ASL, Marlene is undeniably the absolute biggest combatant in all the facility. Most of the time, she's rarely seen anywhere outside of her office, where she keeps the facility's upkeep and paperwork under control, but at the end of every month, there's a fan poll held where viewers can elect fighters to battle her in a five-on-one cage match, a battle that she rarely loses, despite being so obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she's away from the desk, Marlene can only be described as an anthro who's always hungry. Hungry for food, money, success...and love. In the walls of the facility, she's notorious for flirting with or forcing herself on anybody within a boulder's throw of her, whether they be male or female, or even fighter and staff. Rumor even has it that she makes secret deals with elected fighters to date her in exchange for victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the worse off are her assistants, her mad fetish for all things tiny being the main reason humans can be hired in the first place...</span></div></div>",

Plump physique, but nowhere near as fat as her fellow fighters. Usually wears a black tank top and tight black cycling shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda is one of the newest fighters in the Gold Division, and also the youngest; just recently turning 21 after her promotion. She still can barely believe she made it this far, and revels in the luxury that surrounds her--especially when she can share the experience. Fighters she's beaten to a pulp in the ring have found themselves invited to dinner dates or spa sessions, and after a win she rewards her human pets with movie nights in the ASL's private theaters. She still expects to be pampered, though; neck, back and foot massages lasting for hours are a daily demand to her humans. She also likes snuggling them as teddy bears before bed, sleeping with her human cuddled against her. (She sometimes wakes up with the human pinned under her belly, breasts or rump.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's one of the most friendly and gentle anthros you can meet...but there is a REASON she made it to the Gold Division so fast. Brenda is a rather brutal fighter, relying on her size and sheer brute strength to bowl over more skilled and ruthless opponents. She delivers powerful shoulder checks, punches and slams that knock her foe around like a ragdoll, never letting up until they tap out or are KO'd. She even has a signature move: Her long neck can act as a wrecking ball, slamming her head into an opponent in a devastating headbutt like a chained flail. Despite her brutal style, she ALWAYS stops when her opponent surrenders, never kicking when they're down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusually, Brenda is officially exempted from Survival Matches, due to nearly choking to death on an opponent early in her career. She managed to cough her opponent up, and barely avoided a draw by the latter tapping out, but the near-fatal experience still haunts her: she has an extreme (and understandable) phobia of choking to death. She cuts her food into minuscule pieces before even thinking of eating it, An opponent getting her in a headlock (unlikely with her long neck) can trigger memories of choking and give her panic attacks. She has thus never eaten an opponent or a human, and this has earned mockery from the more predatory fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tricia</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Species:</b> Triceratops Anthro<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 39' 6\"<br>\r\n<b>Appearance:</b> Dark green scales with small white freckles on her face, bright red scales around her horns. Pleasantly plump, with muscles beneath the fat. Wears a black bikini, with 'Zoom In On This, Camera Guy!' on the rear in large white capitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTricia loves being adored by a captive audience: win or lose the fight, she's always at her happiest in the ring showing off for the crowd. Everything she does is to revel in the attention! She waves to the fans during a match, poses for the camera whenever she gets the chance, and loves signing autographs for fans. She'll even warn people to cover their kids' eyes when a fight gets really brutal, or before she eats an opponent. Her antics have made her a fan favorite, and easily one of the most popular fighters in the ASL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a showboat, Tricia is a surprisingly competent fighter. She loves grappling and flooring opponents with powerful throws and trips, and can easily dodge attacks while charging a foe and putting her horns to use. She LOVES showy, flashy moves that play up the crowd--hip-bumps, belly flops and leaping into the air to land rump-first on an opponent are among her favorites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, this love of attention extends out of the ring. She rarely gives her human slave a break, making sure they're pampering and fawning over her. She especially loves posting on social media for her legions of followers, from photos of humans feeding her grapes, to videos of her sitting on her servant for no reason....to live-streaming when she eats a human slave that pissed her off. (She prefers to swallowing humans whole: anything bloody can cost her viewers.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's extremely fat, weighted down by a huge stomach and breasts, yet both are completely overshadowed by the gigantic size of her booty, which heaves behind her in an enormous pear shape. Constantly dresses in highly expensive dresses, even during her fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire was a highly successful fashion model far prior to her career in the sumo league, but still holds close the life of a fashionista. She feels completely superior to anybody around her and demands absolute royal treatment, well known to become very hot tempered if her desires are not immediately satisfied. As such, she has little regard for humans outside of slaves hired to constantly pamper, praise, and feed her, and is very quick to punish (making use of her pompous rear end) even the slightest inadequacy she sees in their work. She's also infamous for her obsession with cleanliness, another gripe for anybody who is forced to work for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough far surpassed by her ego, Sapphire does, indeed, possess high talent as a wrestler and brawler, often able to complete matches without damaging her dresses at all. She even enjoys partaking in the occasional survival match, which always ends with her swallowing her enemies whole (it's cleaner, that way).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe speaks in a british accent.</span></div></div>",

The walls were adorned with extravagant paintings that gave Marc a vague sense of guilt for not visiting museums more often.  Up here, there was even perfume cycled through the vents to make the place smell as luxurious as it looked. Today, the ASL had chosen a floral scent: a hint of roses and saffron that he found relaxing despite the danger being a Gold Division fighter\u2019s personal pet posed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually really nice. Marc made a mental note to get an air freshener with that scent. <i>IF you survive,</i> an unwelcome thought added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still enjoying that flowery smell when he came upon one particular door, and a mat laid in front of it\u2014rather than <i>Welcome</i>, it read <i>Wipe your feet OR ELSE. Dirt means PAIN</i> There was a sudden harsh chemical smell that made Marc's eyes water: it was like someone had sprayed bleach all over the door. So this anthro was a major neat-freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the number on the door matched the note he'd been given. G-101.<br>\r\nThis was where his new mistress stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, time to get it over with.</i> Steeling himself, Marc knocked on the door. \"Service? This is Service for room G-101!\"                                                         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that my human?\u201d A posh woman's voice answered. Thundering footsteps approached, and the door opened to release an elegant classical music piece playing in the room, and reveal a plump swan woman, her form wrapped in an elegant white silk dress and a black fur coat draped over her shoulders. A pearl necklace adorned her long avian neck. Beneath her expensive outfit, fat and muscle rippled. \"Good, you've arrived. Taking your sweet time, of course,\" the bird giantess added, her British accent laying the arrogance of wealth on thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc suppressed a whistle. His new mistress was a bombshell. And a RICH bombshell, too, going by the swanky outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to serve me or ogle me? Don't tell me I have to eat you already...\" she squawked. \"Come in, and <i>wipe your feet!</i> They barely vacuum the hall out there; track dirt in and I'll sit on you for an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc mentally groaned, obeying. Now he remembered who this was: Sapphire, the Gold Division's biggest prima donna. She was as prissy as she was brutal--she'd eaten almost all of her opponents, sometimes outside of Survival Matches; and demanded to be treated like royalty. He'd seen her gulp down a Jaguar woman who'd tapped out and waved to the crowd in graceful loss. He sometimes had nightmares where he tried and failed to save her from Sapphire's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire was waddling back into her luxurious room (Marc just thought the expensive decorations were tacky), Marc following in the shadow of her looming feathery rump...and she suddenly spun around and grabbed him, holding him close to her beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JESUS CHRIST, IT'S BEEN FIVE MINUTES!\" Marc wailed, fighting Sapphire's grip. \"WHY ARE YOU EATING ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant swan woman ignored him, bringing him to her beak...and <i>sniffed him.</i> Then she recoiled, gagging. \"You're filthy! How can you come into my perfectly clean apartment smelling like that?! So disrespectful!\" Letting out an angry squawk, she stomped out of her pamper parlor/living room and toward her bedchamber (past a HUGE circular bed that looked soft as a cloud) and opened a human-sized door by her closet, all but throwing him into a bathroom. \"Clean up! There's a change of clothes by the sink. Just get that reek off yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuming (he took a shower this morning!), Marc got undressed and hopped in, running a shower. A quick scrub-down got the sweat off him, and it was nice--but as soon as he turned the water off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get out yet, get PROPERLY clean!\" Sapphire's voice came from behind the door. \"Who knows what you picked up before coming in here. Scrub harder, too! Dirt can cake onto your skin, especially <i>human</i> skin. Feathers stay so much cleaner...\" she added in a disgusted mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling low enough to be drowned out by the running shower, Marc complied. This was still worth not getting sat on in the first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===One Annoyingly Long Shower Later===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Sapphire judged Marc clean enough--close to an hour of constant scrubbing--his skin was reddened and stung at a touch. He must have almost scrubbed the top layer of his skin off...thankfully he <i>hadn't</i> started bleeding. Toweling off and putting on his clean clothes hurt like hell. <br>\r\nThe bathroom was filled with so filled with steam it felt like a sauna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That covers all my bathing for a week,\" Marc mumbled. He opened the bathroom door and found Sapphire towering over him with an appraising look, webbed foot tapping impatiently. \"All clean, Madam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now you're as presentable as you can be,\" Sapphire snipped, snobbish as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo cut off his planned snark, Mac instead asked, \"Who was that change of clothes for, Madam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My last human. He displeased me, so I ate him. At least he was tasty. Lasted for three days in here, so was good for internal massages at least,\" Sapphire answered, patting her belly. She might have been talking about the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gulped and stepped back. For all her prissiness, Sapphire was still a killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire reached down for Marc again. \"But as for what you'll be doing now...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Barely,\" the swan said disdainfully. \"Did you really think I'd dirty my clothes by sitting on you <i>before</i> you washed? Disgusting! Honestly, even a pathetic human such as yourself should've known better than to cross the threshold of my abode without being immaculate. This isn't a barn. It's the residence of a Gold Division fighter! If you're to survive more than a week in my employ, you must learn that cleanliness is next to godliness. And since I'm your new god, you'll be next to me for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gulped. \"Don't you mean, for the rest of my contract?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe edges of her beak curved into a cruel smirk. Clearly she shared his thoughts on the odds of his survival. For the second time that day, the gigantic swan grabbed him, only this time, instead of raising him to her beak, she carried him to her bed and tossed him on top of it. It really was as soft as a cloud. It's funny. In any other scenario, a woman throwing him onto her bed would've been fulfilling one of his fantasies. Here, as Sapphire turned around exposing the mountainous backside of a near-thirty-foot tall, pear-shaped behemoth, it was pretty clearly a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHOOMF</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire's ass came crashing down, enveloping him utterly and completely. The swan took a second to get herself situated, wiggling her ass back and forth to get comfortable, causing Marc to let out muffled shrieks from underneath her. When she was finally satisfied, she let out a small, \"Ah,\" and leaned backwards to read the fashion magazine she had on her bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your usefulness as a servant remains to be seen, but apparently you're quite serviceable as a cushion.\" Marc could only offer more muffled protests which Sapphire ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his hearing was dampened, Marc could make out the harsh tones of his mistress, crystal clear. This wasn't the first time he'd been sat on as part of his \"career\" in the ASL. If he was thinking about it objectively, it wasn't the worst time either. A few pachyderms had sat on him with skin so rough and heavy that it felt like having an actual mountain sit on him. Another afternoon spent under the behind of a pig woman had been repulsive because of how sweaty she'd been... that and the infrequent burst of flatulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire sitting on him on the other hand was about as \"ideal\" a situation as it could be. It was still humiliating, degrading and painful, but not as much as it had ever been in the past. For one thing, her ass was surprisingly soft. Almost as soft as her bed itself. And the pressure, while strong, didn't immobilize him like some others might. The smell wasn't bad either. It was actually... kind of nice. Thankfully her standards for cleanliness applied to herself as well. The scent of her body wash and perfume gave everything a pleasant, floral scent... It was when Marc realized that he was looking on the bright side of being under a bird's back side that he finally realized just how sad a point he'd reached in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been feeling some tension in my glutes since my last match,\" Sapphire said. \"Perhaps if you put your pathetic squirms to good use in giving them a massage, I may reduce the number of hours for your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up</i>, Marc thought sadly as he reluctantly began carrying out Sapphire's instructions. He had enough freedom of movement to move his arms and he began searching for the tension his mistress had mentioned. He wasn't a professional masseuse, but he'd learned how to give massages fast in the ASL. If Sapphire's pleased moan was any indication, he was doing a good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I won't have to eat this one after all</i>, Sapphire thought. <i>He's certainly got magic fingers.</i> Her behind being properly pampered, Sapphire turned back to the fashion magazine she was reading. She was on the cover, of course. Once again beating out the Glamor Gator. That cold-blooded Silver Division fighter would never be anything more than a wannabe runner-up. She gave a haughty laugh and kept reading. Every now and then Marc would grow tired and Sapphire would incentivize him with a quick clench of her cheeks. He got the message soon enough and worked through his pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=== Three Hours Later ===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc couldn't take it anymore. He'd been giving a massage for three hours straight. His arms felt like they would fall off! He needed a break, even if it meant risking the ire of his new mistress. He turned his head to the side, trying to ensure that he didn't get any of Sapphire's backside into his mouth when he spoke. It was less the indignity of it than fear of what she would do to him if he got drool on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Msh Sphir?\" Marc said as loudly as he could through his squished face. \"May oo pwease geh off e? ... Msh Sphir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response. Marc listened closely and realized he could hear something faintly... snoring. She was asleep! On the outside Sapphire was dozing peacefully, her magazine had fallen over her face. With Marc underneath her, she looked like she was trying to hatch an oversized egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc wondered what he should do. On the one hand, he was at the end of his rope. He wasn't sure he could take another few hours trapped underneath his new mistress, even if he wasn't massaging her. But what could he do? Wake her? How? Pinching or biting her seemed like a one-way ticket to pain for him. So what was left? Spending the next several hours trapped beneath her until she woke up on her own? Would she respect his obedience or be angry at him for letting her sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Marc choose?</span></div></div>",

There was just one problem: he didn't know how to accomplish that without angering Sapphire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried squirming out from under her several times and actually made some progress but his limbs had started to cramp. Those three hours of massaging had not In his drained state, the effort combined with the pain had quickly dissuaded him from continuing. That and he was afraid that any pained gasps or yells would wake up Sapphire, whom he doubted would have appreciated such a rude wake up call. His ability to get out from under Sapphire were basically nil, he thought out doing something to <i>gently</i> wake the large swan up...and realized that even that was a bad idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc had not survived the ASL so far by being stupid. He'd quickly learned to start analyzing his mistress' behavior in order to better survive them.

Sapphire, you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal swan woke with a startled honk. \"What time is it?\" She looked at the clock and let out another, smaller honk. \"Damn it! The girls are here! Why didn't that stupid human wake me? Where is that useless fool anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc debated whether or not he should remind her where he was, before deciding to gently tap one ass cheek. She yelped, then stood up. Marc took a deep, grateful breath of fresh air as Sapphire got off him, his weakened body left in the crater-like impression of Sapphire's buttcheeks in the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are you little fool! Why didn't you wake me?\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc bit down his retorts. That 1) she hadn't told him she was expecting company, 2) she didn't tell him when to wake her, and 3) he had no way to know what time it was since her fat ass blocked the clock! Instead he said his prepared remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, mistress, I didn't want to inconvenience you by waking you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'd rather make a fool of me in front of my friends instead?\" she demanded, bending over and craning her elongated neck down so her face was close to Marc's flattened form. \"Imbecile! Next time think before you slack off! If there is a next time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay</i>, Marc thought. <i>So she's unreasonable... And a bitch. Got it. Guess I'll have to find a way to get rid of her after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore knocking came from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire? SAPPHIRE! You in there or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment, ladies!\" Sapphire called, casting a nervous look at the door. To Marc she whispered, \"Never mind. I'll deal with <i>you</i> later. First you'll help me salvage this mess by making the bed so my quarters are presentable. Then answer the door to receive my guests. Offer them anything they want while I get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc wondered what the point was of her getting ready since she was just as well-dressed and dazzling as she'd been before her nap. Marc himself didn't look nearly as good. He looked like... well, he looked like he'd been used as a cushion by a fat, sleeping swan for several hours. He didn't argue though. He just got up and made the bed as she stomped off to the bathroom to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bed was made, Marc went to the door. He didn't bother spending time worrying about who might be on the other side. The voice sounded familiar but not one Marc knew intimately. Whoever it was, Marc figured he'd find out who they were soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc opened the door and was met with the sight of two other bird women. The sight of the first one filled him with hope. It was Avery, a large roc who'd joined the ASL for the thrill of the fight. Marc had heard that she was pretty chill as far as anthro mistresses went, treating humans decently by anthro standards. Marc took heart that maybe her presence meant Sapphire wasn't so bad. That impression wasn't lasting, however, when Marc noticed the anthro standing next to her: Amaya the phoenix. Not only was she one of the best fighters in the ASL--a champion of the Gold Division--but she was fiery, prone to angry outbursts and had a taste for human meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc took one look at them and gulped. He didn't have time to do anything else, as Amaya pushed past the other women, said, \"Out of the way, runt,\" and literally bowled Marc over in her impatience to get inside. Marc let out a squeaky wheeze like a chewtoy as the phoenix stepped on his stomach. Avery at least took the time to step over him and mouth, \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire!\" Amaya said. \"Are you here or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be out in just a few moments, darling!\" Sapphire called from the bathroom. \"In the meantime, help yourself to whatever you like. My servant will do whatever you command!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grumpy phoenix plopped herself down on the couch. \"I've waited for her \"just a few moments\" before. We'll be lucky if she comes out this century. All I can say is, we better not miss our reservation, I'm starving.\" The phoenix cast a hungry eye at Marc as she said this and he felt like someone was walking over his grave. \"Hey, runt, get me something to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc jumped to obey, practically sprinting into Sapphire's kitchen. Avery sat in the lounge chair next to Amaya, looking far more relaxed than the phoenix did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Amaya,\" Avery said. \"You'll scare the little fella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. The little punk should be thanking me. Fear keeps humans alive around here. Maybe if Sapphire's last slave was more afraid of her, he wouldn't have ended up on the menu. Looks like she's wasting no time in breaking this one in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Marc emerged from the kitchen carrying a silver platter piled high with fresh fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Amaya demanded. \"A mid-day snack? Get me some real food! I want <i>meat</i>--Hey wait a minute! Did I tell you to take the platter with you? Leave it. Now run. GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc scampered away and Avery chuckled as Amaya began digging into the small mountain of fruit. \"I swear, I'll never understand this obsession some of you girls here have with torturing humans. They're small, they're weak, they're pathetic. Why bother? It's pointless, like burning ants with a magnifying glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmaya shrugged with her mouth full of chewed apples. \"Girl's gotta take her fun where she can have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc soon returned again, this time with a platter filled with fresh cuts of ham, pepperoni, sausage, turkey, chicken and roast beef. Marc only wondered now if Amaya and Avery would perceive being served poultry as some kind of cannibalism, but they didn't complain as they both dug into the meat with reckless abandon. Marc didn't content himself with letting out a sigh of relief though. Instead he just waited for his next order... and pondered about the ways someone like Sapphire could meet her gruesome demise. In the ring maybe? A Survival Match against a deadly opponent? How nice would that be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not, darlings! Your hostess has arrived!\" Sapphire called out as she emerged from the bathroom. She wore a sparkly red dress with a gold scarf through around her long neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough, Saph,\" Amaya said, as she polished off the last bite of turkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swan blushed. \"I'm terribly sorry, dear,\" Sapphire said, shooting a deathly glare at Marc, who squirmed under her gaze. \"This little fool was supposed to wake me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more,\" Amaya said reasonably. \"Just be sure to kick his ass later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure,\" Sapphire crooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you look nice,\" Amaya said. Sapphire smiled and opened her beak to respond when Amaya checked her watch and cut her off. \"Damn it. The place is gonna be packed! We'll never get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries there, darling,\" Sapphire said with a rich laugh. \"The owner owes me a favor. She'll let us in at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Avery said. \"Thanks, Sapphire. It was really nice of you to invite us along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire laughed again but this time it sounded false. \"Yes. Well, when Amaya told me <i>she'd</i> invited you along, how could I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery hadn't caught the tension in Sapphire's voice but Marc did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Interesting,</i> Marc thought. <i>Sapphire doesn't want Avery here... And the colors of Sapphire's outfit match Amaya... is that intentional? Is she trying to suck up to the phoenix to learn her techniques to surpass her as champion? Or... could Sapphire want a little alone time with Amaya for other (winkwinknudgenudge) reasons? Nah, I'm probably imagining things... Probably.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave!\" Sapphire squawked. \"Make yourself useful and carry my purse!\" She pointed a winged father at a black purse the size of a large suitcase. Marc ran over and gave a strained grunt as he lifted it up. It felt twice as heavy as himself. He had no time to catch his breath though as Sapphire was already directing her guests out the door, Marc following on weak legs. They made their way outside to Sapphire's private car that would take them to the other end of the ASL compound, which contained all the restaurants and entertainment used by ASL fighters, and guests willing to pay for the privilege of hobnobbing with their favorite fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Marc wondered just where the hell they were going. Where would someone like Sapphire take her friends for a good time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The Golden Platter - The fanciest restaurant in the ASL, reserved for only current Gold Division fighters, former fighters, their guests, and technically their slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Club Sumo - The hippest, most happening dance club in the entire ASL compound.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc got his answer when the car came to a stop in front of a large, two story building with a line of anthros along the front and circling all the way around the corner. Different colored lights flashed in the windows in a sequence: purple, green, blue, gold, red. Some kind of techno music was booming inside, the sound loud enough to carry outside and make the car gently shake. Neon lights depicted a golden phoenix fighting an indigo hippo, while, below, written in white lights, were the words: CLUB SUMO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the size of that line,\" Avery said. \"How on earth are we going to get in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire laughed condescendingly. \"Watch and learn, dear.\" She snapped her feathered fingers. \"Slave. Door. And don't forget my purse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc kept his annoyed groan to himself. He heaved her two-ton purse and stepped out of the car, circled around and opened the door facing the club. Sapphire got out first, followed by Amaya and Avery. With each anthro who exited, the car would raise a few inches off the ground. Marc hadn't realized how close the underside of the car had come to scraping along the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndependent of the line that seemed to go on forever was a red carpet that led to the entrance, two angry-looking pit-bull anthros wearing sunglasses and black t-shirts stood guard. When they saw Sapphire approaching, they bowed and opened the door for her and her retinue without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire noticed the shocked looks on the rest of them and laughed richly. \"It's like I said, the owner owes me a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmaya chuckled. \"Unquestioning obedience. I like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight flush came to Sapphire's cheeks. \"Thank you, darling. I do what I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the club was just as packed as the outside and the music was so loud it rattled Marc's entire body. Marc saw a dance floor made of multi-colored, flashing tiles that stretched on and on the size of several football fields, and dancing on it were every kind of anthro under the sun. Most of them had the body type that lent itself to a place called \"Club Sumo\" but there were also lithe and muscular anthros dancing as well. Looking out over the sea of bouncing bosoms, jiggling booties and gyrating bodies, Marc recognized many fighters from the ASL. There was Claudine, dancing with all the grace and elegance one could expect from a unicorn, dancing with Gloria the Glamor Gator, who was keeping pace just as well. One would almost think they were competing instead of enjoying themselves. He also spied the farm girl pig, Daisy, dancing like a maniac, swinging her latest, poor human servant along with her like a doll, oblivious to his obvious sickness and pain as he slammed into other dancers like a ping pong ball. He even recognized Dominique twerking on the dance floor and felt a twinge of pity as he saw the back of her thong was comprised of a human male. His hands and legs were tied with tight leather and his face was buried deep in the hippo's asscrack. Having just spent several hours in a similar position, Marc's heart went out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBars encircled the entirety of the dance floor, where anthros sat on reinforced stools and laughed and drank. The first three drinks were free for fighters and everyone present was more than willing to take advantage of that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" Avery said, taking in the excitement around her. \"This place is popping! I don't know where to start, if I should get my groove on or my drink on. What do you think, Amaya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding me?\" Amaya said. \"Remember what happened the last time you got one too many drinks in you? I'm amazed anyone still serves you alcohol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Avery demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Marc didn't hear what it meant as he was suddenly yanked away from the phoenix and the roc and found himself face-to-beak with Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen to me, slave,\" Sapphire whispered so the other two couldn't hear. \"It is imperative that this night go off perfectly. In order for that to happen, it means I need that overgrown chicken, Avery, out of my feathers, so I can spend some time with Amaya alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need to be alone with Amaya?\" Marc asked, feigning innocent ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never you mind why!\" Sapphire snapped, blushing furiously. \"I just need you to keep that dumb roc distracted for a few hours. That's where you come in. Keep her busy, keep her distracted, but, most of all, keep her the hell away from Amaya and me. Do this well and I'll let your earlier failures slide. Fail me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let his imagination complete the thought for him. Marc gulped. Personally he still didn't think he'd failed her at all so far, but there was no use arguing that with someone like Sapphire. Marc nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Sapphire said. \"Now get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc approached the two colossal bird women warily. They kept talking, oblivious to his presence, but he could feel Sapphire's stare on him. He gulped again. How on earth could he keep Avery occupied for a few hours? She seemed friendly to humans--at least by anthro standards--but he doubted that meant she'd want to spend all her time with one instead of her friends while in the best club for anthros around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne step at a time, Marc thought to himself. He cleared his throat to get their attention. Then did so again--louder--when the two's conversation didn't stop. Finally he just shyly tapped Avery on the arm. The roc broke off and looked at him. \"What's up, little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what the hell do you want?\" Amaya said, clearly not pleased to have her talk interrupted. Avery, however, was looking at Marc with curiosity instead of hostility. He took that as a good a sign as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc cleared his throat. \"Um, Ms. Avery, w-would you like to... um...\"</span></div></div>",

His salary was pocket change compared to what the fighters made. He tried to come up with an answer but just opened and closed his mouth, no sound coming out, like a fish yanked out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought,\" Amaya growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a threatening step towards him only to be stopped by Avery putting a firm, feathered hand on her friend's shoulder. \"Easy there, girl.

This pipsqueak's trying to take advantage of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire appeared out of the crowd, taking in the sight of her servant cowering in front of the enraged phoenix and the roc trying to keep things peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire, good, you're here,\" Amaya said. \"I was just gonna look for you. I need your permission so I can light a fire under your slave's ass!\" She punctuated her statement by igniting a fireball in her hand. Marc yelped while Avery let out a loud sound of protest which Amaya ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I hate to deny you anything, darling, but I did just get this one today. May I ask why you wish to incinerate him so badly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's trying to take advantage of Avery for free drinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amaya, come on!\" Avery argued. \"You're jumping to conclusions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid Avery's right, darling,\" Sapphire said in her calm, refined manner. \"This is a simple miscommunication. I'm afraid this slave isn't as eloquent as us. You know how humans are. A few moments ago, Mr... Err... Um... Well his name's not important. Anyway, a few moments ago he pulled me away and told me how much he admired Avery. Turns out he's a real super fan. He'd even admitted to hoping to be assigned as her slave. Naturally I'm too gracious to be offended by such a careless remark, but I did take pity on him and graciously granted him permission to buy Avery a few drinks so that he could finally meet his hero. All of these drinks will, of course, be put on my bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was frankly amazed that Sapphire had managed to conjure such a massive torrent of bullcrap in just a few seconds, and even more amazed when that lie seemingly did the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww,\" Avery cooed. \"You're a fan of mine, little guy? Well why didn't you just say so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dumbass,\" Amaya said. \"You should've told us Sapphire was paying for everything. That's really generous of you, Saph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire beamed. \"Thank you, darling. I try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really impressed you didn't squash the runt the second he told you he wished he was assigned to another fighter. Any slave of mine ever said that to me and I'd roast him on the spot. You though? You're different. You got class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, darling, it's nothing!\" Sapphire said while blushing furiously. \"But don't downplay you're own virtues, darling! You're the strongest person I've ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, it's nothing,\" Amaya grunted. \"There's a few moves I can teach you if you're interested in a private session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire somehow turned an even deeper shade of red and let out a nervous laugh, complete with an involuntary, highly <i>unclassy</i> honk. Whether or not Amaya meant the double entendre, Marc never found out, as it was then that Avery lifted him off the ground in a bridal carry and began carrying him towards the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you heard the swan! Free drinks! I'm gonna show you how to party and you can tell me all about how much you admire me, Super Fan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite working for the ASL, he rarely got the opportunity to watch any matches that didn't involve his current owner at the time. He wracked his brain trying to think of one he'd ever seen with Avery and was drawing a blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see what's going on,\" Avery said knowingly. \"You're shy! No wonder you've been acting so nervous around me all night! Don't worry, we'll have some drinks and loosen you up a bit first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let out a sigh of relief at the temporary reprieve. As Avery navigated the occupied dance floor to the closest two available seats at the bar, Marc was grateful that she was carrying him instead of making him walk. Seeing all those anthros carelessly stomping and jumping along to the music made Marc aware of just how easily he could be crushed like a bug by an errant dance move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the bar, Avery plopped Marc down on one of the stools clearly meant for an anthro. He was so high off the ground and his feet dangled just past the cushion, making him feel like he was sitting in a highchair. Even though the stools were reinforced, Avery's still screeched as she plopped her bulk down onto her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it'd be better if I sat on the bar instead, so someone else can sit on the stool? I don't take up much space after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was Marc was just acutely aware of the inevitable consequences of sitting on a seat meant for anthros. Either way, the bartender--a plump, brown minotaur woman in a red tank top--shut that idea down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No humans on the bar. Either sit on the stool or stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>STOMP STOMP STOMP</i> went the dancers all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sit,\" Marc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Super Fan,\" Avery said. \"I'll protect you!\" Her point was somewhat undercut when she gave Marc a playful slap on the back that was hard enough to send him lurching forward, only barely grabbing onto the counter to prevent himself from falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What did I just say?\" the minotaur said. \"No humans on the bar!\" She twisted her towel she was using to clean glasses with and whipped it at Marc's hands, causing him to push himself back to the relative safety of his stool. \"Now, what'll you be having Avery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two Sumo Slammers to start, Rosa!\" Avery said. \"And just so you know, everything after the freebies are going on Sapphire's tab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" the minotaur said. \"Boss said Sapphire was coming. Told me to make sure everything was available to her friends.\" Rosa hesitated as she looked at Avery. \"You sure you want Sumo Slammers? They're strong stuff. And after the last time you were drunk--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa!\" Avery whined. \"Don't embarrass me in front of my number one fan! I don't get why everyone's so concerned. I'm a big girl. I can handle my alcohol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa gave her a skeptical look but shrugged her shoulders and filled two shot glasses from a bottle with an ass overlapping with a skull and crossbones. Mercifully, they had human-sized shot glasses so Marc could take a normal drink, but Avery's was the size of a pitcher of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers, Super Fan!\" Avery said with a wink. She raised the drink to her beak and threw it back easily. Marc tried to do the same and ended up coughing as the burning liquid filled his mouth and went down his throat, setting his insides on fire in the process. He pounded the bar with a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOO!\" Avery said. \"Two more!\" Rosa sighed as she poured a refill for them. \"Now you, Super Fan. Quit being so quiet. Which one of my matches was your favorite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... well... Oh!\" Marc exclaimed, finally remembering a match he'd seen of Avery with an old mistress of his. \"That Tag Match where you and Athene faced off against Dominique and Mega Molly the Mole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's an obscure one. An oldie but a goodie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember when Molly had Athene on the ropes and you used your Talon Strike to send her flying out of the ring! That was incredible!\" Marc wasn't lying there either. He'd hated Molly. Seeing a cruel mistress kicked in the face was always good for a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Molly was a tough one. Kind of a bitch too... Still... it was a shame to see her challenge Pearl to a Survival Match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame for Molly, maybe. It'd been one of the best days of Marc's life. He still had a scar from one of her punishments. Rosa laid down two more shots and Avery picked hers up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate Survival Matches. Seems like a waste of good fighters if you ask me. That's why I never take them.\" She raised her glass. \"RIP, Molly.\" She and Marc drank again, the second shot going down no smoother for Marc than the first one did. \"Two more!\" Avery said, while Marc was still coughing. \"And you, Super Fan, keep talking. I don't get to interact with human fans often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc talked on and on, scourging his brain for all memories of Avery's previous fights. Avery meanwhile, kept drinking more and more, long after Marc stopped. After an hour however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Drink after drink had disappeared down Avery's gullet over the course of the hour. Rosa had firmly cut her off after her fifth shot but Avery had easily made the transition to beer, putting away ten anthro-sized bottles so far. Two shots had been enough to make Marc tipsy, so he'd only been sipping on a single human-sized bottle of beer, but he'd watched in something close to awe as Avery managed to keep putting one away after the other. He'd never seen an anthro drink so much in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know why Amaya and Rosa had sounded so nervous about Avery drinking earlier. She seemed fine... albeit totally hammered. He'd made a few suggestions that she should take things slower, but each time Avery brushed him off and encouraged him to keep telling her stories about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! That wash a good one--<i>hic</i>! I tell ya, sometimes I mish the Silver Decision... Tell me--<i>urp</i>--tell me anudder one, Super F--<i>HIC</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's catalogue of past matches he'd witnessed had been exhausted. He was tempted to just take his chances making things up. She was so wasted by this point that he doubted she'd notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on, I'm waiting!\" Avery said, banging the counter with a fist and making Marc jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well... let's see... um... there was... er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y--you--you gonna finish that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery didn't bother to answer, she just nabbed the beer bottle out of his hand. The contents were comparatively a thimbleful for her, but she open her beak and drank the beer down greedily. Once it was gone she winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stuff is weak! What're you schum kinda li--lightweight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a big drinker,\" Marc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa! I need another! HEY! ROSA! I SAID I NEED ANOTHER! WHERE ARE YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That's a good question,'</i> Marc thought. The minotaur was nowhere in sight. She'd done her best to curtail Avery's drinking but she'd had no choice but to follow her boss's orders and keep serving the roc. The last time Marc had seen her had been fifteen minutes ago when she'd given Avery a six-pack then said she needed to help another customer. As he took a look around to try to find the bartender Marc noticed something. Something that sent a shiver down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wait... Where</i> are <i>the other customers?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc hadn't noticed until now that a huge space had opened up between him and Avery and the rest of the club. The closest dancers were several car lengths away. The bar was completely deserted, like some radioactive wasteland where no one dared to tread. Every now and then someone would look over to where he and Avery were sitting and would take a few nervous steps away. Or shake their head sadly at Marc as if he was a dead man walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell is Rosa?\" Avery grumbled. \"You got a payin' cushtomer here who's THIRSTY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh shit. Maybe I should've paid more attention to the others' warnings.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rosa!\" Avery called in a singsong voice. \"ROSA! ROSA! ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! If you don't come back I'm just gonna start drinkin right from the tap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a bluff. Avery started leaning over the counter to grab the nozzle where her beer came from when Marc stood up and gently put his hands on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ms. Avery, maybe more alcohol isn't such a good idea. I know Ms. Sapphire said she'd pay for the drinks but maybe you've... had... too... much?\" Marc trailed off under the intensity of Avery's drunken gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sayin' I don't know when enuff 's enuff?\" Avery asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not saying that,\" Marc said slowly and carefully. \"It's just... you don't want to drink the entire night, do you? Why don't we do something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence that followed felt like a lifetime to Marc. Avery had seemed so calm and easygoing. A bit overconfident, a bit competitive, but a friendly person overall. She was one of the only fighters to treat humans decently. She was practically a Saint... when she was sober. He had no idea what kind of person she was like while drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of drunk is Avery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Party Animal: Avery becomes wild and uninhibited while drunk. Concerned with only having a good time, her hedonism and lack of restraint makes her a danger to everyone around her. Particularly to those smaller and weaker than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Angry Drunk: Avery does a complete 180 while drunk, becoming mean and abrasive to everyone. She perceives almost everything as an insult, hates being told what to do and will lash out violently as a result. In effect, she becomes exactly the kind of anthro Marc lives in terror of.</span></div></div>",

She's very eager to fight, but if she's in the middle of something or has something to do (which is often), she'll delay it until she has time for it. Despite her intimidating size, she's quite friendly, able to enjoy a good laugh, and loves the idea of a fight to the death. Because of their size, Beth finds humans to be cute and will defend them when they're harassed by others, though she places them inside her stomach (however, not many people know of this).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's constantly trying to improve her fighting style, so it's hard to tell what type of fighting style she'll use. Due to her build, she's quite the powerhouse, usually giving other Gold class fighters about 5-13 minutes, before knocking them out and because of her power and how she strikes, most fighters avoid having her as an opponent after encountering her once.</span></div></div>",

She has dusky brown skin, long &amp; dark curly hair and amber slits for eyes. Her arms/front legs are a cross between hands and lion paws: each finger bears a retractable claw and three digits and thumbs. The fur of her lion parts are a light cream color and her large wings have black feathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Description:</i> As a fighter of the Gold Division, Bast is undefeated and quite popular. This is due, in part, to the natural good looks of her human body parts, giving her massive appeal to humans fans. The other part is due to her powers. As a sphinx, Bast has a number of magical powers but the most known on is her ability to alter her body's fat/muscle proportions. She can easily turn herself into a massive blob of adipose, a female Adonis of muscle or anything in between. She can even change her size from her normal height to that more in line with a normal lion. As such, no match she's ever had goes exactly the same and she often approaches them all with an altered appearance. She will change her physique and size as she fights, picking what she believes to be best to bring her opponent down. Hence, she always gives the crowd quite a show and makes her one of the most viewed fighters in the ASL. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBast is incredibly intelligent and wise, befitting a sphinx. She enjoys reading as much as she enjoys a good brawl and takes multiple opportunities to learn new things. She also loves to be pampered and uses the ASL's lifestyle to indulge. She notably detests stupidity and ignorance and her respect for others is based on their own intellect: the higher it is, the better she treats them. Overall, she is quite proud and not afraid to look her nose down on those she considers to be stupid and due to her own high level of intellect and exacting standards, she disdains most around her. However, Bast is willing to change her opinion should one prove themselves to her in some capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotably, Bast has several other traits. The first is that she often walks around on all fours, making her appear shorter than she actually is, in spite of the fact that she can walk on her hind legs. Why she does this isn't known but some think it's so others will underestimate her. Second, she often throws riddles at others, testing their ability to problem solve and work with logic. This both to mess with them and to evaluate them intellectually. Finally, she has an ambition: to replace Marlene as head of the ASL.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc gulped as he took in the door before him. He looked down at the piece of paper assigning him to his new owner, then looked back at the door with the large number on it. There was no mistaking it. This was the home of his new mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name was familiar. He'd heard that she was undefeated, but not much else. The ASL had so many fighters and it's not like his job gave Marc a lot of time to search the internet or catch up on the news. As a servant, he was at his mistress's beck-and-call twenty-four-seven. Any free time he got to himself he was usually so exhausted after narrowly surviving his day's work that he'd just plop into bed. No one could fault him for not having an encyclopedic knowledge of every person in the ASL... well, no one could reasonably fault him, but that hadn't stopped a few of his previous owners puffed up on their own hype to feel insulted when Marc hadn't recognized them immediately. Punishment usually followed. Luckily, these fighters tended to overestimate themselves and found themselves on the unlucky end of a Survival Match before too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was different though. This was a Gold Division Fighter. And not just any fighter, but one who, if the size of her door was any indication, must've been ten times his size! The towering golden door was sixty-feet high and looked like the gate to some secret paradise. For its owner, no doubt it was. For Marc, that remained to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd never been \"owned\" by a fighter big enough to easily rampage through a human city before. He'd had to watch his step around anthros who were \"just\" ten-feet-tall in case they accidentally squished him. This'd be even harder now that he was roughly the size of a bug compared to his new mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe they let anthros this big fight. Where do they get the money?\" Marc wondered out loud. Though if he put much thought into the logic of anything that went on around here, he knew it wouldn't hold up to scrutiny. He'd just accepted that the world was crazy and he had no choice but to live in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small door set in the larger one, a roughly human-sized one in the shape of a pyramid. It almost looked like a cat flap. There was no knob on it so Marc knocked. It sprang open soundlessly at his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, not even a minute in and it starts with the foreboding,\" Marc grumbled. \"It's not like someone this tall needs to try to be intimidating.\" He was hoping to get all of his annoyed sarcasm out of his system now, before meeting Bast. His mouth had gotten him into trouble before, and more than once he'd only survived by the skin of his teeth when prodding a new owner too far. He was hoping Bast's size alone would be enough incentive to keep his mouth shut, but sometimes it felt like his mouth had a mind of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Marc called. \"Ms. Bast? It's Marc Youngblood, your new human... Are you here?\" There was no answer. \"Can I come inside?\" Still no answer. \"If yes, say absolutely nothing and give no sign of life.\" Marc cringed at his own words but still no one answered. He wondered if someone that tall could even hear him at his size. \"Screw it, let's get this over with,\" Marc said and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of Bast's home was as opulent as Marc imagined. A living room built to accommodate someone the size of a kaiju, all in gold and black with an Egyptian theme. There was no TV, but that was no surprise since shelves of books lined the walls. Bast was obviously a big reader. Maybe an academic? What surprised Marc more, however, was that there were several sets of furniture, all at varying sizes, at various points in the room. Most sets of furniture were big enough for several of his old mistresses, but other sets had been clearly built for humans. It looked like Bast might be an accommodating host after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the new boy, are you?\" a husky, droll voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was so startled that he nearly jumped out of his skin. The voice had seemingly come from nowhere. He looked around the room but there was no sign of a fifty-foot anthro anywhere. How could she be hard to miss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last human they sent me was ever so dull,\" the voice continued. \"I wonder if he'd been dropped on his head at some point. I gave him oh-so-many chances to change my opinion of him. He was nice but just... so... slow... It was almost a relief when I stepped on him yesterday. It was an accident, of course, but he should've been watching where I was going. It did have the good fortune to be lunchtime when it happened, and, well, waste not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she talked, the more creeped out Marc became. He didn't know if it was better or worse that she hadn't intended to kill her last human what with the casual way she talked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll... I'll be quicker than him,\" Marc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. We'll see. Now come closer so I can have a better look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt embarrassed that he still had no idea where she was, especially after he'd just told her he'd be smarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't see you,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm,\" she said, unimpressed. \"I hope you have a keener mind than eye, boy. I'm right here. Yoo-hoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flicker of motion and Marc finally spotted something on top of the red, leather couch that took up the majority of the room. A sphinx. Even though the couch was built for someone colossal, the anthro lounging upon it was the size of a housecat in comparison. She waved at him with one paw, while holding a book in the other. Marc was struck with her beauty the moment he saw her. She may have some animal attributes, but her face and torso was undeniably that of a human woman. How long had it been since Marc had come in contact with someone that even remotely reminded him of his own species? Months?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat got your tongue,\" Bast asked dryly. Marc blushed and shut his gaping mouth. He realized she must get attention like this all the time from humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get it together, Youngblood,\" Marc thought to himself. \"She may look human but she just admitted to squishing and eating her last slave! You could be next if your not careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Marc said, trying to recover, \"I was just expecting someone taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? This tall, perhaps?\" And without another word her form began to grow. Suddenly the various sets of furniture in different sizes made more sense. Marc watched in fascination and horror as the sphinx went from the size of a lion to the titaness he'd expected. By the time she was done growing she easily filled up the couch. Marc was so surprised at the display, he didn't realize she was reaching for him until her paw was practically upon him. He gave out a frightened squeak and turned to run, but was snatched up in an instant. Marc flailed as she brought him up to the amber slits that were her eyes. She worked him between each furry finger like a coin, inspecting him with obvious contempt. \"I thought you said you'd be quicker than the other one,\" she said. \"If this is your idea of quickness, I suggest you pick up the pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wait just a minute,\" Marc said. \"It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! You can't expect me to just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you put in a barrel to make it lighter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc blinked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBast gave a long-suffering sigh, as if he was the stupidest thing to ever crawl out of the primordial soup. \"You say you're quick,\" Bast said as if talking to an utter imbecile, \"I'm giving you a chance to prove it. Answer my riddle. What do you put in a barrel to make it lighter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc knew the answer was a hole, but the way she spoke to him made him so angry that his mouth moved before he could stop himself. \"A man?\" he suggested sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBast's eyes narrowed. \"If there's one thing that annoys me more than idiots, it's fools. Idiots at least can't help themselves. I put up with my last slave far past the point of reason because he at least tried. Now, your time with me can be a very painful experience or a tolerable one. I have had slaves in the past who survived their time with me until their contract expired and they could go home. I'm still in correspondence with some of the more clever ones. The ones who angered me, however? They had a very different experience. Now, if you have a modicum of intelligence, I suggest you take my next riddle seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Marc snapped, \"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Bast said. \"We hurt without moving. We poison without touching. We bear the truth and the lies. We are not to be judged by our size. What am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long stretch of silence went on as Bast waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... could you repeat it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBast groaned loudly. \"We... <i>hurt</i>... without... <i>moving</i>,\" Bast said slowly and loudly. \"We <i>poison</i> without <i>touching</i>... We bear the <i>truth</i> and the <i>lies</i>. We are not to be judged by our <i>size</i>... <i>What... am... I?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc listened to the whole thing growing redder and redder in the face, angered and embarrassed to be treated this way. A giantess or not, who the hell did she think she was treating him this way? He'd figured out the answer to her stupid riddle but why should he give her the satisfaction of playing her game? He didn't need to impress her. She was just another bully, the same kind he'd been dealing with ever since he'd been roped in the ASL. Already he was preparing his insult. \"Easy,\" the rational part of his mind said. \"Be the bigger person. The answer is Words. Just give her the answer she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Bast snapped. \"What am I?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's temper flared. He opened his mouth and answered...</span></div></div>",

However, she gave him a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. Good to see that <i>something</i> is rattling around that tiny head of yours.\u201d She commented, idly. \u201cBut anyone get something right at least once. Show me that your flash of insight isn\u2019t just a fluke.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc took a deep breath, doing his best to allow his anger to drain out with it. He gave her a nod in acknowledgment, his gaze never leaving Bast\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Of course. Nothing\u2019s ever <i>that</i> easy...</i>\u2019 Marc inwardly sighed. At least, he\u2019d be prepared this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one color, but not one size. Stuck at the bottom, yet easily flies. Present in sun, but not in rain. Doing no harm, and feeling no pain. What is it?\u201d Bast intoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc took a second to think. \u201cA shadow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Bast nodded. \u201cTrue. Who is that with a neck and no head, two arms and no hands? What is it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shirt.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat word starts with E and ends with E but only has one letter in it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn envelope.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. You see a boat filled with people. You look again, but this time you don\u2019t see a single person on the boat. Why?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe boat hasn\u2019t sunk. It\u2019s just that everyone on it is married.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went. Bast asked a riddle, Marc answered. He couldn't have said how long it went on. Half an hour. One hour? Two? He had no clue. What he did know, was that he didn\u2019t get a single on of Bast\u2019s riddles wrong. Some had forced him to rack his brain for a second or three. Others, he\u2019d known since childhood. Some, he just winged! But in the end, he got them all and all throughout, his gaze never left Bast\u2019s, who returned the stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was being honest, Marc felt surprisingly liberated by the whole experience. Oh, he never forgot that he was being judged. The mere thought almost set his teeth on edge. However, this was the closest he\u2019d come to something mentally stimulating in quite sometime. He\u2019d gotten used to the rather straightforward routine of being abused by the his \u2018betters\u2019 and really hadn\u2019t gotten much in the way of conversation. Not that any of those self-obsessed prima donnas had anything worth talking about, but still. Even as Bast drilled him, he felt quite more energized as he continued to rise to every challenge she set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared into Bast\u2019s eyes, he swore he saw a flicker of emotion. Just a little. But what was it?</span></div></div>",

He identified it so quickly because he'd felt something similar when he'd first laid eyes on Bast's beautiful human features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Was that... attraction?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could know for sure, the sphinx broke eye contact. \"Impressive,\" she said softly. \"You got every single riddle correct. None of my previous servants have ever managed to do that before. The smartest one only got 75% correct... some of those riddles stumped even some of my fellow sphinxes. I'll confess... I had not expected you to be so intelligent.\" Her eyes met Marc's again and this time a slight blush came to her cheeks. She quickly looked away, staring at nothing in particular, a slight frown on her face. \"For a <i>human</i>, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said it haughtily, trying to downplay it, but she couldn't hide what she was feeling from Marc. She was tugging at her collar, like the room was getting too hot for her, and she was fidgeting in her seat. All the signs were clear. She <i>was</i> attracted to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brainteasers for the win,\" Marc murmured idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Marc said quickly. A long, awkward silence followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, he had no idea how to feel about this. She was brilliant, which was a turn-on for Marc... but also arrogant. She looked down on idiots and he'd had to prove himself before she'd even deigned to give him the slightest compliment. That attitude coupled with his own temper could prove a bad combination. Although... Marc couldn't deny how beautiful she was. He'd noticed it from the second he saw her, and the fact that she looked human was definitely a bonus. But no matter her looks, she <i>wasn't</i> human. In addition to her lioness traits and size-changing abilities, she thought like an anthro. She'd confessed to casually stepping on and eating her last human and had threatened him when he'd shown defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Plus she's my boss,'</i> Marc reminded himself as an afterthought. Office relationships had always been a minefield for him, and that was back when his partners <i>couldn't</i> make themselves the size of a mountain when they were ticked off at him. <i>'This whole situation has the potential to blow up in my face,'</i> Marc thought, feeling a little hot under the collar himself. <i>'Maybe I should've gotten some of her questions wrong on purpose.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ahem.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was brought out of his thoughts by the sound of Bast clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that the riddle of your intelligence has been solved,\" she said, \"I have a list of chores prepared for you to do for your first day.\" Bast reached into her pocket with her other paw and pulled out a folded sheet of paper. But she didn't open it. She was eying Marc up, one fang biting her lower lip. \"But... since you've proven how smart you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc smiled at the sphinx and her hesitation. <i>'Hey, this might be a good thing after all! This little crush might get me out of being treated like a slave for once!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Yes: Bast is open with her affection and treats Marc more like a professional assistant than a common servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) No: Bast is a total tsundere in denial of her attraction to a mere human. She hides her feelings for Marc by working him even harder as a slave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If someone had told Marc that he'd eventually meet a fighter who wouldn't treat him like dirt, he'd would have laughed in their face without a regret. Now, however... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since he had utterly blown Bast's expectations out of the water, things had proceeded rather smoothly. Marc had been given his own apartment within Bast's quarters. It was...rather nice. A small but cozy and private place. It had a living room, a bathroom with a tub, kitchen and bedroom. It was rather spartan, what with the last occupants things thrown out. His new apartment may not have been the highest standard of living like Bast's own dwelling but it was nice and a definite step up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's things had been moved in immediately, along with a series of nice collared shirts bearing a stylized Eye of Horus. As Bast's servant, it was her own way of marking him and letting others know just who he served. On some level, Marc figured that he should have been insulted, what with being claimed like property. Yet, the way Bast had gone about it made him feel more like an employee. Seriously, as far claiming went, Marc was perfectly fine with wearing nice shirts. Better that than being sat on or forced to wear a dog collar tied to a leash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Bast, herself, she was a serious but reasonable mistress. She didn't have him do things like her laundry or order her food. No, Bast was far more practical than that. Her first order of business was to have him review videos of some of her old matches. She wanted him to observe and take notes which she would then review. Marc had done what she asked without complaint. Truth be told, he was curious as to Bast's behavior in the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he had seen had been amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBast wasn't just capable of altering her size. She could alter her body's proportions and ratio of fat and muscle. He had seen her shrink herself in the middle of a fight to avoid a hit, only to retaliate by suddenly overloading her arms with muscle and striking back with a blow powerful enough to knock her opponent out. Or take to the air above her foe, expand herself with fat and then dive in on them like a wrecking ball. Every video he watched, Marc got to see something different and all the while he took notes. He'd gotten to see quite a few different kind of fighters at the ASL, but none of them were on the level that Bast was displaying. Not just her size changing but how she used it. She didn't repeat maneuvers or tactics, seemingly on purpose. Marc figured that she didn't wish to become predictable, so she went out of her way to become predictable. He also noticed that Bast didn't like to meet opponents on their terms. If she was fighting an extremely large foe, she tended to keep herself smaller as to make them work at getting her or if the opponent was small, she assumed a larger form and used it to dictate the nature of the fight. These were just a handful of the things he noticed and jotted down.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc had been so engrossed in the viewing and his own note taking that he never noticed Bast, shrunk down to the size of a normal lion, come up behind him. He never noticed her seat herself behind him. He never noticed her presence as she peered over his shoulder to see what he was writing. He most certainly never noticed the smile she gave him after reading over his detailed observations. He absolutely did not notice as she slowly had her form expand with fat, becoming bigger and softer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he finally did notice was when leaned back and met Bast's soft furred girth. Marc snapped around in surprise, eyes wide. He was now leaning on Bast's expanded belly with the sphinx curled around him, her face bearing a large smile that revealed her fangs. She looked utterly amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, hi there, milady.\" Marc stuttered out. \"Can I-I help you with anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" Bast gave a small giggle. \"I've just been watching you work for a while now and thought that you might need something soft to lay against. Besides you seem very taken with ability to change my body. I thought you might enjoy seeing it first hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc composed himself. \"Well, yeah. Definitely. It's amazing. All the avenues of attack, defense or avoidance...it's just something I haven't seen since I came here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBast nodded, her chest puffing out in pride. \"It is an ability that I've spent a long time cultivating. That said...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Keeps her long ears tied back, giving them a look similar to a ponytail. Has one rather long bang of blonde hair. Body-wise, she has an exaggerated apple shape with strong arms and legs. Usually wears a red leotard for fights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Description:</i> May is a veteran ASL fighter and while not the biggest or even the meanest, she ranks among the most skilled and is quite strong, having been fighting for years. She's been nicknamed 'Mayday' because of how many opponents she's actually sent running out of the ring just to get away from the beating she was giving them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the ring, May is confident and easygoing for the most part. Most insults just slide off her if she doesn't respond in kind. She's seen a lot in the ASL and done more then a little banter, so it takes quite a bit to get under her skin. Just a little over forty, May is quite proud of her overall good looks and has little problem with teasing younger men. She's a notable flirt, to the point of being a gadfly. As such she likes to poke and prod reactions out most males around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, this behavior stems from May's past. At one point, she was married and quite content for some years before it all fell apart. She eventually discovered that her husband was cheating on her. When she confronted her husband about it, he literally ran away rather than face her. He even went as far as to divorce her entirely through attorneys rather than ever see her face to face again. The entire debacle has left May more insecure then she liked to admit. Her husband's affair plus his refusal to deal with her has made her truly question about her feminine charms and as such, she overcompensates. Worse yet, she knows that she's getting older and her chances of really finding someone again are slipping by. This is further complicated because her fierce reputation as a fighter intimidates most males away from her, which serves only to make her pursue them all the more, creating a vicious cycle... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and don't call a 'Lola' or a 'bunny'. You'll live longer that way. God help you if you call her both...these seem to be the only proven, consistent method to make May truly angry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was where fighters could rise or fall. That was how it worked when you were in the middle. Because of this, this was the part of the Anthro Sumo League with the most fighters. The girls here were only slightly smaller than the biggest gals in the Gold Division. However, Marc was nervous. A lot of girls here meant a lot of variation. There was Rika, the flirtatious fat cat who taunted her opponents and tended to flirt with her servants just as much, while there was also anthro girls who could be downright mean and cruel. Marc had heard that his particular mistress had \u201cbroken\u201d the last human assigned to her and that she was particularly as brutal as heels came. Marc just let out a scoff. \u201cHow bad could she be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc kept looking at the destination number \u201c094\u201d written on his slip of paper. However, he was so busy looking at that slip of paper that he wasn\u2019t paying attention to wear he was going and wound up bumping into something large an indigo. Marc hit the ground and grunted as he dropped his paper. \"Watch where you're going you fat bastard!\" However, Marc then looks up and gasps in fear. He was standing in front of a 20'1\" hippopotamus woman. She had red-hair worn in a mullet style and was titanically obese, even for a sumo wrestler. Her stomach looked big enough to fit two cars in it, she had H-cup breasts and a thunderous ass that was even bigger than either her stomach or breasts. She was wearing a skimpy black bikini with skulls at the crotch and nipple areas and had bright pink lips. Her mouth opened to reveal her horrifying teeth, a black hole big enough to swallow three human basketball players and a giant pierced red tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's face turned pale white. He had just insulted Dominique, the deadliest heel this side of the Silver Division. Dominique was a hard hearted hippo who liked to crush her openings with her massive ass. There was even a rumor that she used it to swallow a man whole. Speaking of men, Dominique was the biggest man-hater in the entire ASL and she used her male human servants to vent her hate of men. But she wasn't like this. Once she was a very sweet woman and a police detective even. She was engaged to a human man as well. She believed it was wrong for anthros to swallow up humans. However, that all changed when her human groom not only left her at the alter, but was caught by Dominique with another, much smaller woman. From then on, Dominique had nothing but hate for humans, quit her job, turned to black magic and joined the ASL. And now, Marc had angered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans should watch their tongues around anthros,\" said Dominique bitterly. \"Especially rather large ones.\" Marc tried to back away but Dominique grabbed him with one hand and squeezed him.\" Dominique then took the paper from Marc and read it. \"From the looks of it,\" she said. \"I'm your new mistress. And you've just angered me. Now, how to punish you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc sweated because now he really screwed up. How exactly does Dominique punish him?</span></div></div>",

M... Mistress Dominique.\" Marc grunted and Dominique held out her sharp thumb and used it to draw a magic symbol of some kind on his forehead. Dominique chanted in some kind of strange magical language and the symbol begun to glow bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gasped in fear, too scared to speak. Another thing that was known about Dominique was the rumor that trained herself in dark magical arts and used that to her advantage in the sumo ring. Most of her spells were horrible curses. During one battle against a larger elephant woman, Dominique put a curse on the elephant titaness to give her intense head pain. It wasn't a survival match, so Dominique let her live but that elephant woman wasn't clear to fight for three whole weeks. And now Dominique was placing one of her horrifying curses on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique kept chanting as a magical circle appeared around Marc. Marc panicked and tried to run out of the magical circle but the circle created a cylinder-shaped magical barrier that shocked Marc when he tried to leave the circle. \"Please!\" yelled Marc. \"Isn't this a little extreme?\" Dominique gave a look of pure anger at Marc. \"All men must be punished,\" said Dominique. \"There is no extreme that I won't go to to make human men suffer for the wrongs they committed against me.\" Dominique continued chanting and then Mark held his head in absolute pain. His vision was blurring but he could've sworn that as massive as Dominique was, she was getting even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc groaned in pain and dragged his hand across the magical barrier as he collapsed to the ground. It wasn't long before Dominique finished chanting the spell and the magic circle and barrier vanished. Marc panted as he stood up and then he heard a rumbling, he turned around and then there was a tremor that knocked him in front of something enormous and reddish pink. Marc got up and gasped because that large reddish pink thing in front of him was one of Dominique's toenails. Marc looked up and saw Dominique's massive belly blocking his sight. He stepped back and he was able to see Dominique's boobs. That's when Marc realized what the curse was. He had been shrunken to an inch tall and at 20' 1\", Dominique was over 240 times bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc then yelled as Dominique bent over and picked him up by the leg, holding him in front of her massive snout. Marc shivered as Dominique opened her galaxy-sized mouth. He feared she was going to eat him. But instead, the hippopotamus sorceress just gave a snort. \"If only I can make all men in this world as small as I just made you. I've decided that if you're going to be disrespectful, then for as long as you serve me, until your contract expires or you first, you will be the size of an insect. And just remember, only I can remove this spell.\" Marc couldn't believe it. Because he offended this hippopotamus witch, he'd spend the next 5 years shrunken in size. Providing he lived that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Dominique let Marc go and Marc screamed as he fell into a small glass bottle that the hippopotamus titaness proceeded to cork and shut. Marc could see the hippo smile evilly before she turned around, giving him a view of her 30' wide ass. She then proceeded to pull back her bikini bottom before placing the bottom between her enormous butt cheeks. Marc saw the indigo walls of flesh shut as he was trapped. He tapped the sides of the bottle but it was no avail because he was trapped and his hippo mistress was far from through tormenting him as she walked away, her flesh shaking with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Dominique heading?</span></div></div>",

He'd given up on any sort of shouting or jumping around the bottle, knowing such was useless--even Dominique probably couldn't hear his shrunken voice though the bottle AND his hippo mistress's enormous rear, and if she could it would only amuse her. So all Marc could do was sit and cower, wondering what awaited him at the hands of his man-hating and sadistic mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't even guess where she was taking him, since the bottle's cork and, of course, her entrapping behind and bikini blocked any view of the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it--why would those paper-shuffling jackasses assign ME to an anthro who's known to despise men? This job is dangerous enough already; do these people WANT their employees to die?\" Marc's ranting went unanswered, aside from a slight echo. But ANYTHING was worth taking his mind off his fear...if he didn't, Marc knew he'd start crying. So the rant continued: \"But then again, they weren't exactly honest about my contract, just 'Oh by the way; you have to stay for <i>five goddamn YEARS</i>, no big deal!' Total bullshit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then again, I didn't exactly make the best first impression. The first thing I do is call her a fat bastard? Really? Way to make it worse, idiot.\" Marc slapped his own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to continue ranting when the muffled sound of a massive door closing suddenly rang out. Marc looked up to see Dominique's bikini rustle above him, then slowly peel back to reveal a harsh ray of light that cut through the darkness and made him cringe away. When he looked back up, he caught a terribly familiar hand reaching down to grab the bottle he'd been shoved in. The world seemed to blur and tumble as his glass prison was rudely yanked upwards, followed by an ear-splitting <i><b>POP</b></i> as the cork was removed. Then the bottle tilted almost vertically, sending Marc rolling arse-over-teakettle out of the bottle...and into Dominique's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could speak, the massive hand constricted into a fist around his body, pinning his limbs and making him gasp in pain. Fear gripped Marc anew as his view was filled with Dominique's gigantic face and its hate-filled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted and...<i>smiled</i>. It was a tiny quirk of the lips, but just seeing her smile made Marc go pale. \"Welcome to your punishment, insect. I thought about heading off for some training, but after your behavior, I thought my quarters would be more appropriate.\" A quick look around confirmed that he had indeed been taken to Dominique's private room: upscale furniture and immaculately-clean carpet was everywhere, from the sleek widescreen TV to the luxurious red leather sofa. <br>\r\n\"I'd hate to be interrupted by one of the other women here--can't have you getting rescued...or having to share you.\" Dominique squeezed her fist, making Marc yelp in pain. \"Hurts, does it not? I could reduce you to paste in a second, swallow you whole and hardly notice...but I won't, even if you DO deserve it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly licked her lips, cracking that tiny terrible smile again. Marc whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But I won't. No, that would be to quick; too anticlimactic. I've disposed of other men sent to me fast before, but now...I'll be patient. I'll make it LAST. And to start it off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique wore her tiny, demonic smile yet again as she....</span></div></div>",

At Marc's current size, they were as tall as skyscrapers. Marc sweated in fear. \"What she's going to do?\" thought Marc. \"Oh no. She's going to swallow me. But wait. She said she was going to make the torment last. How would... whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Dominique dropped Marc and Marc screamed as he fell for what seemed like minutes as he saw nothing but his hippopotamus mistress's enormous and blubbery, indigo blue body. Finally, Marc grunted because he landed on something, but it wasn't something that was particularly soft. He stood up in pain and looked around to see a horizon of thick red leather, with even several buttons in some places. \"What?\" asked Marc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Marc realized where he was and was filled with dread. He was on Dominique's bright red sofa. The shrunken human then heard maniacal laughter and then looked up to see Dominique smiling maliciously as she turned around and showed him her enormous rear end that looked like it was much wider than she was tall. From Marc's perspective, the hippopotamus sorceress's butt was an entire mountain range and it was wiggling and Marc looked in fear. \"You like what you see, bug?\" asked Dominique as she hovered her butt right over her tiny servant. \"Back before I was blind to the deceptive ways of human men, the man who would crush my heart with his fist would tell me this was his favorite part of me. Well, from what you can see, it <i>is</i> the biggest part of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc stepped back as Dominique was slowly starting to sit down. \"P-Please! D-Don't do this!\" Dominique gave an angry look. \"You're all alike,\" said the hippopotamus sorceress. \"You insult me and then you beg for a way out of your punishment. It makes me sick!\" Marc tried to climb the sofa to his escape but he slipped and nearly fell off and saw nothing but his mistress's rear over his head as he screamed. Dominique's behind was so big that it completely overshadowed the entire sofa. Before Marc knew it, Dominique brought her butt down with an enormous boom and he was pinned underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let out muffled screams as Dominique ground her rear into the soft sofa and positioned her butt until it was practically enveloping Marc, even underneath her body. Marc grunted and yelled as Dominique even bounced up and down and smirked wickedly. \"Oh yes,\" said Dominique. \"My most dangerous weapon, aside from my magic. You deserve every second of this torment, you puny worm.\" Dominique squeezes her flabby rear as Marc is pushed between the cheeks and screams.\" Dominique gave a toothy grin as she continued to squeeze her rear. \"Now,\" said the hippopotamus to her shrunken servant. \"How can I make this more tortuous? Ah, I've got it!\"</span></div></div>",

Super-obese and apple shaped, but supported by enough muscle that their mobility isn\u2019t a surprising feat. They have brown scales with a white under belly, along with yellow eyes, long black hair, and orange horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving spent no living moment of their lives apart, Candace and Olivia share an existence based just as much on their reliance on one another as much as hate. On top of both having only one half of a body to control on their own, the two are polar opposites who each have their own work ethics and style of fighting that they prefer; Candace, easily the most level headed of the two, bases her training on working out and studying her enemies\u2019 weaknesses, and believes in treating their servants with plenty of kindness and respect, whereas Olivia is just a gluttonous, boorish slob who\u2019s \u201cmethod\u201d boils down to putting on as loud and nasty of a fight that she can, and sees humans as little more than edible stress balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt certain points, with some concentration, either of the two can seize control of their entire body from the other, leaving the other with nothing but moving their head about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Carly</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Zebra.<br>\r\nHeight: 21\u20196\u201d<br>\r\nAppearance: Incredibly fat with an enormous stomach and colossal tits, yet both are outnumbered by the girth of her ass, whose width comes dangerously close to matching her height. Her body is black and white striped with long, wavy hair dyed blue at the tips, with brown eyes and an abnormally thick lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly lives under an impenetrable delusion that every male she\u2019s alone with is not only her boyfriend, but that they\u2019re so madly in love with one another that neither of them know any sexual boundaries, regardless of how long they may have known one another. Carly is in almost near-constant need of attention from her servants, considering herself such the backbreaker in her \u2018relationship\u2019 that her ludicrous demands or lusts should be absolved without question, and that any amount of physical or mental harm left on her playthings is just a debt long underpaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stacey</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Phoenix.<br>\r\nHeight: 29\u20198\u201d<br>\r\nAppearance: Massively obese and apple-shaped, so much so that she shouldn\u2019t be mobile, but can somehow still move by her hunger alone. Has silver feathers that are streaked with black along her wings, stomach, and around her eyes, with a black beak and black claws. Her eyes are red with black sclera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Pearl\u2019s gluttony, Roxanne\u2019s cruelty, and Dominique\u2019s hatred for humans had a child, it would grow up to be Stacey. Never was Stacey ever raised or learned to take joy from being kind to others, instead growing up in a wealthy lifestyle of getting whatever she wanted whenever she wanted, eating and growing on a diet of meals that consisted entirely of human meat. She\u2019s perpetually hungry, but has a voracious need for meat that, if her lust for devouring humans were directed on anthros, would\u2019ve been the kind of cruelty only expected out of a serial killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny chance a human under her watch has depends on if she\u2019s hungry or sadistic enough to torture her \u201cslaves\u201d for a while, a term she considers too kind for them.</span></div></div>",

Down to her skin, wings and hair, Indrid\u2019s body is washed entirely in a nightly black, save for her eyes, which glow a blood red even in the brightest light. Hair is done in a messy pixie cut. Has two arms and two legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce only the size of a stout-bodied human, the target of many a sneer from her superiors at the thought surviving any further than her first battle, Indrid would eventually gorge herself into a size with all the luxurious curves of an oversized wrecking ball and establish herself as one of the most feared fighters to climb the ASL\u2019s social ladder, a title that pleases her all too well, considering that she literally eats fear. Despite rarely ever raising her voice, Indrid possesses a menace that can be felt from across the room, possessing an array of supernatural abilities that, aside from making her a top-notch fighter despite her size, enables her to describe deeply personal information of people she\u2019d only just met, and her powers reach frighteningly potent levels in total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of training and labor, Indrid doesn\u2019t really have much use for humans, but nonetheless exploits them by inflicting constant mental and physical torment on them in order to consume and grow off of their terror; she always insists on them sleeping in the same bed as her, not out of affection, but to always be assured that their last waking moments in the day are spent listening to her whisper their greatest fears into their ears, and that their dreams are nightmares of her, so she may thrive off of them even in the dream realm. Should a human manage to brave up to her torture sessions, she merely tosses them away by eating them so she can thrive off of their fear of death, bloating her up to even more gargantuan proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Veronica</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Wasp<br>\r\nHeight: 29\u20197\u201d<br>\r\nAppearance: Black and yellow-striped, with long, cascading locks of swirling hair the color of dark chocolate. Veronica possesses a stomach and pair of breasts that to a human\u2019s size would befit a lady weighing eight-hundred pounds, yet both are compromised by hulking legs and a titanic ass that make it a slaving task to haul her off the ground during her glutting sessions, but makes for a tremendous weapon in the ring that can knock down and smother even some of the largest fighters in the silver division, also shelving a stinger the size of a small house. Is middle aged, but can pass for twenty years younger, aside from some crow\u2019s feet and the occasional graying hair. Like Indrid, she has two arms and two legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA queen more in spirit than in blood, Veronica lives in a sense of self-worth and avarice unseen even by many in the gold division, always gorging herself on honey that covers her like treesap. She may not a legitimate queen by any means, but nonetheless carries a constant need for food, washing, pampering, and \u2018man meat\u2019 to have squashed nightly beneath her titanic mass that she could easily pass, even on the few occasions where she doesn\u2019t use her \u2018best plaything\u2019 on her servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways capped off whenever she\u2019s placed into a fight, so as not to give her an unfair advantage, Veronica\u2019s stinger possesses a bizarre strain of venom that reduces any victim it\u2019s inflicted on but a passenger in their own brain, reduced to watching as their arms and legs are manipulated to whatever command comes from Veronica\u2019s moth, robbed even of the privilege of screaming for help as their mouths autonomically sing her the holiest of praises...</span></div></div>",

Yes, there was some admittedly cruel satisfaction to be had in witnessing another bitchy diva he\u2019d spent weeks slaving after get dragged kicking and screaming to a slow death in another fighter\u2019s belly, but then came the power vacuum for another evil, possibly an even worse one to stomp in to take the mantle as his caretaker, and the prospect of being the next slave for the likes of Dominique or Gloria Gator was allowed to step up as an actual threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least there was always the note to look forward to, that machine-produced strip of paper that would lay down his next mistress\u2019 name with promises of fun and excitement taped on top of the thrashings that\u2019d be in store for him. Not enough to totally quell over his fears, but to at least give him a remote sense of closure. No slip was there for him that day, taking away from him that cruel relief. In its place two figures known well by the staff, carrying something that shook up his already unsteady emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Mister Youngblood, hello! I take you\u2019re ready for your next mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMister Talon.\u201d Marc greeted, giving the prim-dressed velociraptor a stiff nod that he repeated for the figure to his side, a business-y cat woman of equal size and stature. \u201cMiss Pierce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Dante Talon smiled all the time. As did car salesman when they were squeezing extra payment for a van with no seat belts, but as often as Nicole Pierce appeared to keep up to date on Marc\u2019s job performance, he had never, ever seen her smile before. The closest was when her mother had been reinstated to the ASL, but it was just a half-hidden smirk then, hiding her joy from the reporters so Mommy could eat up the limelight once more. Here before him was a warm grin that seemed like she was catching up with a dear friend of hers, something she\u2019d made sure to be clear Marc would find rare to make in the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about the lack of your slip, but we had news for you that had to be spoken of in person.\u201d Miss Pierce elaborated, aware of the edge Marc was on, but made no effort to give him total answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it my contract\u2019s been shredded by accident, and I can go?\u201d Came the monkeys-on-typewriter\u2019s fantasy Marc had always pined for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA round of laughter came from the two, conspicuously <i>not</i> the smack on the head with a tail for joking about losing his occupation. \u201cEven better!\u201d Miss Pierce insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been assigned to Avery Etherglades!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a deal to take for granted. A tough fighter who never took survival matches, very unlikely to see die, but known to be amiable with her servants. But all said, \u201cwhy would you guys be here to tell me, instead of the note?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrinting malfunction.\u201d Their voices blended in harmony their bodies flexing in tandem to step aside and offer Marc to be lead. \u201cShall we?\u201d Dante offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, how about first I\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSplendid!\u201d Dante intruded, mirroring Nicole\u2019s movements in stooping down to take Marc by the shoulders, whose feet briefly jittered to keep up as he was forced to march off to his mistress\u2019 division.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what the <i>hell</i> is going on here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite standing right in front of \u201cAvery\u2019s\u201d room, Marc was still in the dark as to who he was being assigned to. Instead of her residence in the gold division, it was the white-walled corridors of the silver, at a room whose number was scratched off, unidentifiable outside of a multitude of locks keeping it shut. Not uncommon, considering how paranoid many fighters were for spies, but not the least bit comforting to Marc and all his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two superiors at last quit the cheery act, Dante turning the other way as Nicole stood next to the door\u2019s locks, laying a hand against the wall in thought, but Marc sought his own answers and gave a running start to leap up to the keyhole. His fingers hooked onto its rim, enough to pull himself upwards to peer inside, and he saw...red. A solid field of red with no room to look into, no sound inside to determine its owners movements, or even air blowing back in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let himself fall, marching up to Dante\u2019s legs. \u201cListen, I know I\u2019m nothing but toilet paper to you guys, but you could at least stop lying to me and just get on with...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Dante turned around. Marc flinched, observing his boss\u2019 new expression with equal shock, but then it all added up upon realizing a superior was giving him something to fear far more than a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc\u2019s single plea was heard by the rapid-fire of the door\u2019s locks being unlatched, his head spinning over to see Miss pierce unlocking them with frantic eyes. When Dante saw the distraction and dove to snatchuyjh- him off the floor, Marc lost whatever will towards his contract he had left and bit his boss in the arms, legs flailing to catch a few good blows at his kneecaps, but only ached his teeth at the scales under his suit\u2019s sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, kid.\u201d Dante listed in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMister Talon, for the love of god, just give me to <i>Dominique!</i>\u201d Marc squealed, his screams inviting a few doors in the hallway to crack open. Upon seeing that it was a human to be tossed into his next mistress\u2019 room, most just slinked back into their rooms, but the rest kept their heads poked out of their doorways when they saw to whose he was being transferred, some in curiosity, some in pity. \u201cHell, give me to <i>Gloria!</i> Pearl, Sapphire, Roxanne, Carly, Crumpet, Sasha, ANYBODY BUT <i><b>INDRID!!!</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with a final click that Nicole yanked the door open, leaving intact a chain that prevented it from being opened farther than needed for a human to be tossed in, and Dante came through and lobbed Marc into the dark room, the two only assuring he\u2019d landed in entirely before slamming it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit, Dante, hurry up and help me lock these!\u201d Nicole snapped, engaging in re-locking the doorway. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk Indrid escaping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, Nicole, just...just let me pray, alright?\u201d Dante shut his eyes and bowed, offering a few quick words asking forgiveness from above before stepping up to aid his coworker.</span></div></div>",

When the last lock was set, the pitter-patter of their feet set out to leave him to his fate, the one that even the mightiest fighters of the ASL hurried to avoid conversing of. Even the likes of Dominique and Gloria, the latter of whom once left a press conference early when asked if she\u2019d take Indrid on in the ring one day. They may have been cruel, but at least they didn\u2019t crawl out from people\u2019s TV screens and into their rooms to eat them, or appear in your room to slaughter you with their hook-hand if you spoke their name five times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came a drafty wisp of air tracing over his spine, daring him to stare back in an act that pained his soul. His first look at a new mistress\u2019 room would give him some outlook on how they lived their lives: trophies and posters if they were loud blowhards, pretty knick-knacks and expensive jewelry for the socialites, all further hints on how many and how big of punishments he\u2019d experience on the job. However, Indrid\u2019s sense of living came to the bare essentials: a rusted bedframe carrying a skeletal mattress that Marc\u2019d probably see laying in the alley behind a run-down motel. The room probably would\u2019ve been inhabitable outright if not for a single light bulb hanging over the foot of the bed, its dirty filament casting only enough light to see layers of dust and grime left untouched on the walls for several years, unbothered by so much as a picture frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and huddled in the corner, crowded next to a record player whose horn sang <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OyP5aLP4Keg\">an antique tune infested with static,</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OyP5aLP4Keg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> sat a tremendous pile of solidified darkness, squirming in seemingly amorphous movements that were too far from the light for Marc to tell just who or <i>what</i> it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heap of black froze in shape, its exterior bristling at the dainty peep Marc had emitted, then straightened out, stretching higher and higher on a substantial amount of height, but nonetheless maintained its massive breadth, putting its immensity over par with a rich man\u2019s house. Marc furrowed his eyes to make out any detail of what part of its body was what, if just an arm, leg, anything less than a <i>fingernail</i>, yet the most he could scrutinize was a fleshy dollop at its very peak, capped with scruffy hair split by two ropey antennae draped over their owner\u2019s back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen two slivers of red light tearing open along its face that widened into two solid bulbs, staring right back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Marc could say was extinguished at the very thought as he wondered if Indrid could even understand him, that she was even a being whose sense of morality bore any resemblance to even the ass-backwards logic of the ASL\u2019s. Observing her new playmate remain huddled against the locked doorway with enough time for her to lunge on him twice, her head bent down, the same way a wild cat\u2019s would when it was preparing too tear into an unexpecting gazelle, then twitched to the lightbulb, her entire form rolling over to its dusty spotlight. Just her stepping up underneath caused its light to fizzle for a few seconds, its wire shivering in a breeze brought on by her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the aged lightbulb gave Indrid crystal clarity, considering her entire biology, likely down to her bones and internal organs, were imbued a black that consumed more of the light than it could reflect, but there was a sliver of comfort in that it gave her <i>some</i> tangible form. Without being reduced to a comatose vegetable out of fear, as many rumored in the coffee room, he could see right into her face, or at least the borderline total lack of; her head was completely devoid of a nose or any nostrils, her breathing thus reduced to a chilly strings of hisses through a mouth hidden beneath the underside of her vaguely bean-shaped head, only able to emote via two enormous compound eyes that burned with a hellish red even in the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose eyes calculated her new slave\u2019s mindset with zero amounts of love or hate past two broad cheeks flanking either side of her head, teetering along a cascade of three chin-rolls occupying her neckspace that merged amongst unkempt-grass style fur and plush cleavage rising up from the super-stretched collar of a rotted garment keeping her chest contained. Wide, spanning shoulders addled with paunch and bulk hoisted a bosom putting immense pressure on the very crux of her shirt, her breasts billowing outwards beyond the limits of what her pillowy arms could extend to, but both were merely the mushroom\u2019s cap to everything from the chest down, her predominate immensity avalanching past her bustling from below and onto the floor in her stomach, a spheric mass of chitin expanded to such ludicrous proportions that even standing still couldn\u2019t be done without the all-encompassing distance of floorboards it coated erupting into loud flexing sounds under its indomitable weight, as her legs, as cumbersome as they were, sat obscured from behind save for the very slivers of either hip, too little in such little light for him to tell if her lower half was clothed, or even if she was wearing any underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, while at a size advantage where she\u2019d be able to bloodily end his life with an act no harder than pushing a pinkie finger through his chest...progress. She was a being of flesh and blood, not some cosmic monstrosity of some different realm, which meant she could be studied and understood. Perhaps, if given a heavy dosage of optimism, reasoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...you\u2019re Indrid.\u201d Marc jabbed his fingernails in his own palm, the pain preventing him from letting a \u2018duh\u2019 spill out by accident. \u201cMy name\u2019s Ma-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Marcus...Waldreignewizch...Youngblood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid\u2019s antennae twitched, sensing the initial spark of fear she\u2019d earned out of Marc. That damn middle name...the one that had subjected him to so many mispronunciations and teasing that he\u2019d sworn it off by middle school, writing it as a shameful \u201cW\u201d unless he absolutely had to, never saying it outright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid not only knew every letter by heart, but pronounced it as well as his own grandparents would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve...you\u2019ve read my application, then?\u201d He insisted. Maybe to Indrid, maybe to himself, maybe to the hands of fate who\u2019d dealt him this hand to begin with, who were no doubt still laughing their asses off. \u201cThat\u2019s mighty kind of you t-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Born under June and Miles Youngblood.\u201d She prattled on. \u201cLatter died when you were age four. Earliest...<i>only</i> memory of him the county fair, riding the roller coaster with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer antennae twitched again, but she was able to see the terror firsthand as Marc curled up into a ball with his back to the door, inching towards the corner to achieve what little distance from the titanic moth it could supply him. \u201cH...How did...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid\u2019s eyes honed in on him, thirsty for the sweet, tangy fear that he carried, and she stepped forward, entering the same patch of shadow that Marc resided in. Her wings fluttered open and flared over her back, blocking off more of the light, and with less of her form to see, her motions seemed all the more liquid as she approached him like the darkness trapped in the most repressed part of his mind were leaking out and entering the room in a tidal wave of sapient abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You know what?\u201d Marc reasoned, willing to cut his losses to get out of hearing Indrid ramble off his childhood memories. \u201cYou want me to fear you? Fine. I\u2019m scared. Hell, you want me to piss my pants? I can just...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid instead rolled forward against her own belly so she could shove her head right into the air he was breathing, more of the bulb\u2019s light vanishing behind her titanic butt. He skittered into the corner, with Indrid following suit so he couldn\u2019t increase the gap between him and her eyes, no further than what allowed him to see his own reflection in them. He was more gaunt, maybe just as terrified as what he was staring back at, but maybe not as distorted as her eyes made him out to be, his eyes rolling back and jaw twisted around as the corpse to one who was literally scared to death would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust enough to keep him from reacting too early to a fatty, three-fingered hand to enter the red glow and snap around his neck. Her thumb prodded onto his windpipe, keeping him plenty silent as she opened her maw and lulled her tongue out, a fat, oil-slick black tentacle that painted his face with saliva, eyes flittering in the first traces of emotion he could feel off her as she <i>relished</i> in his strangled attempts to scream, the squirming under her thumb to release the pressure binding him to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear...\u2019 She observed aloud, inviting her tongue back so she could stare at him with perhaps the only other emotion he thought she could feel: hunger. \u201cNeed...<i>more...</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Indrid goes for all the physical fears. Crushing, squashing, all that phun stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Indrid casts her magic, resorting to more otherworldly means to extract fear from Marc!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Indrid forces Marc to watch bad movies, or some other spoofy route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Whatever worse things you can come up with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd been holding him by his throat for nearly a minute and he hadn't even been able to take a breath before she seized him. His struggles were useless. Not only was she at a level of strength he couldn't hope to reach in his lifetime, but from the way her antennae twitched, he was positive his fear was just more fuel for her. He'd stop if he could but his reaction was involuntary. It was animal instinct, something humans had been unable to break free of no matter how much they thought they were different from anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he struggled, the oil-black tongue ran over his face again and again, sampling him like a lollipop. Marc was too terrified to even be disgusted. His vision was almost gone when the tongue retreated suddenly and something like disappointment registered in her hellish red eyes. Only now did it seem to dawn on her that whatever fear she was busy slurping down off him like a milkshake was running low as the life left his body. She released her hold on his neck and Marc was finally able to take a deep breath. He'd been so convinced he'd been about to meet his loved ones at the pearly gates that he felt a wave of relief wash over him as he realized he wouldn't be shuffling off his mortal coil quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the good news. The bad news was that relief was the opposite of what Indred wanted to get from him. She stood to her full height and lifted him by the scruff of his shirt so that his face was still inches from hers. She sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need... more... fear,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid!\" Marc choked out, gasping for air, his heart rate starting to go up again in dread anticipation of what would happen next. \"I swear I'm afraid! I'm the fraidiest human you'll ever see, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndred gave no sign she was listening to him. Guess she only cared what her food <i>felt</i>, not what it <i>said</i>. Her antennae gave another twitch and Marc knew what that meant. He tried not to think of anything as she delved into his mind, but he suspected it had no impact on her telepathic abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six years ago...\" she said. \"You were on the bus to visit your great-aunt... A man was sleeping in the seat across from you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, not that!</i> Marc thought, the memory coming back to him as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus was for humans and anthros. A mammoth woman had boarded. She was one of the fattest anthros Marc had ever seen. She had massive headphones on over her massive ears, and was singing along badly to the crappy pop music she was listening to. She didn't see the man who'd slumped down asleep in his seat. She didn't hear Marc as he yelled to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, baby, we've got a bond no one can sever! You'll see boy, you belong to me forever!\" the mammoth sang horribly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and the man vanished. Marc leapt to his feet and pulled on her arm, trying to get her to get up, like a little kid trying to get an adult's attention. The mammoth woman opened an eye at his touch and gave him an annoyed look. She still couldn't hear him over the music. The exact science of human durability was still being researched in this crazy world of giant, humanoid animals living alongside humans. Some humans could take extreme amounts of punishment without breaking. Others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRUNCH!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mammoth sank a few inches down into her seat, as if the chair had collapsed inward, then leapt to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EW!\" she shrieked. \"Who left something wet in my seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His body,\" Indred said in the present. \"So red... pulverized... face twisted in pain. The first human you'd ever seen crushed--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Marc screamed. \"JUST SHUT UP! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yessssssssssss,\"</i> Indred hissed, antennae twitching again. \"Won't <i>hear</i> anymore. Actions, speak louder, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Marc whimpered. \"Please, you can't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndred didn't bother to respond. She carried Marc as effortlessly as a kitten. The room shook with her four footsteps, the floor groaning under the weight of her massive gut as it dragged over the floor. She approached the bed, with its rusted metal frame looking like a prime delivery system for lockjaw, its filthy mattress looking like something from a crime scene. She dropped him on it without a word. He tried to scramble off but the red eyes glowed all the brighter against the shadowy face and Marc was frozen in fear. He didn't move even as she turned around and displayed an ass the size of a small planet. Something so massive that surely he stood no chance against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass descended. Marc screamed but when she landed the wind was knocked out of him. Only his bottom half was underneath her, pinned helpless beneath her backside. The mattress creaked under her weight, the bedframe sagging, the springs poking into Marc's back like instruments of torture from the Dark Ages. His upper half was forced up into her ass crack. The pain was excruciating. About the only mercy she gave him was that she didn't sit on him with her full-weight, her front legs still holding up some of her though her back legs hung limp. Even then, Marc knew it wasn't true mercy. It was just a way to prolong his suffering. He pushed against the wall of insect abdomen covered in grass-like fur, trying to open some space so he could wiggle free of the unbearable pain but it was impossible. As he struggled, Indred spoke softly, but he could hear her crystal-clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've often pondered what the man's final thoughts were. You hope he slept through the whole thing... but you know that's not true. He was awake just long enough to know what was happening, to feel his bones rendered to powder, to feel his flesh burst apart at the seems like a water balloon. He had enough time to scream for help that would never come. You know what's like, don't you? Screaming for help and being ignored. I heard it as your employers delivered you to me. I promise you'll know the rest of what that man felt soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke she steadily increased her weight on him, taking it off her front legs and leaning back more and more. Marc swore she was telling the truth. His legs felt like they were breaking, his stomach and chest felt like they were caving in, making it next to impossible to breath, only getting short gasps as his face dug into her fur. He knew his bones and organs must've been turning to a flat paste inside him, and as she worked her ass further and further back, they would eventually pop up out of the top of his head like someone trying to get every last bit out of a container of toothpaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see boy, you belong to me forever,\" Indred sang tunelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe verse elicited another surge of fear. Marc gave another scream of pain and horror as Indred scooched back, causing him to vanish completely, his entire body devoured by her crack. Though he was completely invisible to the outside world, and far from her pitch black mouth, Indred still salivated as she savored his delicious fear. Technically she hadn't needed to lick him earlier. She fed off fear in a more abstract way. However, it was a good intimidation tact, and human flavor was still enjoyable in its own way, just as the squirms and struggles of his panicked body beneath her were similarly enjoyable, not just for the fear it elicited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all his panic, she hadn't broken anything inside him... yet... but it was so easy for her to go inside his mind and plant a small idea inside. The irrationality of it, his conviction that he was dying, it made his fear all the sweeter. Pain was always something she enjoyed inflicting on others, whether physical or mental, but she often found mental anguish to be more beneficial in the long-term. Why let a good source of food go to waste by breaking it too quickly? Besides, she knew how to doll out physical pain even while restraining herself. She proved it to herself by clenching her cheeks a few time, mangling Marc further and eliciting more sweet struggles and even sweeter terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gorged herself for the next hour, she also spent her time looking through his memories. It turned out Marc had seen and survived a lot in the past. This was good. Not only did it mean she could run the gauntlet in utilizing her favorite methods of torture on someone who could live through it, it also gave him such sweet phobias for her to indulge in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had so many choices... which should she choose next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>True, Marc\u2019s traumatized teen memories couldn\u2019t cover every grisly detail of that poor bastard\u2019s demise, but thanks to the right mix of some mental surgery, creative thinking, and free time, Indrid had an abundant enough canvas to ensure that a little bit of every nightmare that Marc\u2019d recurred of that night was in every clenching of her asscheeks. Much the same as the ones where he was in that man\u2019s skin, feeling his skeleton be twisted from its joints before mashing into bony spines, his innards shredding into marinara before the endorphins could save him from the incomprehensible agony that preluded death. Her antennae swayed about to conduct his memories so all the \u2018could-of-dones\u2019 and what-ifs\u2019 he\u2019d buried in his mind\u2019s sewers flooded over and came to the surface, capsizing his thoughts so the rocking of the bed frame were the bumps on the road that that man innocently felt before seeing the wide, hairy face of his demise, his own wails of misery and agony distorted to split apart into the mourning sobs of the family that he\u2019d no doubt left behind. Hell, that the mammoth lady just farted on him when he was still alive to smell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of which she dealt with no satisfaction or remorse worse than shopping for her groceries. That is, sparing the ravenous pride of getting home, seating at the table with all her purchases, and downing them all in but minutes. The points of a smile poked up along the edge of Indrid\u2019s jaw as she massaged the growing excess hanging off her middle, a pert fear-baby expanding within her belly that she drummed at with the same adoration of a mother massaging kin growing inside of her...such love that rapidly eluded her grasp as its surface was absorbed past where she could feel it, her hands pushed away from reaching in any further by the paunch that puffed outwards to take its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the price of an all-fear diet. Nourishing, untamable addictive fear...but so short-lived in her stomach for it to fill her up before dissolving into calories to bloat her up even further, more bodily mass to feed and sustain. Those hissing breaths became damp with slobber as her cheeks obtained more volume, tainted by winces of strain as her stomach and breasts adopted further tonnage for her shoulders to lug about, the floor\u2019s constant groaning rising to even louder roars of stress as the mass and footprint of her leviathan of a belly extended from her. There was at least that extra little squeeze of terror from Marc as her behind grew around him, the rusty bed frame flattening as its ability to contain its weight and girth were surpassed, but all that lasted in his mind afterward were the pain of the situation, but the bones to the real meat of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid shut her legs one last time, keeping Marc from witnessing her unleash an unintimidating belch of gas, then released her posture and enabled Marc to tumble free, alive and unbroken, but awake only in the physical sense. None of his bones were broken; important, if she wanted him to keep on giving her meals, she\u2019d need him to have at least some integrity to know the horrors he was being inflicted by, but his limbs remained trapped in contorted mock-ups of his own crushed, bloodied remains, eyes rolled to their whites and jaw hanging crooked, ejecting an occasional husky croak. She let him lay twitching on the mattress for several minutes, his mind sampling that his limbs weren\u2019t actually smashed beyond repair and were still able to move, gradually flexing more and more as his eyes opened and shut, softening to the natural (lack of?) light of Indrid\u2019s apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he could finally flex his fingers, his body went limp at relief that the deaths he\u2019d lived and relived were all a nightmare, but then curled in the fetal position, shivering. Indrid just stared ahead, content that he wouldn\u2019t escape. The only way out was his means of entrance, locked so generously by their employers, but such was also the key to great torture; to compose great music was knowing that the silence between the notes could be just as important as the notes themselves, and farming for terror was no different in that it needed those occasional allowances for their anguish to still, giving hope for the sole purpose of snatching it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few dainty sobs were emitted from behind, Indrid cricked her head enough to observe Marc with his head wrapped in his arms, his shoulders occasionally trembling in tandem with his weeping. Swiveling her mountainous bulk around, she lay seated along the side and leaned over with an arm extended, something semblant of a comforting act that Marc understandably skittered away from when her claw tenderly lowered onto his back, but with too little fight in him to go far for her to struggle and reach him again, the hairs on her nubby digits sharp enough to cut his skin as her fingers draped onto his back, only to clamp around him and craned him off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc\u2019s legs dropped from her grasp like he was a dead animal, carrying none of the morale needed to even try and inflict any pain on her, or any form of protest as he was once again brought to the tip of Indrid\u2019s nostrilless snout, eyes glowing red light onto his body. Content by his submission, Indrid merely pointed her antennae at him to test his scent, also casting a silent spell or two to wash any germs from his body, then let him go, save for the very back of his collar that remained caught between her claw\u2019s very tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling him above her, Indrid pulled back and allow her head to unhinge by the mouth, her hair, face, and even eyes disappearing underneath her maw so he was only hung above a wet pit leading straight into her belly...her immediate top priority when she leafed through the very first time his mother taught him of what life could be like for a human in a world of anthros. The very fate she always swore never befell his dad whenever he asked, but couldn\u2019t avoid saying \u2018no\u2019 without a crack in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...d...don\u2019t...\u201d He sniffled, but lacked the fight to resist any further. \u201c...please...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid\u2019s maw engulfed him, her lips sucking him free of the points of her claws. Her tongue lashed about against her jaw and the roof of her mouth, effectively sobering Marc up to the reality of his demise, but too slow to really strategize anything past fighting her tongue like it were an alligator, his clawing at the black appendage mollified as he was twisted around, robbing him the dignity of seeing the outside world as her throat muscles clenched and pulled him down head-first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELP ME!!!\u201d He shrieked, crying as the darkness deepened past that of his closed eyes. \u201cSOMEBODY, PLEASE HELP ME!!! <i><b>I\u2019M SORRY, MOM!!!</b></i>\u201d</span></div></div>",

His head was already in her throat and with another audible gulp she sent his shoulders following. Marc felt her slime-covered esophagus constrict around him and pull him down deeper. He knew Indrid was purposefully drawing it out. He'd seen anthros down fully grown men in a single gulp, and given Indrid's strength and girth, he knew she could've done the same to him easily. But she didn't want this to be easy. She wanted this to be fun. She wanted him to kick and scream and beg for mercy and Marc, hating himself, did just that. He knew he was playing right into her hands, but he would take any chance at all to survive, debase himself in any way if it meant living to see another day. If she loved fear so much, he would show her that he was the best source of it in the ASL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear kept Indred fat and happy. Fear kept her strong and powerful. Fear kept her alive and well and her enemies dead and gone. But despite her preference for fear, despite her love of it, despite her ceaseless overindulgence of it, apparently that didn't mean Indred wouldn't indulge in warm blood and squirming flesh if the inclination took her. And, unfortunately for Marc, his blood was warm enough and his flesh was squirming enough to satisfy her. He felt her four claws running along her neck, gently caressing the spot where her meal had already begun its travel to its final resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother swallow and his arms were inside, free to claw at her throat to try to stop his descent, but it was just as futile as anything else he'd attempted. His hands made contact with a slimy surface and slipped off easily, unable to gain purchase. Another swallow and his torso followed. His legs were still in her mouth, kicking uselessly. Her monstrosity of a tongue reared up like a great wave and his legs began to slide further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndred only had one response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity took hold and Marc's gradual descent turned to a full-on plummet. Indred's throat conformed to his wriggling body easily. A brief fall and then he came into contact with a lake of stomach acid. He thrashed wildly before breaking through the surface. He took in a lungful of damp air. He heard the wet, squelching, pulsating sounds of Indred's innards. The liquid he soaked in was sour-smelling and tingled at his skin, already trying to break him down into basic nutrients. Darkness was all around him. Her insides were as black as night. It was like he'd been swallowed by a shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foul liquid came up to his waist. He waded his way to the slimy wall of her stomach. He pressed at it but it was taut instead of stretchy. He'd seen humans form screaming bulges from the inside of anthro guts before, but Indred's were unyielding. He wondered how many other humans had been in his situation, trapped in the stomach of an anthro that was so tough that they couldn't even make their presence known to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\" he screamed. \"LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words rang through the cavern of her stomach, echoing over and over again. The moth gave no answer. Maybe she couldn't hear him. Or maybe she had nothing to say to her <i>food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought brought up a fresh new wave of fear and suddenly Marc was punching at the damp walls. \"Let me out! Let me out! LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUT... Out... out... o.u..t...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchoes were his only answer. The walls of Indred's stomach were as strong as flesh-covered stone and it wasn't long before he stopped punching at them, terrified he'd break his hands if he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throat,\" he murmured, trying to calm his pounding heart. \"I can climb up through the throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was the entrance to the throat? He looked up and could see nothing. Minutes had passed and his eyes hadn't adjusted to the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he murmured, \"it's okay. It's probably in the center,\" he guessed, not having a passing knowledge of human anatomy, let alone anthro anatomy. \"I just need to adjust to my surroundings. I'll count the steps to the other side of her stomach and grab any food I come across to make a pile to climb. Easy. Real easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc wasn't usually the type to talk to himself but he knew if he didn't hear another voice his terror would just overwhelm him again, and when dealing with Indred, that was the equivalent of putting whipped cream and a cherry on top of your head. He waded through the stomach with his arms outstretched to gather up all the food he found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no food to be found. Minutes passed sloshing through the darkness and Marc didn't come across anything else occupying his living prison. There wasn't a scrap of food, not a crumb, not even the human bones he'd been dreading to find but now prayed for. He realized that he was completely and utterly alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later he realized something else. He'd been walking in a straight line for the past ten minutes and hadn't come to the opposite end of Indred's stomach. She was obscenely obese, yes, and over 28 ft tall, but she wasn't endless! Her stomach didn't go on forever! Did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc ran. He picked up his legs and moved as fast as he could, splashing through the disgusting void, not even caring if he ran smack into the wall of her stomach just so long as he ran into <i>something!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tripped over his own two feet and fell into the tingling acid. He tried to get up, but only got to his knees before giving up and crying. His wails echoed through his mistress's never-ending stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. The end had come at last. The same end he'd always dreaded since he was young enough and smart enough to question his place in the food chain in a world where humanoid animals were the dominant species on the planet. The same end that had--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't think about it, Marc told himself. Indred had taken everything else from him, his dignity, his sanity, and, whether in a few hours or a few days depending on her metabolism, his life, but that was one fear he'd keep repressed. One he wouldn't force himself to contemplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Marc...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet voice hissed from the depths of Indred's stomach and Marc's head snapped up. He couldn't believe it. Had someone else survived down here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Is anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be weak. Who knows how long they've been down here?\" Marc said desperately, praying it wasn't a hallucination. \"HOLD ON! I'LL COME TO YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began wading again through the tingling, foul-smelling stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Marc,\"</i> the voice hissed again. It was closer now! But... it sounded different from before. He thought the speaker was a man, now he wondered if they were a woman. Either way, he didn't care, he'd take what help he could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here! You have no idea how glad I am to see someone el--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrccccccc...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc froze where he stood. This was a new voice entirely. It was cold and cruel and hearing it felt like a knife was being run along his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" Marc asked, hope curdling like week-old milk. \"Answer--OW!\" The tingling liquid was becoming hotter and now it burned Marc's skin. It took him a second to realize what it meant: Digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Embrace it, Marc. Join us... Join usssss...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just one voice speaking now, it was many voices, speaking in unison. They were louder, only a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me!\" Marc turned and ran, the acid growing hotter around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where are you going, Marc? There's nowhere to go. You're dead, Marc. Just like us. Food for the Mistress. You'll stay here, Marc. Stay here forever.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT THE HELL UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the slimy \"floor\" dropped out from under Marc's feet and he was left flailing and thrashing in stomach acid that only grew hotter, hot enough to melt the flesh from his bones, but somehow still alive so he could drown instead. And now the voices were all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There is no rest for us, Marc. When we die, we stay within the Mistress forever. She owns us. She owns your soul, Marc. You'll stay here forever. FOREVER!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc opened his mouth to scream and was pulled down into the hot depths of stomach acid, the voices still screaming in his ears even as he sank down, down, down... and then, suddenly, up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's world turned upside down and he was sent jettisoned up and out of Indred's stomach, back up through her throat and then unceremoniously hacked up on the floor amidst a puddle of black bile. Indred loomed over him, all 28 ft of her, looking only mildly interested. She wiped some drool away from her mouth, now concealed again by her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was shivering so badly he couldn't make words, but when he could, his voice was high and shrill. \"W-w-what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your home,\" Indred said emotionlessly. \"Eventually. When the taste of your fear begins to grow dull and lifeless. When your screams no longer sound like music, your squirms no longer pleasing. On that day I'll swallow you down again and you'll never come back out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-those v-v-voices,\" Marc panted. \"T-t-they w-w-weren't r-r-real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't they?\" Indred asked. \"The longer you feed me, the longer it'll be until you find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't know what else to say. The souls of all her victims, every schmuck who'd been drafted by the ASL, every fighter she'd devoured in the ring, all the countless people she'd eaten over the course of her life. They couldn't all be trapped in there, within her stomach, digesting forever. It was impossible, wasn't it? Indred could do some magic, to be sure, but having that power over life and death, she couldn't... she couldn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc cried for a long time. Indred watched him without blinking, antennae quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...and Marc continued sobbing. Past, present, future, there was nothing in the world left for him but a few cruel happy memories to remind him that he could never say he didn\u2019t have a choice, that Dante, Nicole, and even Indrid had no more blame, none, even, than what he had. He cried till he\u2019d simply bled out of his ability to feel, and the vacuum was replaced by anger. The tears came to a steamy boil, and he bashed his fist at the floor, then brought his knuckles down again, again and again till even Indrid herself was interested by the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peace ended by another bodily need, its presence entering and exiting her as a stray thought. \u201cBedtime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You wanna nod off, fatass, go ahead. I\u2019ll stick with the floor.</i> Marc so, so wanted to say aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBedtime for both of us.\u201d Indrid continued, and remembering her abilities, Marc could easily find some tease in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfolding her arm, Indrid held a palm open above Marc and introduced a spell that summoned the human into its grasp, but with such speed that Marc didn\u2019t know if she hadn\u2019t just used her poweres to shift all of reality but him downwards. She took deep, echoing footsteps that once again brought her and Marc to her emaciated bed, but a squashing session wasn\u2019t on her mind as she laid down so their roles were swapped, her backside flattening the mattress into the floor while keeping Marc held against her fuzzy bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on top of her, the watchful eyes of his mistress scrutinizing him in wait of him to catch the sleep train, Marc had no lack of excuse to stay awake. Her lurid scent, which was much more visible up close, the glare of her line of sight, the burning of his acid-soaked skin and his joints from the near-disintegration he\u2019d been subjected to underneath her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but apparently excuses held no strength to the actual need itself. All the above in account, even beneath the matted locks of her bosom\u2019s coat, Indrid was soft. His heart new the voracious, fear-eating psychopath that\u2019d kill him as she had so many others, but his brain knew his form lay on a soft, comfy surface and that his glands were filled with sleep juice that needed to be deployed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came something <i>else</i> that it knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmmm-mmm...hmm hmm-mmm, mmm-mmm...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmartly, her fingers curled about Marc, preventing him from covering his ears. That tune...Indrid shut her eyes, abandoning him to darkness that left him alone with a soothing tune that he\u2019d been raised to know since he was a baby, when he was also learning how to breathe and love. Indrid could leap such mental hurdles to deal cold-blooded death and depravity on strangers, but hearing her spin that very same tune, almost the exact same humming her mother would do to help him sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d He whimpered, shivering when her fur was warm as could be.. \u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>hmm hmm hmmmm, hmmm-mmm-mmm...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Landing feet-first gave yield to a floor more rubbery and clean than Indrid\u2019s apartment. In place of its walls were metal bars welded together in a cage, the ceiling above replaced by the marque of a fighting ring floating in the black, hypnagogic shapes that kept their world encased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of his other, a series of heavy grunting and rolling came with his master\u2019s attempts to reclaim her footing. Standing at full stature, Marc could notice a definite lack of height from her. Her body exactly the same as she looked in the real world, of course, still as round and imposing as normal, only now scaled down at a \u2018mere\u2019 ten feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what the hell is this?\u201d Marc asked, observing his surroundings a second and third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraining.\u201d Indrid performed a few stretches with her legs, weaving her fingers together and cracking her knuckles. \u201cI have my promotional match tomorrow, and I refuse to go into the ring unprepared. As such, I expect a fight out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well, you just picked the wrong goddamned brain to sneak into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it meant even worse torture would come tomorrow morning, Marc grabbed the opportunity by the neck and proceeded towards Indrid in a marathon of expert kick, flips and cartwheels that settled on him hitting the floor with both feet, hands gathering at his side as he focused his brainpower at his fingertips, throwing them ahead of himself to fire a beam of lightning at his slaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid\u2019s eyelash shivered at the movement of air that glanced her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I should have said this was <i>my</i> dream space.\u201d She corrected. \u201cFor an even match, your reflexes and agility are improved considerably, but any laws of reality out there shall apply as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeh. Still worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than what Indrid\u2019s eye could see, Marc spun with a leg extended that delivered a swift kick to the crux of Indrid\u2019s stomach, followed by him kicking off her abdomen, throwing a punch right at her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but all he hit was a total cease in momentum that nearly broke every bone in his arm when Indrid caught his fist instead, her other arm bending at the elbow and coming down with a seismic force that shattered his limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact registered with the sound of a vase being dropped, his eyes stinging from dozens of shrapnelized glassy bits exploding from where was once a human arm. Marc fell back onto his ass, too much shock and too little pain in him to react outside of holding his amputated stump, the jagged-porcelain like shards of his shoulder poking at his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo much and too little to react when Indrid spin onto her side, shooting out both of her legs to connect to him with her feet, obliterating his form in just as visceral a demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid righted her incredible bulk up again, observing the various pieces and colors to her servant that\u2019d be a century of free time and boredom to match up and repair. His brain, too, was utterly disintegrated, but his mind lay amongst the chunks like a terrified spirit, lost in a realm between life and death that tasted with such tender fear, which Indrid never refused a sample of, but no more. He was here for training, to enter her into the real fear buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snap of her claw. A few pieces jitters in place, the rest following suit as they all flew together, the glassy shatter playing in reverse and merging into a prone Marc all at once, his being springing to life and catapulting from the floor like he\u2019d returned from a bad dream, frantic, deep breaths heaving in and out of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider tonight your last of freedom.\u201d She offered. \u201cPunch and kick me as much as you are able, but expect a fight in turn. Mayhaps you may see some mercy when I at last enter the gold division.\u201d At the forethought of food, Indrid\u2019s belly cried in hunger, eyes narrowing blissfully at the image. \u201cA realm of fear. So, so much fear, more than anyplace in the facility. Even the humans\u2019 apartments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc spat at the floor in front of her stomach. \u201cSorry if my French is rusty, but that\u2019s horseshit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, quite contrary, boy, it\u2019s true.\u201d She corrected. \u201cWhy do you think they bully your kind in an hourly basis, day by day, yet fight one another only once a month? Why do they float how little fear they show, yet feel the need to <i>constantly</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well, what do they have to be afraid of?!\u201d Marc snapped, pointing to the abyss surrounding the ring. \u201cWhen my kind gets stomped under them like litter, what fear do they have in a place like the ASL?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, of course. Well, me and the <i>truth.</i>\u201d She offered. \u201cThe fact that all that pathetic \u2018fame\u2019 and \u2018fortune\u2019 of theirs is totally <i>useless</i> when they remember that they all cry, bleed, and perish as any animal can. That the last semblance of comfort and control over their lives that this world has left for them balances at a needle\u2019s point at the end of a canyon, but a gust of air from being taken away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tomorrow? I will win. I will promote, and their fear will be mine. Invading their dreams...hearing their screams for surrender as I bite their faces in the ring...\u201d Indrid had no resolve to keep from licking her lips, her wings buzzing happily. \u201cBecoming bigger. More <i>fearsome.</i> More to <i><b>grow...</b></i>\u201d With that line of though came her grip of the dream world slackening. Her claws massaged the face of her massive stomach, but even more excess of mothy paunch pushes through the gap between her hands, more stomach fat swelling off of her to droop and smush against the floor naked. Each thought she rallied through have another surge in height, higher and higher, to her real height and <i>beyond,</i> but everything below continuously erupted like a volcano of chitin and blubber, fatter, rounder, wider, <i>bigger.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her explosion and her train of thought keep running, Marc saw the oncoming tidal wave of lard and ran to the bars of their cage, willing to shatter himself once again if it meant escaping through the bars, but then the tips of her fur\u2019s hairs combed his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger than this bed. Then this room. Bigger than <i>any</i> room. Bigger than <b><i>Marlene.</i></b> Big enough to <b><i>EAT</i></b> Marlene. Bigger than the whole <i><b>FACILITY.</b></i>And <b><i>THEN...</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid\u2019s tangent ended at a sudden pressure on her from all sides, four metal walls squeezing her in from hip to hip, belly to back. Judging her size, towering some eighty feet and weighing some nine thousand tons, Indrid tilted her head down to observe a certain lump jammed into her very front, fighting against her with a few suffocated wriggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInviting a hand out, Indrid focused once again and dislodged Marc from his confines, dangling him by the name of his shirt. \u201c...and you will help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d Marc asked in a mocking tone. \u201cWhat if I just stood still, staring at my own shoelaces instead of anything as you punch me and bring me back, over and over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if I do <i>not</i> win tomorrow, if I\u2019m denied of what\u2019s i so rightfully deserve,\u201d Indrid carried Marc close to the center of her face. \u201cI will need to <i>comfort feed.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Indrid bends the flow of time in the dream world. What\u2019s really hours of sleep feels like <i>weeks!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Eventually, Indrid has enough of training. Time for fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Skip to the next morning, when Indrid wakes up for her promotional match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Maybe cut to the gold division\u2019s fighters, who are quarreling over who has to be the one to fight Indrid?</span></div></div>",

And just why does this have to be \u2018fair,\u2019 Avery?\u201d Roxenne challenged, approaching the Roc girl with her arms folded over her chest. \u201cIt seems to me it\u2019d be \u2018fair\u2019 if Indrid had a fighting chance tomorrow. After all, <i>you\u2019re</i> the one out of us who\u2019s never losta fight. What do <i>you</i> have to be scared of, taking on a silver?\u201d Roxenne leaned in with, to Avery, the most punchable that the good creator above could make possible on his own kin. \u201cScared of Indrid? Scared of <i>losing?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery scowled. \u201cI ain\u2019t afraid of the toilet your mom got <i>pregnant on.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, Roxenne thrust her forehead against Avery\u2019s, who pushed back in matching wits in the two pushing back and forth and rubbing their imaginary bullhorns, the two snorting and staring daggers and all, but were wedged apart by a set of gold-feathered hands that yanked both out of their showdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d Amaya butted in. \u201cI think we don\u2019t have to argue that there\u2019s <i>plenty</i> of guilt to go around the ASL of fighters not wanting to tussle with Indrid, so for <i>all</i> our sakes, why don\u2019t we just put tonight behind us and decide before the <i>facility</i> does for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to do! She\u2019s the one dunkin\u2019 the rest of us down!\u201d Avery accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, Avery! In fact,\u201d Honing in on a mug of pens at Avery\u2019s desk, Amaya took five and bit a dent into the butt of one, holding all together in her fist. \u201cWe\u2019ll draw straws. Whoever gets the bite mark is the fighter. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod from Avery. Amaya met eyes with Roxenne, who gave a delayed, rather stiff one herself, but when Amaya went through and took the end of a pen herself, a gold-furred paw delayed the vote again by smacking the pens from her wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d Crumpet added. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it work. The person with the straws let\u2019s everybody else take one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?! It\u2019s drawing straws! That\u2019s <i>exactly</i> how it works!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe person with the straws let\u2019s everybody else take one <i>first,</i> then they take whichever one is left for them! That\u2019s how <i>I</i> always did it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? Fine. You win. Everybody else takes one.\u201d Amaya pinched the bridge of her beak, the night bringing her to genuinely question whether making it in the ASL was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, come on, you aren\u2019t thinking long term!\u201d Roxenne snapped again, thrusting a thumb over at Avery. \u201cIf we send in somebody who isn\u2019t all stars and they lose, then we\u2019re <i>all</i> gonna have to fight her at some point! Send <i>her</i> over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, just a few seconds ago you were threatenin\u2019 Sapphire! You don\u2019t care If it\u2019s me! All you care is you <i>not</i> gettin\u2019 in there! Why don\u2019t <i>you</i> fight her?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, <i>you</i> fight her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You</i> fight her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>YOU</i> FIGHT HER!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>YOU</i></b> FIGHT HER!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BANG!!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody jolted at the noise from the door, all looking at the walls in surprise, but Avery, most notable, looked to her right tilted her head in mild annoyance. Massaging her eyelids, she broke from the huddle and went to the door, huffing our a sigh before pulling it open in regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Claudine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine\u2019s lardy cheeks were puffed further in anger, still dressed in her nightly blouse with curlers spun into her hair, more pleased for Avery to brine in the awkward silence under her piercing gaze than chew her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery feared being the one to talk first, but Claudine apparently had enough mercy to focus instead at a certain black, blobby behemoth sloshing about to her left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPearl, dear, may I ask you of something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping mid-step, the blubber-bloated sea mammal was in the midst of hauling her next \u2018lifetime-supply\u2019 of cheeseburgers to her den, one caught wrapper and all in between her sharp teeth. \u201c...hunh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got Avery, Sapphire, Roxenne, Amaya And Crumpet in this room together. Would you do me a favor and mention one of their names aloud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl swallowed the wrapped cheeseburger, brain weighing the claims of Claudine\u2019s request...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whatever more Indred had in store for him, Marc didn't want any part of it. Unfortunately, given the sheer size and strength difference between him and his macabre, monolithic moth mistress, he had no means of resistance beyond the standard begging, flailing, and--though he would've denied it--weeping. It made no difference in the end. Indred just dragged him to an old, tattered chair in the center of the room. It was big enough for an anthro, but two metal, human-sized restraints had been built into the arms of the chair. He wondered how he could've possibly missed a chair so large during his initial inspection of the room, but that thought had to wait as Indred dropped him down onto the cushion causing a cloud of dust to engulf him. He coughed on the stale, dirty air. As such, he was too off guard to stop his mistress from locking one of his wrists into one restraint, then another into the other. The end result was that his arms were stretched uncomfortably up into the air and now he was fully trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was completely at her mercy--ok, well, technically he'd always been completely at her mercy, but now he was even moreso--he expected his torments to truly begin. Indred stood over him, red eyes glowing. Marc's lower lip quivered. He knew what was about to happen next. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the only reason she would secure him to a chair was so that she could sit on him. But with his arms already straining and her incredible weight, he was terrified his arms would just pop out of their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesssss,\" Indred said with quiet relish. \"The anticipation, the dread, the knowledge of the suffering that awaits you. A satisfactory appetizer of fear... but now I'll dig into the main course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc shut his eyes. He couldn't bare to look! He just waited for the crushing pain to begin... and waited... and waited... and waited one last time until he finally cracked open an eye to peak at what was taking so long. Sure enough the sight of Indred's massive backside took up the whole of his vision, but she didn't lower it on him. Instead she was fiddling with something Marc couldn't see. He saw her raise her fist and bang on something. Was it some horrible instrument of torture that had been used so often it needed repair?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, stupid thing,\" she hissed. \"Damn thing never works.\" <i>BANG! BANG! BANG!</i> \"AH-HA! GOTCHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndred straightened and turned to give Marc her full attention, revealing what'd been hidden behind her... a television with rabbit ears hooked up to a VCR still flashing 12:00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright,</i> Marc thought, <i>I'm not insane. That TV was definitely not here before. Where is she getting these things? What is she, magic?</i> As soon as Marc thought it he shuddered. He didn't need any more reasons to fear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, human. Shiver in fear. What you're about to witness will chill you to the bone. Madness will be the only escape from your horror, but I'll make sure it never comes. Behold... <i>true... FEAR!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere it was, the torture he'd been dreading was now before him! What did she have on tape? Home movies about the grisly tortures and murders she'd committed?! The fighters she'd devoured in the ring? The monstrous fates of all those hapless human servants who'd entered her abode never to return?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc shut his eyes but Indred moved behind him and forced them open with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, little slave, it's show time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP ME!\" Marc screamed. \"SOMEBODY HEEEEEEEEELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wha-Whaaa-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPFFFFFFRRRRRTTTTT!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the sound of a cartoon trombone signaling something embarassing happening to someone, followed by the fart-like noise of a whoopie cushion. Marc's cries for help stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell?</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture on the black-and-white TV showed a human man around Marc's age, only shorter, scrawnier and as skittish as a mouse at a cat conference. He was dressed in disheveled, business-man attire, working in a cubicle that looked like it'd been built for someone ten times his size. He was standing on a revolving chair in order to reach the computer on his desk. He was typing painfully slowly as he had to reach over for each key on a keyboard the size of a coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SPLA-AAAAAAAAAAAAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, sing-song voice like the fat lady wearing Viking horns in an opera cut through the office, triggering a laugh track from the video. The figure typing at the keyboard looked up in terror. Suddenly the entire office floor was shaking as the heavy footsteps of something massive made its way to the tiny man's workspace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure was soon revealed to be a female warthog anthro who stood 15 feet tall. Her fur was dark brown while her black hair was streaked with gray and done up in a bun. She wore a pair of red horn-rimmed glasses and a blue woman's suit and skirt. Her gut wasn't half as big as Indred's but it was still impressive to behold, and her ass was one of the biggest ever to hit the silver screen, barely being contained by her too-short skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe completely took up the space occupying the cubicle's entrance, looming over the tiny, trembling human. Her hands were on her hips, and a cigarette was held in between two pink-manicured nails. Her teeth and tusks were slightly yellow from smoking. She raised her cigarette while glaring at the man before her, took a deep drag between thick red lips, then exhaled through her snout, blowing the smoke directly on human who coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I wanted those reports on my desk first thing in the morning, Splat. It's second thing in the morning and I still don't have them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man flinched and the canned laughter of a non-existent studio audience went off again. \"I-I-I t-told you, Ms. Tuskington, I wouldn't be able to get them finished on time without an assistant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And didn't I assign you an assistant?\" the warthog demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but... after you left your lunch at home you ate him instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuses, excuses!\" Ms. Tuskington boomed after the canned laughter had died down. \"I want results! And if you can't give me results, your ass belongs to me! Or rather,\" she said, starting to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please no,\" the little man gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR ASS BELONGS TO MY ASS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tuskington turned and plopped her ass right down on her human subordinate. The laugh track was replaced by recorded whooping and cheers as if what the warthog had just done was something inspiring and triumphant. She smiled widely as she ground her cheeks into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider this your lunch hour, Splat,\" the warthog said just before her stomach grumbled loudly. \"Oof, speaking of which. Seems your assistant isn't agreeing with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPPFFFFFFRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTT!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man beneath her gave out some muffled screams as the laugh track resounded once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc watched the whole thing with a dumbfounded look. This was the big torture? The new Jack Splat movie? Two and a half hours of some hapless human getting squashed and snacked on by anthro ladies? He knew that anthros loved it and humans hated it, but this hardly seemed like torture to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndred mistook the look on his face. \"Yessssssss,\" she hissed quietly. \"Gaze into the abyss of horrors. Can you not feel your soul weakening with its terrifying message of how pathetic your race is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>... Ooooooooooookay,</i> Marc thought. <i>So it's not like I'm looking forward to being abused or anything (if I did this ASL hellhole would be a</i> dream job<i>) but just showing me some crappy movies are really taking the drama out of this whole \"feast on my fear\" thing she's got going on. Still, might be good to play along and get out of</i> real <i>torture.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Marc pretends to be terrified of the terrible movie to appease Indred and maybe save himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Indred uses her magic to somehow make this lackluster comedy movie into something legitimately terrifying for Marc.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a quiet shack far off in the countryside, somewhere immune to the prying ears of city life, Jack Splat stumbled into his home, back laid on the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoo, boy, Splatcon wasn\u2019t fun this year. Nor was it funny. Or the answer to his courtly prayers that this year\u2019s con would be <i>slightly</i> more tolerable when the months were ticking down to that one week on the calender...and yet, much like the year before, he had weathered the storm. A painful, sweaty, seven-day long storm, but as with all things in life, it had passed. He had climbed one of the many dips of fate alive enough in mind and body, ready to ride on a few highs for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking particularly high was the living room\u2019s armchair. He couldn\u2019t see the TV remote anywhere, but when the only gene of softness he\u2019d had through the week was the hundred-ton magnitude of a sadistic rhino-woman\u2019s behind, the quiet and solace of just sitting around in the privacy of his own domain was all the noise and excitement he needed. His bag fell off his shoulder. He yanked his lanyard from his neck, tossing it recklessly into the corner of the room. He wrecked his shoes even more by stomping on their soles to pull his feet loose, maneuvering with grace and vigor past the cushy carpeting that lay between him and the leap into his favorite chair, its arms open and in wait to pull him in and enable his mind to go slack to the cruelties of the outside of world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>SMASH!!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then the house\u2019s entire roof and much of the walls were disintegrated in a cloud of splinters that shredded his clothes and slashed at his skin like a swarm of angry locusts, plowed through by a white fist the size of a car that swept away the furniture and much of his home\u2019s foundations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn its place loomed the pale grimace of a titan of muscle and rippling adipose sheeted by pale white skin, its finned form above the waist carrying the menacing revere befitting of any other shark, but balanced atop the eight legs of a furred arachnid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>SORRY, JACK SPLAT!</b>\u201d Sharknantula boomed. \u201c<b>BUT EVEN WHEN THE CON\u2019S OVER, <i>THE SPLAT DON\u2019T END WHEN SHARKNANTULA\u2019S IN TOWN!!!</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Splat\u2019s already-occurring screams melted into the soundscape when the echo in Sharknantula\u2019s voice dissipated, but with a leap and aerial pirouette, Sharknantula came down with force that struck him down like an atomic bomb, the camera zooming out only to be chased by the ensuing explosion of dust and uprooted dirt, causing all to go black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the metallic riff of a guitar, the title flashing on in tune with a biting serenade of heavy metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JACK SPLAT 18: SHARKNANTULA\u2019S REVENGE</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really? Two hundred and forty eight hours of getting sat on by random cameos, and Sharknantula doesn\u2019t appear until the last two minutes? I mean, even there isn\u2019t any plot, that\u2019s still a pretty big middle finger to the kind of people who actually watch this shit...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, as Marc roughly translated from thought to speech,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was no expert on human emotion. Yes, fear was something he new quite frequently when the risk of getting eaten alive followed him around so much, but feeling it was a different kind of talent than being able to fake it on command. Not even in a middle-school play had he any time to rehearse how to act, so the display he was forced to satisfy Indrid with contained plenty of screaming, sobbing, or choking on his own spit in fake seizures that put to shame some of the horrific acting she was forcing him to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Indrid minded, sitting on the floor with her little meal ticket\u2019s seat nestled up against her naval, antennae leisurely kicking about as her crimson eyes watched from above in contentment. Obscure her taste in torture may have been, her eye for bad movies was certainly keen; they were certainly bad. As in really, really, really bad, the kind of writing produced by an infinite amount of monkeys being given an infinite amount of typewriters to take a shit all over, but Marc would take all the atrocious comedy he could if it meant living in Indrid\u2019s room without being eaten or getting his mind melted by her powers. He screamed at every \u2018joke\u2019 and dimwitted character like they were videos of medieval torture and executions, and Indrid\u2019s eyes would nonetheless twinkle at his so-called \u2018fear\u2019, feeling at her behemoth of an abdomen in satisfaction when all he felt after eighteen hours of straight binge watching was a major need to take a piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe VCR hit the end of the tape, and silence returned to the room. Noticing the lack of stimuli, Indrid looked to her right and snapped her claw, the needle of her gramophone moving at her command. The horn belched up more static, {x-link:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MzjvYa0oKMM} then let loose another string of high-pitched scatting and ukulele strumming.{x-link}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting his lip, Marc put out a few tears whilst sobbing with the bounce of a hillbilly\u2019s guffawing as Indrid lumbered over to the TV to produce another video. \u201cPuh-lee-hee-hee-hee-<i>heeeeeeeeease,</i> make it <i><b>stop!</b></i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was made, but Indrid made a show of selecting a tape from the VCR, swishing her finger around beforedrawing it out with flair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...\u201d Marc blubbered. \u201c...if you\u2019re gonna torture me, can you at least do it without the <i>shitty music?!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndrid paused at a single choke in her throat, the videotape stuck midway in the slot. Her shoulders squared, her chestfur frizzled, and the already quiet mothwoman went still that the silence that followed her became but the utter loss of his ear\u2019s ability to hear. With her arm shivering, its claw locked in an open pose, Indrid\u2019s head swiveled in Marc\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw fallen, Indrid stared at Marc, and he had to remember to keep in that piss he was holding at the way her eyes met him. This wasn\u2019t the empty, corpse-like way she perceived her surroundings; despite a lack of pupils for him to tell as such, she was staring <i>right at him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what did you say?\u201d She croaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...\u201d He started lamely, playing at the spit in his mouth with his tongue. \u201cI was asking if you could at least turn of the stupid music?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of an obscenity didn\u2019t dampen what Indrid had heard. The fact that anybody had the will to tie a string out of those words opened a window to her soul, inviting a cold breeze that grazed at her heart. Her jaw begin quivering in horror as her eyes stretched implausibly wide, the light shed on some dark, terrifying corners of her mind that she yearned to always dodge away from thinking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it true? Could Indrid, the goddess of fear in the ASL, know it herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid...\u201d She peeped, pointing a shaking finger at him. \u201c...did you just insult Tiny Tim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018\u2019...wha...?\u201d Marc barely narrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teethy breathing intensified, heaving in and out through her gums as her lips pulled back to bare numerous (and what Marc could now see were) <i>sharp</i> teeth locked together in her mouth, a delirious twitch flickering in her eyes before she shook her head out, eyes furrowing in absolute fury that tendered their glow so they appeared as holes in her face that allowed the burning heat inside of her to radiate through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged up to his seat, and Marc quit his staring contest with her by putting up another pitiful attempt at prying himself free of his bindings, but Indrid snapped both of her hands down around him and tore him out from the chair instead, holding him right at the center of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t torture on her mind, neither the real kind or her mockery of it. It was a <i><b>murder.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...did you just insult Tiny Tim?\u201d She spat onto his body.  \u201cDid. <i>You. <b>Just.

Is in the prime of her life with a natural youthful glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia is the kind of woman that mothers should warn their sons, and maybe even their daughters, about. Arrogant and proud, yet possesses enough charm and charisma to pass it off as confidence. This combined with her rather high level of intelligence and natural good looks have enthralled countless. She has charmed many in her career and this shows in the sheer number of fans she possesses and the amount of money that is made whenever she deigns to enter a match. She is completely aware of this and uses it to her advantage. With but a coy smile, a playful wink or some honeyed words, she has had others falling over themselves to please her. Her overall demeanor is that of a patient, scheming aristocrat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has led to an interesting development though. Anastasia, or simply Ana as she often prefers, truly loves the adoration she inspires. So, once she meets someone that truly resists her charms (an extremely rare occurrence), she will attempt to convert them to her side, one way or another. It is notable that she does not become angry during such events but grow more determined and driven to change their mind. The more the target resists, the more extreme and dangerous she becomes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Corra</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Praying Mantis <br>\r\nHeight: 39'1\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Mainly dark green with light green some places. Long black hair and red eyes. Two arms and four legs. Corra is shaped much a like an actual praying mantis, though she stands up much straighter. Her arms and legs are very well muscled. Her 'human' stomach is large and bulbous yet tight but it pales in comparison to her actual mantis abdomen. Said abdomen is so large that it dwarfs the rest of Corra and even many other fighters! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is due to the fact, that as a praying mantis Corra is naturally given to a large appetite. In fact, Corra's are so bad that she constantly has to eat something or enter a kind of eating frenzy. As such, she's in considered to be rather dangerous to most around her. Hence, most of her matches are Survival matches just so that she can try and keep her hunger under some form of control. Things are so bad that Corra and the ASL have installed a special bunker in her room just so there is some kind of safe place for important personnel or even her own servants to duck into. As such, Corra is considered highly dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch is the tragedy of life. Corra, herself, is quite amiable if a little stern with her servants. A hardworking fighter who is quite friendly out of the ring. Yet, her 'Hunger Attacks' have put a huge damper on her life. She is painfully aware that there is no place for her outside of the ASL and that there is barely a place for her even within it's walls. Corra has no true friends, other fighters avoid her out of sheer fear. The closest thing she has gotten to friendship with other fighters are pitying looks before the waddle/stomp/run from her. Many of her servants actually truly liked her before meeting their untimely demise in her belly. However, the ASL is trying various methods to try and combat her 'Hunger Attacks'. None have been truly successful and many a servant has paid the price much to Corra's remorse.</span></div></div>",

Has two arms and six legs that carry an hourglass figure, her \u2018human\u2019 upper half consisting of a fat stomach sandwiched between her larger breasts and legs, her hind and middle ones progressively wider than the ones in front. Her thorax is almost as large as she is, which she\u2019s adept at using to crush her foes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman who knows a steady balance between when to pick a fight and how to end them, Matilda has the drive to be the very best without possessing too high an ego to compromise her abilities, taking her fame with dignity and poise. Respected by her friends, intimidating to her rivals, and kind towards her friends, Matilda is an overall well-rounded individual with little in her way to enter the likes of the gold division.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, unless humans are involved. Not because of any specific hatred of them, but for the fact that she\u2019s <i>terrified</i> of them. Too terrified to even kill one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc\u2019s tenure with Matilda is owed solely to a rare string of bureaucratic errors on the ASL\u2019s part that, through some strange specifics, makes it required for him to work with Matilda for at least a month before everything can be straightened out and she\u2019ll be able to reinstate him with a new mistress. Could Matilda be the easiest job Marc will have in a long time? Could he be the one to help Matilda settle her fears, or will he give her foes the edge she needs to keep her in place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Beatrix</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Cockroach<br>\r\nHeight: 42\u20193\u201d<br>\r\nAppearance: Brown wings and tan underbelly with long hair once dyed bright red, now severely unkempt and allowed to fade into a brownish-purple. Has two arms and two legs, but are bloated with little to no muscle mass beneath their tremendous adipose. Beatrix has barely little humanoid form left outside of a globular landmass of blubber, likely a few tons away from achieving total immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a bright, peppy soul who came into the ASL with plenty of ambitions, all lost somewhere amongst the various snack foods stuffed and left for dead amongst the numerous fat folds that consume her being. After getting that initial taste of the luxuries the facility provided its fighters, less and less did Beatrix follow through on her ideologies of training and studying hard to succeed in exchange for wasting her days between matches on playing video games, growing off of glutting on junk food instead of any specific diet. She\u2019s unquestioningly the heaviest fighter in the silver division, not that it comes as an advantage; winning against her can be as simple as making her trip over and pinning her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in the world of gaming so often, she treats everybody around her, regardless if they\u2019re characters in a game or real-life folk who may be going out of their way to be nice to her, with the profanity-ridden respect that put even the worst basement-dwellers to shame, dotting her \u2018I\u2019s with f-bombs and other cusses crudely butchered together into nonsensical strings of vulgarities. Despite not being a professional by any respect, gaming is the one true life she has left; without having servants to clean her, she\u2019d gladly spend the rest of her life rotting alone in her room, but because her matches bring in a considerable audiences for the \u2018comedy\u2019 she provides (and because removing her from the facility would be horrifically expensive at this point,) the ASL is in the works to supply her with a robotic substitute for her to fight her matches in virtual reality, making leaving her room obsolete.</span></div></div>",

Lost to any memory of such a fighter around the ASL, he couldn\u2019t say his hopes were up, but without the bile that rose up at the image of him being a slave to the likes of Stacey or Amaya, he allowed himself to take a shot of optimism and navigated around the platinum-imbued arches of the Silver Division\u2019s corridors with a small perk to his step, observing the number plates to each door that he passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n549 was a doorway no more distinguishable or decorated than all the rest along its wall, further robbing him of any clues of how hellish a mistress she may be, but Marc ignored his ritual of praying before his first step in a new boss\u2019 door and knocked right away. No answer came, but Marc took note of the intercom next to the doorframe and buzzed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cJust a second, please!\u201d</i> Came a distracted voice from the speaker, enough words to recognize a posh Australian twang rolling off her tongue. <i>\u201cYes, who is it?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a Miss \u2018Matilda Dowette\u2019 here?\u201d Marc asked. \u201cI\u2019m the new servant you called for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause, but more brief. <i>\u201cServant? Hm...I don\u2019t recall asking for a servant. Do you have the right room number?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s five...four...nine?\u201d He scrutinized those three numbers, checking the door itself to see if his own eyes were reading them right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWell...yes, that is right...\u201d</i> She confessed. <i>\u201cListen, I\u2019m just coming out of the shower. How about you step inside and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA <i>click</i> from the door, and it opened without a hand from the inside to push it open, activated by an electric motor from the ceiling. Marc happily marched inside; once again, many fighter\u2019s first acts on a new servant were one of cruelty, some harsh words to assert their dominance as long as they were under their ownership. Even anthros whose rooms he\u2019d been sent to by accident would find some way to punish him for interrupting their private time; he\u2019d nearly been killed when an anthro tossed a plate of food at him for interrupting her TV time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let his hopes rise to probably dangerous heights when he observed his and her surroundings, the door shutting behind him and locking. Whoever it was, she didn\u2019t read like one with an ego, the most flair to her living space being some potted roses and brand-new furniture, her sense of entitlement only as large as a modest trophy case sitting at the wall. Seeing her moderate tastes, Marc channeled all the scoldings and pains he\u2019d endured in the ASL and practiced his best puppy-dog eyes, fantasizing that if this \u2018Matilda\u2019 was as patient as she seemed, she\u2019d renege on her \u2018mistake\u2019 and take him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, when the knob to a door at the other end spun, Marc put on his straight face as it cracked open, inviting six blobby tendrils to enter and transport their owner into the room, each fattened into a doughy nub that struggled to carry her great weight so their crux had any space over the ground, but nonetheless carried an expert array of movement as each leg maneuvered about in tandem with such precision that Marc could see it taking an entire childhood to perfect, the satisfying spectacle put to music by the rhythmic clicking made by their very points touching the floor...music that was tampered by the loud dragging of an enormous mass of chitin stemming from her backside as its bottom scuffed against the ground, its adipose sprawled out with more width than its highest point, but its peak still arched high over her hairline, painted by a stripe of red skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatformed atop her legs was the upper half to a much more human being, or the overinflated caricature to one whose obese stomach billowed over her front legs\u2019 crotch, strained against the belt and front to a fluffy pink bathrobe, yet her middle balanced the sheer mass to her hyper-endowed tits, each bloated past her stomach\u2019s size and sagging over its slope akin to a swollen set of eyelids, hitting the full strain of her clothing and opening its neck to copious white-skinned cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny remaining humanity ended from the neck up, the nose and mouth extending and molded together in a chubby muzzle guarded by sabre-tooth fangs, an array of six eyes resting above that remained shut as she toweled the remaining dampness from cascading locks of swirling black hair. Once she was satisfied that they would dry to their luxurious waves, her eyelids opened to irises of a vibrant red. Not those of the fires of hell, but cherry cider, tart with a layer of sweetness as her lips curled into a polite smile, ready to greet her new guest with friendly words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw Marc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile fell, the mere glimpse of a human in her stead opening a window to her soul that enabled a cool breeze to blow in and graze at her heart. Marc tried to return her earlier warmth with a grin of his own, but witnessed in discomfort her legs curl up in fear, her former graceful movements killed and switched for shivering terror. That pleasing mix of confidence and compassion to her eyes dissolved as their reached outright cartoon-y sizes on observing his two legs, his two eyes, his soft, mammalian skin and discrete, humanoid features...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...you okay, Miss Dowette?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>pew pew</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda threw out both her arms, launching from her wrists two fist-sized wads of silk that struck Marc in the chest, unfurling into sheets of webbing that catapulted him back, gluing him to the main door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay where you are!!!\u201d She barked to the plenty-trapped human. \u201c<b>Don\u2019t come near me!</b> <b>DON\u2019T YOU <i>DARE</i> COME ANYWHERE NEAR ME!!!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose legs that carried such articulated movements nearly tied themselves into knots as Matilda scrambled for escape into her own room, her attempts at slamming the door shut ending with ramming it on her own arachnid behind several times before pulling through in full and closing herself off, the muffled rattling of furniture following after, their weight landing on the door several times before she was fully barricaded inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...hello?\u201d Marc peeped when he had the air back in his lungs to speak, hurt, confused, but mostly too dazed to fully comprehend what\u2019d just happened. \u201cMiss Dowette? Anybody? <i><b>Hello?</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Eventually, Marlene is forced to come down to Matilda\u2019s room to pry Marc loose and get things squared away between them. (I just realized...that\u2019s three \u201cM\u2019s.\u201d)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Marc spends six hours glued to the wall before Matilda finally leaves her room, demanding to know what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Alternate story idea. Matilda actually doesn\u2019t mind humans all that much, yet Marc suffers from crippling Arachnophobia...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Obese in all areas and very bottom-heavy. Most of her weight in muscle has gone to her lower body, leaving her upper-body noticably flabby.<br>\r\nBiography: Despite only being in her young 20s, Taya is surprisingly veteran considering her age. In her late teenage years, Taya was sent by her family to train for ASL after they could no longer afford to feed her and her skyrocketing weight and joined at the youngest age possible. Taya blames her parents for her current situation, and has grown increasingly unstable throughout her time in the ASL. At a natural disadvantage due to her poor upper-body strength forcing her to rely on her legs, short height, and inability to keep up with her seemingly nonexistent metabolism, Taya compensates this through sheer sadism and violence in the ring. Taya fights as if every single match of hers is a survival battle, and has become a popular underdog with fans due to her violent fighting style and unparalleled scrappiness in a division of women who are much bigger than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Taya is an anthro with a huge chip on her shoulder. Constantly snappy and fickle, Taya is surprisingly lenient with humans as far as punishment goes, as her past allows her to understand the often involuntary reasons for becoming a servant to an ASL fighter. While not exactly the ideal master, failing a task will usually cause no more than a verbal beating, or a small amount of actual beating for particularly egregious offenses, which is far preferable compared to what many others will do. She is also naturally distant and self-reliant in and out of her training, giving her servants far more free-time than most. However, her questionable mental state causes her to be prone to mood swings, and it's a not-so-well hidden secret that her last servant was hospitalized after a 4 match losing streak sent her into a fit of rage. Who knows what she'll do to you if she snaps again. Just pray that you won't be on the recieving end of her rage when it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha<br>\r\nSpecies: Poison Dart Frog<br>\r\nHeight: 20'4\"<br>\r\nAppearence: Deep blue skin, purple belly, incredibly obese, and combined with her naturally round body-shape she almost looks spherical.<br>\r\nBiography: A quickly rising newcomer to the ASL, Sasha has an almost cartoonishly idealistic view of the world, considering her profession. A self-proclaimed \"sumo vigilante,\" Sasha joined the ASL to take out all those she considers villains within the league. Sasha has expanded both her stock and her waistline in record time by challenging those she deems villains to survival matches, and was quickly given the chance to move up, taking some surprising wins in survival matches against powerful silver-leaguers in the process. Aspiring to extend this unique method of \"Justice\" to the top, Sasha is constantly eating to bulk up enough to one day be able to eat even the most giant competitors at the top of the ASL. Because of the immense weight she carries around as a result, her fighting style revolves around using her unique abilities as a frog rather than a more standard fighting style. Sasha uses her croaking to bounce her gigantic, bloated body and crush any opponent who stands in the ring with her. Sasha usespecially her tongue for more versatility, it is her main method of wrestling the opponent down, but more importantly, it can be used to execute surprise attacks on the opponent, pull in opponents from long range, and makes finishing survival battles much easier than for most fighters. Ironically, despite being a poison Dart frog, Sasha can't create poison due to a birth defect. Her poisonous glands only create air, which makes her constantly gassy. Sasha considers this an underhanded tactic however, although she will use her gas to her advantage with no qualms when she's fighting someone she considers immoral. Sasha will use her gas involuntarily, however, if she feels particularly gassy or if she's struck in the stomach. Considering her constant gorging and gigantic belly, this happens a lot. This has occurred so frequently since her rapid weight gain that the locker room has mockingly nicknamed her \"The Poison Fart Frog,\" and Sasha herself is considering that she might as well swallow her pride and turn her gas into one of her main weapons in the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Sasha is first and foremost optimistic and believes very strongly in her ideals and the upholstery of what she believes is right.  Brash in nature, Sasha in unafraid of challenging someone who is more accomplished or tougher than her as long as Sasha thinks she can put up a fight. Conversely, the deeper personality Sasha reveals to her friends is surprisingly quite lazy, and even slightly slobby in the way she stops caring about controlling her gas, although her strong moral compass still remains. She is also predictably good-natured, and would risk her own well being to help anyone in danger. Sasha is also honest, brutally so, and always speaks her mind, a quality that often works against her. Sasha, as a master, is known to be quite pleasent to work for, although she doesn't respect humans enough to try to not constantly belch and fart around them. Sasha considers most forms of punishment to be overly-cruel and will only eat you if she catches you doing something she considers villainous, which is easy enough to avoid. Even so, if she thinks a servant is going out of line she will sit on them as a form of punishment with no hesitation, always for an extended period of time to make sure they receive the message.</span></div></div>",

Sure, you would take it over the gold division any day, but not having any idea of what your new master could be like made silver division masters far more harrowing to meet for the first time. It was a true random draw between crazy and (relatively) normal. The halls were lined with doors of varying sizes, reflecting the variety of anthros within them. You stopped at the what had to be one of the largest and most intimidating doors and gulped at the thought of who was giant enough to need a door that tall. What came to mind wasn't exactly reassuring. Still, you stepped inside, accepting your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she certainly wasn't as tall as you feared.<br>\r\nBut she was wide.<br>\r\nUnbelievably wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro who was apparently your new master could be seen wolfing down a gigantic cake in her room. Her arms and legs were almost entirely flab, to say nothing of her mountainous belly, which was bigger than the entire bodies of some in the bronze division. The massive amount of fat easily reached the ground, and would have made you baffled as to how she can still move if Pearl hadn't already shocked you when she moved into the ring and swallowed your previous master whole. Your new master's similarities to Pearl terrified you. The only difference in the shapes of their massively fatty bodies was how much taller Pearl was, which you attributed to the natural hight of an Orca. Your new master finished off her meal with a fittingly large belch, and turned around to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be the new servant. The last one had to be dismissed since he couldn't handle my... smell.\" The anthro gave a hard slap to her stomach, letting out an audible fart into the room. The girl was do fat that even her farms and beaches caused her flabby buddy to quiver and jiggle. \"Y-you're... you're the poison fart frog.\" Sasha, or The Poison Fart Frog, was the kind of person who was unforgettable the moment she entered a room. Or at least her ass was. She was one of the few anthros who could make themselves look like a character even within a place like the ASL. Her fighting style, career accomplishments, and especially her flatulence had made her an infamous figure within the ASL locker rooms. Your previous master had talked about her a few times, mostly about how she would never want to meet her if all the stories about her were true, and judging from the way her room smells now, the rumors were far from wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing you say her infamous nickname, Sasha gave you a disgruntled, vaguely lonely look. She was clearly aware of her nickname, and you figured few people would willingly approach someone known for clearing rooms just by entering them. It was understandable that the name would give her bad memories. Unfortunately, that name was the one you just said. Sasha, making a puffy, slightly angry and unconfortable face as if she was futility holding in more gas, said \"If you're going to be that way, *uuuuurp*, why don't you get over here and...</span></div></div>",

But once you were within arm's reach, her tongue let go and she grabbed you in a headlock instead, your face half buried in her impressive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't *urp* much care for that name, shrimp. I've spent my entire career trying to rid the league of evil, all to protect defenseless people like you. But am I thanked for all my hard work? No! I'm ridiculed! And for what? A little gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't call it a little--\" You had intended this to sound playful in an attempt to defuse the tension. That tone was apparently lost on her because as soon as the words left your lips, she tightened her hold, making it harder to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then,\" she said coldly, her yellow eyes narrowing. \"Let's get on with that demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up from her seat, a massive recliner that was specialized for the obese anthros of the ASL. Despite being constructed to handle even the heaviest of weights, the cushion was worn out and had an imprint of Sasha's butt as big as a crater on the moon. Without further ado, Sasha plopped you onto her chair and turned around ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha, wait! I'm sorry, this was just a misunderstanding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell it to the rump,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a small leap in the air and landed backwards, her titanic ass slamming into your miniscule form. She had landed expertly, wedging you deep between her cheeks. A layer of spandex was all that separated you from the skin of her warty behind. The heat and pressure were unbearable. Sasha ground her ass on the chair and you cried out in pain. Your cries were muffled by her mountain of flab, but she could still hear you, if only barely. She didn't dignify your screams with a response. She did dignify them with a fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast of stench was revolting. If you thought she stank before, it was nothing compared to being closer to the source. The smell washed over you, burning your nostrils and stinking your eyes. You screams beneath her became more desparate. You had been beneath anthros before, it was a sad reality of this business, but being under Sasha was a whole new level of hell entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha sighed in content, and grabbed her laptop off the desk before her, just past the remnants of her cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you be a good slave and think about what you've done. I have a match coming up tomorrow and I need to do some research. Extensive research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she let out another fart, causing you to moan. Sasha chuckled under her breath. The next three hours were spent in utter torment, Sasha's gas seemed to have no end, and she enjoyed bouncing up and down in her seat and grinding you between her cheeks. After the first ten minutes you stopped struggling and just waited for this torture to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, she got up. An animalistic desire to flee from the danger was your first instinct but when you tried to move, you realized that your body was plastered to the chair. Sasha turned around and lowered her face to your flattened form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she said dangerously. \"Have you learned your lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to nod but couldn't move your head. You tried to speak instead and out came a quavering, \"Y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Sasha said, smiling. \"I'm happy to hear that! My fight against evil is of the utmost importance, so I need my sidekick's complete respect and obedience if we're going to triumph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sidekick?\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Sasha said, puffing herself up--literally, her throat inflated and she let out a loud burp before carrying on like nothing happened, \"the never-ending war against evil cannot be waged alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Says you, Ms. Fart Frog,' you thought. 'My part in your war ends in five years, max.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut loud you said, \"Of course, um... noble defender of justice? Would you mind getting me out of this chair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, faithful ward!\" She struck out her tongue again, this time slamming it against your face. Straining, her tongue pried you from the seat and again she squeezed you tightly against her breasts once you were close enough. You seriously hoped this would not be a recurring thing with her. Though you'd take gagging on frog saliva to frog flatulence any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" she said, \"we really must come up with a suitable heroic moniker for you. Something impressive! Not impressive enough to eclipse my name, obviously, but still something good... Hmm, we'll work on that later. But first, faithful ward, I require your aid in a most urgent task!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"What is it boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming, your new mistress said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eager at the prospect of taking down another shady character, Sasha used her tongue to point towards the laptop she had been using during your punishment. On the screen was a somewhat weak-looking, pale grey duck anthro with an equally uninspiring body. The girl was just fatty enough to be visibly out of shape, and far from having the massive amount of flab someone like Sasha would use to compensate. Not especially tall, muscular, or even intelligent-you wonder how she managed to get into the ASL in the first place, much less Move up to the silver division. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha farted to get your attention before giving her description of the anthro on the laptop, causing the breasts she's holding you with to jiggle around you. \"Observe, ward. This deplorable woman is Roche. You're probably wondering what's so great about her that she's managed to move up a league with a body like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds of silence periodically broken up by flatulence, you speak up with \"What's so special about her?\" Sasha, somewhat disappointed with her inability to make dramatic silence instead of awkward silence, responds \"Nothing. She's a complete greenhorn, and a clumsy one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did she get in the silver division?\"<br>\r\nOnce she arrived at the topic of villainy, Sasha became more vigorous and passionate in both speech and movement. \"The fiend has been shamelessly cheating since she first arrived here. Making a mockery of this sport is absolutely *uuuuurup* disgusting! It may be low to spy, but for justice exceptions must be made!\" You mutter under your<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have *urp* asked for a survival match normally, but fortunately for her, the wide frog of the law has more dangerous villains to pursue! She is just a stepping stone on my path to reaching the vilest of the silver division.\"  You doubted that someone like Roche cares enough about her pride to accept survival matches anyway, but your interest quickly shifted when Sasha's computer revealed who her current rival actually was. On the screen was Dominique, a hippo anthro that somehow managed to accrue an even worse rumor surrounding her than Sasha. Dominique's cruelty is universally feared among servants, but even worse is that she's rumored to know black magic as well. Even seeing a mere photo of her puts fear into your eyes.<br>\r\n (profile here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2046442-Anthro-Sumo/map/123\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha's throat puffed up in anger at the sight of Dominique, making her belch on return. You guessed that she must not have much control over her gas, considering that she seemed frustrated with herself over her outburst. \"The way she treats her subservients, it's simply unforgivable! They way she throws away the lives of all the slaves given to her sickens me.\" Sasha seemed legitimately appalled by Dominique's behavior, and you would have gained a lot of respect for her if she hadn't been subjecting you to a prolonged meet with her ass up until a few minutes ago. At the very least you felt relieved to know you aren't going to be eaten by your new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Sasha had calmed down at this point, signaled by her return from sudden mid-sentence burping to constant farting, \"my plan is to get rid of her for good in the free-for-all match to decide who gets to have a shot at a promotion. But first, I need to win enough matches in a row to get there, and I can't afford to lose now with all the competition I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to spy on Roche and see if I can tell how she's going to cheat?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Sasha lifted a rotund leg and farted with considerably more power than she had been before, sending ripples throughout her body and shaking you free of her breasts to gently roll down her expansive, jiggling belly, ending you off near a bag containing inconspicuous black clothing, binoculars, directions to Roche's room, and a device that will alert Sasha in case something goes wrong during your time away. Sasha gives you a \"now go, for great justice,\" before shoving you out the door too quickly for you do ask any more questions after getting everything in the bag together.</span></div></div>",

The building was made with the obese fighters in mind, so crawling through the vents and ducts to eavesdrop would be simple enough, but the bag Sasha gave to you was filled with useless junk. It was like she just pulled the items in the bag out of a Bond movie, you have no idea what she thought you would use it all for. Thoroughly perplexed, you crawl into the vents and make your way to Roche's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you find a vent opening into the apartment, and begin your quote-unquote \"spy mission.\" Before focusing on Roche, you gaze around her room to see if it could tell you anything about her. Out of all the residencies in the ASL, from intense training quarters to extravagant luxury apartments, Roche's stood out as the most bland ASL quarters you have ever seen. Yes, there were the common luxury items, but it had no real individuality or personalization. The only part of the room that had any insight into Roche's personality were the torn posters of other, more successful fighters on her wall. It was like the only thing fueling her was envy for the respect and fame of the ASL champions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving your eyes onto Roche herself, you see she already has her trump card planned out. She was talking to an anthro, a woman if their voice was any indication. You couldn't see the woman she was talking to from the vents, but the sizable wad of cash Roche held made it obvious that they were taking a bribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And make it discreet, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it, I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm not going down because you mess up, you hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you, I hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoche made a smug smirk as she handed handed over the money. Her stature displayed a hint of self-satisfaction, although it was overshadowed by a general air of irritation and frustration she seemed to carry with her. Once she payed the bribe in full, Roche aggressively made her disdain for her guest clear by immediately pressuring them to leave her be. She rested her arms on her soft, fatty midsection and signaled her impatience for their visitor's leave. As they hurriedly exit the room you finally get a good look at the other person and see they're... </span></div></div>",

I don't know a name or face, but I'd keep an eye on the door for when he goes out to run an errand, or something.\" Roche continued. \"Then, sometime before her next fight, you'll get <i>this</i> on his body. It's nothing illegal, or anything, but she's allergic enough to it that she'll swell up like a balloon the moment he comes back in...well, even <i>more</i> of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute, are they talking about </i>me? Marc scooted forward more along the vent, pressing his eye on the very bottom rung of the vent's airspace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoche he could still see, along with only a sliver of whoever she was scheming it up with, but a sliver was all it took. On top of the body of gold standing in front of her, he could make out the pink bangs from none other than Raina, eyes fixed on a bag of something green and leafy that the duck was holding high over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coyote didn't cease raising an eyebrow as she took the bag for herself, stuffed it into her pocket, and looked back down at Roche, folding her arms. \"...and you expect me to get this on him <i>how?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wh...y...you're asking <i>me</i> that?!\" Roche fumed, Raina's subtle enjoyment. \"Just...I dunno, do what you always do!

Capiche!?\" Roche seethed, clearly itching to kick the coyote out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Raina rolled her eyes and held out an open paw. \"Deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Roche didn't even bother giving her a shake and went straight for the door, opening it wide and pointing down the hall. \"We're set then. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina seemed legitimately surprised by Roche's bluntness, but let out a snicker as she saw her way out. Roche slammed the door shut the moment she was gone enough that it wouldn't hit her, still standing with her back against the door as she let out a long, exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That<b> bitch!</b></i> Marc fumed, fingers tensing around the vent's rungs as any pity he once felt from Roche's photograph faded away. It almost made him forget the warzone he'd treaded through underneath Sasha just an hour ago, whom he was suddenly eager to see in action and inflict whatever flatulence-related justice she had in her belly on the sickly duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the anger faded away into a chill of paranoia, imagining having to go up against Raina. Even in the rule-sanctioned world behind the scene for the ASL, Raina was a time bomb of chaos waiting for any chance to pour hair dye into the shampoo of her coworkers, and that's when she <i>wasn't</i> using her powers torment the other wrestlers with whatever kind of sugar-coated madness you'd think would only exist in some nutjob's opium high. The worst of her prank-driven hijinks were her servants, whom she'd stopped calling anything other than \"toys\" long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and now, somebody was <i>paying</i> her to do all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chills going down Marc's spine kept him frozen there for a whole minute before snapping out of it, and crawled his way back the entrance he'd made of the vent...</span></div></div>",

She smirked mischievously as she stared him up and down. A flood of questions entered Marc's mind. \"What. How? What? Why? How? How?! HOW?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was indeed the predominant question as not only had Raina somehow appeared directly behind him when not thirty seconds ago he had seen her walking out of Roche's room, but despite how the vent squeezed him on all sides and Raina's sizeable girth, she fit inside no problem, as if the metal somehow adjusted itself to her comfort. There were even a few inches of space above her head. It was true, she really was magic! It was one thing to hear it in rumors and another to see clear magic workings right in front of him. Marc's open-mouthed bewilderment just seemed to amuse Raina more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she said, \"you must be Sasha's trusty sidekick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not her sidekick!\" Marc snapped without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Would you prefer \"slave\" instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sidekick's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina giggled. \"Word of advice, if you're going to be working for the Poison Fart Frog, you might want to shower before crawling around in the ductwork to spy on people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't spying,\" Marc said hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc tried to come up with a plausible excuse for why he'd be crawling in the ducts above the room of his boss's rival wrestler, but he came up dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to get an autograph?\" Raina suggested. \"Or maybe trying to sneak a peek? How scandalous!\" she said in mock terror. Marc blushed. \"Or... maybe you were trying to figure out how the ugly duckling made it so far in the ASL? So... have you figured it out, trusty ward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gulped. \"I-I didn't see anything! Or hear anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Then allow me to fill you in! Using my vast but vaguely-defined powers, I'm helping Roche cheat in her fights so she can waddle her way into the spotlight for her fifteen minutes of fame. Her latest assignment is for me to get this,\" she said producing a bag of unidentifiable green, leafy things from nowhere, \"on her pathetic, new slave--aka you--\" she said, pointing a claw at you, \"and then get you back into contact with the Poison Fart Frog before their climactic battle tomorrow night! It's some kind of rare, ground up lily pad I think. Sasha's apparently highly allergic to it. A few minutes after being in her presence and she'll spend the rest of the week as a big, gassy beach ball. That'll give Roche plenty of time to knock her all over the ring tomorrow night. There, glad to help you get up to speed! Oh shoot,\" she said, snapping her fingers as if coming to a sudden realization. \"Now I guess you know too much. Darn. Guess now we need to move on to the fun part!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Marc yelped, feebly scooting back from Raina's extended hand. \"Waitwaitwaitwait! Why?! Why are you even doing this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same reason I do anything really,\" she said with a playful shrug. \"Because it's fun! Getting all these big bad career fighters to lose to someone so pathetic is hilarious! It's gonna be even funnier when the ugly duckling figures out how big of fall she's in for once I get bored of helping her. Now, enough evil monologuing, Mr. Sidekick! Time for the fun to begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Raina ignored Marc's pleas as she grabbed him, clamping a paw on his face to silence him, then maneuvered you both out of the air vents. A minute later and you were both out of the ductwork and into the hallway. Only this hallway wasn't outside Roche's room. It was right outside Sasha's! \"Damn magic!\" Marc thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's the abode of our flatulent hero, eagerly awaiting the return of her trusty ward! Now, the simple thing to do would be to mess with your memories and just cover you in the stuff, but where's the fun in that? I already have several delicious ideas on other ways to get you to get that lily dust on the Fart Frog. You might even survive one of them! Isn't that nice of me?\" Seeing the fear in Marc's eyes, she leaned in conspiratorially and whispered a parody of an supervillain's laugh in his ear, \"Mu-ha-ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Raina use her powers to carry out Roche's job?</span></div></div>",

At least, that's what he tried to said. All that he could hear coming out of his mouth were buzzing sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina seemed to have no problem understanding him, however. \"Afraid I can't do that, buzz-boy.

If you put on a good show, I'll make sure you survive this. If you don't, well...\" she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc hesitated in his escape attempt. She could do that? She clearly had powers but could they really extend to protecting him from harm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scout's honor,\" Raina said. \"Now, without further ado... Will Sasha's new ward be able to escape his froggy fate?\" she intoned like a narrator in an enjoyably cheesy tv show. \"Will he end up tongue-tied around his new boss? Will he find a way to stop bugging her? Or will he give her something to digest on? The answers to all these questions will be revealed... right about now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina quickly opened the door and threw the frantic fly-form of Marc into Sasha's room, closing the door quickly behind him. Marc took to the air difficultly. He'd never flown before, obviously, but it was hard to see with his new multi-faceted eyes, and the funk that lingered in the air was disorienting. He just hoped he had time to adjust to his new abilities, and that Sasha wasn't closeby--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What was that?\" Sasha asked. Marc slapped his head in frustration. The big blue frog got up from her seat and walked towards the door. \"Trusty *urp* ward? Is that--Hellooooo!\" she said breaking out into a wide smile, as she saw Marc buzzing near the ceiling. She laughed and licked her lips. \"I spy with my little *uuurrrrpp* the biggest, tastiest treat I've ever seen! Guess somebody forgot to pay the exterminator! How did something as big as you get into my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha! Sasha! It's me, Marc! You're new... sidekick? I was changed by Raina, you gotta help me!\" He new everything he was saying was just coming out as buzzing but he needed to try at least, even if it was impossi--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, friend, I'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf flies could gasp, Marc just did. \"Can you... Can you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing, I know you're just looking for a place of your own, well don't worry! I got the perfect spot for you!\" Marc's hopes were dashed as Sasha slapped her stomach, then grimaced in embarrassment as she passed gas. \"Now hold still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc recognized the sight of Sasha getting ready to lash out with her tongue and quickly weaved to the side. Her tongue missed him by a few inches and slapped against the ceiling. Marc's dodge had turned into a series of involuntary rolls in midair. He managed to straighten himself just in time to see Sasha getting ready for another strike. Marc went into a nosedive, her tongue whizzing over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha! Sasha! Please stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha paid him no mind, she just scowled as her snack alluded her. It must've been a smart insect. It had never taken her more than twice to snag a bug before. \"Guess I'm going to have to get trickier,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc waited as Sasha puffed herself up. She struck her tongue out and Marc was able to dodge again, but his moment of relief was short-lived. His new eyes allowed him to see Sasha's tongue somehow right itself in midair and change its course to come directly back at him. With a panicked buzz, Marc dodged again, but the tongue merely turned back around like a boomerang and came straight towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc cursed. He was so stupid! Using her tongue to fight was Sasha's specialty in the ring! It had been the downfall of many of her opponents and now it looked like it'd be his too! Marc flew and the tongue followed in pursuit. He zigged and the tongue zagged, he rolled and looped in the air, and the tongue followed. Marc made his way across the room and Sasha waddled after him, retracting her tongue and beginning the whole frantic chase again. Marc could only imagine how ridiculous this must've looked to Raina, a high-speed pursuit between a fly and a tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're laughing your ass off, bitch!\" Marc screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of sweat formed on Sasha's face as she focused on controlling her tongue. Part of her was curious how this fly was so smart, but the bigger, hungrier part of her just wanted this thing in her belly. An insidious idea popped into her head and Sasha smiled. She waited for the fly to get by a little closer then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc flew fast as Sasha reeled her tongue back in like a fishing line. He was ready for another deadly game of dodging when Sasha puffed herself up. Only this time, instead of her tongue, a sound-barrier-breaking belch erupts from her mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic waves and stale smelling air washed over Marc and disoriented him. He was flailing helplessly through the air in a blind panic, not knowing the difference between up and down. He tried to right himself but Sasha's powerful burp just went on and on. When the whirlwind finally stopped, Marc's eyes stung and there was a ringing in his... did fly's have ears?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he noticed Sasha was getting ready to strike again, there was barely no time to react at all. Marc dodged and...</span></div></div>",

She'd already worked up a lot of drool, imagining the taste of giant treat. It was better than she imagined! Sasha plopped back down in her chair and enjoyed her treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly was drenched in her drool, as she worked it around her mouth and savored it's taste. Her tongue licked the bug up and down. As she sucked on the thing like a piece of candy, she belched every now and then inside of her mouth, nearly choking the little fly. The poor little thing frantically tried to escape. Sasha giggled as she felt its wings beating against the inside of her mouth. She had a wicked idea and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc saw a chance for freedom and tried to take it. He made it two inches out of her mouth before Sasha lashed out her tongue and grabbed him again. She laughed and did it a few more times. Each time teasing her treat with hope, only to snatch it away. Eventually she began to feel bad for toying with it so much and decided to end it. Sucking on it for a few more seconds to get the last of its flavor, she finally worked it to the back of her throat and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha felt the bug make its way down her throat slowly. She could feel it repeatedly try to fly up and out of her throat but every time it did that, she just gulped again and sent it on its way into its final destination. At long last the fly plopped into her stomach and Sasha let out a contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRRPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha smacked her lips. The tickling sensation of the fly buzzing about in her belly pleased her. She hadn't had a bug that delicious in a long, long time. She didn't eat bugs in public. Her gas damaged her image enough, so she didn't need to be known as the \"flatulent, bug-eating, wannabe superhero.\" In private though, it was nice to indulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat for a few minutes, feeling the struggles of the fly grow weaker and weaker. She knew that soon enough it's struggles would stop entirely. Poor thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha grimaced as she felt more gas build-up inside her. She let off a few belches and farts to alleviate the tension, but somehow there seemed to be more than usual. A pain started in her gut, and her stomach groaned in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, don't tell me there was something in that fly... I... Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha felt her tongue grow thicker in her mouth. She watched in shock as her fingers began to swell up. Then her arms, then her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Don't tell me that had lily--Oooooooh,\" Sasha clutched her stomach in pain and let out another fart. All of a sudden she was swelling up even bigger than usual. She protested as she grew too big for her chair and it broke beneath her. Her clothes stretched tight against her and strained to contain her flab. When she finally stopped growing, she was twice her usual size and practically a perfect sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROCHE!\" Sasha cried to the heavens. \"FOUL, EVIL-DOER! EVIL-DOING FOWL! SHE DID THIS TO ME!\" Sasha cursed. \"I'm in no shape to beat her tomorrow, and I can't cancel the match! Insidious cur! Where is my sidekick?! Why didn't he warn me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside Sasha's now even vaster stomach, Marc was not having a good time. He'd survived for several minutes, but was now floating in the stomach acid, quickly digesting. When he'd first been swallowed, he'd tried to fly above the ocean of stomach acid but his wings were weak from his constant flying and heavy from Sasha's drool that had soaked into them. Eventually he landed on a remnant of cake that he'd seen Sasha eating earlier. Guess his hopes were wrong. Guess he was joining the thing in her stomach. With his added weight, the cake eventually submerged into the burning liquid, and he went with it. He'd tried to swim but it was hard to do so, and eventually the stomach, and his unknowing captor, expanded as the allergic lily pads digested alongside him and took their effect on her. Now his prison was even bigger, but it did Marc no good as the tingling acids ate away at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raina,\" Marc said weakly. \"You said if I gave you a good show you'd spare me. If that wasn't the best damn show of your life, you're a liar! Now change me back... change me... back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc blacked out and sank beneath the waves of Sasha's stomach acid, his body continuing to digest. His fate was in Raina's psychotic paws now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Raina keep her word?</span></div></div>",

She saw Marc sink beneath the stomach acids and let out an exaggerated yawn. \"Meh. Two stars. What else is on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked to a new image in her crystal ball, like changing channels on a TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day the match proceeded as scheduled. ASL employees needed to roll Sasha out onto the stage while Roche led the audience in laughing at her. When the bell rang to begin the fight, all Roche had to do was gently push Sasha to get her on her back, then stood triumphantly atop the giant frog's side as the referee counted to ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the match was in the bag for Roche... Until Sasha involuntarily let out an earth-shattering fart, one of the last remnants of Marc's troubled digestion. It was strong enough to role Sasha forward. Roche was unable to keep her balance and fell, where she was squashed underneath the amphibian vigilante and unable to move. To make matters worse for the evil avian, she was pinned directly beneath Sasha's butt and forced to suffer her gas from point-blank range. Now everyone in the audience was laughing at the duck's domination instead, but none harder than Raina herself who was wiping tears from her eyes as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match was over in less than a minute with Sasha victorious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Marc, Sasha never learned what happened to her faithful sidekick. When he never returned, she assumed he'd been devoured by Roche or one of the forces of evil that aided her nefarious crimes. Sasha at least took comfort in the fact that she had bested Roche in the ring, avenging her sidekick by humiliating and crushing the evil-doer he fell prey to, never realizing that the true killer was her digestive system.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Daisy</i><br>\r\nSpecies: Pig Anthro<br>\r\nHeight: 25'2''<br>\r\nAppearance: Pink-skinned, blue eyed and red-haired which she draws back into a long ponytail. She has a smattering of freckles on her cheeks. Massively obese, Daisy has large breasts but a truly massive ass that protrudes out like a hill from her backside. Though surrounded in flab, her arms and legs are heavily muscled from working out. She wears stereotypical cowboy garb, her usual outfit being a white cowboy hat, a yellow vest, white cowboy boots, and daisy dukes that ride up her ass so much they look like a thong.<br>\r\nA Texan native, Daisy has been a tomboy ever since childhood. Unhygenic, uncouth, and willing to get down and dirty, most of this is owed to Daisy literally being raised in a barn. While she's always been passionate about sports, fighting has always been what she's loved most and she's dreamed of joining the ASL ever since she first found out about it. She's determined to rise the ranks and be the best fighter the league's ever seen. Incredibly competitive, she finds being in the Silver Division instead of the Gold to be unbearable. As a mistress, Daisy can be described as friendly but uncaring towards her servants. While she'll always talk to them jovially, and isn't known for eating her servants at random, her position in the league is her top priority, and she frequently recruits her servants to use as training dummies to practice her moves on. During these training sessions, she never holds back, and doesn't care at all about the pain or humiliation she inflicts on her servants. She also has a perfectionist streak, meaning that she's prone to trying out a move over and over again until she gets it right. Unfortunately, Daisy is also incredibly superstitious when it comes to good and bad luck. Like certain sports fans, she believes performing certain rituals guarantee her victory. For example, she once accidentally sat on a servant for two hours before a match. Since that match was later one of her most spectacular victories, she spent a week sitting on the hapless servant for two hours prior to every match. On the flip side, if her luck runs out, Daisy is paranoid and quick to blame her servants, thinking they've \"jinxed her\" or are actively trying to sabotage her career. Once that idea gets into her head, the best case scenario is that her servant will end up in the hospital. The worst is that they'll end up in her stomach. In a fight, Daisy will do anything to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gloria aka Glamor Gator</i><br>\r\nSpecies: Alligator Anthro<br>\r\nHeight: 27'1''<br>\r\nAppearance: Emerald-skinned with a golden underbelly, she has black glossy hair that she wears in ringlets, ruby-painted lips, black-colored eyes surrounded by purple mascara. Gloria is very much a big beautiful woman, and takes immense pride in her appearance, outside of the ring she wears elegant dresses, while inside her clothing becomes flashier while still remaining fashionable. She also uses specially designed make-up that doesn't run or smear even during fights in the league.<br>\r\nGloria, or Glamor Gator as she prefers her stage name, is a total diva and narcissist. Gloria joined the league to gain fame and wealth, and works hard to cultivate an image of being a sophisticated, glamorous and powerful, yet feminine, figure. This careful management of her image has succeeded as she's scored consistently high in league popularity polls. Gloria believes she deserves the finest things in life, the best clothes, the best treatment, and the best food. This unfortunately causes her to gripe about \"merely\" being in the Silver Division instead of the Gold. Gloria is a cold and haughty person who demands constant respect and admiration but gives none in return, with the only people she ever treats nicely being her fans. She thinks little of her fellow fighters in the league, and nothing at all about the servants she's given, referring to them as merely \"slaves\" who exist to serve her every whim, and she has quite a lot of whims. She constantly works her slaves, demanding them to pamper her nearly 24/7. Humans have it particularly rough as they are also her favorite food. Those who fail her, either through incompetence or malice, are met with brutal punishment. Those who fail consistently are devoured. However, Gloria is not the type to just wolf down some poor sap on the spot, instead she'll go out of her way to prepare them as a wonderful feast. After all, she deserves the best. The only exception to this are those unfortunate souls who happen to catch her doing something \"unladylike.\" Gloria has worked hard to maintain her imagine, and those who see her outside of the elegant portrayal she's constructed for herself are immediately eaten to silence them permanently. It's said her last slave was eaten merely for walking in and seeing her with a bad case of bed head. Rumor has it that Gloria actually comes from a family of sewer gators. This may explain her need to appear a perfect feminine beauty, but the rumor has never been confirmed because no one has dared to ask her. In the ring, Gloria fights with power and precision, her moves more stylish and acrobatic than the normal fighter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Marc reached the door of his new mistress, he spent a minute standing outside it in dread. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and tried to work up the courage to knock. Daisy was far from the worst mistress in the league, he had heard horror stories about fighters like Dominique or the \"Glory Gator\" that made his skin crawl. However, by the sounds of it, she was still a hundred times more dangerous than his old mistress. He let out a sigh, he missed her. Sure he'd only known her for a month and was essentially her slave... and she kept accidentally sitting on him... and had even nearly eaten him once when he had fallen into her breakfast... But putting all that aside, she'd been nice and had always apologized after injuring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was no use dwelling on the past or delaying the inevitable. Marc drew himself up and knocked on the door. The ground started to shake and Marc immediately rethought the benefits of delaying the inevitable. The door swung open and his new mistress stood before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was colossal, an obese, pig anthro who stood over twenty-five feet tall. Her ass was so massive that her daisy dukes rode up so far that it almost looked like she was wearing a thong. She was dressed as a cowgirl, wearing a white hat and cowboy boots. A white sports bra was all she wore under her yellow vest, her impressive cleavage was smattered with freckles like the ones on her cheeks. Remnants of her lunch covered her face and stained her clothes. She apparently ate like... Well, a pig. When she saw Marc, Daisy broke into a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lookie here!\" she said in a southern drawl. \"I got me a gentleman caller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc blinked. \"What? No! I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be shy, darlin'. Come on in and let Daisy show you some hospitality,\" Daisy said, bending down and scooping Marc up to crush him in a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc struggled for breath as he was squeezed against pig flab and flailed ineffectually as the pig woman pulled him inside her room and locked the door behind them. The inside of her room looked like a cross between a barn and a gym. The wooden walls were painted red, straw covered the floor. One half of the room contained a massive mattress, a feeding trough in place of a dinner table with a massive hay bale standing in for a chair. The trough was filled to the brim with an assortment of foods, everything from burgers and pizzas to cakes and ice cream.  The other half of the room was filled with weights and exercise equipment. Dirty clothes and food remnants littered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you don't mind my living arrangements,\" she said. \"It's rough bein' away from home and family. But now that I got a new lil boyfriend to keep me company, maybe I won't be so homesick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc finally managed to break free of her fat for a second to say, \"Miss Daisy, there's been a mistake! I'm your new helper, not--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy let out an uproarious laugh, occasionally snorting as she did so, causing her layers of fat to jiggle. \"Well, shoot. I know that, darlin'! You just looked so cute and scared, I couldn't help pullin' your leg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy let him go, causing Marc to fall on the floor, landing on his ass. Daisy let out a grunt as she plopped herself back on her hay bale. She reached into her trough and pulled out a whole cake which she eagerly ate half of in one bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she said with her mouth full, \"I got a good feeling about you! I'm not one to judge a book by its cover, but you got a mighty cover, if I do say so myself! Let's hope your the lucky charm I need.\" She paused in eating the rest of her cake and scrunched up her face as if she tasted something bad. \"Hopefully, you're a better helper than the last one they sent me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Marc asked, getting to his feet. \"What was wrong with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little bastard suckered me in with his friendliness and eagerness to help. I was one match away from breaking into the Gold Division and all of a sudden I got the worst losing streak of my life! I hate losing!\" she said, smushing the cake in a fist. She began licking the chocolate off her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... what happened to him?\" Marc asked, already fearing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy fixed her blue eyes on him--they were surprisingly beautiful--and smiled. With her free hand, she patted her bloated stomach and a second later let out a herculean belch. Marc gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's forget about that lil' jerk,\" Daisy said. \"I gotta full schedule lined up for you today, darlin'! Gotta break you in, somehow! There's a match coming up and I got new moves to practice. And there's loads of chores for you to get working on. This place is a sty!\" she said then laughed and snorted at her own joke. \"Now did I write first on your list?\"</span></div></div>",

Daisy was trying to remember what the first thing she needed her new human servant for was and then let out a squeal as the first thing on the list finally came to her. \"Ah know!\" yelled the pig lady in her southern accent. \"I need a training dummy for a new wrassling move ah've been working on. And it looks like you're the perfect match.\" Mark gave a gulp. \"Oh no.\" He thought to himself. Daisy gave another snort and then nodded her head. \"Better get yourself ready. Ah'd hate to break you on your first day.\" \"She doesn't want to break me,\" muttered Marc to himself. \"Sure she doesn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc walked to what looked like a large pad in the center of the room that looked like a waller of dried up mud and stood in place. He knew what happened would most likely be painful and the titanic sow was taking off her cowgirl hat and switched her vest to a zigzag-print vest and then put on a pair of mismatched socks. Marc was wondering exactly what the pig lady was doing, but he did remember that he was now working for a very superstitious giantess. Marc guessed that Daisy was in the middle of some kind of good luck ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the look of it, Marc was right because Daisy was standing on one food and jumping up and down. \"Cetus, Buffalo, Unicorn!\" she chanted. \"Cetus, Buffalo, Unicorn!\" Daisy then started to sway from side to side and closed her eyes before drawing pennies on them before she breathed in and breathed out and scratched her right ear. Marc was trying his best not to laugh, knowing full well that it would end painfully for him. Daisy then danced the worm as she spoke in an indecipherable language and then stood up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Marc's enormous pig mistress. \"But that's my training ritual for good luck. I gotta get this new technique just right. I need all the luck I can get in the Anthro Sumo League.\" Marc let out a sigh. \"I  know what you mean,\" Marc thought to himself. \"I'm going to need all the luck in the world just to survive until my contract expires.\" Marc then coughed before Daisy waddled forward towards the ring. \"Exactly what is the technique?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy cleared her throat before she told Marc exactly what kind of technique she was going to practice on him...</span></div></div>",

She nudged him left and right a few times until she was perfectly satisfied he was directly in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Now this is very important. Don't. Move,\" she said, poking him in the chest as she said it. The force of her mere finger poke was enough to cause him to stumble. Daisy glared. \"What did ah just say?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe readjusted Marc's position and walked off the pad to a rope hanging nearby. \"And now the finishing touches,\" Daisy said as she yanked on the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc opened his mouth to ask what the rope was for but this proved to be a huge mistake, as a downpour of mud drenched him and made him gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww,\" Daisy sighed. \"Jus' like home. Now don't move, darlin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc heard the thunder of footsteps rushing towards him. He wiped the mud out of his eyes just in time to see Daisy launched herself in the air. Marc watched in open-mouthed amazement as she did three flips in the air then started to come down, twisting so her massive ass was aimed straight at him. Daisy's backside crashed into him with the force of a meteor, squashing him like a pancake and crushing him into the fresh mud on the mat. Marc moaned beneath her. Above him he could hear Daisy speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tarnation! Pardon my language, darlin'. Ah just get so frustrated when I mess up a routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gasped as Daisy got off of him and pulled him off the mat with a squelching sound as he emerged from the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said, barely paying Marc any heed. \"You stand here and we'll go again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Marc gasped. \"We don't need to go again! That seemed perfect to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'aw, that's sweet of you to say, darlin', but it's also a lie. The move's called the \"Ham Sandwich.\" It only works when the \"meat,\" she said grabbing Marc, \"is directly between the two \"buns,\"\" she said, showing Marc her crack. \"You were crushed under a cheek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's another anthro even supposed to fit up your crack?! Most are as big as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most. Not all, darlin'. It pays to be prepared. Now, let's try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc pondered the possibility of running for it, but he was still weak from the move when he heard Daisy rushing at him again. She jumped, flipped twice in the air, and landed ass-first on Marc again. This time her aim was true and Marc shot directly up her crack. Marc blanched from the increased pressure and stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DANG IT!\" Daisy roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her feet and picked Marc out of her crack like a wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was wrong now?!\" Marc moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm supposed to do three flips, not two. Shoot. Well, no use stallin'. Let's go again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely had strength to look up as he heard Daisy coming at him again. This time she did the move perfectly. A jump, three flips, a human up the crack, and her assistant in a state of pain and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're talkin'!\" Daisy cheered. \"This'll drive the crowd wild! Ok,\" she said, getting up and prying Marc out of her backside, \"let's do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! But you did it perfectly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Daisy said, \"and practice makes perfect! So we gotta make sure this success carries over to the ring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Marc did try to stumble away but Daisy quickly grabbed him and put him back into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong way, darlin'!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc tried to move again but his legs gave out and he fell to his knees. Next thing he new, he experienced the familiar sensation of total porcine ass encompassment. Once again, Daisy did the move perfectly, and once again she wanted to try it again... and again... and again... The sight of nothing but pink flesh and brown mud, the intense pressure, the horrid stench. It was all growing disturbingly familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, Daisy was finally satisfied. \"Alright, darlin',\" she said, grabbing Marc's limp form, \"I think that's enough. Let's move on to the next move! ... Darlin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy noticed that Marc had blacked out. It must've happened recently because he she had felt him squirming not ten seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, poor lil' fella's plum tuckered out. He's so cute. Shame Ah can't afford to go soft! Can't have him sleepin' on the job and goin' unpunished. Now... what would be the best way to wake him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc awoke with a start a few minutes later. He was terrified to find himself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc groaned in disgust as he realized he was covered in food. There was whipped cream and cherries in his hair, chocolate sauce and caramel on his chest and freezing cold lumps that turned out to be every flavor of ice cream in the world underneath him. He was confused for a few seconds, then he took in the walls on either side of him and realized something horrifying. He was inside Daisy's feeding trough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he realized that, he was in for another scary surprise when his giant pig mistress appeared over him, looking down. She was wearing a bib with a knife and fork on it, and a human between them. She looked at Marc and the drool inside her mouth almost leaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah mus' say, darlin', ya sure do look mighty appetizin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy! What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, darlin', ya passed out on me afore I was done trainin'. Ah can't have ya slackin' off! Trainin's important to me, and ah need ya to understand that! So... ah gotta punish ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to eat me?!\" Marc squeaked. \"Over one mistake?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy let out a snorting laugh. \"Of course not, darlin'! Don't be silly! Ah wouldn't eat ya over one lil' hiccup. This is just a warnin' for ya... And a bit of a treat for me.\" She licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc groaned. He'd avoided being eaten in the past, but he'd been inside an anthro's mouth several times before. It was never pretty but it beat being digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it over with,\" Marc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if ah do!\" Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy didn't just pluck him out of the trough like he expected. She grabbed the entire trough, lifted it over her head and tilted one side into her gaping mouth. One second Marc was on one side of the trough, the next he was sliding down like a freezing cold slide. He avoided going directly into Daisy's mouth but only because the scoops of ice cream piled up at the end into a small hillock. He landed on the mound and began sinking into it. It was like creamy quicksand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc couldn't see well through the melted ice cream covering his face and eyes, but he could hear the greedy slurping, gulping sounds as Daisy messily devoured her trough of ice cream. Marc would've been impressed at her eating abilities if he wasn't dreading what would come next. The cold around his feet gave way to a warmth. Daisy's tongue had found her prize. She let out a squeal of pleasure as she licked Marc's feet, and despite how much Marc hated the situation, his feet were ticklish, and he couldn't stop laughing. He felt her lips chomp on his feet and before he knew it, she slurped him into her mouth like a noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's environment changed from the freezing cold of the ice cream mountains, to warm, wet and humid as he and the scoops of ice cream were worked around the inside of Daisy's mouth. Judging by the squeals of delight and moaning sounds Daisy made as she ran her tongue over his body and slammed him against her cheeks, Marc was a flavor sensation. A delightful combo as his taste mingled with each new flavor of ice cream she inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of savoring her dessert, Daisy would expertly maneuver the melted ice cream to the back of her throat and swallow, keeping her human sucker away. Clearly she'd had a lot of practice with not swallowing a living lifesaver. Marc wasn't sure if that was a good sign or not. He watched as gulp after gulp of frozen dairy product disappeared down her gullet, followed by frequent burps that he was forced to breathe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the best time Marc had ever been in someone's mouth, but it also wasn't the worst. Usually when an anthro wanted a taste and he couldn't talk them out of it, he just let his body be loose and let them do whatever they wanted until they had enough and spit him out. This time was no different. His body hurt from the earlier training, his boss's breath stank to high heaven, and he'd get the occasional mouthful of pre-chewed ice cream and pig drool. In spite of all of that, he comforted himself with one crucial thought. <i>\"At least she isn't trying to eat me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes of this treatment, that thought wasn't much comfort. Daisy had swallowed the last of her ice cream a few minutes ago but she hadn't spit him out yet. She was sucking on him so hard that he was convinced she wanted every last drop of flavor wringed out of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother couple of minutes and Marc decided to go against his philosophy of playing dead in the mouth and just spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy, please let me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't reply. She just made satisfied slurping and munching sounds as she continued to taste him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy!\" Marc said louder. \"Please let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't respond again. Now Marc was getting worried. This had happened before when someone enjoyed his taste so much that she zoned out and just focused on savoring him. The time that happened, he'd nearly been swallowed. But surely that wouldn't happen this time. Right?</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were glazed over as she delightedly sucked and slurped on her treat. The only thing ruining the moment was a small muffled sound, a faint buzzing in her ears like a fly. She ignored it as much as she could and instead focused on the magnificent taste on her tongue. Her stomach growled in anticipation. She was already full but she <i>needed</i> this tasty treat inside her. After several minutes she couldn't take it anymore. She tilted her head and swallowed. A screaming lump made it's way down her throat and plopped into her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy reclined on her hay bale seat contentedly and let out a victorious belch. She was in the first stages of a food coma. She rubbed her full belly contentedly--and felt her belly rub her back. It took a few seconds before the realization of what she'd done dawned on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Tarnation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAISY!\" Marc's muffled shouts came from the depths of her stomach. He was pounding on her stomach walls to get her attention. \"YOU ATE ME! LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy blushed. It was always so embarrassing when this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marc,\" she said nervously. \"Um, sorry about that... Ah... Ah didn't mean to swallow ya. Ya just ended up so much more delectable than Ah anticipated. Ya shoulda warned me ya tasted so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc nearly tore his hair out. \"Well <i>excuse me</i> for not \"warning\" you about my flavor.

Marc was left with the sounds of her groaning insides and the lake of melted ice cream he'd been devoured with. Marc was starting to get worried. There was sweat on his forehead, and it wasn't just caused by the sweltering confines of the humid stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Marc, ah just feel awful about this whole thing. Ah never intended to eat you up, ah swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gulped. He didn't like the sound of her tone. \"I know you didn't Daisy. It's alright. I forgive you. Just let me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing,\" Daisy said sadly. \"Ah can't let ya out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya see, Marc, ah have a match tomorrow. Ah've already won a couple matches in a row, and ya know what happens when ah reach ten. Ah get promoted to the Gold Division! And... ya see... the last time ah threw up before a fight, it ended up bein' the worst match of my life. Ah lost in the first minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy that's just a coincidence!\" Marc said desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah just can't take that chance, Marc. Not when ah'm on a winnin' streak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just gonna digest me out of some stupid superstition?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm sorry, darlin'. Ah know these rituals sound crazy to some folk, but ah hope you can understand. You're really cute, and so tasty, but ah just can't afford to let ya out. Ah'm here to be the best fighter the ASL's ever known, and, sometimes... bein' the best means ya gotta be a lil' ruthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc raged and screamed inside her, but as far as Daisy was concerned, the conversation was over. She went about her day, training for her match the next day, lifting weights, doing exercises and practicing her moves on a training dummy. It would've been better to practice against a live target but that was no longer an option. If Marc thought things couldn't get any worse, he hadn't counted on living through a training regime with Daisy on the inside. Her stomach was like a zero-g chamber as his captor flipped through the air and taking Marc with her. He was weightless for a few moments before falling back into the lake of stomach acid and ice cream. He was squeezed and contracted like an accordion as he did crunches and squats. The absolute worst, however, were the belly flops. By the time Daisy's training was done, Marc had blacked, floating in the tingling liquid inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up hours later as Daisy was getting ready for bed. He was in so much pain at this point that he'd like to say that digestion would be a mercy, but he'd be lying. He really didn't want to die, and as soon as he woke up he resumed his feeble pleas and struggles to convince Daisy to let him go. Unfortunately, his struggles weren't doing anything to change Daisy's mind. If anything, they convinced her to keep Marc inside her. In her opinion, one of the best parts of having a living meal was the massage they gave you inside your tummy. It tickled and was soothing all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy got into bed and pulled up the covers, then talked to the occupant of her engorged belly. \"Well, darlin', ah'm sorry it has to be this way. We may not have known each other for very long, but you were a real sweetie. Ah would've liked it if ya could've stuck around a bit longer, but ah guess it just wasn' meant to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer unwilling meal gave out a last desperate shout and pounded furiously against her stomach. The commotion caused gas to build up inside her and Daisy let out the biggest belch of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP P!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething came shooting out of her mouth and she caught it easily. It was Marc's employee ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, darlin'! Did ya wanna give me a souvenir to remember ya by? That's so sweet of you!\" She smacked her lips. \"And ya gave me one last taste too. Ah'm really gonna miss ya. No other assistant has ever been as givin' to me as you've been. Ah'll cherish this forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound coming from Daisy's gut may have been a groan or a sob. Daisy slipped Marc's employee ID into her substantial cleavage and turned off the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nighty, night Marc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Daisy made it to her match bright and early. She was bright, refreshed, and had a happy, warm feeling in her stomach. The match that followed was the easiest fight of her entire career. To her complete surprise, the opponent she'd been dreading was knocked out with only one punch. She was amazed with herself until she got back to her room and remembered Marc's employee ID still stuck between her monumental breasts. It didn't take much for Daisy to come up with a new superstition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darlin', you really are my lucky charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy slipped the ID with Marc's awkwardly grinning face on it back into her cleavage. From that day on, she'd never fight another match without her lucky charmed snuggled between her breasts. Her winning streak continued and before Daisy knew it, she had fought and beaten Avery herself, finally getting into the top ASL league. She remained in the Gold Division for the rest of her career, and she never lost a single fight. When asked about her amazing success, Daisy said she owed it all to her assistant giving her a lucky charm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc hesitated outside the massive door to his new mistress's room. He really, really, really did not want to go in there. Whenever a person was assigned a mistress in the ASL, it was usually a 50/50 chance whether they'd be a good boss or a nightmare, but the Glamor Gator was the nightmare that even nightmares feared. The horror stories that floated around her made Marc's skin crawl. The only one who might beat her out as worst boss was Dominique since Marc heard she could do magic, but even then, \"only\" having the second-worst boss in the ASL was small comfort. Especially when rumor had it that the longest a human servant had lasted in Gloria's employ was only a month before he ended up on his boss's menu. Being assigned to the Glamor Gator was practically a death sentence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of fantasizing about impossible, but incredibly tempting, escape plans, Marc knocked on the door before he could decide to abandon all reason and run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter,\" a cold, deep voice called from the other side of the door. Even muffled, Marc could make out Gloria's French accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gulped and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had heard that Gloria loved the finer things in life and her rooms at the ASL definitely reflected that. An aroma of flowers and cinnamon wafted around Marc upon entry. The main room was divided into several parts, a dining room, a kitchen, and a living room. Through an open door in the back, Marc was surprised to spy an indoor spa. The other two doors presumably led to Gloria's bathroom and bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's new boss was sitting in the living room on a couch big enough for Marc's entire extended family. She wore a black glittering dress, and had a string of pearls around her neck. Marc was amazed to find himself thinking of her as beautiful. The thought was involuntary and confusing and he quickly tried to put it out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's bare feet were propped on an ottoman. A flat-screen television big enough to flatten Marc into a pancake was opposite her. However, the television was off, and instead Gloria was reading a magazine. Marc couldn't see the cover but presumed his new boss's picture was on it. Why? Because an entire wall of the living room was covered wall-to-wall in magazines kept in pristine condition, all of which featured Gloria displayed prominently on the cover. The adjacent wall was covered with plaques, ribbons and various awards she had won. Magazines, pictures, and awards were all within viewing distance of Gloria's place on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria had pulled her eyes away from her magazine to appraise Marc as he entered. The cold look on her face was enough to make Marc wonder if she disliked him simply for interrupting her reading about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello,\" Marc said, his voice coming out weak. \"M-my name is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave,\" the Glamor Gator said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name,\" she said, turning her gaze back to her reading. \"It's Slave. Whatever you called yourself before, whatever your family called you? That doesn't matter. You're nothing more than a slave, and you belong to me. If you survive until your contract expires, you can go about calling yourself whatever you want, but so long as you're my property, you'll take the name that I give you. And you, are Slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's fear was momentarily overcome by his injured pride. Outrage knocked all the horror stories he'd heard of his boss out of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you wait just a minute!\" Marc said, ill-advisedly taking a few steps towards the colossal man-eater. \"I don't know how you treated your other servants, but you're not gonna treat me like some--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the slightest change of expression, Gloria's tail lashed out and wrapped around Marc like a python, knocking the breath out of him. He struggled for air as Gloria idly turned the page of her magazine. Only when Marc was close to blacking out did she loosen her grip enough for him to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Gloria looked at her new human, closed her magazine, and showed Marc the cover. Marc paled. It was a cooking magazine. The cover featured Gloria sipping wine as she sat at the end of a candle-lit dinner table. On the platter before her, hog-tied and with an apple in his mouth, was a terrified human man near Marc's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was another of my humans. His name was Slave too. I can't recall at all, how many slaves I've had between him and you. Like you, he believed he could talk back to me. When he made the poor choice to do it more than once, I decided to have him assist me in a photo-shoot for Fabulous Connoisseur's. He may have been disagreeable as a slave, but he was more than agreeable as dinner. Now... remind me. What was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-slave!\" Marc choked out without hesitation. \"My name's Slave, Ms. Gat--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress,\" she said, slightly tightening her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Slave, Mistress!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she said. \"Needless to say, further disrespect will result in harsher punishment, but I trust you can't be so thick-witted as to make that mistake again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's tail released Marc and he fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should feel honored, really,\" Gloria said as she reclined in her seat and turned her eyes back to her magazine. \"Having a mistress as wonderful as me is surely better than serving that barnyard jock or flatulent wannabe-vigilante. Now, for your first task...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria got up from her seat and beckoned Marc to follow with one perfectly-manicured figure. She walked--sauntered really--to the room containing her indoor spa, and he wondered if Gloria was trying to be actively seductive or if she'd just conditioned herself to naturally walk that way. He knew she tried to encapsulate perfection at all times. That might've impressed Marc had she not threatened to kill him less than a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spa room was only slightly smaller than the main room. Everyone used the word \"spa\" but in reality it was more of a pool. The air was hot and humid inside, the roof covered in a jungle canopy. Bright lights shined through the vegetation. The water didn't bubble but steam came off the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria sat on a nearby lounge chair with her back towards her new slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unzip me,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc blinked. \"I'm sorry?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dress,\" she said coolly. \"Un. Zip. Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc hurried to obey. Even sitting down she towered over him. He climbed up next to her on the chair and extended to his tiptoes. He was just barely able to grab the black zipper and pull down on it. The times the zipper stuck his heart stuck in his chest, fearing that he'd be blamed for anything that happened to her dress. He avoided staring at the skin he exposed, feeling terrified that merely looking at her was an offense worthy of being devoured. Eventually the zipper was all the way down and as soon as it was, the Glamor Gator stood and shrugged the dress off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a black bikini underneath which left very little to the imagination. Her golden underbelly was fully exposed. Marc couldn't help but wonder how many people just in his position had met their fates in that forgiving gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be in good shape for a human,\" Gloria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc wasn't sure if she meant it as a compliment or just coldly stating a fact. Either way, politeness was probably the best course of action. \"Thank you, Mistress,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip to your underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't enjoy repeating myself, Slave. If you're going to keep doing it, I may as well eat you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" Marc said hurriedly.  \"I'll do whatever you say, Mistress! See?\" He quickly began to strip as fast as he could. Gloria watched him. There was no emotion in those cold, reptilian eyes. Once he was in his underwear she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swim twice a day,\" she said. \"An hour in the morning and an hour at night. And I never eat before I swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc looked at her awkwardly, not sure what exactly she wanted from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do my best swimming when sufficiently motivated,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gulped. He had a bad feeling about this. \"How can I help motivate you, Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever hear about the carrot and the stick, Slave?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"You're the carrot. I'm the stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning she pushed him into the pool. Marc fell into the deep end and cried out as he hit the hot water. It was scalding. He flailed beneath the water for a second before breaking the surface and sputtering before his indifferent mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can swim at least,\" Gloria nodded. \"Good. If you couldn't, I would have to end this right now. Do you see those jets next to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc turned and saw two large holes in the wall at the pool's end, underneath the water. When he looked back to his mistress, she was already doing that saunter walk of hers to the other end of the pool. There was a control panel just next to the steps leading to the shallow end. There was a dial that went to 10 and a red switch. She appraised Marc carefully then moved the dial to 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually I swim at a 7. Unfortunately I'm still a bit sluggish from yesterday's match. This is good news for you since you're the rare slave who will have time to acclimatize to his new duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc looked terrified. He didn't feel like this was good news at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as I flip the switch, the jets will start shooting water out. You'll try to stay at those jets, and I'll keep a steady pace swimming behind you. If you don't swim fast enough, they'll blow you to the shallow... To me... You understand the consequences of that happening right?\" She bared her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc nodded in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word the Glamor Gator flipped the switch. The jets started shooting out water. Even though they were only turned up halfway, the current was faster than Marc expected. Gloria took a few steps in the pool. The hot water didn't bother her at all. Keeping her eyes locked on Marc, she opened her jaw wide and began swimming toward him. Marc yelped and began swimming as hard as he could, though the current was so harsh, he didn't move from the spot he started swimming in. Gloria, on the other hand, glided through the water almost lazily. When she was halfway through the pool she slowed down to swim at a consistent pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Marc, the swimming was murder. He couldn't relent for even a moment or else he'd be swept into the waiting maw of his mistress. Yet there was an hour to go. Could he make it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc swam and swam, pushing his body to the limit as Gloria effortlessly swam behind him, mouth open, waiting to catch him at any moment. He'd tried to keep track of how much time remained in his head, but between the effort of swimming and fear of being breakfast for his new mistress, he lost count frequently. He thought at least 40 mins had passed so far but he couldn't be sure. His arms and legs hurt so much that Marc was positive they'd fall off before the hour was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his best efforts, he was slowly losing ground as the jets pushed him back further and further. With a jolt of terror, Marc felt Gloria's hot breath on his feet. He didn't dare look back, but he knew she was right on top of him. The fear gave him a surge of strength and he used it to swim as hard as he could. He prayed to whatever merciful god there was that he wouldn't lose a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timer rang. The jets stopped flowing. Without the current Marc managed to make it another few inches forward. That was just enough distance he needed, as Gloria chomped her jaws down behind him, missing his toes by a hairsbreadth. Marc kept swimming until he hit the end of the pool, and hung off the edge, panting heavily. Gloria stood up in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disappointing,\" she said. \"If I'd been going at my usual rate, you'd be dead. Here's hoping you can get faster in time for tonight's swim. Now dry yourself off and prepare me breakfast. There's instructions for you in the kitchen. I expect the meal to be carried out to perfection within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria got out of the pool and wrapped a towel around herself. She didn't spare Marc a second glance as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy monster,\" Marc mumbled to himself, as quietly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing the danger of messing up, Marc wasn't worried too much about cooking, even for an unappeasable connoisseur like the Glamor Gator. A little time in the ASL had been all Marc needed to realize the importance of keeping the fighters well fed. After finding out how many servants got wolfed down for preparing lousy meals, Marc got really good at cooking, really fast. The biggest problem was the time it took to make the massive portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was sitting at her dining room table, wearing a new black dress. Marc brought out the breakfast in waves, each time carrying them on a silver platter so heavy he could've broken his back underneath it. He laid out an omlette, bacon, sausage links, French toast, waffles with whipped cream, crepes, and hashbrowns. When he was done, he stood silently while Gloria sampled what he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tasted a bite of the omlette and she arched an eyebrow in surprise. \"Perhaps you're not completely useless, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc decided to take that as a compliment. \"Thanks Gloria,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gator's tail reached out and smacked him across the face, knocking him to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still \"Mistress\", Slave,\" she said coolly, sipping her glass of iced orange juice. \"If a single compliment is all it takes for you to forget your place, I'll let you go without.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I hope somebody turns you into a handbag someday,\"</i> Marc thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria continued her meal and Marc kept his mouth shut as she daintily picked at the food he prepared. Despite how ladylike she acted while eating, she still devoured the entire thing in little under fifteen minutes. When she was done, she patted her lips with a napkin and got up from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along, Slave,\" she said. \"The ASL is holding a press-conference to create hype for my match tomorrow evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survival?\" Marc asked. Gloria narrowed her eyes, hearing the excitement in his voice. \"I mean, I just don't want you in danger,\" he said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Marc was sure she hadn't bought it, for whatever reason the Glamor Gator seemed ready to let his slip go. Maybe she was full from breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a regular match,\" she said. \"I won't lower myself to messily scarfing someone down in front of a roaring crowd. It's hardly ladylike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then why does the ASL recruit ladies?\"</i> Marc thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you fighting?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria opened her mouth and responded...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dominique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria ordered Marc to carry her purse for her and Marc grunted in strain as he grabbed it off the table. It weighed a ton. He ended up carrying it by wrapping the spaghetti string around his chest and wearing it it like a backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The match may not be survival, but maybe me and every assistant in the ASL will get lucky and these two will end up killing each other anyway,\"</i> Marc thought as he struggled to keep up with Gloria as she walked down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the conference center minutes later, the place was packed with reporters and fans. Dominique was seated at the table, and a cat anthro was waiting at the door. She was slender, unlike most anthros Marc had seen around the ASL, but at eleven-feet-tall she was almost double his height. She had black fur, blue hair in a bun, and a purple business suit and skirt. She wore rectangular glasses and had gold eyes. Her name was Penelope Pierce and she was Gloria's agent. Actually, she was Dominique's agent too. In fact, most of the ASL's most popular fighters were represented by her. She didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late,\" she snapped at Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was impressed at her bravery since the gator towered over her and could snap her in half with a single bite of her jaws. Gloria wasn't mad though. For the first time since Marc had met her, the gator looked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fashionably late, darling. The better to get the crowd's attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominique isn't happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria laughed like a noblewoman from a cartoon. \"When is she ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of her laugh, the reporters and fans noticed her. Cameras flashed as they took her picture, and Gloria's fans--mostly drooling men, human and anthro both--began cheering, the closest begging her for autographs. To Marc's complete surprise, Gloria obliged them, signing autographs and making pleasant small-talk with her fans. \"Of course she treats her fans well,\" Marc thought. \"She wants their worship. If only they spent a couple minutes alone with her, then see how she treats them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason Gloria was spending so much time with her fans became clear when Marc got a look at Dominique's face. The hippo was not happy. She'd been kept waiting once, and now she was forced to wait again. Dominique's own fans didn't take the blatant disrespect well either. They all had a kind of grunge/punk/goth look and were mostly made up of anthro men and women, and a few human women. Marc had heard about Dominique's hatred of human men and her fans apparently shared her prejudice. When they saw Marc standing behind Gloria, they put two and two together and began insulting and threatening him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can mock Dominique, runt?!\" \"Why don't you and your lizard go to hell?\" \"Come here, twerp, I haven't eaten yet!\" \"Go against the Dom and she'll turn you into a stain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc groaned internally. <i>\"Well, it's not like I'm here to make friends.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of Gloria deliberately stalling, Dominique got up and slammed her fist on the table, breaking it in half. \"WILL YOU GET UP HERE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria looked at her like she hadn't even noticed her. \"Oh, so sorry, Dominique. I completely forgot you were there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mess with me!\" the hippo growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Pierce gave Gloria a pointed look and the gator sighed. She took her purse from Marc and muttered under her breath, \"Stand up straight and don't move. Don't embarrass me either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc glared at her as she approached the stage. One of Gloria's fans, a human man who'd gotten a selfie with Gloria, leaned over and spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be so happy to be working for the Glamor Gator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's freaking heaven on earth,\" Marc grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmployees hauled in a new table and Ms. Pierce grabbed a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We apologize for the slight delay, but we'd like to welcome everyone to today's conference. Today we'll be talking about tomorrow's match. This is the big one. The one you've all been waiting for. The fight between Dominique and Gloria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and rival chants, one side saying, \"GO DOM! GO DOM!\" and the other, \"GLAMOR GATOR! GLAMOR GATOR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Pierce detailed the specifics of tomorrow night's match, hyping up the long build-up between the first ever fight between Gloria and Dominique. She then allowed questions from the press, and said fan questions would follow. Whenever Dominique answered a question, she would pepper her answer with threats of violence, mentions of how no opponent could defeat her, and, if the person questioning her was a human man, she would work take their question, no matter how innocuous, as a personal attack and promised them pain and suffering in return. Eventually they stopped throwing her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria acted the opposite. Whenever asked a question she would respond articulately and cordially, as if she was flattered to be asked a question at all. She turned on the charm, fawning over those who asked her anything, usually making them blush in response. She was clearly trying to buy the fans' and reporters' adulation. It was enough to make Marc roll his eyes. He crossed his arms impatiently, just waiting for the entire thing to be over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It looked like the press conference was having its desired effect. Gloria and Dominique would trade insults and veiled threats, the fans would holler in excitement and the reporters would write down every word they said. If the conference was any gauge, tomorrow night's match was going to have a lot of hype behind it. Not that Marc cared. After half an hour of this, he was bored as all hell. It was around this time that a female voice whispered from directly behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That gator's gonna need her food pre-chewed when the Dom's finished with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc smiled at that image. Then he realized the comment was directed at him. <i>Then</i> he realized it was intended to offend him. <i>\"Damn it,\"</i> Marc thought. <i>\"Did one of Dominique's fans get over here? How did one of those behemoths waddle over without me noticing? Just stay calm. Act like you didn't hear her. Last thing I need is for Gloria to think I'm trying to steal her spotlight.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm talking to you... What are you deaf, runt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman slapped Marc on the back of his head. He couldn't help himself but turn around to look at his attacker. What he saw surprised him. The woman was a squirrel anthro with red fur. She was pudgy with chubby cheeks. She was definitely a Dominique fan. She wore the same kind of goth/punk clothes as her other fans, and she dyed her black hair with indigo tips. Her bangs hid one of her eyes. Her t-shirt had an indigo silhouette of Dominique on it, the hippo had one leg on the back of a kneeling human. None of this was what surprised Marc. The thing that shocked him the most about the anthro was that she was... tiny! She was a foot shorter than him, absolutely miniscule by anthro standards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc couldn't help it. He'd been expecting a big bruiser and turned around to find a shrimp. He laughed. The squirrel scowled. Her cheeks turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's so funny, runt?!\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Marc said. He forced his face back into a serious expression. \"Sorry. Just... remembering a joke from earlier!\" He cringed at how lame the excuse was. \"What can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make fun of me!\" the squirrel snapped. \"We all knew what you were doing. You and that stupid lizard were making fun of Dominique. Well you're not gonna be laughing when she breaks that gator's legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually Marc did think that was funny, and made the mistake of laughing again. That just made the squirrel angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! You've pissed me off! You and me. Outside. Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you crazy? Ok. First off, I'm not allowed to leave the premises without permission. Second, you really want to fight me? I mean you're so sh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't get another word out. The squirrel opened her mouth impossibly wide and before he knew what was happening he was head and shoulders deep inside her, face-to-face with her uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f--GET THE HELL OFF ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel tried to swallow him but Marc was able to get his hands up and pushed against her mouth. His attacker was suspended in the air while Marc was left in the dark. Outside he could hear screams as people saw what was going on. Some of Dominique's fans began cheering the squirrel on as they saw her trying to swallow Marc whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get him, Roxie!\" one of them called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's hands were beginning to slip against the slippery insides of her mouth. Marc remembered where the wall was and ran over to. He started slamming against it, giving Roxie's head a good pounding too. It was enough to daze her and her attempts to eat him were weaker. Marc finally managed to shove her off with the suction sound of a miniature vacuum being pulled off skin. He saw two anthro security guards rushing over to them. One of them grabbed Roxie as she lunged to continue the fight and the other grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that sorry excuse of a man doing to my fan?\" Dominique bellowed at Gloria, as if her fan hadn't tried to eat her slave alive. \"If he hurt her, I'll grind him into a pancake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria ignored the second part of her sentence. \"A good question, Dominique. What <i>were</i> you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria asked the question in a frosty voice. Marc realized all eyes, including his mistress's, were on him. She looked ready to kill. Marc gulped. How would he be able to talk his way out of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Marc is able to salvage the press conference by acting like the entire thing was a publicity stunt to generate more hype. Gloria will not punish him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Roxie spins the story first and Gloria lets Dominique or Roxie punish Marc however they want.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the direness of the situation still didn't mean his brain was fast enough at coming up with an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh... W-well... You see--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was horrible!\" a meek, pitiful voice cried out. The pain and heartache in the voice shocked Marc. He looked to his side and was surprised to see the same squirrel that had just tried to eat him alive was now bawling her eyes out. \"The m-man s-said that Dominique didn't stand a chance against Gloria! H-he s-said that G-Gloria was gonna make an exception to her d-diet and eat Dominique alive during the match! I b-begged him to s-stop, but he just kept saying Dominique was a dead woman over and over again, a-a-and I-I-I c-couldn't bear to hear him say that! Dominique is m-my h-hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirrel, nothing! This woman was a weasel! Marc couldn't believe the lies he heard her say about him. And the worst part was how convincing she sounded: the poor, pitiful heartbroken fan trying to defend her idol's honor. If he hadn't known the truth for himself, even he would've believed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie!\" Marc yelled. \"I never said any of that! She jumped me out of nowhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie broke out into bigger sobs at being called a liar and the crowd booed at him. None of them believed him. Dominique was fuming and her fans were calling for his blood. Gloria's fans looked at him like he was a disgrace to their shining star. Even the reporters looked at him like he was a monster. Marc looked at Gloria for help, but her eyes were cold. Marc gulped. He was a dead man and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"THAT'S IT GLAMOR GATOR!\"</i> Dominique roared. She was almost frothing at the mouth. <i>\"FIRST YOU SHOW UP LATE, THEN YOUR SLAVE ATTACKS ONE OF MY FANS, AND NOW HE CALLS HER A LIAR?! I DON'T WANNA WAIT FOR THE MATCH, I'LL EAT YOU AND YOUR HUMAN ALIVE RIGHT HERE!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria didn't respond right away. She took a deep breath, composed herself, and spoke clearly. \"I am deeply remorseful for the actions of my servant, Dominique. I swear to you that I never told him to obey in such a disrespectful manner--and I certainly never made any claim that I would eat you during our match. It goes against my nature, and I have to maintain my girlish figure, after all.\" There was some laughter from the reporters and Gloria's fans at that. Dominique and her own fans just grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" Gloria continued, \"I admit that the flaws in my slave's behavior are a reflection of my poor instruction. For this, I am truly sorry and pray for your forgiveness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's fans made pitying sounds. Clearly they thought she was being too hard on herself. Personally, Marc would rather she be hard on herself rather than him, but his opinion didn't count for much here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As an apology, I will offer up my slave's life to Dominique. You may do with him whatever you please. It may hurt me to lose his service, but it is a sacrifice I'm willing to bare to maintain the dignity of our sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fans and reporters cheered. Even Marc had to admit it was impressively done. Gloria maintained her air of glamor and superiority while coming across as gracious and sympathetic. Roxie got to look like the poor victim and gained the attention of the reporters as well as her hero. And Dominique got a human male--her favorite type of victim--to destroy in any way she desired. It was a win-win for everyone... except for Marc, of course. As the aforementioned, soon-to-be-destroyed human male, he was horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe met Dominique's vengeful gaze and began desperately trying to squirm out of the grip of security. From the corner of his eye he saw Roxie smirking at him. Her tears had dried up and there was an evil look in her eyes just for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you up on that offer, Glamor Gator,\" Dominique sneered, stepping down from the stage. She loomed over Marc and he gulped audibly. \"I'm gonna show this pathetic runt exactly what I do to insects like him, but know this you overgrown suitcase. What I do to him's gonna be nothing compared to what I do to you in our match. Nobody hurts my fans. Anyone who does deals with the Dom-Inator!\" Dominique's fans hooted and hollered, but Gloria remained as composed as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" the titanic hippo said, turning her full attention to Marc. \"I'd love nothing more than to destroy you right here and now, but you hurt one of my fans, so she's the one who gets to decide what happens to you.\" She turned to the squirrel. \"What's your name, hun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Roxie,\" the squirrel said, blushing furiously at being addressed by her hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the victim here. What would you like to be done to this maggot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie looked between Dominique and Marc. She smiled wide and Marc's heart plummeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Roxie want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Roxie wants Dominique to feed Marc to her, right in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Roxie wants to train with Dominique and use Marc as their personal practice dummy.</span></div></div>",

Your meal was rudely interrupted. It's only right we put this pathetic loser right where he belongs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie looked overjoyed and Dominique's fans cheered their idol on. The applause washed out Marc's begging and pleading for mercy. Not that he figured it would've done much good anyway. Dominique was infamous for her hatred of human males, a hatred her fans shared. The giant hippo grabbed Marc, pinning his arms to his side. Marc could make out Dominique's fans pointing and laughing at him as he kicked and screamed. Dominique held Marc above the squirrel and prepared to lower him down head-first. There were flashes as photographers and fans took pictures of the sight. Marc had no doubt he'd be a headline somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Roxie held up her hand and Dominique stopped. The jeers of the crowd grew quiet. Marc sighed in relief, hardly believing his good luck. Was the squirrel actually showing him mercy? Of course not. \"Stuff him in feet-first. I want photos so I can see the look on his face before he slides down my throat. I'll make the one with his most pathetic expression my profile pic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's heart fell but Dominique found it hilarious. \"You have an evil mind, hun. I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique didn't waste any time, she repositioned him before he could object and lowered him into Roxie's hungry maw. The squirrel couldn't stop the flow of drool leaking from her mouth onto her shirt as she waited in anticipation for her meal. Marc's feet slipped inside her mouth and her tongue eagerly lapped at them. He tried kicking her in the throat to make her sick, but Roxie didn't seem to have a gag reflex. Given that she'd nearly swallowed him before without problem, he shouldn't have been surprised, but he couldn't fight his instinct to fight. With a gulp, Marc was pulled further in, his legs vanishing down the squirrel's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive technique,\" Dominique said in appreciation. \"No offense but from what I've seen, smaller gals like you usually take longer to down a human whole. You swallowed once and he's already halfway down your throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie blushed even more at being complimented by her hero. \"Ank oo,\" she said, with her mouth full. She swallowed again and the force of it was strong enough to yank Marc out of Dominique's hands. The hippo's jaw dropped in surprise. The only part of Marc that remained un-ingested was his head, which was peaking over her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone stop this, please! Gloria! Anyone! Please! I swear I didn't do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just like every other example of your worthless species and gender,\" Dominique growled. \"Instead of admitting your mistakes, you deny, deny, deny. You deserve to melt away in the belly of an anthro goddess. At least then you'll be serving some purpose, even if it is just as good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!\" Marc said, giving up on dignity if it earned him another shot at life. \"I'm sorry! I was wrong and I take full responsibility!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Dominique laughed. \"Since you take full responsibility, you should have no problem letting Roxie swallow you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! That's not what I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Roxie. How about a selfie of the three of us before you send him on your way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie couldn't talk with her mouth full but Dominique took her squeal of delight as a \"yes.\" Dominique knelt down next to the squirrel. She still loomed over her fan but Roxie managed to get her, Dom, and Marc all in frame. The squirrel's smile widened as she saw tears running down the pathetic human's face. Marc knew his crying was being caught on camera by not just Roxie, but every fan and reporter present, but he couldn't help himself. He'd always known this fate was a possibility, he just hadn't actually expected it to happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay eese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese!\" Dominique said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of flashes went off from Roxie and her friends phones and the photographers cameras. They kept going off even as Roxie swallowed with her mouth open. They kept going off as the squirrel traced Marc's head going down her throat with a fat finger. They kept going off as Roxie patted her engorged stomach, which jiggled and bulged as Marc pressed against its walls in a futile effort to get out. And they kept going off as Roxie struck a heroic pose and let out a deep guttural belch, signaling her ultimate victory over the pathetic specimen of a human male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me,\" Roxie said, not in the least bit embarrassed. Dominique's fans went wild--Roxie's friends loudest of all, cheering her on and complimenting her on a job well done. Roxie felt pride in her accomplishment. She'd never been cheered on by an adoring crowd for her. Was this what Dominique felt every time she emerged victorious from the ring? She could get used to it. She could also get used to the feeling of an insignificant human man writhing in her gut. She didn't even know his name but the internal massage he gave her while trying to free himself was divine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Roxie,\" Dominique said, flashing the squirrel a thumbs up. \"You did good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dom-Inator!\" Roxie gushed, blushing even more. Being complimented by her hero made Roxie feel like she had butterflies in her stomach... Or maybe that was just Marc? Either way, it was wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" Dominique said, \"you handled yourself so well. I want to give you another gift. Something special for my Number 1 Fan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the squirrel's stomach, Marc couldn't believe his situation could get any worse. Bad enough that he was devoured to a round of thunderous applause and mockery, but Roxie's short and pudgy frame meant that her stomach was even more constraining than any of those of the much larger anthros. He was squeezed between Roxie's previous meals and the slimy walls of her stomach. He wasn't just gonna be digested, he was gonna be digested without any leg room. And now, overhearing the muffled conversation from outside, Dominique was going to give Roxie another reward for devouring him. What could it possibly be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Backstage Passes for the match between the Dominator and the Glamor Gator. Roxie and her friends will go on a celebratory bar run beforehand, stuffing themselves and drinking, and Marc will be present for all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Dominique wants to induct Roxie into the ASL as her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 right away. She'll take her and start training right away. Marc's hell will get a lot worse as Roxie tries out her new wrestling moves.</span></div></div>",

Massively obese, Chorus' weight mostly accumulates in her belly, the area on her body left the most untouched by robotic, but her robotic arms and legs are able to flex, gain weight, and even squish like actual fat does. She sees through an optic sensor implanted along her face like a sleeping mask, which displays s a pixelated set of eyes to help her express emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: Formerly a Russian ballerina, Chorus' life of glamor and vigor were thought to have been over after an explosion onstage destroyed her body, but many of the top scientists of her country saw her as the perfect test for their most ambitious project: a transformation that bonds flesh to metal through an unlikely hybrid of science and magic. Even for somebody of her size, Chorus is an incredibly heavy fighter due to the sheer cybernetics in her body, which, combined with her skill for magic, makes her extremely difficult to knock over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds no specific prejudices for or against her opponents and servants, but expects them to carry on any task needed to help her prepare for battle without any condition whatsoever. For her colorful appearance, Chorus can seem utterly devoid of feeling, save for determination in being the strongest fighter she can be, but she's often prone to mental glitches that come and go at pure random, leading her to feel nothing but an overwhelming bout of a single emotion, whether it be joy, sadness, cruelty, anger, fear, adoration, or lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Morgan</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Raven Ghost Anthro<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 18'6\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Partly transluscent, but features a monochromatic teal hue. Her appearance can vary, but Morgan tends to settle on a very fat build that mostly accentuates her belly and thigh, her legs fading out of visibility below the knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: Probably the only fighter with a successful career after losing a survival match, management initially did what little it could to shoo Morgan away when it was discovereed that her spirit was still haunting the facility, but popular fan demand called for her to be reinstated into the roster instead, and to this day, her shows draw in massive crowds for the spectacle she provides. Being a ghost, she has the ability to shapeshift, possess others, and levitate matter, as long as she has enough energy in hersystem left to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile prideful, Morgan still comes across as a very friendly and lenient boss towards her servants, but is still widely feared by those at risk of being employed for her. True, she may not have any issues with the living, but she has an inquenchable hunger in her stomach for the souls of those who die in the facility, assimilating their mass into her body. Her sense for other spirits is so strong that her room is regularly lined with ectoplasm to keep her from escaping, and she's personally escorted throughout the facility by a team of ghost hunting experts whenever she has to leave.</span></div></div>",

Has an almost featureless face, save for a pair of white eye-like splotches and a maw that can completely unhinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn parasitic alien abomination that has permanently merged with her host\u2019s body after years of bondage, dissolving whatever brain existed before. When some anthros prefer regular food and some can eat both non living and living meals, Uproar <i>only</i> eats other anthros, both out of taste and necessity. Her fights can last as long as five survival matches in a row, but humans to her are as disposable as soap; some can last only so far as ten seconds of entering her room before getting snacked on by her, but in the rare, rare cases where she sees more to them than food (that is, when\u2019s she\u2019s absolutely stuffed or just really, <i>really</i> bored,) she can get a kick out of forcing them into all kinds of degrading, dangerous acts to see how strong their will to live is.</span></div></div>",

Pan fights mainly with her horns, hooves and her psychic abilities that allow her to attack the minds of her opponents. Pan considers herself to be a sophisticated animal and acts more refined compared to her partner. But that doesn't mean she doesn't like to use humans as butt cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Spot</i><br>\r\nSpecies: Dalmatian Anthro<br>\r\nHeight: 22' 1\"<br>\r\nAppearance: A large and obese Dalmatian with a large stomach and D-cup breasts. She has black hair with a white lightning bolt streak in it and has a distinctively beauty mark under her eye.<br>\r\nSpot is Pan's roommate and tag team partner who has been a friend of hers since both of them were teenagers. Spot relies on rather underhanded tactics and fights using her claws and teeth. She has also been learning psychic abilities from Pan but so far can only perform telekinesis. Compared to Pan, Spot is a horrible slob with terrible manners, especially with her gluttonous appetite and is especially crude when it comes to humans. The contrast in their personalities led one to wonder <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTag Team 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Elizabeth</i><br>\r\nSpecies: Draco Lizard Anthro<br>\r\nHeight: 18' 11\"<br>\r\nAppearance: A bright green-skinned lizard with long red-hair and yellow-green colored wing-flaps under her arms. Very obese but with muscular arms and a large and thick heavy booty with a long tail.<br>\r\nElizabeth is a so far undefeated lizard who only participates in tag team matches with her roommate and lover, Winona. Both of them have a tendency to use humans as sex toys, but Elizabeth is more gentle and almost maternal with such small humans. This does not extend to her fighting style as she uses her wings to fly high while using her ass as a flying guillotine to crush her opponents from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jennifer</i><br>\r\nSpecies: Parrot Anthro<br>\r\nHeight: 18' 11\"<br>\r\nAppearance: A large and blue and red feathered macaw with an enormous belly, meaty muscular thighs and long blonde hair. Also has a long black beak.<br>\r\nJennifer is Elizabeth's tag team partner and lover. She is a lot rougher and more masculine and can be rather hard on humans. She takes insults to Elizabeth personally and is rumored to have shoved the last human to insult Elizabeth in a rather unpleasant place. Like Elizabeth, Jennifer mainly attacks by flying from the air. She uses her large talons and beak to tear into her opponents while the occasional belly slam.</span></div></div>",

Huntress wears a black top and loin cloth, leaving her massive belly exposed. Very fat, with a bulging stomach, but muscular arms and legs.<br>\r\nA cave woman from the dawn of time, this mammoth anthro was frozen in a block of ice only to be thawed out in present day. When asked who she was, she only ever responded, \"Huntress,\" leaving it ambiguous if this is her name or her former role. The media surrounding her discovery was enormous, and the league wasted no time in signing her up. As a mighty warrior from her own time who was respected for her prowess, Huntress was more than happy to have a job where she could participate in grand battles once again. Even though she has to start in the Bronze League, most are confident she'll rise quickly through the ranks. Despite being hired to fight fellow anthros, Huntress bares them no ill-will. In fact, she considers every other anthro in the league as her friend. No matter how badly they treat her, she always naively assumes they're just joking or messing around. Huntress does have some trouble to adjusting to modern times, often confused by new technology and the current culture. Due to her lack of organizational skills, absent-mindedness, and oblivious awareness of present norms, her servant needs to act more as her handler, telling her when and where to train, and steer her towards matches. However, this is highly dangerous for humans as she lived in a time where humans (or \"yummies\" as she calls them) were nothing more than walking food, and she has not outgrown that mindset. It took the League a long time to teach her not to eat any fan or League higher-ups on sight. Servants like Marc, however? They neglected to tell her how to behave around them. She also has an embarrassing habit of snorting humans up her trunk, enjoying the way they tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Raina</i><br>\r\nSpecies: Coyote Anthro<br>\r\nHeight: 15'3''<br>\r\nAppearance: Bright golden-furred, blue-eyed, and pink-haired done up in a ponytail. Raina favors bright, colorful clothes.<br>\r\nLike Dominique, Raina is a fighter who possesses magical abilities. Merely some of the magic she's capable of includes transforming people's size or shape, altering memories, and even bestowing invincibility or immortality. This isn't known to the League at large however (with the exception of Dminique), and she doesn't use these abilities in the ring (or at least she claims she doesn't). How she became so powerful is unknown but she implies that she's a descendant of an actual trickster god, and has been around for a long, long time. Raina is a creature of impulse, and joined the League to cure her current boredom. She's been bounced around all three divisions, but for some reason holds no fear of actually being kicked out. Raina only acts for the sake of her own amusement, viewing everyone around her as a plaything instead of a person. Constantly cheerful, bubbling with laughter, and immature despite her centuries of life, Raina is definitely a trickster at heart who enjoys tormenting both her fellow fighters and her servants with hilarious pranks. Hilarious for her at any rate. While her fellow fighters are safe from lasting harm, for her servants, these pranks can range from humiliating to deadly. Raina delights in enlisting her servants to help her prank a fellow fighter, then sits back and watches the chaos unfold. Due to her vast magical powers, she can allow a servant to survive a normally lethal prank... provided she thinks her new \"toy\" is amusing enough to keep around for a while.</span></div></div>",

His new mistress's room was right around the corner, and from the sounds of it, there was quite the commotion going on. Nervously, Marc peered around the corner. Dominique was standing just outside Raina's room, pounding on the door and screaming her lungs out. Marc gulped. Dominique was one of the cruelest fighters in the league. Destroying men was her hobby! It was even rumored she could do magic. It was odd though, Marc had seen her before and she always had kind of a gothic style to her, but her current look was a complete 180. Instead of a red mullet, her hair was pink and in pigtails. It even had flowers in it! Instead of black clothes, she wore a golden sundress. The mystery of her appearance was quickly solved by her next bout of ranting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE YOU FLEA-BITTEN COYOTE! I SAW YOU! YOU DID THIS TO ME AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA PAY! NOW COME OUT HERE AND FACE ME LIKE A WOMAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's heart was pounding in his ears. He did not want to go out there, not with a magic man-eater erupting like a volcano. Maybe he could sneak away and come back later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, some people just can't take a joke,\" a chipper voice whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc nearly leapt out of his skin and almost screamed but a white paw that encompassed his head, silenced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, friend,\" the voice said. \"No need to raise a ruckus and alert tall, not-so-dark, and angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand spun him around and he was face-to-face with a gigantic coyote, who was leaning down to match his gaze. Her fur was bright gold, except for the paws of her hands and feet which were white. Her long pink hair was done up in a ponytail. The coyote wasn't quite as fat as some of the other fighters in the ASL, but she was still massive compared to Marc. She was pear-shaped, with her gigantic ass at least five times as wide as him. She wore a light green top covered in a floral print, which showed off her prodigious breasts. She smiled widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Raina,\" she said. Before Marc could question how she got out of her room, she forcibly shook Marc's hand and crushed it in her grip. Marc managed to turn his cry of pain into a barely audible squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, though,\" she said, \"I thought Dominique would be happy with her change in wardrobe! Before she looked so down and dreary, now she's a pleasant ray of sunshine! Ah well, some people are just so unappreciative. Shame. But I'm sure you won't be such a stick-in-the-mud, Marc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know my name?\" Marc asked quietly, still terrified of the enraged hippo nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stole your wallet,\" the coyote said nonchalantly, holding his wallet up between two furry fingers. \"God, you had bad acne,\" she said, inspecting your driver's license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Marc said is a hushed, hurried voice. \"Give me that back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" she said, dropping it into Marc's hands. \"It's pretty worthless now that I've taken out the cash, credit cards and book club membership card though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I can!\" she said. \"I'm you're new boss, what's yours is mine! And you're mine too, technically, so it's not like you can forge a formal complaint. Now--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CAN'T HIDE FOREVER, YOU STUPID MONGREL! MEET ME FOR A SURVIVAL MATCH AND I'LL FIX YOUR MANGY HIDE GOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina sighed and rolled her eyes. \"What say you and I move this conversation somewhere more peaceful? I've set aside the whole day to play with my new toy, and I don't want Domi spoiling them before they even begin! Now, better hold your breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina grabbed him and shoved him in her cleavage. One minute a struggling human was visible, the next her boobs concealed all sight of him. The only sign of him from the outside was the jiggle of her breasts as he squirmed against them. Raina began skipping down the whole, somehow not making a sound, leaving her oblivious nemesis behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just know you're going to be my favorite toy, Marc!\" she said. \"I already have so many games in mind for us to play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc dreaded her frequent use of the word toy, but all he could do was wait for her to get to her destination and free him from his sweaty prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was she headed?</span></div></div>",

It didn't come up on any of his 'most wanted' lists, thankfully, but he also couldn't remember seeing it in any of the Anthro Sumo rosters before. There wasn't even a species or height to clue him in, leaving him totally in the dark about his new mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he fully noticed the room number: 106. He looked up at the hallway, the doorways along the walls scaling smaller and smaller the further away from him they were, and the very largest nearby was one only big enough for an anthro in the range of fifteen feet: 200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc ran forward, the hallway gradually shrinking around him like a funnel. He kept glancing between the sheet in his hands and the doors he was rushing by, startled each time by how slowly their numbers were shrinking. When he was halfway down, the doors were already for the nine-footers, and each were noticeably trunking down a few inches more than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was reeling, and soon he was staring only at the sheet, trying to make sense of all this. \"What's going<i> on?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes glanced to the side just in time to see \"106\" fly past, and he skidded to a stop just inches from hitting a single end table on the wall with a potted plant sitting on top. He took a few long steps back, stopping when he was at the door of his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't move to knock it, however, and instead just stared in awe at its size. When he'd applied for the ASL, he'd had a pretty clear picture of what he was walking into; constantly getting sat on by some gigantic sumo wrestler, halving to dodge every which way whenever he was a few feet near a buffet, and just about any kind of hell a human could endure in a building of sweaty, obnoxious monsters thousands of times heavier than he was, but none of that could've prepared him for where he was standing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorframe was perfect for his size. Blinking a few times, he moved his arm up and, for the longest time since he could even remember, reached <i>down</i> to grab the knocker and give it three quick raps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Coming!\" </i>He heard a light, yet mature voice inside say. There weren't any audible footsteps moving around in the room, but the doorknob still turned, pulling open from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, for a brief moment, Marc looked straight in the face of a whole lot of nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're name's Marc, right?\" A voice politely asked from somewhere around his stomach. \"Name's Denise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing a messy head of black hair at the bottom of his sight, Marc tilted his head down at a blurb of red standing in front of him, then flinched back from his new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was abnormally large on her frame, understandable, given the league's indomitable waistlines, but its size was nowhere near as abnormal as the fact that it was only as large as an overstuffed bean bag chair, slightly crushed beneath an E-cup pair of breasts dressed in a black T-shirt that, by god, <i>fit.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was just a smooth, blubbery red ball with only two red eyes and a pair of black pincers left to emote, and all of them were currently looking up at him with a friendly smile, with two red antennae gently twitching through her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't answer, standing completely still as he stared down at his diminutive boss in utter awe, until she gave a humored giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"I...I'm sorry, I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry about it, I knew I'd get stares in a place like this.\" She laughed. She turned around, dragging around a thorax behind her as big as a backpack. \"Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc followed her, and was quick to feel unease by the size of her room. It was probably passable enough for a human to live in, as much as he could remember one being, but something about entering a room in the facility with a ceiling that wasn't a few dozen feet over him felt really off-putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise grunted softly as she went up a tiny set of stairs going up to a couch, then spun around, her tush expertly landing on the cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Denise...\" Marc clumsily began, with Denise looking back with curious eyes. \"...is there anything you'd needed me to do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has brown hair that she wears in a bun. In the ring or while training she wears a red mawashi and bra. Broad shouldered with large breasts, most of her weight is in her gigantic stomach which is tight as a drum. She has a lot of muscle in her arms and thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya has worked and trained her entire life to be the best sumo wrestler in the world. After competing and winning in a series of amateur competitions, she was ecstatic when she was offered the chance to sign a ten-year-contract with the most prestigious sumo league in the world. Unfortunately for Kaguya, she didn't read the fine print. Instead of signing up for the aforementioned most prestigious sumo league in the world for anthros (the Sumo-Anthro League or the SAL), she didn't realize she was joining the Anthro Sumo League (ASL). Ever since she found out that she'd signed on to a league that's more like MMA or professional wrestling than real sumo, she's been desperately trying to get out of her contract to no avail. While she hates being in the ASL, she's too stubborn to half-ass it in the ring. While fighting, she always tries her best to win while staying straight to her traditional sumo roots, meaning she'll normally just try to push her opponents out of the ring instead of doing anything flashy. She also refuses to participate in anything other than \"Regular\" matches. So far she's been undefeated and is only two matches away from joining the Silver Division. However, this \"no flash\" approach to fighting, while effective, also makes her wildly unpopular with the fans who consider her \"boring,\" meaning her matches usually end up advertising her as a \"heel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these factors mixed together have made Kaguya bitter, short-tempered and prone to violent outbursts over perceived slights, an attitude that does not bode well for her human servants. Though she used to be indifferent to humans, now they're her primary targets in venting her frequent frustrations. Luckily(?) she prefers pummeling her servants instead of devouring them, though that doesn't mean she hasn't eaten them in the past or wouldn't eat one if sufficiently angry. It may be difficult to survive a tenure as Kaguya's servant, but given that she's just as angry as being tricked into a long contract with the ASL as Marc is, they at least have something in common. Who knows? Maybe Marc could even break through to her and make a friend... Provided he doesn't do anything too stupid to tick her off first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope \"Penny\" Pierce<br>\r\nSpecies: Persian Cat<br>\r\nHeight: 22'11\"<br>\r\nAppearance: White furred with long hair that's gone gray but is kept dyed to her former gold. While many fighters in the ASL are fat, Penelope's become roughly the size of a small planet. She's in her mid-fifties and is showing signs of age but tries to conceal it with makeup and flashy dresses she used to wear in her youth but no longer fit her properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of ASL agent Nicole Pierce, Penny was one of the biggest stars of the ASL in its heyday. Not only is she a former repeat champion of the Gold Division, she managed to springboard off her popularity as a wrestler into a career as a world famous actress. While critically her performances were panned, she remained an audience favorite due to her good looks and charm. Unfortunately, as time went on and she showed signs of aging, the public latched onto the newest shiny star to come along, leaving Penny in the dust. The movie offers started drying up, and without work Penelope went to siege and has never come back, growing from her once slim and strong form to astronomical proportions. A hedonist who lives in the past, Penny is in denial of her fading good looks and still believes herself to be the most beautiful and famous star in the world. She rationalizes rejoining the ASL as \"revisiting her roots\" ignoring the fact that her daughter, Nicole, was the one who offered her the job and the heads of the ASL mainly keep her on the roster out of pity. Penny spends most of her time lazing about and eating anything within reach, watching old movies and matches of herself, and demanding her human servants pamper her non-stop, either worshipping her like the goddess she is or being brutally punished if they refuse/fail. More than one has fallen victim to her gluttony, but the ASL pities her too much to ever cut off her supply of servants/snacks, even when she's exceeded her limit. She rarely trains because her sheer size means most of her victories come easy. She prefers Survival matches or Free-for-Alls, meaning ASL rookies are another staple of her diet.</span></div></div>",

From what he could remember of her, she was a rookie Anthro who was promoted to the ASL from a bug equivalent, after she got too tall to qualify for the bug equivalent. After looking around for the room, Marc found the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening the door, which was suited for people around 11\", Marc finally got to see Garza, who was currently practicing kicks on a training dummy. Garza was a grasshopper anthro who was around 9\", and was slightly chubby all over except for her massive behind. Marc did see a bit of muscle under Garza's fat though, so he knew she was strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Marc said while introducing himself to the Anthro. \"I'm supposed to be the servant for this room, do you need anything done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now.\" Garza quickly replied. \"I'm training, so for now just leave me be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Marc said. Since Garza was training, Marc decided to relax on the couch in Garza's room, and watched TV while he waited for his master to be finished with her training. While he was surprised he wasn't being put to work yet, he was still happy he could relax for a while, at least untill Garza was ready for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Garza was finished with her training, and approached Marc. \"Ok, I'm done with my training for now, so now...\"</span></div></div>",

Because of this she has rarely been with other Anthros when not wearing her jumpsuit, and she has even started to spend some time with other humans when not busy with matches.

She usually wears black, punk-rocker clothes combined with a military aesthetic from her time in military school. She wears black lipstick and green eye shadow that matches her hair. She's morbidly obese with large breasts and a colossal ass, but her arms and legs are thick with muscle. She has a thick, black tail.<br>\r\nDescription: Meg is a natural born sadist who's rude, crude and all around unpleasant. During her time at Darwin Academy, she was Marc's worst nightmare. The most feared bully in the school, Meg had it out for Marc since day one, and took every opportunity she could to make his life a living hell. She was so frightening that she ended up expelled from Darwin Academy, and transferred to a military school instead, something she blames Marc completely for. She's been a fan of the ASL for as long as she can remember, and as soon as she graduated military school, she leaped at the chance to join the ASL and hurt people for a living. She's adopted military-esque attire in her standard punk-rock style, and her time at her second school made her a lot stronger. Neither she, nor Marc know that he's been assigned to her, meaning they're both in for a surprise.

She's had a crush on Marc ever since her days in Darwin Academy and tried time and time again to make him her boyfriend. Unfortunately for Marc, her definition of boyfriend is more like \"pet\" which she smothers with love and care. June would never intentionally hurt a human, but her displays of affection are often bone-breaking since she doesn't realize her own amazing strength, even when compared with fellow anthros. She's never eaten a human nor another anthro, and the idea of it terrifies her. Because of her insanely wealthy parents, who bought her everything she asked for but never gave her much attention, June is used to getting everything she wants, and still feels bad over never getting Marc.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the name alone, Marc was dreading the meeting with his new fighter. \"Major Hurt.\" First off, it was corny as all hell. Second, it sounded like whoever came up with it thought she was tough shit. It was that second bit that worried him. The newbie fighters who wanted to prove how hardcore they were, were usually the ones who busted up their servants to prove a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was bad enough but there was one other detail that bothered Marc. The fighter was a rat. Marc knew it was unfair to judge a fighter based on their species, but ever since high school, he'd had a phobia of rats. He'd avoided rat anthros at every opportunity, but even today he'd still have nightmares about things that happened years ago. He shook his head. That was a long time ago. Darwin Academy was behind him. As soon as he got the money from this gig and his contract was up, he'd be college bound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to room at the end of the hall and knocked reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" a muffled voice said from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc steeled himself then entered. Bronze Division fighters had the \"poorest\" quarters in the ASL, but their rooms still put Marc's grimy, little, company-owned apartment to shame. In his place, there was barely enough room to sit down in the bathroom. In this room, the living room alone could contain five of his apartments. The furniture dwarfed him, and posters of death metal bands lined the walls. Gym equipment was in the back of the room. The entire room was littered with half-eaten food, dirty dishes, and laundry clearly in need of wash. Marc walked into the middle of the room and sighed as he surveyed the mess. He just knew he was going to have to clean all this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, pipsqueak,\" a voice called out from the bathroom. \"You have the honor of being my first slave. The first slave of the greatest fighter the ASL will ever see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn normal circumstances, Marc would've rolled his eyes at the fighter's boast. Countless rookies came in claiming to be the best. Few ever walked away from their first survival match. That's what Marc would've thought normally, except he was preoccupied by a chill running down his spine. He recognized that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, please no,\" he prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajor Hurt came waltzing out of the bathroom. She was dressed in a black t-shirt, black boots, and green, camouflaged pants. She wore a black leather jacket over her shirt with bright gold buttons. It looked like the first half of a uniform. The design on her t-shirt was of a rat-skull clamping its jaws down on a human skull which cracked under the pressure. Over her neon-green hair was a black commissar cap. She carried what looked like a riding crop in one hand and stroked it as she inspected it lovingly. No doubt she had a speech in mind to show her slave what a badass she was. Her preoccupation on that was the only reason why she didn't immediately notice her favorite punching bag standing in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of her, Marc froze. There was no doubt about it. She may have gone by Major Pain now, but Marc knew her as Meg, a name that struck more terror in his heart than any other ever had. She was a few years older than he last saw her, but it was definitely her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the second Meg had laid eyes on him in Darwin Academy, it had been hate at first sight. For some reason, Meg had decided the sweetest thing in the world was seeing Marc suffering. She and her pack of cronies would stalk Marc, waiting for him after class or after school only to deliver some new form of abuse. Marc had fought back at first but there was only so much he could do against a 20 foot rat with anger issues. Especially in a school that didn't mind if its students ate each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abuse had started normally enough, for a given definition of the word \"normal.\" Wet willies, purple nurples, noogies, wedgies, swirlies, Meg did it all. She stole his lunch money, kept him stuffed inside her locker, and forced him to do her homework. Over time Meg got more and more \"creative\" with her methods of punishing him. Forced foot massages, using his face as deodorant, using his body as bra padding, sucking on him like a breath mint, sitting in his seat and \"forgetting\" he was already sitting there, doing the same thing but eating ten breakfast burritos before hand. It was a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven outside of school he wasn't safe. He remembered summer vacation before junior year. He'd signed up to go to an all human summer camp just to finally have some fun in an environment where he wasn't constantly in fear for his life. He never made it on the bus. Meg had snagged him and stuck him down the back of her underwear, then kept him there for the <i>entire summer.</i> Nobody except her gang of cronies had any idea he was back there, not even his family. It'd been the worst three months of his life, and it was a year before the smell would go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc finally had enough in his junior year. The next time Meg picked him up to put him in her disgusting mouth, Marc cut loose and punched her right in the nose, making it bleed in front of a crowd of students. This was not his best idea ever. Meg headed to the cafeteria and devoured Marc as an early lunch. She planned on leaving him to digest like countless other unfortunates who'd made their way to her blubbery gut. He managed to survive for a day in the sweltering confines of her stomach. She ate so much Marc was able to form a mountain of chewed up food in her stomach and waited atop it as everything digested around him. He had to endure Meg's taunts all the while but at least he survived. The only reason he got out of there alive was because she ate a bad egg salad sandwich. An hour later she chucked up the contents of her stomach, which wouldn't have been so bad for her had she not been getting a lecture from the principal and let loose right in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc remembered what happened next as the happiest day in his life. Meg had gotten in trouble countless times before and the principal was convinced Meg had thrown up on her on purpose. She was expelled from Darwin Academy and transferred to a military school. She remained convinced that Marc deliberately made her sick to get her in trouble and vowed revenge against him. Marc hadn't been worried. What were the odds he'd ever actually see her again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here she stood in front of him. In the perfect position to perform untold horrors on him. If she could catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc ran for the door without thinking. The sudden motion was enough to catch Meg's attention during the middle of her braggadocios speech. For the first time she got a good look at her slave as he made a break for it. Her eyes nearly popped out of her head like a cartoon character's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUNGBLOOD!\" she screamed, speech forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how huge she was, Meg had always been faster than him at Darwin Academy. Years of running drills had made her even faster. She stomped after him and the room shook like there was an earthquake. Marc was a step away from the door before Meg grabbed him by the scruff of his clothes and lifted him to her face. She was breathing heavily. There was a psychotic gleam in her eyes but she smiled at him, revealing a mouth full of fangs that could rip him to shreds if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marc Youngblood,\" she said, grinning maniacally. \"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. How long has it been since you got me expelled and sent to that hellhole school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now, Meg,\" Marc squeaked. \"Don't do anything rash. That was years ago. It's all in the past now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been looking forward to this for a very long time,\" Meg said laughing. \"You wouldn't believe every single evil thought that popped into my head at the mention of your name. I was afraid I'd never get to see you again but now the ASL gives you to me like a birthday present. Is this the best job in the world or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of Marc wiggling like a worm trying to get free of her grasp, she licked her black lipstick covered lips and half lowered her green eye-shadowed lids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've missed this. The look of you helplessly dangling in my grasp. I could destroy you in so many different ways. But I don't want you dead. Not yet. I want you to suffer. It's been years since I last got to play with you. Why don't we make up for lost time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg closed the door and locked it. Marc continued to fight in her grasp no matter how futile it seemed. This couldn't be happening. His worst nightmare had found him once again. And now he was her slave. Her property. She could do anything she wanted with him and no one could stop her. It was like he was in hell and she was the demon charged with his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc recognized the look on her face as she watched him. It signaled a monstrous idea that had popped in her head. Marc winced as he waited for her first punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

I want you...\" Marc gulped. \"To apologize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was so surprised he stopped struggling. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me,\" Meg said. \"I want you to apologize for getting me expelled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning bells were going off in Marc's head like fire truck sirens. There was no way in hell that all Meg wanted was a simple apology. He'd lived through too much pain and suffering at her hands for that to be it. He still remembered all the promises of vengeance she swore at him as security dragged her away. But at the same time, he knew that telling her to screw off would only land him in even more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he groused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Meg said, cupping a hand to one of her round ears. \"I didn't catch that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I got you expelled,\" Marc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she said, rubbing her chin. \"Here's the thing, pipsqueak. I'm not sure you mean that. Why don't you prove it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg broke out into another evil grin and Marc instantly regretted playing into her trap. Without a word she let him go. Marc landed on his ass and cursed. Meg turned around. Her fat, black tail whipped out and wrapped around him like an anaconda. He was bound so tight he couldn't move. Meg snickered over her shoulder and hooked her thumbs over the brim of her pants. She bent forward, sticking out her ass, and slowly pulled her pants down. She revealed her furry cheeks, each large enough to fit three Marcs in. They were completely exposed by the dark green thong she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember your summer home?\" Meg asked, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc blanched at the smell coming off her ass. He remembered how he prayed that he'd go the rest of his life without ever experiencing the stench again. It looked like whatever divine power there was had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made your point, Meg! Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. You still need to prove how sorry you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail yanked him forward, dragging him across the ground and bringing his face within inches of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove your sorry, pipsqueak. Pucker up and give my ass a kiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you!\" Marc yelled in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg squeezed her tail around him tighter, lifted him up, then slammed him on the ground. Marc saw stars as the tail propped him back up in front of his tormentor's massive behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your sake, I'm going to ignore that,\" Meg growled. \"But think very carefully, Youngblood. You can either apologize to me and take your first step in making amends for your past deeds, or we can just pick up where we left off the last time we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, her stumbled rumbled hungrily. Marc winced. What she wanted was humiliating but at least it wasn't deadly. When push came to shove, Marc would take a blow to his ego over death every day. He closed his eyes, puckered his lips and reluctantly leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed it once quickly, more of a peck. The second his lips met flesh and fur, he recoiled like he just kissed radioactive waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of half-assed attempt was that?\" Meg asked. \"Is this a joke to you?! Do it like you mean it, pipsqueak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc groaned. Of course she wouldn't make this easy. He closed his eyes again, held his breath and leaned in. He kissed it longer this time, resisting every impulse to pull away. He hated himself as he did it but forced himself to stay where he was. He doubted Meg would warn him again. After several seconds, he sensed a flash of light behind his eyelids. He pulled away with a disgusted look on his face and looked up to the source of the light when there was another flash that made spots shine in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked to clear his vision and as he did so he heard Meg cackling. \"Oh man! Your expression was priceless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Marc could see again, he realized that Meg had taken pictures of him on her phone. <i>\"Shit!\"</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just too perfect! Thanks Youngblood, this is all the proof I need of our sorry you are. I'm sure the proof's going to be enough for our old classmates too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's jaw dropped. \"You're joking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, pipsqueak. I'm sending these pics to all my friends. Also all your friends. I bet everyone you know will have seen these by tonight. It must be so embarrassing for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You evil bitch!\" Marc snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg was in such a good mood that she didn't even get mad. She just laughed and used her tail to slam Marc against the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how I should title these. What do you think?\" she asked smugly. \"\"Youngblood Finds His True Calling\"? No, that's not right... \"Once an Ass-Kisser, Always an Ass-Kisser\"? Nah. I got it! \"Renewing a Friendship,\"\" she said, typing it as she said it. She laughed as she submitted it. \"Man, I can't wait to read the responses on this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc cursed and struggled against her tail but was unable to break free. Meg saw his feeble attempts and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so feisty, pipsqueak! I think you need a timeout, and I know the perfect place for you to chill out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Meg's tail lifted Marc up. He went pale as he saw Meg move her thong out of the way. She winked at him from over her shoulder and raised the phone for more pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smile!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc cursed at her as her tail rammed him deep between her mounds of flab. The smell on the outside was nothing compared to how bad it was inside. She clicked away photos of Marc as he disappeared, her crack swallowing him whole. She felt him wiggling between her cheeks and felt a tingle go up her spine. She'd forgotten how much she missed the feeling of him in there. She wondered if it'd be possible to beat her old record of keeping him there for three months, but then decided she might try it later. There were still so many things she wanted to do to him, and there'd be plenty of time for more prolonged punishments later. She literally owned him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled up her pants and clenched her cheeks a few times to feel Marc's squirms. She shook her hips in an exaggerated way as she walked over to her recliner. She turned around, leaped into the air and slammed her ass down on it, eliciting another moan from her captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatsa matter, Marc?\" she asked mockingly. \"You not having fun? How about I give you a little fresh air?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc knew her well enough to know what she meant and she heard his howls of protest. It was a shame Meg wasn't in a merciful mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA world-shattering wave of flatulence washed over her prisoner. The smell was so rank it even stung Meg's eyes, but she was laughing so hard that she didn't care. She was too busy enjoying the screams and writhing motions of the slave sealed within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perfect thing about having Marc--other than her dreams of revenge finally getting fulfilled--was that years of practice had made her aware just how much the human could take. He was a surprisingly durable guy, and he could take a lot of punishment. It was like he was made to be her bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg had previously planned on forcing whatever servant the ASL sent her to tidy up around the place before getting into the more fun stuff. Now, however, she intended to spend the rest of the day lazing around, reacquainting Marc to his old home. She cracked open a monster sized bag of potato chips next to the chair and began munching away as she kept refreshing her phone. The comments on her pictures were coming in faster than she'd anticipated. All of her old friends couldn't stop laughing at the idea that Marc had found himself back in the clutches of his mortal enemy. Each of them had their ideas on how to make him suffer. Other comments came in from Marc's friends and old girlfriends, most of them expressing pity for him, acting like he was already dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg laughed as she shared every single comment with her prisoner who would respond by thrashing and trying to escape the prison of her ass. Every time he would get too uppity, Meg would respond by clenching her cheeks or blasting him with more rancid farts. Of course, she'd also do the same thing if he was behaving and she just felt like hurting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed contentedly, leaning back in her armchair and propping her arms behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPffrt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Meg might have been having the time of her life, Marc was in hell. The absolutely horrible smelling walls of ass flesh rubbed and squeezed him, impeding any chance of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill that didn't stop Marc from trying. There really wasn't any other way he could respond to being forced to relive the absolute worst period of his life. The memories of that long summer living in Meg's rancid crack pushed him to try anything and everything he could to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, there was an unforeseen consequence to his constant struggles. As Marc wiggled and squirmed he suddenly felt his feet become firmly stuck. Though he couldn't see the sudden suction that pulled him farther back brought forth a horrifying realization. Marc had bumped into Meg's asshole as he fought, and now he was being sucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Meg's part she was surprised as well. She nearly jumped out of her chair as the puny humans feet rammed right up her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that you little shit!?\" she screeched, but then stopped thinking about what she just said. Oh she was REALLY going to enjoy this. She stood up and went to the bathroom, along the way losing her pants and thong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc couldn't believe it as light entered his horrid prison. For the briefest of seconds, as Meg's cheeks spread open he thought she was going to let him out. Those hopes were crushed as her tail came into view and quickly shoved the hapless human deeper inside her. Before he could even react, Marc found himself up to his neck in her bowels. The tight ring of flesh around his throat made it difficult to breathe, let alone protest as Marc saw he was looking into a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg finished adjusting her cheek with one hand as she tried to get the best shot on her phone with the other. When she managed to get both her and Marc's face into view she smiled. \"Say cheese Youngblood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then with a snap, Meg had the perfect photo and her tail pushed Marc the rest of the way. Not a trace of the poor guy was visible to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder what would be a good title for this one...\" She pondered as she put her clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Marc realized that Meg's crack had been paradise compared the the absolute hell he was in now. Somehow even her farts had been nice and refreshing in comparison to the sheer putrid stench they had originated from. Every breath was torture, every movement caked him in shit, and he couldn't even scream for the retched taste it left in his mouth. However the worst part was that the ride wasn't over, with each step the rat took he found himself sliding deeper into her depths with no way to fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped and prayed that Meg would think of some other way to torture him. Any other punishment would be better than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere Marc's prayers answered?</span></div></div>",

Instead of being a servant to a fighter, Marc will be a participant in the fights. Obviously these aren't \"real\" fights, as the ASL has no expectation that Marc will ever advance in the League, he'll just be a jobber used as a source of cheap entertainment between \"real\" matches.

He didn't even know there were Room Zeroes. He followed the instructions on his paper through the winding halls, noticing that the closer he got to his destination, the worse the conditions were. They were nothing like the glitzy rooms he'd seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sense of foreboding only increased when he came to a stop before Room 0. It was located in a dimly lit hall with flickering lights, like something out of a horror movie. There was an odd smell coming from behind the door, and the door itself was covered in peeling paint. The label with Room 0 was crudely nailed to the door and hastily written in marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing himself for whatever nightmare lurked behind the door, Marc slowly raised a fist and knocked on the door. It was only a light tap, but Marc flinched as the door creaked and slowly opened on its own, revealing a room the size of a broom closet with nothing in it but a sleeping bag and a light bulb hanging on a chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell lives here?\" Marc thought outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc practically leapt out of his skin at the unexpected noise. He whirled around, heart thundering, and saw a cat anthro standing directly behind him. Unlike the vast majority of anthros Marc had seen around the ASL, this one was slender. Marc had to take a few steps back to look her in the eye as she was eleven-feet-tall. She had black fur, blue hair in a bun, and a purple business suit and skirt. She wore rectangular glasses and had gold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recognized her. Her name was Penelope Pierce. She was the agent who represented many ASL members, usually the most popular ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We remodeled the janitor's closet to be a living space. I know it's not exactly living in the lap of luxury, but it's not like we could expect the higher ups to go out of their way for you. Maybe I can get them to fix the lock on the door.\" She was talking absently while checking emails on her phone. She didn't even look at Marc as she talked, so she didn't notice the confused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Ms. Pierce,\" Marc stammered. \"W-what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh. Just making sure our latest fighter was fitting into his new accommodations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Newest fighter? Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat shrugged and turned her attention back to her phone as she spoke. \"I agree, it's absurd, isn't it? But the higher ups wanted a new gimmick to put more butts in seats and focus groups responded positively to the idea of human jobbers going up against anthro fighters. They think the matches would be good comedy between real fights. You know, kinda like that movie that came out this summer with Jack Splat? <i>What Did I Sit In?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc had seen that movie. It was a favorite of his last mistress. It was about a hapless human who kept being squashed by anthro women. It was the highest grossing movie of all time. He cringed at the memory of how his last mistress would sometimes get drunk and force him to reenact scenes with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this! My contract says--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Pierce rolled her eyes. \"Oh please. We both know you didn't read that contract all the way through, otherwise you wouldn't have been so surprised when your duties consisted of being a servant to our fighters. The exact wording of the contracts states, \"I hereby agree to carry out any and all demands put to me by the ASL, regardless of the possible risk to my life.\" I can have a copy of your contract delivered to you with the relevant text highlighted if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc remembered that damn contract. It was the size of a phonebook. He felt faint and grabbed hold of the door frame to support himself. This was all happening too fast. When this day started out he thought he'd just be another servant, but now they expected him to be a fighter? He was in pretty good shape for a human, but he was no match for those monsters out there. His last mistress had been three times his size and a trained fighter and she'd still be eaten alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Mike--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'm not anymore happy about this than you are. You think I want to waste my time representing a joke when I have <i>real</i> clients to take care of? Let's just do our best to make the most of this and get on with our lives.\" Before Marc could object anymore, Ms. Pierce shoved a key and a new ID badge into his arms. \"Here's the key to your room and a pass that'll let you use the locker room, training hall, cafeteria, etc. Obviously it won't let you leave the facilities, so don't try to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's throat went dry at the thought of daring to take a step anywhere the fighters in the ASL would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" Ms. Pierce said, as if reading his mind. \"The fighters aren't allowed to kill you unless it's a survival match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH THAT'S A RELIEF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a list of personal trainers delivered to you,\" she said, as if he hadn't just shouted at her. \"You might want to pick one to help you prepare for your fight. Your first one will be next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEXT WEEK?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't selected your opponent yet, but we'll let you know 24 hours before your match. We won't start you off with a Survival Match... though the higher ups may decide on one if you're not doing well for ratings. You might want to work on your charisma so the audience likes you. By the way, your stage name will be Mike the Mite--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Do you have any questions?\" Marc had a million of them, but before he could ask a single one, Ms. Pierce's phone beeped and she sighed. \"I need to go or I'll be late for my nine o'clock meeting with Dominique. Here's my card. Call if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved the card in his hand then closed the door on his face, leaving Marc alone in his janitor's-closet-turned-bed-room. He looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have a phone,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sank down to his knees, feeling numb. How had he gotten himself into this mess? And how could he possibly survive the life of an ASL fighter? It had the highest mortality rate of any other profession. He imagined going up against someone like Dominique or Roxenne, and he shuddered. Maybe a personal trainer wouldn't be a bad idea... even if training meant he'd have to step outside and face his opponents in the ASL. He gulped. Maybe staying cooped up in his room for a week wouldn't be such a bad idea after all.</span></div></div>",

He felt ridiculous, wearing nothing but a pair of shiny gold trunks, a white cape with red polka dots, and a black domino mask. He looked like a two-year-old's rough draft of a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word of advice,\" Ms. Pierce said without looking up from her phone, \"learn to handle pain better. Even if you're opponent <i>wants</i> to take it easy on you, they're not going to treat you like a delicate flower. It's why we're giving you this shot in the first place. To make your body less likely to break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a load off my mind,\" Marc grumbled. \"And if the ASL has a shot that makes humans more durable, why the hell don't you give it to every human who works here? Do you know how many humans kick the bucket every year just because an anthro doesn't check to make sure a seat isn't taken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The board considered it,\" Ms. Pierce said. \"But the serum's too expensive to keep buying in bulk. It's just cheaper to hire more humans... What?\" Ms. Pierce asked when she felt Marc glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You people are monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" the cat anthro said. \"It's just business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where's the business sense in making me dress up like a complete idiot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test audiences loved it,\" Ms. Pierce said. \"Or, at least, they loved laughing at it. Look, you're comic relief, alright? You're supposed to look pathetic. Don't think about that, just focus on how to make your big wrestling debut as enjoyable for the audience as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was actually doing everything he could to focus on anything <i>other</i> than his big wrestling debut. He'd spent the last week in a state of panic, holed up in his broom-closet-turned-bedroom, jumping at every little noise and cowering in the corner whenever he heard heavy footsteps walking down the hallway. The first night three anthros had gathered around his door and tried to goad him to come out. Instead he'd wrapped himself in his sleeping bag, turned out the light bulb and pretended no one was home. That didn't stop them. They kept taunting him, telling him how he was a disgrace to their profession. They said how he wouldn't last a minute in his first fight before being turned into a stain in the ring. They kept it up for almost an hour before they stomped off, taking the time to tell him exactly what they'd do to him if they caught him outside with \"real\" wrestlers. Marc was just grateful they hadn't figured out the lock was busted, otherwise they might've grabbed him right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taunts had been enough to keep Marc cooped up in his room for the entire week. He knew he should at least <i>try</i> to train, but the fear of what would happen if he left was too great to ignore. He was even too scared to run to the cafeteria in case he winded up on someone's lunch tray. The only reason he ate at all was because one of the ASL's security guards, a massive gorilla woman named Queen Connie, checked on him twice a day to make sure he hadn't made an escape attempt... or hadn't been taken by one of the other wrestlers. She agreed to bring him food from the vending machines in exchange for five times the amount they actually cost. At first Marc refused, but when he realized it was either that or starve, he decided extortion wasn't the worst thing that could happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week had passed before he knew it, and now Marc was in the locker room, the match about to begin in only a few minutes. The sheep nurse offered him a lollipop after his shot and he politely refused, feeling too nauseous to eat anything. He'd felt that way ever since Ms. Pierce popped in yesterday to tell him who he was fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Pierce's phone beeped and she said, \"It's time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc gave a nervous gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Sugar,\" the black-furred sheep said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the defibrillators ready for you,\" she said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... thanks,\" he said glumly as Ms. Pierce led him to the curtain separating him from the ring. The curtain was so big, a mountain could've been on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laaaaaaaadies and gentlemen!\" the female announcer boomed on the speakers. \"Welcome to another thrilling match arranged by the ASL! We have a special treat for you to get things started tonight. For the first time ever, the ASL will be hosting an anthro-on-human match!\" Marc could hear the audience gasp outside. \"This little guy came to us on hands-and-knees, begging for the chance to live his dream as an ASL wrestler, and our hearts were so touched, we couldn't help but make his dream a reality.\" Marc would've been outraged if he wasn't too busy having a panic attack. \"Please welcome to the stage the Pummeling Pipsqueak, the Terrifying Tiny, the squishable, the stompable, the seatable and oh-so-eatable Mike the Mite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They're not even going to get my name right on my tombstone,\"</i> Marc thought just as Ms. Pierce shoved him roughly outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc stumbled on the way out and had to windmill his arms to keep balance. He staggered out of the spotlight, and caught himself on a nearby bench. The spotlight moved to meet him. The crowd was dead silent. Marc felt the sweat on his brow and nervously wiped it off his forehead. He laughed nervously and gave a feeble wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the audience exploded into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you folks,\" the announcer said, giggling, \"but I think we've got a real champion on our hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed even harder and Marc blushed at the humiliation of it all. He tried to regain some dignity as he entered the ring, only to snag his foot on one of the ropes and face plant on the floor, his cape covering his head and his ass hanging in the air. Marc considered just staying there forever until the crowd just got tired and went home, but he considered it unlikely and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mike,\" the announcer said. \"You'll get the hang of it eventually! Let's give him a big hand folks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd clapped sarcastically, most of them too busy laughing to play along. Marc would've felt more embarrassed if the ring hadn't started shaking. He wondered if it was his nerves at first. Then he realized the entire stadium was shaking because of heavy footsteps approaching behind the opposite curtain. Marc grabbed the giant turnbuckle to stop from fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now folks, let's welcome our challenger into the ring, a brave woman considering she's willing to face-off against an opponent as fearsome as Mike the Mite! You know her, you love her, you fear her and revere her, here she is...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc watched in horror as the indigo hippopotamus came stomping out into the ring. Twenty feet of angry blubber wearing a black bikini with skulls on it. Her pink lips pulled back in a snarl to reveal a pair of giant, flat fangs. Marc couldn't stop his knees from shaking. Out of all the people he could be pitted against, Dominique was everything he was afraid of. She was a sadistic, human-hating, man-eating monster who took out all her anger over being dumped by a human man on every human servant she could get her hands on. Every human working for the ASL knew to steer clear of her, lest they end up subjected to her wrath. The stories about her were as blood-curdling as they were farfetched. Marc had even heard a rumor that she could practice black magic. As if she needed anything else to make her more terrifying. Before a week ago, Marc thought the worst thing that could happen to him was that he'd be assigned as her servant. Facing off against her in the ring? This was worse by far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met in the center of the ring and the sight was laughable. The ring itself was the size of a football field to accommodate for the fighters' gargantuan sizes. Marc barely came up past the hippo's shins! Ominous gurgles and growls came from her monumental stomach, which swayed only a few feet above his head. All she had to do was take a knee and Marc would be flattened underneath her flab. Marc was very aware of the hippo staring at him, making him feel vulnerable with her gaze alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Looks like the wrestlers are trying to psych each other out!\" the announcer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc did not need to be psyched out at all. He was already psyched out, and just hoped to leave a good enough impression that Dominique wouldn't want to murder him completely. Unfortunately, what spilled out of his mouth was a pathetic, \"Um, may the best man win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc cringed as Dominique pulled back her pink lips in a haughty smirk, showing off her fangs, either one of which was strong enough to squash his head. \"I can't believe I'm getting paid to annihilate a pathetic speck like you tonight!\" she said, to the cheer of the crowd. \"A worm of a human man like you isn't worth washing a real wrestler's underwear, much less stepping into the ring with one. I hope you folks enjoy the show, because this is gonna be Mike the Mite's first and last show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now,\" Marc said in an undertone. \"You're not serious, right? This is just supposed to be fun for the audience--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it's gonna be fun for them and me!\" Dominique bellowed. \"Everyone shut up and listen closely!\" She raised a hand to her ear. \"You hear that?\" she asked. \"I think Mite needs a closer look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marc could move, Dominique seized him in one hand and stuffed his head into her bellybutton. The world went dark and Marc struggled feebly to pull himself out. All around him, the growls from the hippo's gut was deafening. Dominique cackled at his pathetic attempts to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now he hears the old girl! She's hungry tonight! What do you say, folks? Want me to fill her up on stage?\" she asked, rubbing her growling gut. She smiled, feeling Marc's screams echoing in her bellybutton. She hoped he would at least be useful enough to clean out all the lint while he was there. Dominique let go and with a wet <i>POP</i> Marc's head was free and he landed on his ass. \"Get a good look at your new home, Mite?\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc coughed out enough bellybutton lint to choke out, \"This isn't a survival match!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>I</i> know that. But <i>she</i> doesn't,\" she said, pointing at her stomach. \"And she's in charge. I might not be able to help myself tonight.\" She licked her lips obscenely then chomped her fangs an inch over Marc's head, causing him to cower on the ground. She smirked then spoke low for the first time so only he could hear her, \"Besides, it's not like the ASL would boot me from the roster over a nobody like you, would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't serious, was she? She had to be messing with him, she just had to! Mostly because Marc knew he had no way of defending himself if she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, break it up, break it up!\" a loud voice said. The referee, a female zebra came over. She was a fraction of Dominique's size, but she succeeded in driving the hippo back a few steps. \"It's like the Mite says, this isn't a survival match! It's a regular match! There will be no eating or killing of the opponent! Do you two understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc had no idea why she bothered telling him that. If she thought he could kill a twenty foot carnivorous hippo, you wanted some of whatever she was on. Dominique only shrugged cheekily in response and gave her lips another lick while looking at Marc. Then she marched back to her corner of the ring. Marc's legs were too weak to move on his own so he had to be dragged by his cape to his corner by the referee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a regular match,\" he said to himself. \"Not a survival match. A regular. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even remember getting to his feet before the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>DING! DING! DING!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc whimpered as Dominique bellowed and came charging at him like a freight train. All common sense went out the window and Marc tried to climb over the ropes out of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" the announcer said. \"Looks like Mike has cold feet. Good thing Dominique is here to show him the ropes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs--bad--luck would have it, Marc snagged his foot again, leaving him a sitting duck for the angry hippo. She grabbed both feet in one hand and lifted him like a doll back into the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going anywhere, squirt,\" Dominique chuckled. \"Your ass is mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dominique have planned first?</span></div></div>",

Your ass belongs to <i>my ass!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's heart skipped a beat. He knew that line. It was from the Jack Splat movie, the same one his old mistress had loved so much, the same one the higher-ups in the ASL wanted to capitalize on by forcing Marc into these ridiculous squash matches in the first place! It figures that a movie that revolved around a human man getting stomped, squashed, sat on and devoured by anthro women was one of Dominique's favorites. That line in particular was the catch phrase of Jack's warthog boss. She always said it right before she--Oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't even have a chance to fight back before Dominique moved him into position against the turnbuckle. Then she turned around, presenting a looming wall of indigo cellulite mere feet in front of him. Marc's eyes widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique let go of him at the same time she slammed her ass backwards. The hippo's colossal ass engulfed Marc effortlessly. His back was pressed against the turnbuckle, Dominique's butt cheeks were on either side of him, crushing him like a vice grip, his face was forced up against the fabric of the hippo's bikini bottom. He was completely immobilized, his arms and legs pinned to his side, her ass sweat soaking his body, his nose forced to breath in the scent of her crack. Outside, Marc could hear the audience roar with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh,\" the announcer said. \"That's gotta hurt! Dominique showing no mercy out of the gate as always. I hope the poor, little guy can take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Dominique planted her hands on her hips and began wiggling her behind exaggeratedly, mashing Marc even more between her cheeks. He felt like pizza dough being kneaded by a pair of giant hands, flattened and squashed and stretched beyond reason. He thanked god for the shot he'd been given earlier. He doubted he'd still be alive if it wasn't for that. The squishing torment went on for several minutes, the audience couldn't seem to get enough of it. Neither could Dominique, for that matter. She beckoned them with her hands to keep cheering her on, and in response to their enthusiasm, she would mash Marc more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the announcer seemed to be getting bored, \"Come on, girl. Have a heart. The little guy just wants to be a wrestler! Why not give him a fighting chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique stroked her chin as if seriously considering being merciful. A few seconds later, she sighed and nodded, lifting her ass off of her helpless opponent. Marc thought it was a miracle when some of the weight started to shift off him and he was finally able to take a breath that wasn't tainted by the smell of swamp ass. Then Dominique gave a laugh that chilled Marc to the bone. She waved her hand in a, \"Naaaaaaaah,\" gesture, and slammed her ass back onto Marc. <i>Hard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let out a little whimper as his world once again consisted of nothing but pressure, sweat, and crushing, crushing pain. The weight lifted off him for a second time, but only for an instant before the hellish hippo slammed her ass back into him over and over and over and over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! <i>Creeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaak.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the weight of her onslaught, the turnbuckle began to bend backwards. The ropes along the ring pulled tight. Marc let out a muffled scream of agony, but he may as well be yelling at a smelly wall for all the good it did him. He didn't know how much longer he could last. Sure the shot made him tougher, but it didn't make him invulnerable. He'd break at some point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after five minutes that felt like five hours, Dominique pulled her ass away and kept it away. Marc slid down the turnbuckle at a 45 degree angle, and plopped on the ground. Dominique had her back to him and had mounted the opposite turnbuckle. She put her hand to her ear and encouraged the crowd to keep cheering her on. They were more than happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people are maniacs,\" Marc wheezed. \"How can they possibly be enjoying this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced to the side of the ring. There was still no one there. No security to stop him. He could just run. He'd done his time, damn it! How could anyone ask any more of him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, if he did run, the ASL wouldn't like it. Blind panic had ruled him before, but now that he had a second to catch his breath and think about it, he realized if he kept trying to run, it wouldn't go unpunished. Who knows what they'd do to him? But what was his other option? Stand and fight? He certainly hated Dominique and would love to kick her ass, but in a straight-up fight he stood as much of a chance as a Chihuahua fighting a werewolf! But... it might keep the audience entertained. And Ms. Pierce did imply making the audience happy might make things better for him in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc got to his feet. Fight or run, whatever he was going to do, he should do it while her back was turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Marc decide?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc knew running wasn't an option. Any punishment Dominique dolled out to him in the ring couldn't be half as bad as what the ASL decided to do to him behind closed doors. There was really only one option. If they wanted a show, he'd give them a show. Dominique still had her back turned to him. It was now or never. He charged! ... and charged... and charged. In his mind, Marc had pictured the ordeal as a spurt of adrenaline that'd take him the entire way in a matter of seconds. He'd forgotten just how long the damn ring actually was for someone of his size. It took him almost a minute to cross the ring and by that time, many people in the crowd were pointing at him and shouting at Dominique, trying to warn her of his approach. Marc couldn't tell if Dominique didn't hear them or was just playing dumb, but either way it was too late to give up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when he was within five feet of Dominique that a thought struck him: he had no plan of attack. That thought struck him a second before Dominique's foot did. She whirled around and kicked him, her foot bigger than his entire body. It was like a car hit him, sending him flying all the way back to wear he'd started against the damaged turnbuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like his sneak attack wasn't so sneaky after all,\" the announcer said sympathetically. \"Sorry little guy, looks like she was just playing dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO SHIT!</i> Marc screamed, or, would've screamed if the wind hadn't been knocked out of him. He felt the vibrations of the ring as Dominique sauntered over to him. With her foot, she rolled him over onto his back so he could look up at her. Or, at least, theoretically could've if her gut hadn't been in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fee-fi-fo-fum,\" Dominique said, \"it's time to squash my little, Mite mun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... rhyme... sucked...\" Marc wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo glared at him. \"Fine. Then I'll let my belly do the talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc feared for his life what that could mean. He was positive she was going to devour him right then and there, but, instead of picking him up and eating him, Marc was amazed to see her walk away. He managed to sit up a bit, even though it felt like his ribs were broken, to get a better look. She was mounting the turnbuckle again and the crowd was roaring in anticipation. He knew what was coming next. One of her signature moves: The Gut Buster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith agility that amazed Marc in spite of her girth, Dominique leapt into the air and did a backflip, positioning her stomach so that it was on a collision course with Marc's battered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should've run</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like the stadium was in the middle of an earthquake. Everything was moving, the crowd falling into each other, the lights flickering, the doors and windows rattling, the ground shaking. Ripples ran up Dominique's colossal stomach, the gargantuan gut jiggling like an ocean of pudge from the force of her impact. It was, quite frankly, a miracle that Marc wasn't rendered a pancake under the force of her bellyflop, especially since she hadn't held back at all. Not that that gave him much comfort as every molecule of Marc's body was in screaming agony under the force of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhh,\" Dominique said. \"I could just lie here all day. What do you think folks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd got to their feet and roared their approval. Apparently they would be fine just watching her lay about, doing nothing, so long as someone was getting hurt in the process. The hippo put her hands behind her head and leaned on her stomach like a giant exercise ball. Marc tried to move, but if it was impossible to move under her ass, it defied the laws of time, space, and reality for him to move himself an iota of an inch while pinned to the mat under her all-encompassing stomach. In a repeat performance, Dominique would alleviate some of the pressure off his body, peeling away some of her stomach and letting him get some fresh air, only to grind her gut back over his body, leaving him in hot, sweaty darkness, surrounded by her flesh and the sounds of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it just his imagination or were the growls from her stomach getting louder? She wasn't getting hungrier was she? Dominique spoke and it was like she'd read his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, crushing this sucker's hopes and dreams sure does work up an appetite,\" she said loudly to the crowd. \"Does anyone know if there's a place I can find some decent food around here?\" The crowd helpfully responded by pointing at her stomach and cheering. \"What's that?\" Dominique said, as if she couldn't hear them. \"My opponent? Well, he does look tasty, but this isn't a Survival Match. I can't eat him... can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd couldn't get enough of her coyness. They cheered all the louder, voicing their approval, encouraging Dominique to indulge herself. Marc was waiting for the announcer to say something or the referee to step in or anyone to say anything that could save him! But no objections came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Dominique said as if the audience had only reluctantly convinced her. \"I won't tell anyone if you don't.\" The hippo winked and pulled her stomach away and peeled Marc off the mat like a piece of gum stuck to the floor. She raised him before her mouth and licked her pink lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenderized,\" she said. \"Just the way I like my meals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominique,\" Marc said weakly. \"You can't... it's against the rules...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical weak, pathetic human man,\" she growled under her breath. \"You want to step in the rings with the big girls but you lack the commitment to carry through. You disgust me. Or you would if I wasn't so hungry. Wave buh-bye to your adoring public, Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Marc,\" he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo raised Marc over her head. She opened her mouth wide, a gaping entrance to hell if Marc ever saw one. He couldn't help himself. He began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Dominique being serious? Is this really her finishing move? Does she eat Marc or is she just messing with him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was no bluff. One second Marc was dangling by his cape, crying for help in the outside world, the next Dominique stuffed him inside her mouth, managing to get every inch of savory human in her drooling maw. It was a tight fit, like a human cramming an entire slice of pizza into their mouth. Doable but difficult. She'd managed to snap his cape free, and now used it as an impromptu napkin to wipe the drool from her lips. Dominique's cheeks bulged as her captive meal thrashed around inside her. She sucked and slurped on him loudly, making no effort to disguise her enjoyment as she savored her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm... oo nuu Mites taysth sho good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Folks, I can't believe what I'm seeing!\" the announcer cried. \"It appears that Dominique--in a flagrant disregard for the rules--is devouring her opponent outside of a Survival Match! And the referee is just sitting back and checking her phone! How can this possibly be allowed to go on?\" Even though the announcer was trying to sound outraged, there was a distinct undercurrent of laughter to the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc, meanwhile, was fighting for his life inside his dark, pink, foul-smelling prison. Her teeth could've easily crushed his head like a watermelon, but Dominique wasn't interested in resolving this quickly. She battered him around her mouth with her tongue, dousing him with drool. Every now and then one of Marc's flailing limbs would find itself slipping past her lips, only for Dominique to suck it back inside like a wayward piece of spaghetti. At one point, Marc's soaking wet head popped out, and through his mask and the saliva that stung his eyes, he had enough time to take in the roar of the crowd. He was blinded by the flash of camera lights, deafened by the cheers and the laughter. He couldn't believe it. A whole crowd of strangers eagerly anticipating his death. What kind of monsters were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only a second to think this before Dominique brought up her finger in front of Marc's face and wagged it in a \"naughty, naughty\" gesture. Then, using that very same finger, she pushed down on the top of his head and trapped him completely within her mouth again. The casual display of dominance only brought on a bigger cheer from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc heard it, the cheers, the laughter, the pure delight the audience was taking in his misery. He heard it and he hated them. Hated them almost as much as the hippo who was only moments away from swallowing him whole. He wouldn't die here for their amusement. He swore it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRighting himself as best he could so that his feet were on her bottom teeth and his hands were planted against her top teeth, Marc pushed. He pushed with his arms and legs, pushed with every ounce of strength in his body, straining to pry the hippo bitch's mouth open. As he strained, he heard the muffled voice of the announcer continuing to talk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well folks, it looks like that's all she wrote. Mike gave it his all but he's just another in a long line of failed ASL fighters--BUT WAIT! What's this?! Is... is Dominique's mouth... OPENING?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was. Despite Dominique's resistance Marc was managing to actually pry open the hippo's mouth. First only an inch. Then a few more. Now a foot. Adrenaline fueled Marc, pumping through his veins, lending him strength in his Herculean effort. He could hear Dominique gagging, could hear the crowd going dead silent. Everyone was transfixed as this puny human was, against all odds, working his way to freedom. With a final scream of effort, Marc opened Dominique's jaws all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" he screamed triumphantly, his cry echoing through the silent stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Folks, this is unbelievable! I've never seen an opponent manage to get Dominique's mouth open once she's already gotten them inside! Oh folks, do you believe in--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Dominique brought her hand up in front of her mouth. Marc was horrified she was going to simply punch him and destroy all his hard work, but, somehow, what she did was even worse. She brought her hand up to cover a <i>yawn.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that the illusion of hope was gone. Of course Marc hadn't managed to overpower a twenty-foot-pachyderm and veteran fighter of a hundred matches. She was toying with him. But now playtime was over... lunchtime resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaws effortlessly snapped shut, sealing him off from the outside world again. Dominique's tongue wrapped around him like a snake and dragged him to the back of her throat. He didn't even have time to scream as she worked his head past her uvula and swallowed powerfully. On the outside world, the crowd watched as a thrashing lump travelled down Dominique's throat before disappearing behind her bountiful cleavage. The lump's arrival into her stomach was heralded by the hippo patting her prodigious gut contentedly and letting out a ceremonial victory belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh,\" the announcer said. \"Scratch that folks. Looks like Mike's a goner after all... Shame...\" The announcer allowed Marc's passing a respectful moment of silence. \"Welp, no use dwelling on the negative!\" the announcer said, voice growing chipper again. \"We've still got a lot more exciting fights for you tonight folks, but first lets give a big round of applause this match's winner: DOMINIQUE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd burst into thunderous applause as Dominique wiped her lips with Marc's cape again, then tossed it over her shoulder carelessly like a used napkin. She gave a last wave to her adoring fans as she made her way out of the ring, her stomach sloshing, filled with her wriggling, squealing prize. When she reached the locker room, she let out another satisfied burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>BRAAAAP!</i> Ahhhh, not bad for a night's work, hey Mike?\" the hippo asked her gut tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT OF HERE YOU PSYCHO!\" Marc screamed. \"THIS ISN'T RIGHT! IT'S AGAINST THE RULES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, looks like my food's disagreeing with me,\" Dominique said, laughing at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fine performance,\" a voice said. Upon hearing it Marc ceased his struggles. He recognized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Pierce! MS. PIERCE! You have to get me out of here! You have to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, shaddup,\" Dominique said, smacking her bloated gut and causing Marc to fall down into her half-digested meals. The hippo turned from her stomach to the slender cat who'd entered the locker room. \"What can I do for you, pussy cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a fine job tonight,\" Ms. Pierce said. \"Apparently ratings were through the roof. Your match has already gone viral. Looks like the board was right. Viewers love seeing humans in pain. Though you weren't supposed to eat him,\" Ms. Pierce said, critically eying Dominique's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo shrugged carelessly. \"I missed lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, regardless I have your bonus right here,\" Ms. Pierce said, holding up a briefcase that both women knew was full of money. \"Just regurgitate, Mr. Mite and the agreed upon amount will be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Dominique said slowly, \"about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dominique say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \"The deal's off!\" - Dominique decides she'd rather have a human digesting in her stomach than an extra bit of cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) \"Did you bring the ipecac syrup?\" - Dominique keeps her end of the deal and Marc lives to fight another day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Did you bring the ipecac syrup?\" Dominique asks. She doesn't sound too happy about what's going to come next but Marc had never been so happy at the prospect of puke in all his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna live!\" he thought to himself in elation, over and over again. \"I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live!\" While his thoughts were doing a conga line of happiness, Marc stayed perfectly still within Dominique's prodigious gut. The sensible part of him realized he wasn't out of danger yet, and he didn't want to do anything that could jepordize his impending release. Who knew if one wrong squirm could cause Dominique to reconsider? He didn't move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget the ipecac,\" Ms. Pierce said. \"I've got something even better. Take this instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique took the small bottle of pink liquid Ms. Pierce produced and inspected it as suspiciously. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little something the lab boys have been working on,\" Ms. Pierce said. \"Last year saw a 35% rise in human mortality rates in ASL employees. Those contracts they sign may give us ownership over them and cover our asses if \"workplace accidents\" occur, but that doesn't stop those damn Save the Humans groups from making a big stink over the numbers. Some of them even saw tonight's match and have started trending #StopMiteAbuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunch of bleeding heart crybabies,\" Dominique growled. \"They thought a few lovetaps in the ring counted as abuse? I should take a page out of that triceratops, Tricia's, notebook and live stream his digestion just to show them what real pain is. That sound good to you, Mikey?\" Dominique asked, picking up her gut and shaking it. Marc's world jiggled around him but he remained silent as the grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that and you won't get your bonus,\" Ms. Pierce pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, I'm only teasing,\" Dominique said, then added under her breath, <i>\"mostly.</i> Anyway, what's any of this gotta do with this pink crap you gave me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one of the solutions the ASL has come up with to keep human casualties down. It's going to be part of our new line of (Comparatively) Human Safe Products. One of them is the treatment we applied to Mike which made him more durable for your fight. If that didn't work he probably would've been reduced to a bloody smear on your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I always did have a killer ass,\" Dominique snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you've told me that joke before. Many times,\" Ms. Pierce said, sounding highly unamused. \"The bottle you're holding is called Ultra Fizz. It's a formula designed to react with humans when detected in an anthro's digestive system. It causes a build up of gas bubbles that lets our fighters belch up any humans they swallowed while leaving the rest of the food in their stomachs alone. We think it'll be easier to convince our girls to take this than induce vomiting. Less messy too. Now they can still snack on a human if they're in the mood without being forced to choose between losing a slave forever and puking their guts out. We hope when we unveil this line of products it'll take the wind out of the sails of the Save the Humans groups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet!\" Dominique laughed. \"That's unbelievable! You're telling me the ASL has come up with ways to pummel humans without them kicking the bucket? This is perfect! Now anyone who whines about \"Saving Humans\" won't have a leg to stand on! Heck, I bet when they find out they can munch on or squash humans without killing them, even some of those wusses will start joining in on the fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as the ASL thrives and profits keep going up, they're free to do whatever they want,\" Ms. Pierce said. \"Now, please drink the formula before our latest sensation is digested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, Pussy Cat,\" Dominique said, raising the bottle to her lips, then stopped. \"There's no side effects to anthros, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minor gas. It should pass in less than an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, alright, cheers!\" There was only enough liquid in the bottle for a swig and Dominique drank it straight down. The pink potion tasted like cream soda and Dominique licked her lips appreciatively. To Marc, the small splash of liquid looked too miniscule to accomplish anything, but within seconds of hitting the hippo's stomach acid, bubbles began forming all around him. The stomach began gurgling and groaning all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Urph,\"</i> Dominique burped into her hand. \"You weren't kidding, this has--<i>brap</i>--a real kick to i<i>ooooOOOORRRRPPPP!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt like he was inside a freshly shaken bottle of soda, the bubbles rising up all around him, he could feel the pressure building, building, building... and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"BBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belch sent Marc flying up and out of Dominique's throat like the popped cork of a wine bottle. He passed through the slimy tunnel of her esophagus and was flung out of her mouth. Ms. Pierce's eyes went wide and ducked as Marc sailed over her. If not for her catlike reflexes he was sure he would've taken her head clean off. Instead he immediately splattered against the stone wall and noisily slid down to the ground like a cartoon bird who'd flown into a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique broke the silence that followed with a sarcastically dainty, \"Pardon me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fine job, Dominique. Thank you,\" Ms. Pierce said, all business again as she handed the hippo her briefcase full of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure doin' business with you, Pussy Cat,\" Dominique said. \"Let me know if you need me to eat him again tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Ms. Pierce said, lifting the dazed Marc up by his slime-covered leg and carrying him over to the nearest sink. It was the size of a wash basin compared to Marc and his cool cat manager dunked him inside like that was exactly what it was. A blast of cold water shocked him as it hosed off the contents of Dominique's stomach. Under the rush of water, Marc heard her keep speaking, \"After tonight's success, we have him fully booked for the rest of the month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique shrugged as she counted her cash. \"Oh well. If I ever need a snack, I know where he lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo's nasty laughter followed Marc out of the locker room as Ms. Pierce wrapped him in an anthro's hand towel big enough to cover him like a beach towel and hauled him away. It was only when the room stopped spinning and the cold water wore off that Ms. Pierce's words sank in. He was booked up... the entire month?! How many more fights was that?! How could he survive even one more when it felt like he was dying already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answers came to Marc as Ms. Pierce escorted him to the janitor's closet that was his room and tossed him inside without even so much as a, \"Good work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Marc ever get out of this one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) He doesn't: Skip to the next fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Outside intervention: Save the Humans protestors sneak inside to rescue \"Mike\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a day since Ms. Pierce broke the news about Marc's new role in the ASL. During that time he'd stayed cooped up in his broom-closet-sized room. He hadn't been able to sleep a wink in all that time. It was cramped, it smelled funny, and it was dingy. Worst of all was the broken lock, which caused him no small amount of stress. Every now and then he'd hear footsteps coming down the hall and when he did, he'd hurry to the door, grab the handle, and pull on it as hard as he could, just in case any of the anthro fighters had figured out where he was living. He doubted fighters who dedicated their entire lives to the sport would look kindly on someone who was literally just going to be fighting as a joke. They'd probably consider it a mockery of their careers and want to deliver some payback--no matter how unwilling a participant he was in all of this. Luckily, none of the footsteps had stopped outside his room, and he wasn't dragged screaming from his new accommodations. However, the fear of who he'd run into on his own, without the back-up of an intimidating anthro mistress striding before him, kept him right where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he knew he couldn't stay in his room forever. He hadn't eaten anything at all yesterday and now today was halfway through. His stomach growled in protest as it tried to eat itself in lieu of real food. He looked at the pass Ms. Pierce had given him. He could head to the Fighter's Cafeteria... but the thought of willingly walking into a room filled with starving fighters who could literally eat him alive was a gamble he didn't want to take, even if he knew he'd have to either go there sometime, or starve to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could head to the Training Room. The looming threat of next week's match hanging over his head filled him with utter dread. He knew that if he couldn't get out of it--which he doubted he would--that meant he'd need to actually train to fight. While he knew he'd only been made a fighter as a joke, that didn't mean he wanted to get totally creamed in his first match. It was bad enough he was in this scenario without having to worry about becoming a laughingstock on national television. He couldn't let his family and friends see him beaten to a pulp so effortlessly. Marc remembered Ms. Pierce talking about personal trainers he could work with to coach him. It might be a good idea to meet one. Hopefully, whoever it was, would go easy on him. After all, it was a trainer's job to help fighters get better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc made up his mind. He took a deep breath and walked outside. Cafeteria or Training Room. Where does Marc go first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marc got to the Training Room through a combination of stealth and dumb luck. He'd snuck through the halls as quietly as a mouse (a normal-sized mouse, not an anthro one), and the few times he'd heard thundering footsteps coming down the hall, he'd manage to duck around a corner, behind a vending machine or into a trashcan before he was spotted. Granted, he ended up kinda sticky and smelling a little ripe, but it was a small price to pay for getting to his destination safely. He grabbed a banana peel that had stuck to his head and tossed it away as he finally came to the Training Room entrance. He took out his pass, put it in front of the scanner, and the gargantuan doors unlocked, allowing him to slip inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc took one look inside and gulped. The Training Room was packed. It seemed every piece of gym equipment was occupied by a towering anthro fighter. Marc spied the elegant unicorn fighter, Claudine, hitting and kicking a punching bag shaped like an obese anthro. Her skills were more like that of a graceful and refined dancer as she practiced her routine. Next to her was Daisy, a superstitious pig anthro, who was using a similar training dummy to practice a new move, over and over again until she perfected it, as was her habit. With a spike of fear, he recognized Dominique the Dom-Inator, the sadistic, human-male hating, black-magic practicing hippopotamus. Right now she was doing bench-presses, roaring in exertion as she lifted the maximum weight possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recognized many more famous fighters, but the scariest of all was Amaya, an obese yet muscular phoenix anthro. She was one of the biggest stars and top fighters of ASL's Gold Division. Her reputation for treating her human servants was almost as bad as Dominique's. She looked down on servants at the best of time, and anyone who wasn't in the Gold Division. Marc, a walking-talking jobber would elicit outright scorn at best, or utter loathing at worst. She was fighting in one of the practice rings in the back, using one of her poor servants as a \"training dummy.\" Marc winced as Amaya got to the top of one of the turnbuckles and jumped off, squashing the poor human underneath her. When she got up, he was indented into the mat like a pancake. Clearly this was less about \"training\" and more about stress relief. Smoke was coming off the phoenix as she looked at her bruised and broken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic,\" she sneered, peeling him off the mat. She tossed him contemptuously out of the ring, over to a pair of twin mouse anthros in hot pink nurse's outfits. The two loaded the groaning human on a stretcher as Amaya sneered down at him. \"See if you can fix this loser up so he can still be useful. If not, put him in my pantry for later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire display made Marc sick, especially when the two nurses rushed passed him with the smooshed human whimpering on top of it. They hadn't taken a step outside before one of the nurses slipped on the banana peel he'd carelessly tossed to the floor, and the two of them crashed, along with their patient. Marc winced/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there's that new human jobber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc couldn't tell which fighter had said it, but realizing he'd been noticed was enough to finally break him free of his shock. His eyes darted around the gym, until he saw an office halfway through the Training Room marked, \"TRAINERS\". Marc rushed towards it, not quite running but certainly a lot faster than walking. He didn't want to show fear, but he didn't want to dally either. As he moved, he heard other female fighters grumbling angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Just who the hell does he think he is, coming in here with real fighters?\"</span><span class=\"cviolet\"> \"I spent my entire life trying to get into the ASL, and this twerp is just handed a spot on a silver platter.\"</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\"I bet he thinks he's so special. Someone needs to teach him a lesson.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"I give him a week before he ends up a stain on the mat.\"</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Week nothing. If I have it my way, he'll be a stain before the day is up.\"</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Stain? What a waste of a perfectly good meal. He wants to be a fighter? I'll make him a part of one.\"</span> <span class=\"corange\">\"Does anybody else smell garbage?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc decided to give up not looking scared. The office of the personal trainers was still far away. He started running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Awwwww, is the widdle baby scared?\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Pathetic! Grow a spine you wimp!\"</span> <span class=\"clred\">\"Run as fast as you can, jobber, but you're not faster than me.\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc heard footsteps right behind him and he started sprinting. He doubted he'd ever run so fast in his life, but the footsteps were gaining on him. He dared not look back to see who was chasing him. He heard the woman chuckling, saw her shadow looming over him. He was so close to the Trainer's Office. He dived through the air, hoping to make it through the open doorway. Did he?</span></div></div>",

That had never happened in the months since he'd been trapped here. He had always reported to the facilities and suites for the fighters. After all his experience so far, he didn't have the good feelings about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Then again, what more could they possibly throw at me?'</i>, the young thought darkly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc report promptly to the offices and surprised by how normal they were. Somewhat enlarged to accommodate Anthro proportions but nothing as exaggerated as what was given to the fighters. All and all it looked like a normal office space of the human world with various employees walking around talking, handing off reports, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't given long to observe before a male velociraptor in a black suit strode up to him with a smile. He offered a clawed hand that Marc took with a firm shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Youngblood, thank you for coming so swiftly.\" spoke the velociraptor. \"I am Dante Talon and I'm here to offer you a proposition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's eyebrows rose into his hairline. \"Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante nodded. \"Yes, we here at the ASL have come upon an interesting situation that requires your particular brand of services.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Marc was truly confused. \"Ok what is it exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. The ASL is experimenting and looking to expand it's facilities with a new brand of fighters.\" Dante stated. \"We wish to expand our horizons to include human fighters in matches.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's jaw dropped. \"P-Please don't tell me that you me to fight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante gave a small laugh while waving his hands. \"No, no, no. We already have a candidate secured.\" Dante's face turned serious. \"The issue is several fold, however. You see, we wish to see if a human is even capable of bulking up sufficiently to even be considered a fighter. Anthros have the natural disposition to grow larger in size through eating but human...not so much. <br>\r\nAs such we have brought in specifically made foods and created a strict regime for diet and exercise for her to see if we can remedy that problem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next problem is that we have no way of knowing if that will work or even backfire. We will need observation on as many levels as much as possible. While we will be arranging checkups of all times, it is felt that we need a more personal touch. That is where you come in. You would act as her assistant as you have for other fighters. You will do you're typical duties but you will also be making periodic progress reports to us as well. Her attitude, your personal feelings on her progress, concerns, whatever you feel we should know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe selected you in particular because you are the only other human assistant that ASL has available. As such, you can relate more easily to our possibly newest recruit. Plus, you already have experience in dealing with such...demanding personnel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc weighed his options. On one hand, he got away from the anthros with this but on the other hand, he didn't want to deal with being what amounted to a glorified slave to another human being. Especially when it sounded like he was being given even more work to do on top of whatever this woman would have him do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante sighed. \"I can tell what you're thinking. Honestly, I can't and shouldn't blame you. After everything you've already been through, you've got to be thinking 'What do I get out of this?', right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man had enough shame to look sheepish and Dante continued. \"We are prepared to offer you this, should you accept. If everything goes to plan and the ASL sees this experiment pan out successfully, we're prepared to let you go. You're contract will be considered complete and you will be compensated approximately two million dollars for your troubles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt lighted head at that. He might actually get out of here and he'd have more than enough money to go to college! But as soon as his hopes rose, he became nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I get that if things go well but what if they don't?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that things go pear-shaped. You will still be compensated, just differently. You still fulfill your contract but it will be for three years, not five. In addition, you will become a maintenance and site employee instead of an assistant. You will work behind the scenes to keep our facility here running instead of directly working with the fighters.You be paid every two weeks, work five days a week, eights hours a day. You will be paid 100 dollars an hour. You will be given your own personal quarters and food will be paid for by us. Naturally, you cannot slack off during this time period or we will be forced to demote back down to your current position.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So I stand to benefit regardless,</i> he thought to himself. This was honestly a no-brainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept, Mr. Talon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante gave a relieved look and offered his hand again which Marc shook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. We'll get all the paperwork drawn up and sent to you. Nothing complicated and you're free to review it. But in the meantime...\"</span></div></div>",

Long, black hair that reaches her butt. Her figure is ruled by her wide hips, big butt, muscular and large belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNubia was once a young and talented singer; elegant, vibrant and friendly. Her good looks, clever wit, beautiful voice and warm disposition won her the hearts of many and in return, she poured her soul into her work to never disappoint them. This, however, caused a rift with her now ex-husband, who grew jealous of Liliana's success and the attention she gave to her fanbase, feeling like she was neglecting their marriage. Despite, Nubia's attempts to heal the damage she inadvertently caused, her husband eventually cheated on her and left with his mistress. This event and betrayal broke something in the singer. She became cold and bitter which reflected in her singing. While still beautiful, where her voice once uplifted people's hearts and brought joy, it now brought woeful tears and sorrowful spirits. Deeply ashamed of this and bitter at the perversion of her art, Nubia quit singing altogether out of anger and guilt and joined the ASL, drowning her sorrows in fighting, food and drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Nubia is a renowned ASL fighter known for her cynical disposition. She strikes the perfect example of an ice queen. Her words are biting and she has lost none of her elegance. As such, she can make a person feel small with just a glance or gesture. She has become an extremely heavy drinker, her belly often audibly sloshing and severely distended from just how much she alcohol she consumes in a day. Due to constantly indulging, her alcohol tolerance is through the roof and is a miracle for her to even become tipsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ring, Nubia actually uses this as an advantage. She uses her massive and drink filled gut as a battering ram and wrecking ball. Propelled by her extremely strong legs, she is able to ram into her foes like a train wreck, all the while being too fast for most to even react to. This has allowed her to take on and beat opponents far larger than herself and overwhelm those her size or smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He needed to get to one of the upper floors to reach is new mistress/boss/torturer/person-he-didn't-want-to-meet. He pressed the button for the 3rd floor when he noticed something. The button, which should have glowed green, was red. Marc had no clue what that was about. A glitch, maybe? Bad wiring? With little to lose, he pressed the button again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, the button didn't just light red, the panel sparked with a small surge of electricity. Marc jumped back in surprise and jumped again when the elevator started moving. Only, it wasn't going up, it was moving downward. Marc watched with mounting dread and confusion as the display for the elevator went showed it descending to the basement. Marc had no clue what was down there as he had never had a reason to go. Sadly, he wasn't given any time to ponder any unknown dangers that lurked there as the elevator went <i>further</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Marc breathed out, eyes wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't another level to the ASL or, at least, there wasn't another level below the basement as far at the young man knew. Yet, that wasn't stopping the elevator from continuing its descent downward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc didn't know how long he was in the elevator, his confused and terrified state making every moment feel like a lifetime. He was in such a stupor that he barely noticed when the elevator stopped with a rumble before the doors flew open. Despite himself, Marc poked his head out of the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was greeted with a long, hallway. It was sparse, devoid of any ornamentation or decadence that the ASL exuded from every surface. Large, bright lights lined the ceiling. The sheer lack of anything familiar made Marc's skin crawl. He looked back to the elevator's control panel and noted that it was still sparking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I doubt that'll work</i>,' He thought. He weighed his options. He could venture out into...wherever he was at. Maybe he could find someone to help him or at least another elevator to get back to the main facility. But there was the possibility that he'd get himself lost. Just from what he'd seen, everywhere looked the same. Or he could wait until someone came to the elevator. Surely someone would want to use it, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Marc do?</span></div></div>",

Has vibrant red skin, pointed ears, gold slitted eyes, extremely pale blonde hair with a single streak of black, black horns on her forehead, a long red tail and hooves for feet. Her physique is one of equal parts fat and muscle. Her chest is rather modest for her size but extremely large due to her sheer size. Her limbs are bulky, layered in a thick coating of flab that hides the thicker muscle underneath. Notably large hips and rear that outsize most fighters. Lexi central feature his her belly, a tight ball of packed fat that jets out in front of her like a small mountain. Face is surprisingly thin with attractive and perfect;y symmetrical features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi is a virtual unknown to the wider world and for good reason. Her existence is proof of another world in addition to the Anthro and Human ones: the Monster world. Anthros and Monsters used to coexist, if for no other reason than the fact that Anthros vastly outnumber Monsters. However, once Humans and Anthros met, the Anthros were quick to forcibly contain the Monsters in their original homeland due their fear of humanity's reaction. Due to this, she is confined to the Pit. How she came to be at the ASL is unknown but she's managed the Pit since it came into existence and is well acquainted with Marlene. She keeps the Pit running, checking on the status of the prisoners, looking after the integrity of the prison's tech and coordinating the staff that helps her run it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi runs the Pit with a firm hand and keeps her staff on task with mix charisma, respect and fear. She rewards competency in earnest but doles out punishment in proportion to the mistake. She is the best kind of friend but the worst sort of enemy who never truly forgets a slight even if she was to forgive it. She is usually charming and intelligent. Underneath it all, Lexi despises Anthros. She believes that if the Humans had been allowed to meet her people, the Anthros would never be allowed to treat them as second class citizens. She labors for the day that Monsters are able to truly be apart of civilization again and believe that if she can somehow get control of ASL, she can bring that day sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Lexi is very curious about humans and would personally love to meet one.

Before coming to the ASL, he'd have never noticed this particular sign, but his time spent in this hostile environment had all but required the honing of his senses for better or worse. Now, it was all but second nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the vibration of the ground underfoot and by the sheer level of it, Marc could tell that one thing: whomever it was, was absolutely <i>huge</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt his heart rate pick up as he desperately sought somewhere he could hide or run. The problem was there really wasn't anything he could duck in or behind, the hallway was bare. As for running he just didn't know where he could go. The hallway only had two directions, right or left and both rounded a corner, making it so he couldn't tell from where the nearing danger was coming from. Usually, he was good enough in detecting such things as to figure out what direction one of the huge fighters was coming from. Yet, the approaching behemoth was so large that their bulk made vibrations so intense that they seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc cursed himself for his indecision. He cursed even more when he saw a figure round the corner to his left and felt his jaw drop as he finally saw what had been approaching him. She, because it was most definitely a she, was the single largest figure Marc had ever seen since his entrapment at the ASL. The first thing that Marc took note of, once he'd gotten over the sheer difference of height, was the fact that the person was wearing a neat black suit, perfectly tailored for the veritable mountain that was her body. While that might have seen such a strange thing to take notice of, such clothing was uncommon at the ASL. Many of the fighters didn't bother with normal clothes, if they bothered with clothes at all. Marc had gotten used to seeing various anthros in bikinis or ill fitting shirts-turned-bras and shorts. Instead, this one wore a rather nice looking black suit jacket and matching pants. She sported no shirt though, Marc saw, giving him a perfect view of the red skin her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was taken aback as he took in the female in front of him. This was no anthro! She had no fur or scales. Instead, her skin was a bright red, unblemished and unmarred. Furthermore, her face...was human. Or, at least, practically human. A noble, beautiful face framed and contrasting against flaxen hair with a single black streak trailed its way through her locks. Black horns jutted from her forehead. A tail of red and tipped with a spade-like growth trailed behind her while she walked, her bare, smooth hooves clacking off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis female was the perfect example of a demon from the various depictions that Marc had seen throughout his life and she was looking right at him with an expression of...</span></div></div>",

He'd met plenty of anthro mistresses who ACTED like demons, and knew plenty were evil enough to pass for one...but none had been actual hellspawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now he was staring one down, with nowhere to run. He cringed and waited for the expected taunting over his doomed soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait...what? How'd you get down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hadn't been it. \"Um, what?\" Marc asked stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get down here?\" The demoness asked again. She bent down, her smart black business-dress straining to hold in her plump frame. She squinted her glowing yellow eyes at Marc, looking him over. Those eyes widened. <br>\r\n\"You're a human! Down here, in the Pit!\" she grinned. \"This could be my chance...finally, Monsters can come out of the shadows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc was sweating. This demon woman had just started talking nonsense within seconds of meeting him. He took a step back, hoping to get back to the elevator--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was enveloped in a giant red hand, then stuffed between the demoness's ample breasts. Immediately he felt the summer-day heat of her body envelop him. Fitting for a Hell-creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Alexis, but you can call me Lexi,\" the demon lady greeted cheerfully as she started walking down the hall. With his eyes now adjusted to the dark, he saw it was a spartan corridor of concrete and dim lights. Steel doors lined the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, my name's Marc, Miss Demon--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, call me Lexi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Lexi. But...where is this? The elevator went wrong and brought me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is The Pit,\" Lexi answered, pausing at a set of double steel doors. They were reinforced with large rivets and bolts, like something from a military bunker. Lexi's hand paused at the bar. \"Marc, little guy? Try to keep quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door to a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was massive--big enough to fit a small town. And all along the walls, extending past catwalks almost to the ceiling, were giant barred cells, each with an Anthro inside. All of them sneered, scowled, paced around their confinement. A few shouted greetings...and threats...at Lexi. And they all had murder in their eyes. Marc recognized a few Anthros from the news--serial killers, drug lords, assassins. They were all here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a prison,\" Marc breathed, feeling a shock of dread. Had this been under the ASL all this time? If there ever was a breakout, there was a stadium full of victims waiting above....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked by one cell housing a slender otter woman about Lexi's height. She perked up at the sight of Lexi--or rather, Marc. \"You've got a human, Bael?\" she asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lexi replied, moving her hand protectively before Marc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Human,\" the otter woman greeted. \"Just so you know, if I find your family, I'll eat the kids first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd said it so easily, so <i>casually</i> that it took Marc a second to process.  His mouth suddenly felt dry. \"W-what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, I'd start with the children. They taste the best; like an appetizer.\" The otter said patiently. \"Not to mention they're the easiest to eat--I can swallow children in one gulp; adults take a few swallows. Not to mention they're stronger: makes eating adults a bit of a chore. More complex flavors, though.\" She shrugged, like she was talking about the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc felt his jaw drop, and shivered despite the heat coming off of Lexi. Plenty of anthros ate humans, especially the gluttons in the ASL. He'd seen his share of people getting eaten, even came close to becoming a meal himself. He'd always found it terrifying that these giant animal women saw him  as a talking snack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut NONE of his mistresses had been this cavalier about it. They threw out quips, made a show of eating humans, salivated when they got the chance. This otter woman seemed almost <i>bored</i> talking about eating people, as if she didn't even get the predator's satisfaction most anthros got eating humans...the people she ate might have been noodles to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd until now, even the most predatory, gluttonous anthros he'd met had NEVER mentioned going after kids. Some even had a soft spot for human children--even Dominique and Sapphire were friendly to the kid fans. But now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of obvious psychosis didn't matter.<br>\r\nThis otter was <b>evil.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi must have felt his shivers. She pulled her dress closer around her chest, tucking Marc protectively between her breasts. Letting out a low, dangerous growl, she flicked her wrist--and a coiling fire in the shape of a whip formed in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice that speech in front of a mirror, Helena?\" the demoness hissed. \"Think you can rile me up into killing you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have much entertainment down here, Bael. Not much to do but remember better times.\" The otter, now named Helena, said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A shrug that turned into an agonized spasm as Lexi cracked the flailing whip in her face. The flaming coils phased harmlessly through the bars to strike Helena, throwing her hard to the floor with a cry of pain. Marc smelled burnt fur and singed flesh, and now saw the pathwork of blackened welts and scars on Helena's back as she lay on the concrete floor. He felt Lexi's chest heave as she took shuddering breaths; felt her heart pounding in her chest, nearly loud enough to drown out her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll keep on remembering until you die and rot down here,\" Lexi growled. \"However long it takes: years, decades; maybe even until you're one hundred years old--all you can do is remember everything you did, all those innocent people you ate. You won't get to cheat your suffering, Helena. And when you finally do wither and die, with nobody even remembering your <i>name</i>...I'll be there to drag you to Hell myself. And I'll make sure you suffer everything you put your victims through....but I hope it takes a long time for that to happen. <i>I want you to rot to the bone down here, you <b>bitch</b>.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi sneered down at the writhing prisoner, then stomped down the hall, now silent after her display on Helena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Helena's cell was well behind them, she gave Marc a comforting pat on the head. \"It's alright. None of them will get to you. You're safe with me, Marc. I promise--just stay close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long staircase brought them to a fortified watchtower/office that overlooked much of the basement. Lexi let herself in, gently plucking Marc from between her ample breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Pit, little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc shook his head clear, fighting down the choking shadow of horror his talk with Helena had thrown over him. Unable to speak, he looked around the spartan office/security station...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Alone with Lexi: He and Lexi are the only ones there--she tries to talk to him and see if he's alright; fascinated at meeting a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Guardians of the Pit: One of Lexi's fellow jailers is there, and notices the new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.)

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Set in the same world as Anthro Tech, this time you will be guiding/controlling Marc as he goes about his daily duties at an ASL (Anthro Sumo League) site. This site is not just a staging area for the various matches but also where the various wrestlers live, train, and pamper themselves. While at first glance you would think that it would be like the human sumo sport, you would be wrong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ASL, while the fighters may huge in height and bulk, their fighting has more in common with MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) than traditional sumo. The ASL is hugely popular in both the human and anthro worlds for its highly volatile matches. Many even pay thousands of dollars just to show up and see a match in person everyday and even more bet on the victors and losers of various matches. Their are three main division in the ASL and you can tell what division each fighter belongs to by the colored ASL logo on their belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Divisions:</i> Each division has it's own compound in the site that is private to them and general staff assigned there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gold Division:</b> Considered to the cream of the crop of the ASL, these are the fighters who receive the most fame, given the most money for their victories, allowed access to the best R&amp;R sections of the ASL compound and given the most leeway for rule breaking. Those of the Gold Division are generally the largest and/or most skilled fighters in ASL. The luxury they have access to is far above that of five-star, world class resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Silver Division:</b> Those of the Silver Division are considered to be above average in size and skill and on their way to Gold Division. However, they haven't made it just yet. Silver Division see the most traffic, with anthros going from bronze to silver, then silver to gold and back down from gold to silver. The Silver Division has privileges that are comparable to a 5-star resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bronze Division:</b> The lowest division in terms of general size and skill but the largest pool of fighters. However, they are probably the most ambitious and daring. The facilities they have access to are comparable to a 4-star resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Pit:</b> The Pit is not an actual division but instead a massive, underground prison complex located underneath the ASL. The ASL attracts some of the most dangerous competitors in terms of personality, size, skill or some combination of the aforementioned traits. However, most of these behemoths are just that - competitors, seeking to do their best at the ASL and contain the viciousness to the ring or personal property. Yet some descend into true madness, depravity or other malevolence that goes far beyond what the ASL is willing to tolerate. Such dangerous individuals cannot be simply allowed to roam free and, thus, the Pit was created to contain them. Should a fighter become too dangerous or unreasonable, this is their destination. The Pit is a state of the art technological marvel of security and innovation utilizing everything from knock gas dispensers in the cells to forcefields to contain the prisoners to teleporters for travel in and out of specially designed cells. No fighter sent to it has ever escaped it's oppressive walls. The Pit is unknown to the general public and no human has ever visited it...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn addition, there are 5 types of matches that the fighters can participate in: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. <b>Regular:</b> These matches are the standard matches that are seen the most of the time. They end when a fighter submits or is tossed out of the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. <b>Survival of the Fittest:</b> These matches end only after one of the fighters is consumed by another. This can be either whole or even in pieces. These type of matches can only be issued by a fighter/team of fighters to another. They can also be declined, however, that can result in a loss of face. Survival matches can bee issued by any member of any division to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. <b>Promotion:</b> These matches are for when a fighter is about to be promoted upwards in division. To enter a higher division, the fighter must defeat a member of said division. Promotion matches can also be coupled with Survival matches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. <b>Tag:</b> This is type of match is always 2 on 2. It can also be a regular, survival, or promotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. <b>Free for All:</b> Free for all's are matches between 3-5 fighters. Fighters lose if they submit, tossed out ring or eaten.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Promotion/Demotion:</i> For a fighter to be promoted, she must win 10 consecutive matches of any kind. A fighter will be demoted a division if she loses 5 consecutive matches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Main</b> <br>\r\n<i>Marc Youngblood </i><br>\r\nSpecies: Human <br>\r\nHeight: 6'1\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes. Slim, athletic build. <br>\r\nMarc is a young man who needed money to go to college as his family fell on hard times. Determined to pull his own weight he signed up to work for ASL to make money to pay for his education. What he didn't know was that the job entailed him basically acting as a servant to the fighters. He has little to know rights and the only things keeping him alive is the ability to please the fighters, his wits and the excellent medical facilities of the ASL. Marc is fairly polite but has a sense of pride that can cause him to speak/lash out when abused or demeaned. This has gotten him sent to the hospital several times. Now, he does his best to curb his tongue and tries to avoid being wrapped in any plots or deranged behavior. He's stuck at ASL until his five-year contract is up. Recently, he's been assigned to a new fighter as her personal servant/slave. Can he survive his new charge and even if he can, will SHE stay top dog long enough for him to even get used to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other Characters </b> <br>\r\n<i>Faculty &amp; Staff</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Marlene</i> (Created by lwut)<br>\r\nSpecies: Penguin<br>\r\nHeight: 64'11\"<br>\r\nAppearance: Has dark purple feathers and a white underbelly, with bright red eyes and a yellow beak. Marlene sports a pair of breasts and an ass that each put the waistlines to some of the biggest fighters in the facility to shame, but she's mostly bombarded by an utterly titanic belly that perpetually lays on the floor, which she decorates with a variety of colorful tattoos to show off as it hangs out of all her shirts. She's reaching her late forties, but looks to be ten or fifteen years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner, founder, spokeswoman, and undisputed champion of the ASL, Marlene is undeniably the absolute biggest combatant in all the facility. Most of the time, she's rarely seen anywhere outside of her office, where she keeps the facility's upkeep and paperwork under control, but at the end of every month, there's a fan poll held where viewers can elect fighters to battle her in a five-on-one cage match, a battle that she rarely loses, despite being so obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she's away from the desk, Marlene can only be described as an anthro who's always hungry. Hungry for food, money, success...and love. In the walls of the facility, she's notorious for flirting with or forcing herself on anybody within a boulder's throw of her, whether they be male or female, or even fighter and staff. Rumor even has it that she makes secret deals with elected fighters to date her in exchange for victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the worse off are her assistants, her mad fetish for all things tiny being the main reason humans can be hired in the first place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alexis 'Lexi' Bael </i><br>\r\nSpecies: Demon <br>\r\nHeight: 64'1\" <br>\r\nAppearance: As a demon she appears very similiar human though naturally different. Has vibrant red skin, pointed ears, gold slitted eyes, extremely pale blonde hair with a single streak of black, black horns on her forehead, a long red tail and hooves for feet. Her physique is one of equal parts fat and muscle. Her chest is rather modest for her size but extremely large due to her sheer size. Her limbs are bulky, layered in a thick coating of flab that hides the thicker muscle underneath. Notably large hips and rear that outsize most fighters. Lexi central feature his her belly, a tight ball of packed fat that jets out in front of her like a small mountain. Face is surprisingly thin with attractive and perfect;y symmetrical features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi is a virtual unknown to the wider world and for good reason. Her existence is proof of another world in addition to the Anthro and Human ones: the Monster world. Anthros and Monsters used to coexist, if for no other reason than the fact that Anthros vastly outnumber Monsters. However, once Humans and Anthros met, the Anthros were quick to forcibly contain the Monsters in their original homeland due their fear of humanity's reaction. Due to this, she is confined to the Pit. How she came to be at the ASL is unknown but she's managed the Pit since it came into existence and is well acquainted with Marlene. She keeps the Pit running, checking on the status of the prisoners, looking after the integrity of the prison's tech and coordinating the staff that helps her run it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi runs the Pit with a firm hand and keeps her staff on task with mix charisma, respect and fear. She rewards competency in earnest but doles out punishment in proportion to the mistake. She is the best kind of friend but the worst sort of enemy who never truly forgets a slight even if she was to forgive it. She is usually charming and intelligent. Underneath it all, Lexi despises Anthros. She believes that if the Humans had been allowed to meet her people, the Anthros would never be allowed to treat them as second class citizens. She labors for the day that Monsters are able to truly be apart of civilization again and believe that if she can somehow get control of ASL, she can bring that day sooner rather than later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Lexi is very curious about humans and would personally love to meet one. Maybe that just might happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fighters</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Gold Division</i></b>  <br>\r\n<i>Amaya</i> <br>\r\nSpecies: Phoenix Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 20'2\" <br>\r\nAppearance: A red and gold feathers, black hair, gold eyes.

Obese and muscular, well proportioned over all. <br>\r\nClaudine is noted for her elegant personality and refined fighting style. She speaks softly but hits like a truck. Claudine will fight any type of match but Survival. Not out of real morality, but because she believes that consuming other anthros will throw her figure and thus, her fighting style off. Claudine has high standards for her servants but is slow to anger. In the ring, she fires of blasts of magic to stun/knock back her foes while coming up with tactics to dispatch them efficiently. She does not posture or gloat but goes right for her win. Underneath all of her elegance and competitive personality, is a lonely anthro who desires real companionship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Roxenne</i> <br>\r\nSpecies: Western Dragon Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 21'5\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Black scales, red underbelly, pointed horns.

She degrades anyone under her authority. In the ring, she's known for her fire breath and pure strength. Not too much else about this one. Rumor is that she kill someone long before joining the ASL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Silver Division</i></b> <br>\r\n<i>Rika</i> <br>\r\nSpecies: Jaguar Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 17'4\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Brown fur, black  spots, white underbelly.

To servants, she always teases them, working them up by flirting or intimidating them with her size, only to let them go. Rika is usually easygoing but anything that detracts for her looks will instantly strike a nerve. When Rika fights, she like to goad her opponents into making mistakes to make up for lacking any true special skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Athene</i> <br>\r\nSpecies: Rhino Anthro<br>\r\nHeight: 17'1\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Gray skinned, short brown mowhawk, extra large muscular, thunder thighs. <br>\r\nTough as nails and taciturn, Athene's not one to waste words or indulge herself in anything she thinks would make her soft. Instead, she focuses all her time training for her next bout. To her servants, she is a silent, brooding mistress who likes to use them tools to further her training. Athene likes to use charging attacks and grappling to hound and decimate her opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Bronze Division</i></b> <br>\r\n<i>Miku</i> <br>\r\nSpecies: Fox Anthro <br>\r\nHeight\" 14'9\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Black hair, red fur and white underbelly.

While confident, she's not arrogant and always looking to improve her style. To her servants, she expects obedience but also like to bounce ideas off of them and values their opinions if they prove to be intelligent and resourceful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rules</i> <br>\r\nNo toilet stuff. <br>\r\nSex is allowed just don't turn this into smut. <br>\r\nVore is allowed. <br>\r\nDon't end the story too soon. <br>\r\nMake sure your entries readable. (Basic Grammar) <br>\r\nTry to keep the Anthros around adult age (18 and up). <br>\r\nThere can be male anthros but Marc should be interacting with females for the most part. <br>\r\nFeel free to add new Anthros. (Singles or entire lists)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave Fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </td>",
