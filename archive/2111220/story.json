        "created":1486342920,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Angels with Scaly Wings is a Romance Adventure Visual Novel available on Steam (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/571880/\" target=\"_blank\">http://store.steampowered.com/app/571880/</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive is based on the world portrayed in that Visual Novel, but it will not involve the same location, or same characters. Why? I will be wanting to avoid spoilers at all costs so those that decide to try the game can still get the full enjoyment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis means that some background information, or events portrayed here is inspired by AWSW, but is not the same.  As such, there are a few rules that need to be made clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. <b>No Spoilers!</b> Enough said.. I will delete any posts I believe is a spoiler to the game, whether it was intentional or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. <b>Do not use characters from the game!</b> On top of the No Spoiler rule, there is also the fact some of the game characters are cameos, and as such are owned by the people who those cameos were for.  It would be very rude of us to include them in story lines and actions that are against the creators view of that character. Exceptions will be if the owners of those cameo characters wrote in the storyline their permission, AND can be properly verified that they do indeed own that character<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. <b>Protected characters are Protected</b> If a player writes a new character and denotes it as a protected character, then that person is the only one that can write a response FOR that character. That doesn't mean that you cant jump into a storyline that is being written and interact with that character though.. provided it makes sense. Just leave room for the player to respond as their character. See Below for more information<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. <b> There is only one human in the game.</b> If that human has been identified in a story thread, then there is no changing that human. If you want to add a different human, pick a story thread that doesn't have the human introduced yet. On this world, humans are considered a myth, to some a deity. Just keep in mind how humans may react to a dragon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. <b>Technology</b> Flat screen televisions and computers exist, There are no ships, there is no mobile phone use, but there is a device called an Ixomen Sphere that does most of what a modern mobile phone does.  There is no knowledge of any continent beyond the one you are on. For purposes of this story, there is no mass transport other than flying or walking. Beyond that, you can assume a technology level as one would expect for modern times<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. <b> There are 5 Dragon races.</b> There is room for customization, but try to keep it so one can make it generally within one of these 5. They are based on the dragons you can generally interact with in the game, though I have taken liberties with some of the dragon race names. Dragons either have a breath weapon of fire, or no breath weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. <b>Vore</b> As much as I enjoy a good vore scene, for storyline purposes, eating another sentient being is a crime.  It happens, but usually by dragons who contract a mental illness that reverts them to a feral state of mind. I am not saying don't have vore in your story, I'm just saying make sure you take into consideration the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. <b>Gender and Orientation</b>No limits. Everyone's sexuality is unique, and it is all welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Dragon Races are as follows:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth Dragons: These dragons are quadruped, heavily scaled dragons known for their strength and toughness. They have vestigial wings that act as extra armor for their back, and can be moved with some effort, however they do not support flight. Their tail end comes to a club like appearance, and can be used as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyverns: One of the two variety of Fliers, they do not have any forelegs. However, they are very dexterous and can walk while balancing objects on their wingtips. Their feet serve the same purpose as hands in other species, and can be used just as well as hands. The tail comes to a curved tip that can be used for catching fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue Dragons: The second variety of Flier, these are the ones that most resemble Western Dragons. They combine the strength and toughness of the Earth Dragons, with the flight ability of the Wyverns, however they have a simple tapered tail, and their claws lack the dexterity of the Wyverns. Some are able to walk on two legs, others can not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaptors: Also known as the Runners, these flightless dragons walk on two legs and can run extremely fast. In addition, their hands are the most dexterous of all the dragons, and as such are usually used for jobs that require fine motor skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraconians: These creatures most resemble lizardmen. While they mostly have scales, a few have been known to have fur instead. They are bipedal, and though not as fast as the Raptors, they are more solidly built with fairly dexterous hands. This makes them ideal for the largest variety of jobs of all the Dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>More Information for Protected Characters</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeally, having a protected character allows that character to interact directly with a writer, adding more storyline and cooperative effort. In a perfect world, a person would not write a \"Forced action\" for a protected character, unless it is something obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, a person may have a Protected Character named Faamil who works as a barkeep at the Drained Dragon.  You could order a drink from Faamil and have him deliver it to you without needing to interact with Faamil's creator, but asking Faamil about his favorite music would be something you would have to allow Faamil's character to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, you couldn't in your storline claim Faamil is killed, or becomes a criminal, or his bar burns down without his permission, and any permission granted is LIMITED to just that one storyline. This gives Faamils creator some say in how his character is used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the same token, if you do decide to create a Protected Character, we ask you remain active, introduce your character in other storylines, basically our Protected Characters act as sort of GMs to help other storylines foward if they are stalled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough rules then?
