            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel's already been on his way for a few hours now, making his way through the dilapidated forest path. How much longer would it take until he'd reach his destination? They told him that going though the forest would be a faster route to his grandparents, but by now he has spent twice as long time trying to find his way though the damn place. Daniel intended to bring his grandparents a basket of food as a gift, but at this point he may actually need it to survive if he can't make his way out the forest anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel checked his map again, which didn't help much considering the forest was marked as a bunch of trees off to the edge of the map. It only really showed the most commonly traveled routes between the towns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" Daniel thought to himself. \"I think I'm lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was very tired. He'd spend doing nothing less than constantly wading his way though the overgrown forest for hours on an end, just to get lost in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll just make my way south, I'll probably see my home town once I get out of this damn place.\" Daniel told himself, slightly frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's thougths were interrupted, however, as he saw a large shadow move between the trees nearby. He went against instinct to run, and instead decided to take a closer look to what the hell it was that he saw move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved into the area where the strange shadow had been, but didn't really find anything out of the ordinary. \"Must've been my imagination. Maybe its because of walking so damn long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns around to face the head of a large crimson red dragon staring down at him, inches from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel dropped his basket and nearly screamed, but then the dragon spoke up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you lost?\" It said, in a strangely feminine sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was completely puzzled. Yes, he had heard of dragons in children's tales, but never in his life had he expected to face one, let alone one that spoke English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, um-- I think so..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon chuckles. \"Oh, this must be the first time you see one of our kind, I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've met other people?\" Daniel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Usually, humans come here to meet us.\" The dragon cheerfully responds. \"Anyway, what's your name? And what brings you here, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel thought about this for a moment. There's been a hidden place in the nearby forest where people would meet up with... dragons? Sure, the forest is huge, but it's strange to realize that he could meet a dragon just around the corner like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you awake? Helloooo!\" The dragon says as she waved a paw before Daniels face. Daniel snapped out of his thoughts and replied to the dragon's original question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my name's Daniel, and uhh...\" Daniel held his hand on the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon just stared at Daniel with an anticipating smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I wanted to meet one of your kind, so I came here!\" Daniel lied to the dragon. Sure, he could've told the truth, but it just seemed like a one-time opportunity, meeting a dragon like this. Telling the dragon he went to his grandparents to deliver them food would probably end up with the dragon bringing him there and leaving him alone, but Daniel wanted a little more out of this encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so sweet!\" The dragon exclaimed as it embraced Daniel in her scaly forelegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, hey! A little less rough, please?\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my bad. Sometimes I get a little excited like that, sorry about that.\" The dragon said as she releases Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, what's your name, anyway?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Avila!\" The dragon responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nice to meet you Avila.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too, Daniel!\" Avila replied. \"Hey, do you wanna meet my brother as well? He can be a little rough, but he's pretty nice overall. I think you'll like him.\"</span></div></div>",

(As long they're consumed in a whole piece.)<br>\r\n* Other fetishy stuff, but do try to make it clear what it is and make sure it's a choice the reader makes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">What you may NOT write about</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Gibs 'n gore.<br>\r\n* Extreme torture or anything related to that level.<br>\r\n* Growing/Shrinking characters. (Special magic spells are tolerable, but try to fit it in the story.)<br>\r\n* Death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================================<br>\r\nAlso: PLEASE DO NOT MAKE TONS OF CHOICE CHAPTERS! Giving the reader too many choices will cause the story to become scattered all over the place because no one will bother writing a unique chapter for every single option you put down. Chapters should tell stories, and end with the reader making a choice on how to continue that story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, don't say make a chapter that just says \"is the dragon male or female\", instead, give the reader the option to meet a different dragon, and write a chapter based on that. It's much more interesting and it keeps the story in place.<br>\r\n====================================<br>\r\nJust use your common sense, and you'll be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe setting for the story is a little ambiguous, you may make up stuff as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, don't be nervous if you are considering creating a new chapter. Even if you're not good at writing, your commission will help this story greatly.</td>",
