Ivan's parents were leaving on an extended vacation and he was being forced to stay at home while they had the time of their lives. In all reality, this wouldn't bother Ivan all that much, but the fact that they hired a babysitter? He was sixteen years old! If anything he should be doing the babysitting! But sadly, his parents didn't see it that way, they were worried that Ivan would get into trouble if he was left alone and before they left, Ivan's parents told him that the babysitter has been given the authority to do whatever she thinks is necessary to keep Ivan safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan was pretty much a typical teenager. He was tall, about 6 foot 2, but very scrawny and gangly. He wasn't an ugly guy, in fact most people considered him to be quite attractive, but his extreme shyness and the way women intimidated him always got in the way of his social life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his parents were out the door, Ivan realized he should just accept the inevitable. He sat down on the couch, put in his headphones, and waited for his babysitter to arrive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was no more happy about this either. I was captain of the cheer team, and the quintessential rich brat. My parents had forced me to get this stupid babysitting job as a lesson in responsibility or some crap like that. But I thought it might not be so bad, though I hadn't payed any attention to who the client was. As I walked to the door, I tapped on it twice, running a bit late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a year older then Ivan but quite a bit shorter. I had long brown hair in a fluffy ponytail with a pink butterfly beret, a white tanktop covered by a black light black coat, and a very short pink and black skirt. I was in quite good shape, given my position in the team at school, with a fairly large bust and absolutely gigantic ass. The latter pushed up my skirt enough to partially reveal my cotton candy pink thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the boys at school would fantasize about me, Ivan knew better. I constantly tormented him about his shyness and he'd heard horrible stories about the ways I hazed the other cheerleaders. As the door open, I looked fairly shocked. \"Wait, you?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I opened the door, I became overcome by intense fear and hatred. Out of all the people at school who bullied me, this girl was definitely the worst. For some reason she just couldn't leave me alone, she seemed to believe that because I'm so shy and awkward I deserve to be nothing more than your personal ridicule slave.And although you've never spoken to me about them, I've heard rumors of the horrible and disgusting ways she tortures hopeful cheerleaders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly backed away from the door, trying to distance myself from you as much as I could. Even though up until now all of her abuse has been verbal, I still had immense fear that she may attack me in a much more physical manner. \"Please no!\" I said as I stared at the floor in front of me, I knew that if I looked up, I would stare at he huge breasts or her beautiful ass and I didn't want to give her any ammunition for my torment. \"Can you just leave? I'll tell my parents that you were here the whole time and you can still get paid. Please, I'll give you anything. Money, electronics, hell you can take my fridge, I don't care! I'll do whatever you say if you leave!\" I said through a strained voice and pleading eyes</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he had first opened the door I was in total shock. I hadn't much payed attention to who I was babysitting, but even if I had, I doubt it would cover this. I wanted out of this, at least, I did. Of all the losers in school, this was perhaps the one that I most enjoyed putting in his place. Of course what I did there was only the tiniest sliver of what he really deserved. And this provided me with a situation where I could finally show him just what really happened to people like him in the real world. Of course the offer was appealing in it's own way, but it's not like my family couldn't afford it. My weekly allowance was more money then most people my age would see in an entire year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to decide, and my look of shock and annoyance melted away into a taunting smile. \"Oh sorry, but you know I can't do that. Professional ethics and all. So get in here already, your letting in a draft and if I get sick then your going to be very, very, sick.\" My tone was threatening but far from serious, I was starting to enjoy the thought of having authority over him for your entire stay. I stepped back to let him in, gesturing to the nearest hallway. \"So want to take the grand tour?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Begrudgingly, I mumbled out a quiet \"Okay.\" I slowly turned to follow you as you lead the way down the hallway. For the most part, I kept my eyes glued to the floor, but although I was terrified of you and the situation that had presented itself, I couldn't help but look up at the magnificent ass the was standing before me. I knew if you noticed me doing this, there would be Hell to pay, but it was just so gorgeous I couldn't tear my eyes off it. As we walked through your house, which was ridiculously large, I found myself marveling at the elaborate layout of the house. As we had passed certain rooms I found myself compelled to distance myself from the doors. Such as the bathroom. I don't know why, but the idea of your bathroom made me sweat. And as you pointed out your bedroom, I found myself drawn to look at your bed with longing. I let out a slight moan when the thought of sharing that bed with you shot to my brain. I instantly realized what I had done and quickly asked \"Umm.... Where will I be sleeping? I don't mean to interrupt, but I'd like to know where to put my things.\" I looked at your face when I asked the question, but quickly shot my eyes down to the floor as I awaited your answer. </span></div></div>",
