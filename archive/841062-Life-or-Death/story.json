After you had lunch, you go to the gym room to have Gym, the class you hate the most. You wait until all of the girls go into the girls' locker room to change into their gym clothes. Once they leave, you, steathily, enter the room. Inside, you shut the door and start looking for their bags and find them without too much trouble. Carefully, you unzip one of their bags and find a waterbottle, just half full. You take it out and open the top. Holding the bottle and cap with one hand, you take out one pack of school salt you took from lunch, rip it open with your teeth, and pour it into the bottle. Then you place the waterbottle back into the bag, exactly as you found it, and zip it up. You do this with all of the other cheerleaders' waterbottles. When you're finished, you smirk and leave the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a smile on your face during the class. You couldn't wait to see the look on their faces when they drink from the bottles. That'll definitely be a Kodak moment to remember.  Some of the students eye you, suspiciously, and you stop smiling, making sure you don't make others question you. As soon as class is over, the girls and cheerleaders head to the locker room to change back into their street clothes. You follow and hide behind some lockers. One of the cheerleaders unzips her bag and takes out her waterbottle to drink. You stifle your laughter as she tastes the odd water and spits it into the face of a girl that's on her way to take a shower. The other girls gasp and you bit you lip to keep from exploding with laughter. That scene was priceless. \"Gross!\" the cheerleader exclaimed, grimacing. \"This water has SALT in it!\" \"Salt?\" another cheerleader questions. The first cheerleader coughs and spits, trying to get the bitter taste out of your mouth. \"Yeah! Salt!\" \"Let me taste it,\" the second one replies. The first cheerleader hands the second one her bottle and she tastes it. The look on her face says that the first girl isn't lying about salt being in the water. She spits it out. \"You're right!\" the second cheerleader cries. \"There IS salt in this!\" The rest of the cheerleaders take out their waterbottles and taste the water in them. Instantly, they spit the foul liquid back out. \"EWWWWWWWWW!!!\" the exclaim in unison. \"Someone's gonna pay for this!\" the first cheerleader yells. She grabs her things and storms out of the room, not even bothering to get dressed into her street clothes. The others follow, still dressed in their gym clothes. Once they're gone, you burst out laughing. After you've had your laugh, you leave the locker room. Now what do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
