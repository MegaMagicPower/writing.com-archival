        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Astro Boy, a super-powerful android with all the powers and strength of a supreme robotic warrior, but the heart and emotion of a peaceful human boy. Created by Dr. Tenma as a robotic reincarnation of his deceased son Tobio and given every bit of cutting edge defense and weapons technology so as to prevent him ever dying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Tenma took to this robo-Tobio for a time, he soon grew dissatisfied with how the android developed to be unlike his son; and of course the fact that as a robot it couldn't grow. As such he abandoned his creation in a display of cruelty and vanished from society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobo-Tobio would be discovered later by Tenma's old associate Dr. Ochanomizu (Dr. O'shay for short, or sometimes Dr. Elefun in reference to his large nose). Upon discovery Dr. Ochanomizu adopted the android as his own and renamed him Astro and taught him the virtues of peace, kindness and justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on Astro used his extraordinary abilities to save people and robots alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive is really for only Astro Boy fans. Each branch will be based on one of the forms of Astro Boy media. Manga, 60's anime, 80's anime, 2003 anime and 2009 movie. Each basically carries on from the end of the official version and it's up to you how they play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't think I need to post rules. Just have fun and make it Astro Boy-ish.</td>",
