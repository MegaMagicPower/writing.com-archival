And even though misery loves company, he had no one to be with. For 48 years of his life, life seemed to play jokes on him. He was always chubby, now becoming fatter, he started balding when he was 26, and whenever he tried, he could never get a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake Matthews was miserable, but he did have one thing. Unknown to Jake, he had a guardian, maybe an angel, or a demon or what have you, but a guardian who cared, making sure that whenever he said things that started with \"I wish..\" he got them. Unfortunately for Jake life was about to play a really strange joke on him indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake slumped down on his couch, groaning as he turned on the tv. He had just gotten back from the eighth interview this week, he had been trying to find a job for a month now, and money was starting to get tight. Jake stared blankly at the tv, the words passing through his ears and lost in a haze. Stress was gripping him, very tightly and he sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA commercial for and exercise machine came on and went through it's usual routine, healthy sexy looking people worked out on the machines and the tagline came on screen. \"Get ready to start a new life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" Jake sighed \"I wish i could have a new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few moments after that everything went black. Jake woke up in a bright well furnished white room, something felt off, and he threw back the sheets and let out a scream, Jake had been changed, and what he saw was an entire new body, complete with new voice, he got his wish, but was he in control, and who was he now?</span></div></div>",

Jake's eyes jolted open, he was in a room he didn't recognize, but before he could take anything in his body threw back the bed sheets and Jake screamed as his new body started moving. His head was now connected to a teenage girl. her curvy body was everything he wanted in a lover when he was in high school. His body walked over to the mirror and he got a good look at her, she stood at 5'4\", with C cup breasts, and lightly tanned skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake didn't understand what was going on, his body moved again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" He screamed, but his body didn't listen. She grabbed a pair of panties and a bra and went to the bathroom. Stripping Jake became aware of every inch of the new body, and how wrong everything felt. She got under the water and he felt the movements of her cleaning herself and finally getting out of the shower and drying off. She walked over to the bedroom again and got dressed, her body hugged by the t-shirt and jeans, she put on her shoes and started walking down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake for his part was scared and confused, he didn't know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has got to be a dream!\" Jake moaned. \"Yeah that's it, a dream, it's all a dream, I'll wake up any minute now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's new body walked into the kitchen where a woman was standing at the sink and washing dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LADY! LADY! YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, but instead of shock, she acted as if everything was normal. \"Good morning honey, did you sleep well?\" Jake just stared at her, and was about to say something, but she interrupted, \"That's great honey, now eat your breakfast, you're a growing girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was dumbfounded as his new body sat down and grabbed a spoonful of cereal, shoving it in his mouth, and his mouth automatically started to chew against his will. Swallowing he gasped, trying to say something and was forced to eat more. It was as if he was just a passenger to this girl's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you and Jeff going out today?\" The woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JEFF? WHO'S JEFF?\" Jake panicked, still trying to grasp what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i do love the outdoors, the fresh air, the scenic views...\" She turned around and winked at him \"The privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jake croaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm just kidding dear, I know you two will wait for a while until you're through college, but I was your age once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a car pulled up and a horn honked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, speak of Casanova, you have fun now.\" Jake's body leaped up and ran out the door to a well built man standing next to his car, before Jake could react, he found his lips locked and his body embracing the man. Jake pulled back after the kiss and to his horror he found his mouth speaking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, we are going to have so much fun!\" Jake spoke not in his voice but int he girl's, and he found himself in the car soon enough.</span></div></div>",

Damn! What had gone wrong now? This time she had been so sure\u2026 Sarah ordered the machine shut down and stepped out of the chamber. The assembled scientists and other staff began to disperse. This had been her life\u2019s work, the focus of her career since she had still been in college. And now that she was so close to seeing it realized, there seemed to be an unlimited number of setbacks waiting to trip her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think the problem is mechanical, or have we miscalculated?\u201d asked Dr. Kim, the project\u2019s second-in-command. Dr. Hyun-sung Kim was a highly motivated, angel-faced scientist from Korea (though her English was flawless) who had joined the project a few years ago and quickly distinguished herself. She was close to Sarah in age and the two had become friends in short order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to check everything.\u201d Frustrating as it was, she couldn\u2019t be too discouraged. They were close, and every try got them closer. And it had taken just a little over ten years to reach this point \u2013 Sarah had been fully prepared to be an old woman before her dream was close to reality, or even to die and trust it to the next generation to complete. Instead, it seemed highly likely that she would make the first inter-universal trip herself before her 37th birthday. Her emotions were a balance of anxiety and pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer team spent the rest of the day double-checking and running various diagnostics, but it was obvious that it would be some time before they could give it another try. Sarah excused herself a couple hours early because she had a gala to attend. It was her hope that she could drum up just a little more support for her project by mingling with the stuffed shirts and bigwigs. As close as they were to a breakthrough, a sudden lack of funds or resources could put the whole thing to an unceremonious end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Sarah was at home and nearly ready to leave for the big event. She had squeezed herself into a little black dress, let her hair down, and was now putting on her earrings in front of the mirror. Looking at her reflected face, she hoped she hadn\u2019t overdone it with the eyeliner. Sarah was naturally very attractive, but her job didn\u2019t let her \u2018gussy up\u2019 very often. It paid to stay in practice, though, as quite a lot of wealthy donors were secretly dirty old men and \u2018feminine charms\u2019 were one advantage she had that many others in her field did not. That was one instance where being a pretty woman was an asset rather than a disadvantage, she supposed.<br>\r\nShe adjusted her breasts. \u201cAlright girls,\u201d she said, \u201clet\u2019s see if you can\u2019t get us another couple thousand.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already in her car when she remembered. On her desk back at the office were some important files that she needed to review overnight. She\u2019d been so distracted by the most recent failure, and by the gala looming ahead that night, that she\u2019d forgotten to take them home. <i>Oh well</i>, she thought, <i>I can swing by work and pick them up on my way to the party. It\u2019s not too far out of my way.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab was empty and dark when she arrived. She unlocked the door and hurried to her office, the click of her high heels echoing in the empty building. She found the files right where she\u2019d left them, but as she turned to leave, she noticed a peculiar sound. Is that\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick peek into the testing chamber confirmed her suspicions. Somehow, the machine had been turned on. <i>What the hell? </i>Everyone knew to make sure that everything was shut down before they left. It was policy to double-check, and to have others check for you as an extra precaution. There wasn\u2019t a single person working on the project that Sarah didn\u2019t trust to be this careful. Could it have possibly turned on by itself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost unconsciously, Sarah started walking towards the device. However it\u2019d gotten turned on, it was clear she\u2019d have to turn it off herself. The machine was between her and the controls, though, and getting close might be dangerous. She stepped carefully, but the machine\u2019s hum was noticeably getting louder with each step she took. By the time she was next to it, still with half the distance to cross to reach the \u2018off\u2019 switch, the hairs on the back of her neck were standing up from a noticeable charge in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah decided to make a break for the switch. The humming was getting louder and louder, and there was a noticeable ionization smell. As she kicked off her shoes and broke into a run, a light started shining from the device. It was only a couple more feet, but the light would reach her before then. The light, now blindingly bright, washed over her with her hand just inches from the switch. Sarah\u2019s body went numb, and her vision went white \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of light faded, revealing the machine alone in a dark room. The machine powered down by itself, and all was quiet again. On the floor between the device and its control console was a pair of discarded high-heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then it all came rushing back. <i>Last night... the machine...where am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she realized that she was in a bed. Her first thought was hospital bed, but a quick glance around told Sarah she was not in a hospital room. This was a private bedroom, but not one she'd ever seen before. Had somebody found her unconscious at the lab and taken her to their house? That didn't make any sense. Why wouldn't they just call an ambulance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted in the bed to get a better look at the room she was in. As she moved, she realized that something felt very strange. There was a peculiar feeling in her body from the neck down - not quite a tingling, or any other sensation she could easily describe, but there was a definite sense that something was...off.

It didn\u2019t even look like anything she owned \u2013 which sort of made sense, in a weird way: after all, this was a room she didn\u2019t recognize, either. Had she been kidnapped? In the back of her mind there was a feeling of foreboding, but right now she had to get her bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her body, there was something else that seemed out of place. She had no idea what that might be, but there was a distinct sense of wrongness. Had something\u2026been <i>done</i> to her? She debated calling out, but worried that whoever had moved her \u2013 and <i>undressed</i> her \u2013 might not be someone she\u2019d want to meet. Sarah put her thoughts toward escaping. There was a window across from the bed that looked out onto a suburban neighborhood. From the looks of it, it seemed like she was on the second story. There was a tree right outside \u2013 Sarah wasn\u2019t the most athletic person, but she figured she could probably climb down it if she had to. Should she risk taking the time to get dressed first? Sarah crept to the door and put her ear to it, listening for any indication that there were other people in the house. It was quite to her shock that the voice she heard came from behind her, in the same room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah spun around, heart pounding. She was sure she\u2019d been alone in the room. Had there been someone else in here, hiding?

What\u2026what are you <i>wearing</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kim was standing in the bathroom door, staring at her desperately confused colleague. She appeared to be wearing a simple white nightgown, but underneath that was what seemed to be some sort of skin-tight brown bodysuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah!\u201d Kim\u2019s stare broke into a huge smile, like someone seeing an old friend for the first time in years. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve finally found you!\u201d Before Sarah could even react, Kim ran forward and embraced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026OK,\u201d Sarah was able to blurt out. \u201cYou seem like you know what\u2019s going on here. Which makes one of us.\u201d As her friend hugged her she couldn\u2019t help but notice how odd her \u2026weird bodysuit felt. It was just like skin.<br>\r\nKim\u2019s demeanor turned serious. \u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember before you woke up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe device! I came back to get some papers on my way to the party, and it was already on! When I went to go shut it down, it went off, and then\u2026 then I woke up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked thoughtful. \u201cI see. Some people on the team thought you had activated it yourself, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid like that. Well, let me tell you what we know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably already guessed, but the machine works. You\u2019ve successfully shifted into an alternate reality. For you this only happened last night, but on our end it\u2019s been months. I went after you as soon as we were sure it was safe, but it took a while to hunt you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. It hadn\u2019t actually occurred to her initially that the device had actually worked, but she was glad to learn that she hadn\u2019t been kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the process of dimensional translocation doesn\u2019t work exactly as we had expected, though,\u201d said Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d asked Sarah. Waking up in a strange bed in her underwear had already tipped her off to that fact, but she was hoping Kim could enlighten her further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, our expectation was that the entire body would make the shift. Apparently that was not the case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked surprised. \u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t noticed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was becoming agitated again. \u201cNoticed what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy way of explanation, Kim gestured at her own body. Sarah stared blankly for a second before she noticed the pores and minute hairs on what she had previously assumed was a bodysuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, that\u2019s your <i>skin</i>! What happened??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the issue \u2013 it seems that, rather than being transported as predicted, you are somehow inserted into someone else\u2019s body and life. The body I\u2019m currently occupying is not my own, as you can see. You might not have noticed because your current host body looks a lot like your original one, but you\u2019re in the same situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you mean \u2013 but \u2013 <i><b>what?</b></i> But your face still looks the same! It\u2019s not even the same color as the rest of your body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d, Kim sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure why or even how, but apparently your head doesn\u2019t change with the body. Though other people don\u2019t seem to notice.\u201d She saw Sarah\u2019s quizzical stare. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve done this more than once. Looking for you. And trust me,\u201d she added, smiling, \u201cyou don\u2019t know how lucky you were to get a body like that on your first try.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her head did look just a tiny bit incongruous, hair and makeup still done up for the party she\u2019d been on her way to. But her body \u2013 it seemed normal enough. Was it really possible? She looked back at Kim, with her pale head on its dark brown body. She looked down at herself. Maybe it was her imagination, but the hue of her skin did seem ever-so-subtly different. And there \u2013 there was a little mole. Sarah didn\u2019t have that mole. She gasped softly. \u201cI need to sit down,\u201d she said, and promptly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 who are we?\u201d Sarah asked, looking over her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can answer that!\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some modifications to the technology, so now we can pinpoint where a person comes through \u2013 and who they end up as. It took a while to find you, as I said, but now that we have we won\u2019t lose you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, but it doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body\u2019s name is Jocelyn McAllister. She\u2019s 22 and going through beauty school to be a hairdresser. I\u2019m currently her roommate, Donna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWild\u2026 So this body\u2019s 22, huh? I guess I should feel younger or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, you\u2019re quite lucky to have this body. You can\u2019t imagine some of the bodies I went through looking for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d Sarah suddenly realized something that had been bothering her. \u201cHang on a second. If our machine was supposed to facilitate travel between dimensions, how did I end up teleported onto someone else\u2019s body instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you did travel between dimensions. Or universes, I should say. We\u2019re both in an alternate reality right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Sarah was pleased to learn that the machine had functioned almost correctly. <i>Almost.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I had to go in after you. If you\u2019d remained in the same reality, we could have located you using normal means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, I guess. You mentioned that other people don\u2019t notice that your head and body don\u2019t match?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. Apparently everyone sees you as being your host. So this world should perceive you as Jocelyn McAllister, with nothing unusual. We aren\u2019t sure why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah thought. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible that we created a new reality, one in which I\u2019ve always been this person. That would explain what happened to the real Jocelyn \u2013 she didn\u2019t exist until now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting theory, but we can\u2019t be sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a lot to research. How are we going to get back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s face had a pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we going to get back?\u201d Sarah repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026That\u2019s the problem. <b>I</b> can go back, but I didn\u2019t go in at the same time as you. We still don\u2019t know how to get <b>you</b> out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lump formed in Sarah\u2019s throat. \u201cBut,\u201d Kim continued quickly, \u201cnow that we know where you are, I can check in on you any time and keep you updated on our progress! There\u2019s hope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute Sarah said nothing. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do in the meantime?\u201d She finally asked. \u201cDo I just pretend to be this Jocelyn person?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to you, I guess. If you do, I can help you out with information about her.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sarah felt a little embarrassed to be seen in only her (well, <b>someone\u2019s</b>) underwear, but that couldn\u2019t really be helped under the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah! It is you! Oh God, I\u2019m so glad we found you! I\u2019d hug you if I could, but that\u2019s not really an option\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah squinted in confusion. Every new development was only bringing a host of new questions. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d she repeated. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s look of joy faded. \u201cActually, I was hoping you could tell me.\u201d Seeing Sarah\u2019s blank look, she continued. \u201cSarah, you\u2019ve been missing for a year. The day after you\u2019d last been seen, we came in to find evidence that the machine had been used. We came to the conclusion that you\u2019d used it on your own, but we couldn\u2019t figure out why. Do you remember anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t use it myself\u201d, Sarah said, trying to get her memories in order. \u201cI\u2026I came back to the lab because I forgot something, and it was already on. I tried to turn it off, but\u2026 there was a flash, and\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, did you say a <i><b>year</b></i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s how long it took us before we were ready to send someone after you. I insisted on being the one to go. We were able to pinpoint the first place you\u2019d gone in the inter-dimensional time stream, and they sent me there. So we\u2019ve both come to the same place, but from a year apart. That\u2019s space-time travel for you.\u201d She smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was about to say something, but Kim continued. \u201cListen, Sarah\u2026 there\u2019s more.\u201d Her tone was ominous. \u201cWhen you activated \u2013 I mean, when <i>the machine</i> was activated, you were phased into an alternate reality. In this timestream, you don\u2019t exist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not you. You\u2019ve shifted into someone else\u2019s life. According to my analysis, your name is Jocelyn McAllister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sarah ran over to the mirror on the far wall. The face reflected was clearly her own. \u201cBut I still look like me\u2026Wait. What on Earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking herself over in the floor-length mirror, Sarah realized what the strange feeling from earlier had been. Below her neck, her body was a noticeably different skin tone, and there was a birthmark on her hip that she\u2019d never seen before. Looking all over, she was starting to see that every part of her body was subtly different somehow \u2013 longer fingers, more muscular legs, a better bust \u2013 this wasn\u2019t her body at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly <i>shit</i>!\u201d Sarah cried, overcome with wonder. From the neck up, she was still Sarah Thierau. Her face was still made up from last night, and her hair still looked freshly shampooed. She was even wearing the same earrings she\u2019d put on before she\u2019d left for the gala \u2013 the gala she\u2019d never gotten the chance to actually go to. Her head was still exactly as it had been \u2018last night\u2019, when she\u2019d been caught up in the malfunctioning device. But below the neck, she was Jocelyn McAllister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seeing this?\u201d she asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly is incredible,\u201d Kim responded. \u201cTemporo\u2026spatial\u2026 Cranial\u2026 Substitution? I don't know <i>what</i> to call it. This goes beyond anything we expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you look like this? You look like you have your normal body still.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not physically here. This is just a projection, that only you can see. It took a few months of tweaking to make something like this possible, but we thought it might be safer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sat down on the bed. She (and Kim) were without a doubt the first human beings to ever be in this situation. So why did it seem so familiar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d she asked her friend\u2019s hologram.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know anything about this woman! What\u2019s my job now, if I even have one? Am I married? Do I have kids? I \u2013 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kim calmly interrupted her. \u201cAccording to our data, Jocelyn is a hairdresser. She has a boyfriend but was never married.

She was just walking through a short cut to get home and spotted a strange looking hole. There were weird noises coming through it and Chelsea was just curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took a peek and saw what seems to be a portal. She sticks her head into it, but suddenly felt like she was being pulled into it. Her head slowly detach itself and it wasn't bloody at all. It was just a clean neck stump. Chelsea felt numb from the neck below and her head then descends into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god I'm falling! And why can't I feel my hands, or legs, or a body for that matter?\", asked Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea looks below herself and saw that she was only a head. She screamed on top of her lungs, well she would if she had any. She fell further into the hole and suddenly it stopped. Chelsea then suddenly had a familiar feeling from below her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a body again, but something is not right.\", said Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her hands and then the rest of her body and discovers that its not her's. Chelsea panics a bit and ran to a more private place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this technically count as robbing because I have no idea what's going on? In fact, where is the original head?\", said Chelsea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ends up seeing the original head of the body holding onto or biting onto her pants. The head looked at the girl and then screamed at the sight of Chelsea having her body. The head dropped and it freaked Chelsea out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Chelsea's head teleported again and her head fell through the same hole. The body she was occupying then had the head of a man. This could mean that Chelsea then has a body that she wished she never had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I have a guy's body!\", cried Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hid again and observed herself more. She checks her chest and it was pretty average, but what's in her pants scared her a bit. She now has a dick. She pokes it and it made her feel strange. She stopped and pulls her pants back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to know what's going on and get back to my old body.\", said Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out and acted normal. She hopes that no one discovers that she is a girl with a guy's body. She walked casually, but sweats at the same time. She finally reached to the short cut that she was at and found her headless body trying to look for a head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea tries pulling her head off, but couldn't. She then waited for her head to teleport again, but nothing is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Of all the times I need to teleport, let it be now.\", said Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited and nothing happens. She then heads home with her body. Her parents are out in a business trip so she's safe somewhat. She was about to put the keys to the door until her head teleported again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why now?\", cried Chelsea as her head teleported again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time her head was swapped with a globe model. She was practically stuck and then a man appears and act as if he is expecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's where the energy source came from. My ultimate magnet worked.\", said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\", asked Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little bodiless friend, have you found a strange portal around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at that shortcut near outside of the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eureka! You helped me find a warping hole. Its a hole that has strange teleporting properties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your telling me that I have teleporting powers with my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well based on your state, you'll probably won't have control of it and will forever head swap with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to stop this?\", asked Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well soon. For now, good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way what's your...\", asked Chelsea, but she teleported before she could get the guy's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's head fell through a portal again.

That is until a scientist wabts to take a look into the lives of flys...on a more physical note. The scientist creates a machine that when two different specimens are in it it will create a rift between the minds that allows one of the specimens to kinda spectate the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist captures you and puts you in one of the machines, you start to freak out as you try to escape but are trapped by the glass. The scoentost get in the other half and says, \"for Science!\" And presses the button and soon your body starts to feel crushed and you then find yourself in the body of the scientist.... in full control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the scientist was a genius but even genius' make mistakes, it appears that the scientist had made a slight error in the coding section which spiraled into changing the programming matrix. It was no longer aspectating machine it was a mind swapping machine! And thanks to that slight miscalculation you could now experience the freedom of having an open mind...if you could stop drooling on the floor, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, your tiny fly brain can barely hold onto the 'basic rules and guidelines for your survival' in your head. How is it going to compensate for the to-do list the scientists body had prepared: after experiment go to grocery store, grab eggs, milk, sugar, flour and cake mix to make celebration cake :), after that go home and relax knowing that you had made a breakthrough in Science today. The best ypur mind could take was to lie down on the floor and drool, that was it's best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you started to learn and grow with every fiber if your brain working its tail off you manage to do a tremendous feat! Lift one finger up and immediately put it down..... hooray! After a painful 6 hours you finqlly manage to get up and walk over to the mirror in the room, you see a beautiful brunette staring blankly back with her mouth open and drool pooling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deduce that this is the scientist who had spent her career trying to understand flys, only to have her body stolen by one. You spend the next hour closing your mouth and swallowing your gulp of saliva that you had made, and walk over to her door, you spend about 20 minutes figuring out doors and how to open but these baby steps would all pay off.... hopefully. You walk out and see many of her coworkers working vigorously, they would say stuff like \"hey Sam\" or \"what up ,girl\" you would simply stare at them, not yet knowing how to respond or talk with words yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the exit and through the parking lot until you get to her car and open the door then sit down. You just let your mind wander a minute and soon a tiny spark of personality pops up in your head, your survival had no need for a personality, so it tries to get rid of it but the newly formed personality wins over survival and creates emotions which teach your primitive brain words. Then the ability of speech is granted to you, then fianlly it escalates all the way to your car which this body just needed a little push to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to speak in her feminine voice while you drive out of the parking lot and onto the parkway. You are going on a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go now (this location depends on your personality)</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">So a while back I discovered the weird world of headswap stories here on Writing.com, and decided that I wanted in. I've always found stories of body-switching to be both frightening and attractive at the same time, and the 'head swap' angle provided an interesting new take that I couldn't resist. So I thought I'd start my own, and see where it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>General Outline</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, the main character finds themselves in a vaguely <i>Quantum Leap</i>-style situation, where they travel from body to body. The exact specifics of how this works and why it happens are up to you. Other characters may end up 'traveling' along with them, if you like. Non-human swaps are also welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are four characters to choose from in the beginning, but you should feel free to create others if you wish. (I try to give equal representation to males and females, as I believe the latter are under-represented in this genre, but that's just me. Create whatever characters you like.) The four starting characters are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake Matthews, 48<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Thierau, 35<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary Martinsberg, 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea Taylor, 16<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I said, there will be options to create other characters, and more could be added to an existing storyline as well. Beyond that, it's pretty much anything goes. See you on the other side (of the link)!</td>",
