Professor Stein then looked at each person's soul, to figure out which weapon/s were compatible with which meister. After that was done, the meisters and weapons were split up, and called up one by one. One such meister was Matthew, a 16 year-old from New Zealand, who was curious as to what weapon he'd be partnered with. He wore his favourite attire; a simple black suit with a silver fern stitched onto each shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew Gavin, please come forward.\" Stein called. Matthew made his way to the front, where Stein told him to wait in the next room for his partner. After a few minutes, Matthew was surprised when two girls entered the room. Both were about the same height, with straberry blode hair, blue eyes, and wearing skirts, simple blouses and berets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonjour.\" they said together, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, so you're both supposed to be my partners?\" Matthew asked politely. The two girls nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui.\" they replied. Matthew walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, I haven't introduced myself. Matthew Gavin, from Auckland, New Zealand.\" he told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Matthew.\" the girl on the left replied. \"My name is Francoise, and this is my sister, Chelsea. We are from Paris, France.\" Francoise told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you two. We should probably head to class now.\" he suggested, Francoise and Chelsea noded, as the trio headed for their first class.</span></div></div>",

As they looked for a place to sit, they were approached by a blonde girl with pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be the new students. I'm Maka.\" she said, offering her hand to Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, taht's us. Nice to meet you Maka, I'm Matthew, and this is Francoise and Chelsea.\" Matthew replied, shaking her hand, while the two Frech girls waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have a place to sit, why don't you sit with me and my partner.?\" Maka suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Matthew replied, as they group found their seats. Maka sat down next to a boy with white hair, presumably her partner, who greeted the three new students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so you're the new kids, huh? Name's Soul.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Name's Matthew, the girls are Francoise and Chelsea.\" Matthew replied. Then everyone stopped talking as Professor Stein walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, settle down people.\" Stein told them, before looking up towards Maka. \"Maka, do you know where Black Star is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't seen him yet.' Maka replied, just as a boy with spiky blue hair burst through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late!\" he shouted, before walking up and sitting down behind Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star, if you're going to fight, do it after class next time.\" Stein told the boy, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he always late?\" Matthew asked Maka, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, every day.\" she replied.</span></div></div>",

Matthew realised why Soul and Maka were partners; they were the exact opposite of eah other. Maka was thoughtful and smart, Soul was reckless and a bit headstrong. As the group walked outside, they saw a crowd in the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this about?\" Matthew wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star's probably fighting someone again. He never changes.\" Soul sighed. The group moved through the crowd, to find Black Star fighting a  kid that Matthew didn't recognise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Maka, who's the guy Black Star's fighting?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, him. That's Death the Kid, Lord Death's son.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, interesting. Looks like Black Star's gonna lose.\" Matthew said, just before Kid ended it, leaving Tsubaki to pull Black Star to his feet again. Kid's guns turned back into two in (Matthew's opinion, hot) blonde girls. The three then approached Matthew and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you must be the new students.\" Kid said. Matthew introduced himself and his partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you use two weapons as well. Care to see how good you are?\" Kid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy, Kid? Even Black Star can't beat you.\" Soul asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Soul. Besides, I like a challenge.\" Matthew replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, then Liz! Patty!\" Kid said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" the two girls replied, transforming back into weapon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this. Chelsea! Francoise!\" Matthew called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui!\" replied his partners, transforming. Matthew found himself holding two elegant-looking swords (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs41/i/2009/009/d/7/Weapon_Design__Awaking_Destiny_by_CBJ3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs41/i/2009/0...</a>). Soul whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice weapons.\" he said. Meanwhile, Kid assumed his stance, as the crowd murmured in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" he asked. Matthew assumed his own stance, hold each sword out to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on, Kid.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Kid said, firing at Matthew. The meister swung both swords swiftly, deflecting the shots. Kid used the moment to close in, attacking Matthew, using his pistols as clubs. Matthew guarded, before kicking Kid away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. I can't believe he was able to block those shots.\" Maka gasped. Soul simply nodded in agreement, as the two mesters continued to fight. After a few minutes, Kid backed up, putting some distance between himself and Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, you put up a good fight. Now it's time...to see the power of a Grim Reaper.\" he said, as the dust around him started swirling. Matthew gasped, as he could see Kid's soul expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go! Soul Resonance!\" cried Kid, Liz, and Patty. The two pistols glowed, morphing into large cannons. Kid dropped back onto the ground in a crouch. Matthew prepared himself to guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Execution Mode ready, prepare to die!\" Kid said, as dark lightning coursed around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Resonance stable. Noise at 0.3%.\" came Liz's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Needle Soul Wavelength fully charged!\" Patty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preparing to fire. Feed Back in 4 seconds, 3...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1...\" Liz said. Matthew realised what was coming. A plan quickly formed in his mind. Using his ability to see souls, he waited for the right moment, watching Kid's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firing now!\" Patty said. Kid brought both cannons together, as Matthew tensed his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death Cannon!\" Kid shouted, firing both cannons. Matthew immediately ran forward, towards the two cannon shots. As they came close, Matthew sliced each one with his swords, which absorbed the soul wavelengths, causing them to glow white. The crowd gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Kid gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn. Soul Blade!\" Matthew shouted, swinging both of his swords across in front of him. A curved blade of white energy erupted from each sword. The energy blades struck Kid before he could react, knocking him to the ground. He got up slowly, clearly in pain. Before he could retaliate, Matthew had one of his swords at Kid's neck, the tip barely touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I win.\" Matthew said, before releasing Kid. Matthew and Kid faced each other, as their weapons resumed their human forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, not bad, Matthew. You're pretty skilled already.\" Kid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Francoise cried, wrapping her arms around Matthew. \"Well done, Matthew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks...I guess.\" Matthew replied, slightly taken aback by the sudden display of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Francoise.\" Chelsea said, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sis.\" she replied, letting go. Meanwhile, Stein watched Matthew from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How did he anticipate what Kid was going to do? Even I might've been caught off guard, yet he acted like he knew what would happen. That kid, I'll have to watch him from now on.\"</i> he thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since then Matthew, Chelsea and Fracoise had become good friends with Maka and the others. Kid was extremely happy, mostly because he wasn't the only m,eister with symmetrical weaons anymore. For the most part, Matthew got along best with Kid, both of them preferring a serious approach to their respective missions. Chelsea and Francoise however, really seemed to hit it off with Kid's partners, Liz and Patty. Given that they were two pairs of sisters, they understood each other very well, despite their vastly differing backgrounds.<br>\r\nAt present, Matthewq, Chelsea and Francoise had just returned to the school, following a successful and very profitable mission. They'd been sent to northern Germany to wipe out a small group of Neo-Nazis that were murdering anyone they deemed 'inferior' to them. As a result of the mission, Matthew and his partners managed to collect 20 Kishin Eggs, ten for Chelsea and ten for Francoise. Matthew insisted on this even division, saying that they deserved to become Death Scythes together. As they continued, Matthew turned around to see Tsubaki running towards them. Matthew and the two girls stopped as Tsubaki caught up to them, the weapon panting slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew...I finally found you guys.\" Tsubaki gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsubaki? Is something wrong?\" Matthew asked. Tsubaki looked up at them, her face betraying her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Soul. He and Maka had a mission in Italy but...Soul got badly injured. He's in the medical room right now. Iwas just going there when I saw you guys.\" Tsubaki explained. Matthew and the girls gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he's alright.\" Francoise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Maka?\" Chelsea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's taking it pretty hard. I think she blames herself for what happened.\" Tsubaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous, Soul was just protecting his meister. I know we'd do the same for Matthew if we had to.\" Francoise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. C'mon, we should go see them. Tsubaki, you go on ahead, we'll catch up.\" Chelsea replied. Tsubaki nodded, then ran on ahead, while Matthew, Chelsea and Francoise followed at a brisk walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>DWMA, Medical Room</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived outside the medical room, Matthew and the girls were slightly surprised to see the door had been torn from its hinges, most likely from Black Star's entrance. As Matthew, Chelsea and Francoise entered the room, they saw that Tsubaki and Black Star were already there. Tsubaki was standing beside Maka next to Soul's bed, while the other was occupied by an unconsciouss Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ugh, he must've gotten Maka-chopped again.\"</i> Matthew thought. \"Hey Maka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys.\" Maka replied, her voice lacking its usual energy. Matthew and the girls quickly picked up on it, moving over to stand next to Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maka, it's not your fault. Don't beat yourself up over it.\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea's right, Maka. Sould did what he did to keep you safe. It's what any weapon would do for their meister.\"Francoise reassured her. Maka looked up at them, smiling now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Pas de probl\u00e8me.(No problem.)\" the French twins replied. as another set of footsteps entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, what happened to the door?\" the newcomer asked, causing everyone (apart from those unconsciouss) to look towards the voice's source. Matthew didn't recognise the person at all. She wore a black dress with two white arrows crossed over the waistline, with a white labcoat ocer the top. Her hair was a dirty blonde, with two strips braided together over her chest. \"From the looks of it things have been lively in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dr Medusa.\" Maka greeted. Meanwhile, Matthew eyed the woman carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hm, something feels off about her. Maybe my Soul Perception can help.\" </i>Matthew thought, silently activating his hidden talent. Immediately, the souls of the other people in the room were visible. Maka, Tsubaki, Soul, Black Star, and the girls' souls appeared normal, but where Medusa should've had a human soul, Matthew was shocked to see the distinctive purple-hued soul of a witch. He let out a gasp, causing the others to look at him in confusion. \"Oh, sorry. Bad memory.\" he said, hoping to cover up his reaction. the others seemed to by it, causing Matthew to sigh mentally in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Matthew, what's wrong?\"</i>Chelsea asked mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't worry about it now. I'll tell you about it afterwards.\"</i> Matthew replied, smiling. He and the girls had recently discovered that they were able to talk with each other using their soul waves. They had yet to let anyone else know about their newfound ability, but it came in handy on a few occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Dr Medusa, are you here to check on Soul?\" Matthew asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be Matthew. Dr Stein told me about you a while ago, he said you're quite the skilled meister. But no answer your question, Miss Maka?\" Medusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it?\" Maka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do me a favour and help me out with your father? I can't get him off my leg.\" Medusa explained. Everyone, including the now consciouss Black Star, looked down to see Spirit clinging to Dr Medusa's leg. In seconds, Maka delivered a powerful Maka-chop to his head, knocking him out cold. Black Star unceremoniously dumped Spirit on the spare bed that he'd just vacated, while Maka glared at her father, her eyes twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Matthew asked Chelsea and Francois to come with him, so that they could talk privately. After reaching one of the balconies, he turned to face his partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you finally gonna tell us what happened back there, partenaire?(partner)\" Chelsea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\" Matthew replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donc d\u00e9p\u00eachez-vous ! (So hurry up!)\" Francois exclaimed. Matthew sighed, before explaining to them what he'd seen back in the medical room. The twins were shocked when he told them the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, does this mean Dr Medusa is a witch?! Mon dieu!(My God!)\" Chelsea exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but we can't just attack her. If I'm wrong, we'll be in big trouble with Lord Death. If I'm right, we'll be up against a powerful witch. Neither is really that good. For now, let's just keep a close eye on Dr Medusa.\" Matthew replied.</span></div></div>",

Soul had recovered enough to attend classes again, while Maka was back to her usual energetic self, having gotten over her mild bout of depression. Matthew, Chelsea and Francoise had kept a close eye on Medusa every day, but so far had yet to gather any concrete evidence. However, Matthew's Soul Perception had never been wrong before, so he knew the right moment would eventually present itself to him. Tonight there was a big formal party to celebrate the founding of the DWMA by Lord Death at the school itself. Maka and the others had already arrived, but were still waiting on Matthew, Chelsea and Francoise to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's taking them so long.\" Maka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" Soul replied. \"For all we know, they're already inside.\" The others were about to answer when they heard someone call out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, sorry we're late!\" Matthew shouted, as the group turned in the direction of his voice. As soon as they did, their jaws all practically hit the floor. Matthew was dressed immaculately, wearing a formal James Bond-style black suit, but that wasn't what they others were really staring at. Chelsea and Francoise both looked like they'd gotten ready for a movie premiere; both had let their hair down, which reached to about mid-back for both sisters, while each wore a tight-fitting royal blue dress that beautifully accentuated their figures. They also wore white gloves that went up to their biceps, with royal blue 2 inch high heeled shoes. In short, both girls were absolutely stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you two look so beautiful!\" Liz and Tsubaki squealed, causing the French twins to blush profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you do realise you're gonna have to fend off every other guy in that place, right?\" Soul asked. Matthew shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, I can't help it if my partners are both beautiful and deadly, weapon or human.\" he replied, causing Chelsea and Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s blushes to deepen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Oh Matthew, vous \u00eates trop doux!(Oh Matthew, you're too sweet!)\" Francoise replied, hugging her meister. After she released him, which was a good five minutes later, the now quite large group made their way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>DWMA Ballroom, two hours later</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Matthew, anything yet?\"</i> Francoise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, not yet. Be patient, we need to wait for the right moment.\"</i> Matthew replied. Right from the start of the party, Matthew and his partners made sure that at any one time at least one of them was within earshot of Dr. Medusa, hoping that something would pop up to confirm his suspicions. As yet, nothing significant had happened, but Matthew wasn't deterred. Suddenly, he heard a shout come from the main entrance to the ballroom. The three turned to find Sid crouched against the wall, bleeding badly despite his zombie physique. Stein and the others rushed over, while Matthew wondered what this meant. Suddenly, he felt Medusa's wavelength spike, a clear sign of heightened awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's planning something, but what?\"</i> Matthew wondered. Suddenly, the entire room began shaking violently; not enough to knock people off their feet, but still powerful nonetheless. Out of the corner of his eye, Matthew spotted Medusa rushing towards the balcony, confirming his fears. Matthew broke into a run, knowing that he had to stop the potential witch from escaping. Just as Medusa reached the balcony edge, Matthew managed to grab her around the waist, throwing her back into the room, just as a green glowing barrier sealed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, witch.\" Matthew said, as Chelsea and Fran\u00e7oise hurried over. Matthew noticed that Maka, Soul, Black Star, Tsubaki, Death the Kid, Liz &amp; Patti, Stein and Spirit were missing. <i>\"Good, at least someone managed to get out.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean.\" Medusa replied, putting on her innocent nurse facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't fool me, Medusa. I've seen your soul, and I know a witch soul when I see one.\" Matthew replied. \"Besides, once I kill you, everyone'll see what you truely are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really attack a teacher...based on a hunch?\" Medusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more than just a hunch. Chelsea, Fran\u00e7oise!\" Matthew shouted, seconds later, he felt the familiar weight of his twin swords in his hands, then charged Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No choice. Soul Protect, release.\" Medusa muttered, releasing her magical power. The sudden rush of energy startled everyone including Lord Death, who all turned to see Matthew facing a powerful witch, Medusa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, looks like I was right.\" Matthew said, pre[paring himself for what he knew would be a tough fight. Based on her soul wavelength, Medusa was probably the worst witch to have to face single-handed, but Matthew had faith in his partners and his own abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew, I must stop you now! You're not ready to face a witch as powerful as this!\" Lord Death exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Death, trust me. I know I can handle this.\" Matthew replied, before attacking Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, so reckless. Vector Arrow!\" Medusa shouted, as numerous black arrows streamed out from her, aiming for Matthew. Matthew reacted swiftly, spinning around while slicing through each arrow with his swords. One arrow managed to get through, slicing through the shoulder of his suit, but without breaking the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do better than that! Soul Blade!\" Matthew shouted, sending the same attack he'd used when he first fought Kid. Medusa dodged it easily, but was caught off guard by Matthew, who slashed at with both blades. The witch managed to escape, while sustaining a shallow cut to her left arm. Medusa immediately retaliated, sending ten times as many arrows towards Matthew. Matthew quickly ran through his options, before crossing his swords in front of him, forming a soul wavelength barrier, which easily deflected the arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, you certainly are persistent. But now I think it's time to get rid of you. Analysis Disassemble!\" Medusa shouted, sending another group of arrows, but these arrows glowed white. They struck Matthew's shield, but didn't bounce away. The arrows slowly began to dig into the shield, causing it to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn, we're out of options! Chelsea, Francoise, we have to resonate now!\"</i> Matthew thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Que?! But we haven't tried it yet! Who knows if it'll work?!\"</i> Chelsea replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Even so, we have to try! It's our only chance!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Le droit, le faisons!(Right, let's do it!)\"</i> Chelsea and Francoise replied. Matthew quickly broke off, letting Medusa's arrows fly past him. He landed a few metres away, assuming his usual stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Let's go, Soul Resonance!\"</b></i> The three partners shouted. Matthew's soul waves flashed around him, as the three souls began to resonate with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Medusa exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Legendary Superskill of the Sword Meister: XIII Blades!\" Matthew shouted, releasing his two swords. They floated around him in a circle, forming eleven more blades from their combined soul waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't help you!\" Medusa shouted, attacking again. Matthew smirked as the arrows closed in. As soon as they got close he raised his arm towards them. The thirteen blades around him shot in front of him, deflecting the arrows away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Medusa gasped. Matthew pointed his arm towards the witch sending the blades flying towards her. Medusa tried to dodge, but the blades matched her every move. Eventually, Medusa was caught, taking blows to her torso, legs and arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time to end this! Dancing Blades!\" Matthew yelled. In rapid succession, each blade slashed at Medusa, inflicting grievous wounds. Matthew charged forward, grabbing his two swords again, before slicing Medusa in two, right through the chest. The witch smiled slightly, before her body swirled away, leaving her glowing purple soul hovering in the air. Matthew released his swords, allowing Chelsea and Francoise to return to their human forms. The other students started whispering and talking amongst themselves, in awe of the fact that Matthew had just defeated a witch single-handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, well done, you three! Never in the DWMA's history has someone defeated a witch so early!\" Lord Death exclaimed, clearly impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
