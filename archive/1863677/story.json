You begin to shiver because of the cold water and somewhat chilly air he sees this and sets up a camp and makes a fire. And sits you near it to warm you up as you are soon feeling warmer you then proceed to walk over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says \"How you feeling warmer I hope?\" \"Eevee.\" And you run u to him giving him several nice licks across the cheek he slowly and gently pushes you away he then says \"Well... Someone is apparently thanking me for the help... I guess in the morning we will part ways.\" You simply run up and hug him as much as an eevee can he sees this and asks \"Seems your growing attached to me, So little girl as I see would you like to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes brighten up as you run over tackling him and muzzle him finally saying \"Eevee Eve.\" And proceed to lick him again as he slowly pulls you off his face this time and gives you a hug as you hug him back as much as an Eevee can. He then pulls out a luxury ball... Meant to foster friendship quicker than other pok\u00e9balls even though you were getting closer already he taps your head softly. As you are in the ball it is very cozy for a pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like this is expected for luxury balls. As he soon pulls you out of the pokeball you see him in a sleeping bag as he says \"Thought you might want to sleep with your new trainer...\" \"Vee.\" And proceed to run to him and tackle him a third time as he says \"Some one has an energetic personality. Come here... What should I call you... Amber?\" You shake your head \"Hmmm... Holly?\" Nope. \"Angelica... Nah too long Tiffiny... Still a little long... I got it Eve!\" You like this name as you say \"Eevee Eve.\" And nuzzle him as he pulls you closer he soon proceeds to hug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both lay together inside the sleeping bag by the fire. In the morning you are the first on up you go get a drink of water and walk over to his belt and counted 1...2...3... And press the button releasing his typhlosion and ask it to light another fire as you were cold. It replies \"Sure no problem I don't blame you for being cold.\" He then makes a fire with his flamethrower after doing that presses the button non his pok\u00e9ball you soon go sit near the fire then decide to lay down near... Ummm... He never told you his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really care at the moment frankely your still a bit tired and lay down in the sleeping bag by his head and torso.   </span></div></div>",

You see that this Charizard is ginormous and you start shaking a what it looks like. Your mother just stares at the Charizard and then uses flamethrower. The Charizard takes a couple of steps back like it didn't do much to harm it it attacks your mother back by using slash, this hurts your mother but then your mother attacks it back with slash but this is a critical hit that is done to the Charizard.

You get scared as your mother is no where in sight. You stare at the girl blankly and then the Charizard. You don't notice that the girl stepped closer to you but then you walk back slowly and start getting faster. You see this girl was smart and knew to come after you because she knew that you were the off spring of this Ninetails. You reach the end of the cave and its starting to get a little to hot for you. You start shaking thinking of where you will go if this girl throws that ball at you.

You all had time to relax as you snuggle close to Jaden. \"You feeling clingy. I undrstand that you lived alone and always on the move but this is a little close.\" \"Please, Jaden i just want to be close to you...\" Giving him some sad eyes that as he looks into he sees your pain from the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you have been through a lot...\" \"How do you know this exactly?\" \"I can see into pokemon memories...\" \"Does anyone else know this?\" \"No and I would prefere it to stay that way.\" \"I can keep that a secret Jaden, but i must be able to be close to wheni feel so.\" \"Deal I don't want anyone questioning me about it.\" \"I promise Jaden.\" And you both lay down for a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning you are still asleep as Jaden slippes away to take a shower. \"Jaden...\" Reaching for him but not finding him you wake up. \"Where is Jaden?\" You hear water running and a slight humming that sounds fimiliar. \"Oh, he is taking a what is it the humans call it? I can't remember as i have never had a trainer before... I have heard people talking.\" He walks out fully dressed and hair fluffed like you had seen yesterday. \"Oh your up! Well good morning.\" \"Good morning Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all got some supplies as you all head into the gym... *I will prove myself to him here!* The gym leader stand on a field. \"Welcome Trainer this is the Fighting gym you are here to challenge me right?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"Then let's begin are you going to start off with Gardevoir who is not that bad...\" You blush a scarlet hue. \"Voir...\" Jaden turns to you. \"You want to go first?\" You nod and rush forward. he summons a machoke... \"Machoke!\" You ready yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trainer get's first move...\" \"Ok Gardevoir use Pyschic.\" Your eyes glow green as the mahoke is enveloped in a green Aura where you lift him before ramming him into the ground several times. \"Machoke... Use Seismic Toss.\" \"Gardevoir... Teleport!\" \"Voir.\" just before he grabs you, you teleport just behind him. \"Now Mirrow Move.\" You grab him before launching into the air and slamming him into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust clears to show Machoke had fainted. \"Machoke is Unable to battle. Gardevoir wins.\" \"Gardevoir can you go on?\" You think and nod. \"Ok. I believe in you...\" The next Pokemon he summons is a Makuhita. \"Use Giga Impact!\" \"Use Protect.\" The attack bounces off. \"Mirror Coat.\" You summon a barrier to reflect 1/4 damage of special moves damage. \"Brick Break!\" \"That will undo my Mirror Coat.\" You teleport but before you do the Barrier breaks. \"I was too slow.\" You suddenly decide to use your hidden Power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole body glows as does the opponent's... the body of his start to glitch someone like it is fading. \"What move is that?\" \"Mirage Away.\" The pokemon then faints as it become solid again. \"Makuhita is unable to battle that means the wiiner is Jaden.\" You run over to Jaden and hug him before fainting in his arms from exhaustion. Next thing you know you wake up ona bed which you recognize as the bed at the pokemon center. \"Where am I?\" \"Were back at the pokemon center you fainted from exhaustion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did strain myself pretty hard I guess I wanted to impress you, but instead just drained myself.\" \"Awe, it's ok you didnt have to battle them both.\" \"I know i wanted to though to prove myself worthy of your command.\" \"You are my very special close Gardevoir.\" \"Thank you Jaden.\" Blushing a scarlet hue. \"I got to go take a shower.\" \"Ok, see you in a little bit.\" So you lay back down and fall asleep on the bed. \"Gardevoir... Dinner time.\" \"Oh, ok.\" You both head downstairs for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sit down and eat as you quietly eat you pokemon food which you really had had nothing like before having eaten berries then chased by angry pokemon... you like being safe and close to Jaden. *I am so lucky to have Jaden in my life... I was so lonely and have never had any real friends as I was always on the move.* Jaden looks over to see you lost in thought. \"Everything ok Gardevoir?\" \"Huh? Oh yeah everything is fine...\" Blushing. \"Well, eat up I dont want my pokemon to go hungry during battles.\" \"Yes, Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to eat again as you all finish you head upstairs and lay on the floor not sure as you has always slept on the ground. \"What are you doing?\" \"Sleeping is something wrong?\" \"Yeah, why are you sleeping on the ground?\" \"I have always slept like this while on the move...\" \"Make's sense as you had no real place to stay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here come sleep with me...\" You blush suddenly. \"Um... you mean it?\" \"Yeah I dont want my pokemon to sleep on the floor.\" You get up and walk over and lay down by him saying \"What is this it is comfy i have never experienced something like this?\" \"It's called a bed.\" \"Interesting are they always here?\" \"Yeah lt?\" \"Yeah can I sleep in it with you more often?\" \"Yeah, it is better than sleeping on the floor. We will camp out sometimes.\" \"Camp out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain that later. right now let's sleep.\" \"Ok Jaden.\" You both lay down on the bed where you fall into a peaceful slumber with some dreams. *What is this feeling? It is around Jaden...* *It feels like a fuzzy feeling...* *What is this feeling? It is strange i have never experienced it before.* You feel a slight shaking... \"Gardevoir wake up...\" \"Huh?\" \"Breakfast time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ok then.\" *Yawn* You slowly rise from the bed with out feeling any pain as you have from sleeping on the cold hard ground. \"I haven't slept that well in years.\" \"Did you enjoy it?\" \"Yes very much so...\" You walk up to Jaden and kiss his cheek. \"Thank you for letting me sleep with you.\" You both blush at what you had done. \"I feel fuzzy...\" \"Fuzzy how?\" \"I feel all fuzzy when ever I am around you... I think i have feeling for you...\" Blushing again.</span></div></div>",
