As you walk towards the town, you are given a few strange looks. Then you make your way to the bar and once you enter, you see it is lightly packed with people. Most wearing the usual outfit, a standard brown/tannish jacket, and some pants, maybe accompanied by a pair of goggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way up to the front, you're greeted by the bartender; a young girl, maybe 18 years old, with dirty blonde hair and dark, tanned skin. <br>\r\n\"Good evening sir, what'll it be today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some water is fine,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around, you see two girls at a table in the corner staring at you; one of them is a skinny middle aged women with dark red hair, and the other is a pale brunette, who is about the same age as her friend. When you see them, they don't break the stare so you look away, you don't want any trouble already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, you notice the two girls who were staring at you go up to the bartender and whisper something in her ear, as they smile. Then they exit the bar, giving you a a strange grin as they leave. You look away confused; what were they so happy about? Why did they look at me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your train of thought is interrupted as the bartender comes with your water.<br>\r\n\"Your water, sir.\" She says, handing you the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You reply, gulping the whole thing in one drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey here must have made you really thirsty, you thought, and... tired?

Does that tickle?\" She teases you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she starts to add in a few soft bites to your toes, followed by some licks and kisses.

One look at your buyers and you can tell they're bandits, who are never so brazen to attack Tickle Town but are still allowed to trade within its rusty walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first has on a leather and chain jacket, tight hide pants jangling with chains and trophies, and biking gloves on. Much of her skin is bared to keep away the heat, but her skin is still pale even in the sun. Her head is half-shaved, with unevenly shorn pink hair falling down the unshaven side. The other woman wears a long, coarse cloak with the hood down, leather kneepads and combat boots. A head of unkempt black hair flows out from above her ragged clothing and tan, pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloaked bandit grabs your chain (a collar with a chain on it has been attached to your neck so you don't run from the auction) and pulls you along, out of the gate to the road beyond the town's scrap metal walls. The pink haired woman keeps you moving along with a teasing poke in the side if you stumble, which you do often owing to your bound hands and the rough, dirty ground. <i>What is it with tickle torture after the apocalypse?</i> you think to yourself. Gradually the hanging lights and sounds of humanity move away from you as you and the bandits move away from Tickle Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road runs east away from the \"civilized\" Tickle Town, through what was once the rural suburbs of a town long ago. Nothing approaches you as you walk among the abandoned houses, probably out of fear of your two captors/buyers/owners, but you see strangely clad figures with torches and flashlights scramble away or peer closer at the three of you as you make your way towards wherever you're heading. Are the figures mutants? Scavengers? Tribals? Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you come to what was once a walled off roofed mall. The windows on the bottom floors have been smashed out and covered with metal, and the only entrance is a hand cranked lift guarded by several bandits on a scrap balcony above. The mall is now a raider den, no doubt teeming with crazed and greedy rogues. You can hear sporadic laughter echoing within the building to the sound of yells and cheers, which grows louder as the male guard at the gate's crank recognizes the slaver scouts and lets you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you are pulled by the mall's interior second floor balcony, peering down into what was the pavilion. It's been dug into and built up to resemble a fenced off fighting pit, with throngs of raiders cheering for the tickling carnage going on in the ring. Then the cloaked woman pulls you into a side room, where a middle ranking bandit leader looks at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" she says, inspecting your sweat covered body closely, \"What to do with you...shall he/she be a tickle slave for one of our comrades? Perhaps a fighter in the arena? Or maybe we have use for an extra body in the supply runs. The raider official turns back to the pink haired and cloaked bandits who bought you after she makes up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kath! Lilah! Take this filthy runt...</span></div></div>",

As you trod up some stairs, you see a rusted door, that has probably been worn down for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In there should be some water you can use to clean yourself off.\" She says pointing to the door, \"You got five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you walk out, as clean as you've ever been since the whole apocalypse started. Then you notice your skin feels more sensitive as the the bandits grab hold of you, and you are starting to have second thoughts on how well you should have cleaned yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you are brought into another room, and upon entering you notice it's huge! Then, you realize this must be the fighting pits! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving your surroundings you notice it's more of a stadium, with sandy covered ground, rather than a simple ring; which is what you had expected. You also notice the many bandits cheering at the ongoing fight- a young man, who you assume is a slave, and a red-haired girl, who you also think is a slave, based on their ragged clothing, and dirtiness. You also can't help but notice how intense the fight is; the girl seems to be winning, as she has the man pinned down with her legs, and is poking at his armpits, causing him to die with laughter, as the crowd follows along joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstonished with how seriously they seem to be taking the fight, you are brought into a side room, where you see many other slaves chat with each other, while they wait their turn. Then the bandits who brought you in pull you aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you probably already know what you're going to be doing, based off of what you've already seen.\" The hooded bandit says, \"But let me explain what you're going to be doing exactly; you're going to go into the pits, and have a tickle fight- right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, following along with what she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's also some other things you need to know. Depending on how long you last, you will be in there for no more than an hour, and there are no rules, anything goes. Tools, and other things such as feathers, tickle oil, and rope will also be distributed during the match to give both fighters a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when will I start?\" You reply, feeling a slight touch of anxiety, due to your deathly ticklish body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired bandit looks at a written list, \"Ah!

You've also heard they have various other traits, that give them the upper hand against their opponents and that they are merciless brutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems you've got a challenge ahead of you.\" She says, giggling sadistically., \"Oh, and your match starts in a few minutes, be ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of mental preparation, you're ready to accept your ticklish demise; after all how could you, a wasteland scavenger stand a chance against a superhuman brute?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok kid, you're up!\" One of the bandits yells into the room, as you're pushed out into the pit. Noticing your surroundings, you see many different things, high hilltops, wooden fences and posts. You then think to yourself that you might be able to use the hilltops as higher ground to overpower your opponent. You also remember the bandits talk about tools like ropes and restraints, which you could use to your advantage, since you won't win with raw strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear a door from the other side of the pit open and you see what the mutant herself. She seems to be the direct opposite of what you had envisioned a mutant to be, based off of what you've heard. She had looked like any other normal person; she was fairly skinny and had dusty tanned skin, with crimson hair, and white eyes, accompanied by regular ragged dark leather clothes, and a brown scarf. She looks towards you and gives you a threatening look, opening her mouth, revealing her extremely long pink tongue, which drooped all the way down to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...\" You mutter to yourself, amazed at such a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the battle begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an ideal situation, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been agreed that matters could be worse, so your village just agrees to the sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And this year?

It was easy enough to stay out of it, and mind your own business. Every so often a curious youth would wander in and never return, and the villagers would never speak of them again. But the forest didn\u2019t encroach on the village. A wide stone path poured over with the ritual salts every season saw to that. It would have been fine, were it not for the Witch of the Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the first full moon of every summer, one villager must be sent into the forest as a gift to the Witch. At first some of the sacrifices had displeased her, being given the worst of the villagers. The folk now knew the rules. The sacrifice had to be in their first year of adulthood. They also had to be fit and attractive, among other things. Somehow, the witch needed these sacrifices in order to keep her body young and beautiful throughout the ages, but no one knew exactly what she did with her victims. And this year, that person was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you should have deliberately scarred yourself, marred your attractive features in order to be less appealing. Or fattened yourself up on too much bread and potatoes. But you were vain, and proud of your features, the eyes would flirtaciously linger over you. And you never really thought it would end up being you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now here you are, walking through the enchanted forest on the night of the full moon. The thick ferns and vines almost seem to be parting a way for you, leading you\u2026 into some kind of clearing. A meadow of grass softly waving in the gentle wind, a cool breeze for a hot summer night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in the center of the meadow nervously, not knowing what to do. It seemed very clear you were supposed to come here, but what now? The forest looks dark and foreboding in every direction, pitch black under the thick tree cover. Above your head, the moon shines its pale silver light, letting you see around the meadow. Everything seems still, expectant. </span></div></div>",

It felt as if they were moving in on you. Then you felt on reach your armpit, and your laughter broke loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe\" You giggled, feeling the others move in. One of the vines stuck to your feet, writhing along your soles, while the other moved up along, your thighs, slowly, but all the more ticklish. Something about these vines felt different, they weren't just regular, it felt as if a million little fingers were crawling all over your body. As you felt the vines moving forward, something happens.</span></div></div>",

You feverishly try pinching your knees together to keep them out of unwanted areas, but its no use.

OH MY GAHAHAHAHAHAD!!\" You plead once again, hoping that the witch will spare you. She lets the torture go on for a few more minutes before snapping her fingers. The torment finally comes to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kneels down to your prone, panting, sweaty form and looks over your body, grinning at the scene before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why cant i have girls like you EVERY year?\" She asks rhetorically. She stays quiet, thinking to herself as she stares into your eyes, planning her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you bashful, child?\" She asks you, a predatory grin spreading over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp with nervousness and fear, wondering whats going on inside her head. With a snap of her fingers a vine slithers i to your shirt and pulls up, quickly ripping it from your body like tissue paper. You squeal at the surprise attack and blush feeling the cool air dance across your naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch giggles and winks at you. Slowly and gently gliding her nails over your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you get everyones attention dont you?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cant help but nod at her question, keeping your eyes on where her hand goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets see about down here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more than a second later, your pants suffer the same fate as they are ripped from your body.

In fact, they do tend to pick on you more often than most, and they discovered early on how delightful it is to hear you laughing and giggling your head off from being tickled.  So, you bear your people no grudge for their pragmatic decision, but you also know that there is no way you can bear the thought of being the helpless plaything of such an awful creature.  Especially when they've always treated you as their red-headed stepchild.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is easily the awfullest night of your life, and sleep is out of the question as you contemplate what chances you have for escape into the night while everyone else is asleep.

You understand their situation, and the nature of the arrangement with the oppressor.  You wish you were brave enough to just go along with the plan, and serve as their offertory lamb in an utterly bizarre sacrifice.  You truly do.  But the people whisper terrifying tales of what happens to those who serve as the village\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offering, and it makes you shiver just to imagine an hour of it, let along the rest of your life!  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one else is going to.

The other children of the village had chased you into the edge of the eerie woods that day out of sheer maliciousness, and while you were hiding from them amidst some thick fir trees, you discovered a little wrinkle-faced man stuck with his foot buried mid-kick into a huge toadstool.  At first, he pitched a terrible fit when he saw you, but when you offered to help free him and successfully managed to extricate his boot from the `shroom, he doffed his pointy hat and bowed, declaring that, should you ever be in need, simply return to these woods and whistle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTweet-Toot-Toot\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and he would appear.  Or words to that effect, if your memory serves you.

Rusted patches have been painted over, pipes are leaking and food in the kitchen may or may not be older than the ship itself. But it's got lasers, it's got shields and it's got warp drive and at the end of the day, what else does a pirate ship of the 31st century need?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, most merchant ships give up without a fight anyway. They always look at the guns and not the way the thrusters burn rich, or the fuel leak by the stabilizer that refuses to be locked down. But it helps that the crew- or most of them- are always ready for a fight. First off there's the captain, Sarina- big, heavily armed, razor sharp claws and playing to all the stereotypes when people think Yathi space pirate. She also sleeps with her favorite blankie and snuggly bear, but if that information leaves your lips then an eternity in the tendrils of a koochievine will seem like respite compared to her punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first-mate, Morgan Aratino is a hairy tattooed human, almost as tall as Sarina herself, with an unhealthy obsession with plasma grenades and explosives- one that once or twice almost blew the Nighthawk apart. Unlike most humans he's not ticklish despite numerous efforts to prove the contrary. Unfortunately, again unlike most humans, he has no sense of humor and is in either deadpan or berserker mode depending on his mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFileen and Brianna are a pair of gunrunners who were together long before joining the crew of the Nighthawk. Fileen is a Radin- a green-skinned humanoid with antennae, gray hair and a figure that looks good in a sleeveless, skintight bodysuit. Brianna is a blonde human woman that does her best to act tough and aggressive, but It's hard when Radin culture dictates that, after Fileen saved her life, Brianna is now effectively the green alien's tickle slave. Not that she minds and not that Fileen keeps her lover on the end of a chain but she strikes at some unfortunate moments for Brianna's image and reputation. Brianna's all black leather outfit consists of thigh high boots, tight hotpants and a top that covers her breasts and shoulders, but leaves neck, armpits and a whole lot of cleavage exposed. Fileen wouldn't have it any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot is a rare example of a male Kichi and there are some who call him Tim- apparently no other species can pronounce his real name right. He can shoot a laser gun, no problem, but his true calling is flying. Incidentally, he was a drifter with no purpose before joining the crew and was in jail for hot-wiring and joy-riding a diplomat's personal vessel- again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the aggression spectrum is Flin. Flin's an Uru who just found her way aboard one day, was completely unphased by the guns pointed at her and proceeded to establish herself as chief engineer- and the only engineer. Still she's held this bucket of bolts together for a long time and she's friendly enough. Maybe too friendly depending on your choice of attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship cook is a Giglin called Raol. He's also the ship translator which he obviously has more experience with because the food's terrible- not that anyone will tell him. Brianna did once-she still flinches every time he so much as brushes past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrinda is- well she's in charge of the brig and likes to tickle. An ebony skinned Erimosi with an aversion to wearing clothes, Irinda usually loosens the tongues of a prisoner withholding valuable information- but is just as happy laying her fingers on her fellow crew mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's Mindy. The name wasn't hers but Slithers have no concept of identity and she seems to respond to it. Mindy, a gelatinous blue goo, acts as a janitor, absorbing and digesting trash and generally keeping things tidy. She adopts the outline of a not unattractive female humanoid when interacting with people- which could mean anything from taking orders to sticking them in place and tickling them senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally there's the ship AI who does all the micromanaging so the crew doesn't have to. ERin, of no relation to the AI on the SP-001 <i>Swift Feather</i> many years ago, the first human ship with warp drive, is a more advanced AI meaning she can deal with a heavy workload and still have a smile on her face- hypothetically. Unfortunately ERin was stolen from an experimental research station before being installed on the Nighthawk and was designed for more up to date software, so some glitches may occur. Still, at least no day's a dull day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then of course there's you, the...</span></div></div>",

That and your talents lie outside of directing a M4 particle beam. You were an orphan as long as you can recall. Your only family were the other street urchins on a planetary spaceport in the Alpha Centauri system. You had to be quick, you had the agile and you had to know how to pick a pocket now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpot a mark, grab their coin and melt into the crowd before they realized what happened- or run up a wall, vault over the top, roll on impact to spread the shock and get out of dodge before anyone could find a ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 17 you were the bane of local law enforcement and unsuspecting spacers on shore leave. Sometimes all it took was feminine charm, sometimes playing the lost little girl. And sometimes it took all your expertise and stamina to grab what you could and escape by a Margin too narrow for a pin. But you always got your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's why they recruited you. You remember your surprise then horror when you realized the drunken Kichi wasn't drunk and had just wrapped his coils around your legs. But instead of turning you into the police he offered you a cut in an operation more sophisticated than just another pirate attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of it you were a few hundred credits, and a nice ball gown, richer. And that was when Sarina asked how a place on a pirate ship and more credits than you could spend sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year and billions of lightyears later you're a well established member of the crew- just not in the way you envisioned. And less credits than advertised. Still it's a more exciting life than the one you used to live. That's why you never sought legal work isn't it? The suspense of the snatch and the thrill of the chase. Action and adventure are your callings in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ren of the Nighthawk- cabin girl, true. But also master thief, traceuse extraordinaire and, even if you say so yourself, ravishing femme fatale.

Thankfully the Nighthawk is big enough for most crew members to get a cabin of their own. Thankfully Fileen and Brianna stay in the same cabin, otherwise the ship would be one room short\u2026 which would mean you\u2019d be the short being out. It would probably mean sleeping in the brig when no one is occupying it. But otherwise that\u2019d mean having to share a room with someone\u2026 which could have unintended consequences. When that \u201ccompletely disarmed\u201d smoke grenade managed to start slowly leaking in your cabin and Irinda happily offered to let you room with her for a night\u2026 let\u2019s just say you didn\u2019t get a whole lot of sleep. Irinda has kept the offer open, which makes you extra careful not to leave anything too strange in your cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling it a cabin might be a bit of a stretch, but at least it\u2019s a private spot for you. Sure, it\u2019s barely big enough for a bunk, but you are the lowest sentient being on the totem pole. Sarina\u2019s spacious captain\u2019s quarters on the other hand, you\u2019d be willing to part with a significant bounty share for some time in that room. Not that Sarina lets anyone in there; someone might make a remark about the snuggly bear. But its ok, this cabin is all yours, free to sleep in the relaxing bed of Giglin soft fiber, molding to your form and cradling you into sleeping in far past time for chores. You\u2019re sure no one will mind, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s been a lot going on lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch lazily, and try to roll over. Unfortunately, something seems to be in your way, which is odd considering how little space there is for anything to get in the way. And you keep the cabin so Spartan. It feels\u2026 soft, and warm, and\u2026 gooey? Uh oh, Mindy. The goo girl has occasionally had the habit of crawling into bed with people. Maybe it\u2019s the warmth? Mindy isn\u2019t much of a talker. But she\u2019s snuggled up close to you, her mostly humanoid form pressed against your bare back under the blanket. You also notice her \u2018arms\u2019 wrapped around your sides, although they seem to have lost some of their form, and her gelatinous limbs are now coating most of your sides, her fingers and hands now broad and flat and wrapping around most of your midsection. \u201cUh, Mindy, hey\u2026\u201d you mutter sleepily, trying to coax the strange alien off of you. You\u2019re not even sure you can get out of bed with her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy makes some kind of cooing or purring noise, which you take as some form of acknowledgement. Although instead of, you know, scooting herself out of bed, she takes a different tactic. Her extended hands at your sides start to vibrate, her surface wriggling gently against your skin. The practical effect of this is extremely ticklish, and you immediately start to squirm in your bed. But her hands stick to you like glue, and continue to vibrate against the entirety of both your sides, from hip to lowest rib. \u201cAh! Ahaha! H-hey, Mindy, nohoho!\u201d You protest, still groggy but quickly waking up now that the tickling is getting to you. \u201cEhehe, Mindy stahahap! I\u2019m awahahahake!\u201d You giggle, trying to convince the silly creature to lay off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Mindy seems to take \u201cawake\u201d to mean \u201cyou could tickle me even more if you want to!\u201d Her form presses closer against your bare back, and now you feel that wriggly, vibrating feeling against the entirety of your back. While not the most ticklish spot, it definitely tickles, and all over your whole back at once! Now your really squirming in bed, bucking and kicking off the blanket in hysterical laughter. \u201cNyahahahaha! Mihihihindy-ehehehehehe! Pleehehehehehehase!\u201d You plead with her through your laughter, as it feels like the goo girl is tickling you all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think you can\u2019t take any more, Mindy suddenly stops her ticklish vibrations against you, and with a happy burbling sound lets you go. You collapse back onto the bed, and by the time you can turn around the good girl has dissolved her form and slipped under the frame of the door. As you lay there, still giggling, you wonder if someone sent her in as a wake up call, or if Mindy did that on her own. It was so hard to tell with Slithers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding now was good a time as any to get up, you stand in your little cabin and dress for the day. You put on a pair of skintight pants made of a grey Radin fabric that seems to keep you comfortable no matter what the temperature. You put on your boots, then grab your top. It\u2019s a black Kichi garment that seems to perfectly accentuate your chest, if you do say so yourself. Admittedly, the small garment is sleeveless, and doesn\u2019t go past your ribs, leaving everything from your waistline to lowest ribs exposed. But you were always more about mobility and freedom of movement than plenty of protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the communicator above your bed lights up, relaying an audio communication. \u201cRen! I know humans don\u2019t need this much sleep! Get your lazy self over here, I need your help with something.\u201d Realizing you have your first task of the day, you exit the cabin. Brushing your hair as you walk, you make your way over to-</span></div></div>",

About 40 seconds later the doors to the bridge slide open and you dart through, almost tripping but managing to recover and coming to a half-assed attempt at standing to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bridge is sort of split into two parts. The cockpit section, where Tim is currently sat is mostly reinforced sci-fi glass that you wouldn\u2019t be able to name if your life depended on it. But it gives the pilot a wide field of vision if he ever flies into a section of space that actually has something worth looking at. This half is darkened, with monitors and screens covering the walls, though you\u2019re certain some just display the same squiggly line over and over to make it look like an important reading. The middle of the space is taken up by a holographic display table, that projects images and data either on the tabletop itself or above as a hologram. Placing any sort of electronic device on top of it also allows ERin to access its contents and right now there\u2019s some sort of cube sat in the middle of the table. And given the amount of red flashes the screen emits every few seconds that\u2019s not going as intended right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina who was leaning over the table snarls in anger and slams a furry paw down on the screen, causing part of it to flicker and turn a funny color for a moment. \u201cAgain!\u201d She growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Captain. I\u2019ve tried everything I can and everything that, technically, I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not working.\u201d Being an artificial intelligence at no risk of being hurt, ERin's voice remains calm even as Sarina bares her teeth in another snarl. The same can\u2019t be said for you as she turns her attention to you. To your relief however her face lightens slightly so you know you\u2019re not here to be punished- which means you still have time to find those missing pictures and destroy them any way possible. Why you thought taking them was a good idea in the first place you\u2019ll never know, but alcohol may\u2019ve been involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen.\u201d She says in a calmer voice, but still not without an impatient undertone. She picks up the cube in one hand, making it look much smaller than it really is in her large claws and holds it out for you to take. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know what this is. Are you capable of opening it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes to the first, no to the second. From the intricately traced carvings on the golden surface of the cube, you recognize it as a precursor tesseract, like that one you stole from a museum back at Atheron spaceport. No one knows who made them or how long ago, but they hold vast amounts of data. You know that some hints of what\u2019s inside can usually be found with the right software but without a passcode that\u2019s theoretically- and so far literally- impossible to decipher they\u2019re next to useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell that to Sarina who\u2019s frustration only grows. \u201cTypical- I hired the most useless thief in the galaxy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in this thing that\u2019s so important anyway?\u201d You ask as Sarina takes it back from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe location of the crashed treasure vessel, Heart of Mirazon,\u201d ERin tells you, displaying an image of what must be the ship she\u2019s talking about. \u201cIt disappeared in an ion storm in the Etheral Nebula several decades ago carrying the personal fortune of Iona Kithariti, a kichi noblewoman. At least that is what I can glean from what little I have access to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny idea what the code is then?\u201d You ask. \u201cOr are we just cutting our loses and selling it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIrinda is- doing her best.\u201d Sarina tells you with a wolfish grin appearing on her face. \u201cWe acquired it in the last attack. Morgan tells me the previous owner was locking it when he walked in on her.\u201d You remember hitting a lightly armed research ship a day or two ago. It wasn\u2019t a great haul- mostly just papers and lab equipment that would fetch no price. Sarina must only just have realized the true value of this thing. There hadn\u2019t been many people on board either- only one of them had failed to escape on some sort of warp-equipped escape pod. You guess that must be the poor sucker Irinda is hosting right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously she knows the access code, but so far she\u2019s been un-cooperative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr she could\u2019ve locked it without knowing how to unlock it.\u201d You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps. Either way I thought you might be able to provide an alternate solution. Seeing as you failed and I have nothing better for you to be doing before lunch, go help Irinda. I\u2019m certain she\u2019d love your company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fidget awkwardly as you work desperately to find an excuse. But the captain knows you have nothing better to do and even if you did it was nothing short of a direct order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll- go see if she needs a hand.\u201d Reluctantly you turn to leave before turning back around. \u201cBy the way, is this a realistic kind\u2019ve treasure hunt, or a legend of a legendary treasure of legends treasure hunt? Because the last o-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen.\u201d Growls Sarina with clear intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn my way.\u201d You call over your shoulder as you leave the bridge as fast as you can.</span></div></div>",

And that\u2019s saying something for an Erimosi. You suppose that\u2019s why she\u2019s in charge of the brig. You\u2019ve noticed even Captain Sarina doesn\u2019t get too close to Irinda if she can help it.

And then there was the time you screwed up on that snatch and grab on Resha Prime and Sarina made you train with Irinda\u2026 it turns out Erimosi martial arts are way more effective than what you learned on the streets, and far more ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way across the ship and down to the brig. As the doors open, you\u2019re immediately met with the sound of laughter. Apparently Irinda is already hard at work. An X-frame is laid out horizontally in the center of the room, and laying on top of it is a green skinned Radin woman. Her jacket has been removed, leaving her wearing only a thin wrap around her breasts. A force field is keeping her still, and if it weren\u2019t there you\u2019re pretty sure the woman would be squirming off the table. Her eyes are squeezed shut and her teeth clenched as she tries unsuccessfully to stop snickering. Her antennae twitch erratically above a silver colored pixie cut hair. The Radin seems to be about your age, relatively speaking, as you notice some lingering dark-green freckling on her face and arms characteristic of Radin youth. Below the waist, the Radin woman is wearing tight black pants made of some kind of synthetic material you don\u2019t recognize. Her footwear has been completely removed, and her bare feet are being attended to by Irinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrinda is wearing even less than her prisoner, which doesn\u2019t surprise you. Her top is a small garment that does no more than a passing job of covering her nipples and the undersides of her breasts but little more, the white fabric in stark contrast to her jet black skin. A pair of white short-shorts hug her hips tightly, and a matching pair of white boots cover her feet and ankles. Her snow white hair is pulled back in a human-style ponytail, and her eyes are focused intently on her prisoner. She\u2019s sitting at the foot of the X-frame, and has a hand up to each of the prisoner\u2019s feet, her nails gliding up and down the soles as she watches her captive intently. It takes a moment, but eventually Irinda notices you and looks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen! Did you want to come play with the prisoner too?\u201d Irinda asks, looking to be in a very good mood. \u201cOr were you just looking to spend some time with me?\u201d The Erimosi gives you a playful look, prompting you to quickly answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 Sarina wants the access code to the tesseract, and she\u2019s getting impatient.\u201d You tell Irinda. \u201cSo she sent me to lend a hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpatient? That does sound like Sarina.\u201d Irinda says thoughtfully, not seeming to care that the boss was in a bad mood. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad though, I was hoping to drag this out for a while\u2026\u201d Her hands keep raking up and down the Radin\u2019s soles, but she pauses for a moment to press a button on the control panel. Suddenly, the Radin\u2019s laughter is muffled, almost inaudible, but you can tell she\u2019s still laughing. \u201cThere, don\u2019t want any interruptions! So far all I\u2019ve gotten out of her is name, rank, and serial number. Her name is Gora, and she was a research assistant at that lab. Poor thing panicked and jammed up the warp drive on her escape pod. Lucky us, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been warming her up down here, but I have a hunch the best tickle spots are farther up. Take a seat, and let\u2019s see what you can do! If you\u2019re a good interrogation assistant, I might just have a reward for you\u2026\u201d Irinda said, making you wonder what exactly she had in mind by a reward. \u201cAlthough if you need some pointers, I\u2019m sure Sarina wouldn\u2019t mind if I give you a training session in\u2026 techniques?\u201d A shiver runs along your spine, as you don\u2019t need to wonder at all to know what THAT means. You take a seat at the head of the X-frame, looking down at the poor Radin girl. She just ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Still, you need those access codes, and you definitely don\u2019t want want to disappoint Sarina or Irinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking next to you, you notice a table of tools both simple and technologically complex. Then again, using your own fingers might be best medicine. You look down at your captive: her arms stretched up along either side of you, her armpits taut and exposed, and farther down a smooth belly also makes for a tempting target. How to start?</span></div></div>",

NAHAHAHAT THEHEHEHERE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I think you found a good spot!\u201d Irinda happily exclaims as she jumps up. \u201cYou get that bellybutton with the feathers.

Meanwhile, the Erimosi takes one of her machines and places it on the right side of the ticklee\u2019s stomach, covering up a thin line from her bellybutton to her side. She flips a switch on it, and the machine whirs to life. Irinda moves the machine up and down Gora\u2019s midsection, and your victim\u2019s twitching becomes even more violent, as well as her laughter, which is near silent. Following five minutes of this treatment, Irinda yells out above the hysterical laughter, \u201cAlright, we can stop for now!\u201d You take the feathers off of Gora, whose laughter continues and then becomes very hard breathing. \u201cSo, Gora, that was just a taste of what we can offer.

ERin is getting the data from the tesseract as we speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Irinda cheers. \u201cDid Sarina have an opinion of what to do with the prisoner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said we\u2019re going to sell Gora to a Kichi tickle slaver,\u201d you relay the information. \u201cShe wants you to prepare Gora for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I will,\u201d Irinda confirms. \u201cNow for you. You were a very good interrogation assistant today, managing to find Gora\u2019s worst spots very quickly and exploit them. I promised you a reward if you could do that, and I intend to deliver. Your reward will be to tickle me on the interrogation table once Gora is off. You\u2019ll get ten minutes, so I suggest you use them wisely. I can get Gora off the table and in her cell in fifteen minutes, and then I\u2019ll teach you how to use the interrogation table. How does that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally good,\u201d you state, excited to be the tickler instead of the ticklee for once. \u201cWhile you\u2019re dealing with Gora, I can go up and ask Sarina how long it will be before we sell her off.\u201d Irinda nods, so you head back up to Sarina. \u201cSarina, Irinda is preparing the prisoner to be sold. She and I were wondering how long it would be before we get to sell off the prisoner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are on track to get to the Kichi tickle slaver in two hours,\u201d Sarina notifies you. \u201cShe is waiting for us, so make sure Irinda gets her ready in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, Captain,\u201d you promise before heading back down to Irinda. The Erimosi interrogator has her captive in her arms, unconscious, as she prepares to carry her back to her cell. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two hours before we\u2019re supposed to sell her to the Kichi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, she\u2019ll be ready when I cuff her and put her in her cell,\u201d Irinda announces. \u201cPick up those cuffs for me, will you?\u201d You do as she says, following her and Gora into the cell. \u201cHere.\u201d Irinda takes the cuffs, binding Gora\u2019s wrists behind her back and her ankles together, and then finishes it off by tying the cuffs together with a rope by the cell. Lastly, she takes a pen that claims to have washable ink in it and puts a large \u2018X\u2019 on Gora\u2019s belly. \u201cThe hogtie is to prevent her from escaping when she gets up, and the X marks the most ticklish spot. That\u2019s so the tickle slaver doesn\u2019t have to search to find the most ticklish spot. Many tickle slavers are happy when this is done.\u201d She finishes up this thought, and then turns her attention to the other matter at hand. \u201cBut you probably don\u2019t want to hear that much about selling Gora. You want your reward I promised you. Come with me.\u201d You follow Irinda back to the interrogation table. \u201cSome tools I think you might be interested in using. This is an electric brusher. You turn it on with the press of this button, and wherever the bottom hits will be tickled thoroughly. This is pretty effective on both the tummy and feet. Next up are the sole scrubbers. You put this strap around the front of the victim\u2019s feet, then press this button. The machine will begin scrubbing the bare soles of the victim, and the sensation is very effective. Of course, you know about the Hili feathers and other standard tools like electric toothbrushes, regular brushes, feather dusters, and paintbrushes. I also have a ten-raspberry machine. You place this down on a victim\u2019s stomach, and adjust the intensity, length of raspberry, and time between raspberries using these dials. When they are satisfactory, you just press this button, and the machine will start blowing ten raspberries at once. If Gora hadn\u2019t given us the right code, this is what I would have used on her. I\u2019m sure she would have given us the correct code quickly after that. Anyways, you can one of these, or you can always use your fingers. As far as the actual table, this is the switch to flip to restrain me. You can adjust between X, Y, T, or I position with this dial. If you want me completely restrained, turn on the force field with this switch, and I won\u2019t be able to squirm at all. I think that\u2019s all I can tell you for now but be sure to ask if you have any questions. The moment you start tickling is when the ten minutes start. I\u2019ve already prepared the timer to record the start time and to automatically deactivate any machines you leave on at ten minutes. It will also beep loudly to let you know that the time is up so there is no question. To let me out, simply flip the switch to turn off the force field and then flip the restraining switch, and then I\u2019ll be out. Do you have any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think I understand it,\u201d you dictate, having followed the important steps fairly well. \u201cGo ahead and get on.\u201d Irinda does so, and you restrain her in an Y position, then turn on the force field. Once the Erimosi is fully in your control, you decide to start tickling\u2026</span></div></div>",

So you both know, I\u2019m going to start by putting my machines on one of you, and the other will be treated to me tickling them personally.

ERin, speaking through the small communications device embedded in your ear. It\u2019s a big help when you need her to speak to you covertly, although it\u2019s a shame you\u2019re not capable of the same. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone on this jungle moon. And whoever else is out there has been attempting to hack my systems.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOh, that sounds bad. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You cry out in indignant surprise. The only reason Tim landed us here is because this hot humid mess of a moon is visited by spacecraft about as often as you get first dibs on the Yathi boar ribs. Which is to say almost never, Sarina is very particular about getting the best bits. And now not only is someone else here, but we didn\u2019t know about it. Worse yet, they\u2019re hacking us!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou take a deep, calming breath, and put the hacking device into your pocket. It probably works now anyway. You mostly fixed it. \u201cERin, what do you mean when you say that someone is hacking your systems? And why are you only telling me?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFirst, a shipwide communication might possibly be detected by the attackers.\u201d ERin tells you, even more calmly than you can be in this situation. Or any situation, for that matter. \u201cAlso, an increasing amount of my resources are being dedicated to deflecting their efforts. Talking merely to you is easier.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWell, that does make sense. \u201cOK. So, what can you tell me about these hackers? Who are they, what methods are they using?\u201d You ask, starting to get your mind in gear from hot summer nap time to important thinking time.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAs best I can determine, I am being probed by a precision ultra-modulating laser located approximately five kilometers south of our location. I am 74% certain it is of Giglin design, however I have no way of knowing if the users are Giglin themselves. I have implemented your Omicron Countermeasure sequence, per your programming. However, the laser is transmitting data faster than I can encrypt, and I estimate the intruders will grain full control of my systems within eight standard hours. I don\u2019t need to remind you that all my systems will likely be turned against the crew at that point, and the odds of your success against me are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNever tell me the odds, ERin.\u201d You cut her off quickly. Not only does that sound bad, but someone is out-hacking you! It\u2019s pretty galling, but that laser does sound like a pretty impressive piece of technology. If it could be mounted on the <i>Nighthawk</i> instead, think of all the damage you could do! But first things first, you need to save the ship. Time to...</span></div></div>",

But 5 kilometers through dense jungle and with who knows what out there? Problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think quickly about what you might need, but in the end you only take a handful of items. The data tablet that straps onto your left wrist, a compact drone that fits into a pouch on your belt and a plasma edged knife that fits into a sheath on your boot. No need to take a radio- the comms device over your ear can keep you in contact with ERin and the rest of the crew- as well as listening in on whoever\u2019s trying to take control of Erin if you can get close enough and get the right frequency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you load a magazine onto the top of your submag gun and make sure the power cells are fully charged. You sling the lightweight railgun over your shoulder and make your way out of your cabin headed for the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stands to reason the only room in the ship that isn\u2019t a damned sauna is the one the captain\u2019s in. With the AC on full, despite the occasional worrying clunk, it\u2019s almost too cold and the sweat quickly disappears from your exposed upper body. Sarina is alone and looking angrier than usual for reasons already known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the person.\u201d She growls as you approach the display table in the back half of the bridge. \u201cThis damnable AI has-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cERin\u2019s being hacked.\u201d You say before the captain can tell you what\u2019s wrong. You quickly fill her in on the details and she\u2019s gracious enough not to interrupt you as you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only good news is that the device they\u2019re using needs a direct line of sight at the Nighthawk.\u201d You say once you\u2019ve finished explaining the situation. \u201cThen we know that they\u2019re south of us and how far away they are and-\u201c You pause as an idea materializes in your head that might be worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cERin I know this might be a long shot.\u201d You admit as you look at the unusually blank holographic tabletop. \u201cBut can you bring up a terrain scan of everything south of us and up to 6 kilometers away?\u201d There\u2019s a long pause and you note that the AI\u2019s response is much slower than it would normally be. But then the display lights up with a 3D map of the area you requested. Whoever it is must be on high ground to be able to have a direct shot at the Nighthawk- unless they have an impossible window to your ship through 5 kilometers of jungle. And though there\u2019s a lot of high ground on the map there\u2019s only one hill, actually a very big hill, that the hackers could be on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like that\u2019s the place.\u201d You say quickly downloading the map to your tablet before ERin closes it and focuses her attention back on defending against the cyber-attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now we can make them pay for trying to take my ship.\u201d Sarina growls. \u201cFind Morgan. Fileen and Brianna too.

It\u2019s a mistake you immediately regret- the thought of the first mate being anywhere near the Giglin device worries you but now Sarina\u2019s giving you a look that\u2019s even more concerning. \u201cMaybe we should try to sneak up on them instead. If we take them by surprise we can take their stuff instead of risking damaging it in a fight.\u201d Sarina\u2019s expression softens slightly as she considers your proposal. \u201cAnd maybe they\u2019ve got more stuff like it we can use or sell.

And don\u2019t make me regret this.\u201d That last line made a shiver run down your spine. Assuming everyone makes it out of this in one piece, the last thing you want is to be on the wrong side of Sarina. Last time she made you re-wire the comm encryption unit with a Yathi obedience-band wrapped around your midriff and set to \u2018high-random.\u2019 <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlright guys, you heard the boss.\u201d you tell the three. \u201cTime, get your laser gun in case we get into a fight. But the goal is to NOT use it if possible.\u201d Tim nods with a grin, and while you trust the Kichi you know he\u2019s been itching to use the thing for a while now. \u201cIrinda, grab whatever gear you need, and meet us outside the airlock in five minutes.\u201d Irinda just smiles impishly and goes to her cabin. You don\u2019t even know all the tools she has, but you know each and every one is very effective at something. She might be the most important member of this little infiltration team. \u201cAnd Ren\u2026\u201d You turn to the cabin girl, who looks back at you expectantly. \u201cGet the stunner and your binoculars.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cStunner?!\u201d Ren complaints indignantly. \u201cWhat about the X-ray Rifle? Or the mini-fusion grenades? Or even the Radin tickle-net?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBecause you're a terrible shot, Ren.\u201d You tell the young human woman. \u201cAnd the last time you tried to use the tickle net you ended up wrapping yourself in it, remember?\u201d Ren cringes, and its an incident she doesn\u2019t want brought up. It\u2019s not that Ren is useless, far from it. But her talents involve sneaking in and out, not weaponry and high-tech gadgets. That last part is where you come in. Ren wanders off to get the stunner and you move to your cabin to grab your own tools.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTrusting Tim to watch your back (and underarms, and belly\u2026), you focus on grabbing your hacking gear. Let\u2019s see, if it\u2019s a Giglin device, you\u2019ll definitely need scrambler\u2026 and the hacking unit that\u2019s probably fixed (no time to test it now!)... and a couple other things that might come in handy. With your belt loaded to bear with high tech wizardry, you head outside the airlock, into the jungle outside. You\u2019re immediately greeted by even hotter weather than in the ship. \u201cOh man\u2026 who\u2019d want to spend any time out here\u2026\u201d You mutter, deciding to keep your suit open.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cActually, I rather like it.\u201d Tim says, slithering out of the ship with his trusty laser in hand. \u201cMy people would enjoy this place, which means our opponents might be Kichi\u2026\u201d Irinda and Ren follow close behind, ready to move out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Tim.\u201d You tell him. \u201cI\u2019ve never known Kichi to use Giglin tech. You guys are too proud of your own stuff. But we won\u2019t now until we get there, right?\u201d And with that, you move out. It\u2019s not easy going, with the vegetation clustering thickly around you, vines and ferns obscuring any path. On the plus side, the enemy won\u2019t see you coming. But that also means they could be five feet in front of you and you wouldn\u2019t realize it either.

Wires that don\u2019t quite blend in with the rest. Transactions on an activity log that don\u2019t quite add up to the end total. And because of your honed skill you notice the sheen of green painted metal through the leaves in what little light reaches the ground- a single artificial entity in an otherwise natural environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe presence of something peculiar immediately puts you on alert. Without any unnecessary sudden movements or sound you motion for the rest of your team to get down. Luckily they\u2019re all sensible enough to do so immediately and as stealthily as possible. For the next few minutes you watch, wait and listen. But strain as you might you hear nothing but the wind in the leaves and that irritating call of- whatever that lizard-bird-thing you saw earlier was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re about to creep up to the metallic object, to make sure it\u2019s not just an odd plant and you aren\u2019t jumping to conclusions when you hear it. Unmistakably a sentient voice coming from somewhere up ahead. Then another. And another. In their short exchange you manage to pick out five individuals and you think you can pinpoint roughly where they are- it\u2019s more difficult to tell with all these plants in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk- time to find out who these people are and what they\u2019re trying to do- besides hack into the Nighthawk and take control obviously. In hushed whispers you quickly come up with a plan of attack. As Tim and Irinda sneak around to the right, you take Ren with you left- more to keep an eye on the girl than anything else. She means well and she\u2019s all enthusiasm but luck rarely seems to be on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass the metallic object- some sort of now empty container- and advance slowly and carefully. By your reckoning you still have an hour or two before ERin\u2019s defenses are defeated. You can still afford to take things carefully. Or as carefully as you can whilst heat and humidity sap at your concentration. Luckily for the four of you none of them seem to be keeping an eye out. In fact it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re not even bothering to stay undetected- you\u2019ve been underestimated so much it hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019re all so focused looking inward that you manage to creep right to the edge of the clearing they\u2019ve set up in. Three Giglin like you suspected. Annoyingly Tim was right- there\u2019s a Kichi over there. And it\u2019s the one actually operating the laser device- which is doubly annoying. But you put any thought of what his stupid face is going to say aside because all your attention is now on the hacking module.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize it instantly- a GLX437. Military-grade, top of the line, cutting-edge tech that\u2019s honestly making you feel uncomfortable down in your nether regions. It\u2019s not that big or physically impressive- a tripod, a gray tube and a touch screen data-pad that clips to the back or can be used to remotely-control the device. Point that baby at any computer ever, flick the switch and it\u2019d be decrypted in moments, giving you full remote access. It\u2019s a testament to ERin\u2019s endurance and tenacity that she\u2019s managed to last hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you\u2019ll be sure to tell her as much when you bring it back on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that thought in your mind, you finally turn your attention to the fifth member of their group. A red-skinned humanoid who\u2019s skin seems more soaked than yours. Then you note the five long tentacles growing out of the back of her head where hair would be on a human and the long slender fingers that curl and writhe like tendrils- that\u2019s not sweat, its slime. She\u2019s a pentaclid- native to a world that\u2019s mostly water. She shows no sign of discomfort though as her slender form slinks toward the kichi manning the laser. You feel a shiver run down your spine as you envision what damage those tentacle like appendages must do to bare skin before steeling yourself for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat laser is as good as yours.</span></div></div>",

I\u2026 uh\u2026 may have stolen her credit chip and spent as much as I could before she noticed.\u201d The former pickpocket and street thief looks a bit bashful, but proud at the same time, replying in a low whisper. \u201cShe was trying to chat me up at a sketchy bar back at Alpha Cen. Thought she could have whatever she wanted just because she was a Giglin showing up in that backwater. Maybe she has a human fetish, I don\u2019t know. I am pretty hot\u2026\u201d Ren boasts shamelessly, an impish grin on her face. \u201cBut I was more interested in her wallet.

Another one of the Giglin gesticulates about her, but you can\u2019t make out what she\u2019s saying. The Kichi and the Pentaclid look around them at the surrounding jungle, prompting you to duck lower and keep yourself fully in the brush. You silently will everyone to stay calm, since it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve spotted any of you. They might be worried about something else completely. But then you turn to your left and\u2026 \u201cCrap, they see us!\u201d Ren exclaims, doing the exact opposite of what you wanted, raising her stunner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Ren!\u201d you try to say to her, but before you can she\u2019s fired off a shot into the group. And missed all of them. You never should\u2019ve given Ren a weapon. Five aliens quickly turn in your direction, raising their own weapons. You\u2019re completely outgunned, especially when you consider that a four armed Giglin can hold a lot of them. Not that it mattered, as the Pentaclid raised some kind of device up in the air. It must have been some kind of area of effect stunner pointed in the general direction of you and Ren, because you instantly felt yourself becoming very sleepy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself coming to, although you can\u2019t quite open your eyes yet. You can feel yourself suspending upright in a force field, your wrists crossed over your head. You\u2019re in a comfortable position, but you definitely can\u2019t move to save your life. Which you hope isn\u2019t the actual situation. You can hear two feminine voices talking nearby, and you can start to make out the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...human computer and two captive humans. Maybe it\u2019s just a whole ship of them!\u201d One voice muses, sounding oddly enthusiastic about the idea. But if that\u2019s what they think, it means they only captured you and Ren. Irina and Tim are still out there, hopefully trying to rescue you. All you have to do is make it until then, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you three are so interested in humans. What\u2019s so special about them?\u201d The other voices asks skeptically. You can finally open your eyes, as the heavy sleep finally wears off. You can\u2019t tell how long you were knocked out. Hopefully not long, ERin\u2019s clock is ticking. The second voice is the Pentaclid, talking to one of the Giglin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe human nervous system is wonderful.\u201d The Giglin replies. \u201cWith enough practice you can stimulate it perfectly. You really need to play with one. Just look at this one- I bet that soft skin is delightfully <i>sensitive</i>\u2026\u201d A shiver runs up your spine as the Giglin turns your way. \u201cOh look! She\u2019s awake!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hacking will be complete in two standard hours.\u201d The Pentaclid tells her. And you, it means you still have time. Not that you\u2019ll be much good right now, but the rest of the crew\u2026 \u201cWe should these two.

Despite your cries that it was probably a pirate ship itself, they took one look at it's rust and age and decided it would be a good target for some profitable privateering in the name of the Lady. Nobody cared to listen to a lowly mechanic like you while they readied the magnetic clamps and boarding hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when you saw the name Nighthawk painted on the side through a viewport that you knew you were in trouble. The fight was over in a matter of minutes: the meanest and stupidest of your fellow 'mates were gunned down quickly after attempting to attack the green Radin and the blonde human. The captain surrendered and handed over the giant glowing gem much to the happy surprise of the Nighthawk's crew, then made a beeline to the escape pods with the surviving crewmembers. You slipped down one of the side passages and hid in the Nighthawk's cargo hold after making sure there was nobody following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose you had to become a stowaway: once the Lady finds out her precious cargo had been pinched, she will without a doubt hunt down the escape pods and punish your crew in some unspeakable way. Probably by having them enslaved and sold to an Erimosi tickle-slavery cartel, or perhaps kept alive writhing in a vat of torturous featherfluid for a decade or two. As you lay crouching behind an empty storage crate, you've realized your only option if you want to keep your life or sanity from the Lady's wrath is to find the strange crystal aboard the ship, steal it back from the famous pirates aboard, and deliver it to your mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the captain has it, or maybe it's hidden in some onboard stockpile. Up to you to find out.</span></div></div>",

So lets provide it for them, while getting a little something out of it.\"<br>\r\nIt slowly clicks in your mind what she's suggesting. \"You can't be saying what I think you're saying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to be a tickle slave for- for money- for hire?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the girls round here are gonna tickle you anyway now that they've heard how ticklish you are. And I could tell you were enjoying it a lot. So why not take advantage and make a little money out of it?\"<br>\r\nYou stood there, taken aback. You had no idea what to think or stay as you tried to stammer back a response, before she cuts you off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it helps, we'll split the money 90-10 in your favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. \"Really? Why so much for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because you're going to be doing most of the work.\" Most, you thought. Try all! \"And because, most of my payment will come from being able to tickle you, whenever and however I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this. You had enjoyed being tickled by this attractive goth girl. And the thought of being tickled by the rest of this schools population of pretty females was making your heart race. But could you really go through with this? Allow yourself to be hired out as a tickle slave? And you had felt how Jenessa tickled, she was a sadistic tickler. Speaking of Jenessa, she had approached you with the idea, and was requiring your agreement to make it work. You thought to yourself that maybe you could leverage this, and see if in conjunction to what she'd pay you, and her being able to tickle you, you could get to tickle her. Because she was so alluring, and also for a bit of revenge. Your mind raced with all of these thoughts and ideas and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say?\" asked Jenessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A pair of passing girls in cheer leader outfts walk by and give you a suggestive look as they pass. You gulp. Clearly Jenessa was right about word getting around. \"Wont this coincide with my school work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" said the goth girl. \"Im thinking three hours of private time outside of school for each customer per day and of course youll have to do whatever they say during school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver at the thought of it, some part of you bewildered at the craziness of standing here talking about the logistics of being a tickle slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that sounds pretty fair\" said Jenessa, waiting for your response. \"And plus Im thinking of charging 20 dollars a flat fee and then 50 each day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\" you say.

Taking your things, you walk around the school to where most of the stoners, smokers and skateboarders typically hang out. The air is thick with weed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday a few kids were listening to rap music, wearing beanies and low slung jeans, across from the empty smoke pit where Jenessa is. You swallow nervously and approach the goth girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on time\" she says, giving your body an up and down look. Today the goth is sporting a denim jacket despite the heat, over a black Metallica Tshirt, multiple studded belts over her slim waist, and tight black jeans and clunky black boots. The only splash of vivid color is the red backwards cap bundling her dark hair, the front of which has a pair of vampire teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\" she says and leads you farther back where two girls are waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first is a blonde girl wearing white tennis shorts and a Nike hoodie. Youve seen her in some of your classes, usually among a pack of other students, and youve seen her tickle other boys before. Shes a relentless tickler and a huge sadist. Part of you begins to hesitate but Jenessa gives your waist a pinch. As a giggle shoots out of you, her hand applies pressure on your waist, steering you forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl is Indian, far smaller in height, her figure hidden in a big sweater. She has a pair of rectangular glasses and is holding a bundle of textbooks under one arm. As you enter, she casually puts down her books, stares at you unabashed, a hint of a smile on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is him?\" asks the blonde girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats right Courtney, just as promised\" replies Jenessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he really as ticklish as you say?\" Courtney licks her lips, approaching you. \"I cant believe anyone can be so ticklish. Theres no way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" affirms Jenessa. She snaps her fingers. \"Shoes. Off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink at the sudden command but you dont know how to say no. After all youre this far deep already. Blushing, you remove both your sneakers aside revealing your feet in red checkered socks which you set on the warm grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want his socks off too?\" Jenessa asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I like a little surprise\" says Courtney staring at your feet. \"Get him to show his sole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenessa nods and beckons with one finger. You gulp and avoiding eye contact you sit down, lifting both feet up. The goth girl cups their heels with her fingers, pulling back your toes to show off your arch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow so big\" says the Indian girl. \"But I agree with Courtney, he cant be as ticklish as you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Jenessa rolls her eyes. \"See for yourself\" She places her nails at the heel of your foot. As she roves them upwards, laughter and giggles burst out of your mouth and you try to fight her grip on your ankle. Jenessa continues her fingers, ignoring your pleas, up to your toes and then tickles the tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls are impressed. \"Hes that ticklish, even with his socks on?\" The Indian girl exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" Jenessa quickly snatches off your red checkered socks and presents your soles to them. \"And these lovely soles along with the boy attached to them can be yours today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chuckling quietly at how you have now resorted to bounty hunting a few months ago to make a name as well as coin for yourself, you tune your ears through the dull ringing of your slight stupor, trying to gleam for some tidbits of information from the rowdy customers that might help you aim for your next target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear? Recently there have been reports coming from old sailors in the port of Balthas. Rumor has it that there have been sightings of rare creatures only found in fairy tales at sea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might be right! I was on a fishing skip the other day, just minding my own business when suddenly I saw a giant cloud of fog coming towards my boat. I thought I was hallucinating when I heard the sound of something calling out for me. Turned my boat straight around and headed back home, I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah, that\u2019s nothing! Once when I was out ferrying passengers to the city of Calus on the other side of the ocean, I saw something swimming just underneath the water. What was strange though, it looked <i>too</i> large to be a fish, even though it had a tail fin\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your ear to another side of the room, you listened in, interested in a conversation between a male and female knight carelessly talking while downing another round of ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it <i>that</i> time of the year again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, its always been like this. Now that it\u2019s the twelfth month, they\u2019ve been raring to go at it like always.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard this year is going to be even <b>more</b> chaotic. I hope that everyone has evacuated out of Areindal\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel sorry for anyone that remains. All we can do is pray that they keep their squabble inside that city and away from us <i>mortal</i> beings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both gave each other another toast, ending their conversation, you stood up, leaving behind a few silver coins to pay for your drink. As you were about to walk out of the establishment, a fluttering notice pinned onto the wooden doorway caught your attention. Ripping it off its nail before scanning its contents, your eyes widened before pocketing the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling away from the merry chatter coming from behind you, you let your mind wander as you walked down the path, still taking all your options into consideration. As of now, you could see three possible actions you could take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, you could head to the port of Balthas. From the looks of things, there seems to be some creatures, such as mermaids and sirens from the looks of things, hanging just outside its coast. From what you remembered, a mermaid\u2019s scale would fetch a pretty penny, along with their tears, which would immediately turn into diamonds the moment they were secreted. Of course, getting them was entirely different matter. You also knew that if you could get your hands on a siren, she would have years of stored up treasure from all the sailors they would have lured in by their beautiful singing voice, if you could get her to part with all its splendor and riches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, from the notice you saw at the inn, there was a warning against going in the forests just on the outskirts of the town you were currently in, as there was a Fairy Queen residing in it. Of course, any decent traveler knew that when there was a fairy queen, there would also be multiple subjects that would have followed her into the forest, some examples you have heard of being fairies, dryads and nymphs. The treasures of the forest were always plentiful. Fairy dust is always a hot item to market, with it being a key component for potions and all. Not only that, but the water where nymphs have resided in always tastes refreshing, along with the rumor that it could cure fatigue instantly. The biggest catch of all would be the Fairy Queen's tiara, said to hold magical powers otherwise unknown. However, you also knew that the moment you stepped into their territory, you would be treated as an intruder and would be treated accordingly if you got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you considered journeying to the annual war between Heaven and Hell in the abandoned city of Areindal to the west of where you currently were. As to why you were reluctant to go for this opportunity, you knew that while this had its perks as well as large rewards, it also had extremely high risks. With Heaven\u2019s usual forces of Valkyries, Angels and holy warriors fighting against Hell\u2019s Succubus\u2019, Vampires and other peons, it would always be a war of large scale destruction with both super powers colliding. Of course, if you were to act like a vulture and collect the items that were supposed to be the spoils of war, any weapon or armor that you sold would most likely net you enough coin to survive luxuriously for several months. You could even try to capture a person from one camp and sell them to the other for bounty money. Of course, that would inevitably result in direct confrontation from one side, where you might either be subjected to the judgement of the angels or temptations of the succubus\u2019. Since your prey would likely not even be mortal, a little trouble might arise if you accidentally bit off more than you could chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much deliberation under the starlight night sky, you finally came to the conclusion that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Traveling a far distance by now, the town must be a half mile away, and you notice the amount of trees begins to increase as you continue walking. Soon, you find yourself surrounded in nothing but nature. There are dozens of trees, wherever you look, barely being able to see past them. The ground is covered in an immense amount of foliage; there are flowers, bushes, and grass as far as the trees would let you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue deeper into the green forest and find a large rock.

This one was a little shorter than you, somewhere taller than a child, but smaller than the average adult. Her skin was a pale green, and her body was covered in leaves, acting as clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get up, but you realize you are bound to a tree. Its vines holding your arms up above your head, and its roots clamping down your ankles, sturdily into the ground. You realize she must have used magic to restrain you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you lost?\" She said smiling innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-uhh, I'm just looking... for stuff.\" You said, unconvincingly. \"Why have you restrained me against this tree?\" You say, pulling at the vines around your wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... you shouldn't travel this far alone. I think you should be punished for such foolishness!\" She said, quickly shifting from an innocent smile, to a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she ran to the other side of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... how ar-hehehehehe\" You erupt giggling, as you felt her fingers roll up both of your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, is the little victi--ER, traveler ticklish?\" She says, teasing your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehehe-stohahahap I AM NOT-hehehehe... TICKLISH!\" You try yelling out in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin laughing more as she keeps tickling your sides; tapping, poking and pulling at each part. She then moves to your front, and begins tickling your midriff. She starts by poking it with her index finger, causing you to instinctively breath in and try to wiggle away. Then she starts wiggling her fingers against the middle, near your belly button. Held up by the vines, you were stretched up, and could barely move, giving you no break to her tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAAAHAHHAHAHANOT THEREHAHHAHAA\" You pleaded in between laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Not... <b>here?</b>\" The dryad said, as she used one of her hands to also squeeze at your hips; a place you didn't even know was that sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEHHAHAHAHAHHAA\" You laughed out, at such a surprising tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the dryad suddenly stopped, and you were panting. You heard her walk away, for a moment. And a few seconds later, heard her again. As your last tears from the tickling fell from your eyes, and you could see clearly, you noticed her sitting down, dipping a brush into a jar. Upon focusing, you noticed she was soaking this brush in some sort of amber liquid; it was slow and gooey, and dripped lazily from the tip of the brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryad then stoop up, and walked towards you, and rolled up your shirt, all the way up to above your rib cage, leaving the naked skin of your belly exposed. Then she showed you the brush, almost as if she was showing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here, is rare oak tree sap, harvested from one of the oldest and magical trees in this forest. To you humans, it tastes bitter and nasty, but the creatures of this forest, go wild for it.\" She then lowered the brush to your belly, and began slowly spread the tree sap across your taut tummy. When she finished, she had covered nearly all of your midsection--from your sides, to your belly, to your ribs, and all the way down to your waist--you could see the yellowish orange sap glow on your skin, slowly beginning to droop lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryad then whistled, and almost immediately, two deer came from behind the trees. Then you had an idea of what she was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stepped away and sat against a tree, almost as if she was watching a play. In a matter of moments, the deer noticed you, and what you had been covered in, and you prepared for the worst. The deer immediately, as if driven mad by the tree sap, dashed towards you and began licking rapidly against your skin. On both halves of your midsection, you could feel their rough, slender pink tongues glide against the amber sap stuck to your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HahHAHAHhAHHAHA\" You began crying out again, starting to feel a new form of ticklishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the deer both finished cleaning up your sides, leaving no sap behind, one moved downward. It began licking across your waist, just above your pants. The other went towards your center, and began tonguing your inner belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes of this, the deer had finished. The parts of your body that was once covered in sap was now covered in the deer's saliva. The deer soon ran away, after lapping as much tree sap from your skin as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

As he cracked his whip, not willing to spend even one more second near the infamous \u2018City of Catastrophes\u2019, you did a few stretches, working out the kinks in your aching shoulders from not moving freely for so long, stuck for most of the journey in the small confines of the carriage. Once you felt yourself becoming sufficiently limber again, you set upon the task of entering the town, the outline of its half-destroyed buildings and walls already in view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making your way into the city through a decent sized hole in the stone walls, you thank whatever gods there were that the sun was high up in the sky, for if you had made this journey in the night, who knows how you would have found your way in, let alone see anything that would try to take you by surprise.  Finally managing to pull your small bag of items that you had always kept close by your side since the start of your journey, you quickly hugged the shadows of the closest buildings, wary of <i>anything</i> or <i>anyone</i> you might encounter in this war-torn town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping deeper into the city through the dark and abandoned alleyways between buildings, you quickly stop as you hear the sound of flapping above you. Pressing yourself against the wall and hoping that no one spotted you, your eyes opened ever so wider as you caught the sight of a pair of women with white wings zipping past the skies above you. Shortly after, a group of women, this time with bat-like wings on their backs, flew above you as well, probably giving chase to the former two. \u201cIf I could just stay hidden from all the action, there should be no problems\u2026 Just keep sticking to the shadows\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more painstakingly slow minutes of cautiously moving about the shadows, you finally came across an obstacle you couldn\u2019t sneak your way through. In a small area near the back of some houses, you could see the outline of two feminine figures circling each other. Making sure that you were sufficiently hidden behind the cover of some barrels, upon closer inspection, you realized that both women were from opposite factions, their appearances and open hostility towards each other quickly giving it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in only a few pieces of bronze armor around her chest and waist, along with a fancy helmet and pair of metal boots, the short-haired brunette spoke first, an arrogant look on her facade as she raised her sword and shield, issuing her threat. \u201cI\u2019ve finally caught you, filthy succubus. Now surrender or I\u2019ll make it so!\u201d Nervous, you recognized the front-line fighters of the holy side of the war, the infamous Valkyries, war-hardened soldiers trained from the goddess Athena to act as foot soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, did you really think you caught me? I <b>lured</b> you here, where no one could see what would happen to you, much less hear your delicious screams\u2026\u201d Licking her lips, the other woman, a raven-haired beauty with strips of cloth scantily covering her essential areas and a tail sticking out from her rear, started to walk forward, not a care in the world with her prey in front of her. Internally suppressing the urge to run, you also recognized the other woman from her appearance, quickly matching it with the term \u2018Succubus\u2019 in your mind from the Hell side of this war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other woman bravely tried to swing at the oncoming threat with her weapon, the Succubus just yawned, dodging all her attempts as easily as if a toddler had tried swinging at her with a stick. Closing the gap with one quick step, the brunette gasped as her opponent managed to get behind her, the latter smirking. \u201cSwinging that little stick at me? You should know better than to try. Now, to relieve you of those toys\u2026\u201d Nails skittering up and down the other\u2019s bare side, the Valkyrie let out a girlish shriek, dropping both her sword and shield as she tried to clumsily hop away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecounting the tales that you have heard from the few others such as adventurers who had ventured to this very city, you recalled that many have said to have heard the screams of terror and oddly laughter coming from inside these walls, you yourself dismissing such an impossible claim. However, now you realize that maybe those claims might not have been so far from the truth, your eyes remaining glued to the scene in front of you. Giggling along with her victim, the seductress continued to tease her prey skillfully, finding the gaps in between the others armor. Sliding her fingers smoothly into a small opening in her armor near her underarms, the brunette\u2019s knees finally gave way as she collapsed to the floor, a giggling mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTying up her hands with her tail, the Succubus smirked, taking off the other\u2019s large metal boots. \u201cSuch unsightly things, hiding such soft\u2026 Smooth\u2026 ticklish feet. Coochie Coochie Coo!\u201d Raking her nails up and down her adversary\u2019s now exposed soles, the Valkyrie instantly went hysterical with laughter, her body bucking and down with the effort of escaping the ticklish nails. As her laughter kicked up another notch as the Succubus started to tickle her toes, you thought perhaps you could do something about this situation\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So nervous you were, you didn\u2019t notice that you had bumped a lone metal can, said object slowly rolling to hit the wall with a soft \u2018clang\u2019. In an instant, you felt yourself being tackled to the ground, the wind knocked out of you. Looking up, you saw the hungry face of the succubus looking directly into your eyes, already licking her lips at her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEavesdropping, were we? It\u2019s so rare that we have mortals visiting up during our war. Might you be so kind to enlighten me on why you\u2019re here, or do you need some\u2026 <i>Convincing</i>, like our friendly Valkyrie over there?\u201d Pointing behind her shoulder, you gulped, not for the first time today as the sight of the slightly giggling warrior from heaven still lay prone on the ground, her knees pulled up to her chest as she guarded her naked feet with her hands, not wanting to experience the fiendish nails of the succubus again. As you felt a tail slowly drawl its way into your shirt, you decided that the risk wasn\u2019t worth it, choosing to spill the beans instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just here for mercenary work, along with just searching the town for items! I\u2019m not a part of this war, honest!\u201d Leaning in closer to give you a quick sniff, she nodded in approval. \u201cI don\u2019t smell any of that pure air from heaven on you\u2026 Nor do I smell any of my brethren\u2019s stench on you either. Looks like you are telling the truth. A mortal who\u2019s unaffiliated to any side\u2026 Fufufu\u2026 Just maybe\u2026\u201d Trying to move back away from the grinning raven-haired demoness, a purple-nailed hand planted itself next to your head, warning you of what would happen should you try to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin now appearing on her face, she leaned in closer, her hot breath tickling your ear. \u201cSay, how would you like to work for us, hmm? Even though you\u2019re a mortal\u2026 Perhaps we could use someone like you with your unique ability to look relatively harmless just like, well\u2026 a mortal.\u201d Already seeing where this was going, you opened your mouth to try to refuse. However, before the words could come out, a single finger was placed on your lip. \u201cOf course, we will reward you for your efforts, as well as granting you temporary tools to help aid us. Of course, they come with a price\u2026 But it\u2019s not like you have a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything, the succubus quickly placed her hand on your heart, purple fel-magic flowing around your body. By the time she had removed her hand, she got off you, a mischievous grin on her face as she pointed to your wrist. Now seeing a purple insignia appear on the top of your hand, you tried to rub it away, to no avail. \u201cThat\u2019s the mark of the temptress. With that, no creature that is allied with hell will attack you, and will recognize that you are aiding us in this war. It also had some minor benefits, such as creating ethereal rope, summoning a few dark pixies, etc.  But of course, I did say there was a price, didn\u2019t I? If you were to betray us\u2026\u201d Snapping her fingers, you gasped out loud in surprise as several purple tattoos appeared on your skin, moving underneath it. As they moved underneath your clothes, you felt the surprising sensation of at least dozen hands tickling all over your body, squeezing your ribs and hips, fluttering across your chest, even digging into your armpits. Leaning against the wall with crazed laughter, the succubus snapped her fingers again as the tattoos went back to their original positions, before fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is what happens if you think of turning tail on us. And just in time, it looks like our heavenly friend over there is about to recover. Now move along. Those people won\u2019t hesitate to help a mortal who\u2019s seemingly lost their way. And don\u2019t forget to help us collect information!\u201d Giving her last instruction, the succubus vanished into thin air. Sighing at how you\u2019ve now become an unwilling participant in this war, you grabbed your items, noticing that the runic insignia on your wrist conveniently vanishing. Walking up to where the Valkyrie was still catching her breath, you forced yourself to keep calm. \u201cHey, are you alright? You look like you\u2019ve been through a tough battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is none of your concern mort-A human?! Here?! What in the heaven\u2019s name are you doing! Don\u2019t you know that this place is dangerous?!\u201d Taking back her sword and shield from where it lay on the ground, the Valkyrie looked you over, a tad suspicious. \u201cSo, how did you get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI climbed through the wall, looking to see if there was anyone else that might have been caught up in the holy war. Before I knew it, I found myself here where you were.\u201d Bluffing your way through, you gave a sigh of relief on the inside as the Valkyrie nodded her head, accepting your statement for now. \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s our duty to help mortals in need. My name\u2019s Eydr. We best move for now, before that accursed succubus comes back for more.\u201d Gesturing for you to follow her, you both walked along the alleyways, looking out for any signs of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are we goi-\u201c Halting as you see Eydr suddenly raise her hand, you quickly kept quiet, peeking around the corner at where your companion was looking at\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No sooner have you poked around the corner than Eydr frantically pushes you both back behind the cover of the wall, pressing a finger over your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Light!\" she whispers, \"Trouble up ahead! Stay alert, human.\" She peers back around the alley's wall, then motions for you to look again when she deems it safe. You bend forward, careful not to jostle any loose stones or bump into Eydr while looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area in front of you is a small courtyard, wider than the streets or alleys but nothing particularly grand. The ground is barren save for the remains of some old crates and a wagon, smashed in the battle between Heaven and Hell. In the yard you quickly spot the two warriors of heaven locked in a battle against a group of demons, a fight in which they seem severely outmatched. One, a male, has a white robe and hood on and clutches an arcane staff, wildly blasting at the enemy. The second patrol member is a woman, clad in a shiny, glass-like armor over her chest, arms, and legs as well as a winged helmet. She holds a double-bladed axe in one hand, while her other hand glows, creating a golden magical shield that moves with her arm and seems to ward off the demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation, Eydr chuckles. \"A priest and a paladin fighting side by side...they must not have chosen this. Completely different styles of fighting,\" she muses. \"Must be an ambush. And to happen so close to our perimeter...We need to make our move soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully take note of the information about where Heaven's territory is, so you can send it back to your succubus captor later. Then you look back to the battleground. The fiends assaulting the pair of warriors are clearly imps: little demons about three feet tall, with red skin, pointed tails, and feminine features. While they only have sharp claws and their dexterity, they make up in numbers what they lack in strength. The group of about ten imps darts in and out at the priest and paladin, taunting, giggling, and slashing accurately with their claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a few dark, powdery smudges mark the spots where several imps were vanquished, you can see they've worn down the outmatched servants of good. The priest's robe is in tatters, and the paladin's armor has been removed in several strategic places by the claws of the imps. As the two of you watch, the imps finally overcome the exhausted fighters. Half of them pounce on the priest, laughing as they dig their claws into his unarmored body. He tries to crawl away, but they stick fingers into his belly and trip him up with their tails, then roughly pin him to the ground as they poke his sides, lick his soles, and stick enterprising fingers down his pants, reducing him to a wriggling, red-faced ball of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin hardly fares any better. She slashes with her axe, reducing one imp to a puff of dust, but is set upon by four more. One creeps around her magical shield and scrapes her nails across the paladin lady's armpit, causing her to break concentration. The shield dissipates, and the demons immediately set upon her and give her the same treatment they're giving the priest, furiously tickling her exposed thighs, neck, and ribs where the armor is ripped off. Before long both heavenly warriors are tired out to the point of near immobility, but the imps keep teasing and tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the savage, unrelenting tickling going on, and it makes you begin to wonder if the mark the succubus put on you protects you from demonic tickling or merely tells them you're on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a glowing, shimmering portal appears by a wall nearer to you and Eydr, and you can swear you hear faint laughing sounds from it. You're not 100% sure where it leads, but you can bet it's straight into Hell controlled territory. \"Damn! That must be the way they got so close to our borders. They must be using powerful magic to override the protective spell we have in this area.\" says Eydr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then look over to the priest and paladin. The imps are dragging their still laughing, feebly struggling bodies towards the open portal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to act now!\" Eydr whispers, and tosses you a long dagger from her belt as she draws her own sword. Remembering your job to collect information, you decide not to drive it into her back then and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you charge into open view of the imps.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a few more of them vanished into a puff of smoke, they finally take notice of the both of you, grinning as they knew immediately what to do. As you both got closer to where the paladin and sorcerer was, two of the imps from both of the downed people detached themselves, quickly flying over to you and Edyr. As the Valkyrie tried to swing her sword at the annoying creatures, both of them dipped into the openings in her armor. Before long, you could hear giggling coming from inside her clothes as the former barely held onto her sword, clutching at her sides in laughter. \u201cG-Get out from there! Stop it, don\u2019t tickle me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping as another pair of imps came over to where you were, one of them sat on your shoulder, whispering into your ear. \u201cHey human, we know that you have the mark of the temptress on you, so we won\u2019t tickle you. Since you\u2019re with them, we\u2019re guessing you\u2019re going undercover.\u201d Nodding, both of the imps giggled the other one flew to your belly, her hands just inches away from your tummy. \u201cAlthough, it would be a little bit suspicious if we didn\u2019t tickle you, so try to play along!\u201d Getting to hint, you wildly but carefully flail about, faking your laughter as the other imp continued to make a show of tickling you, even though her hands or fingers didn\u2019t come into contact with you all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a loud boyish laughter erupting into the air again, you turned to the side. Feeling pity for the man, you saw now that the three remaining imps that had remained with him were now trying to get him to go through the portal, the lower half of his body already inside. However, even as they poked and prodded along the length of his upper body, his hands remained clamped onto a nearby lamppost, true terror in his eyes as he knew what would happen if he let go. As they all let out a sigh, the three mischievous creatures decided to change their tactics, a wicked smile on all of their faces at their new plan. As one of the imps sat down on his shoulders to whisper something to his ear, the other two entered the portal. As the imp finish speaking with a giggle, a crimson blush appeared on his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! You can\u2019t do that! If you do-!! Urrk!\u201d Gasping as he felt his rob being tugged on from the other end, the sorcerer burst into giggles again. \u201cDon\u2019t touch m-me! Not down there! It tickles like hell!\u201d As his laughter kicked up another notch, the imp on his shoulder resumed her verbal teasing, her legs swinging daintily. \u201cOh but mister, you haven\u2019t seen what pleasure we can bring you in hell yet. Let us give you a <i>taste</i> of what is to come.\u201d At that moment, moans started to become intermixed with his giggles as his face became even more flushed than what it was before. Fingers finally slipping free from its hold, his whole body went into the portal, his laughter growing softer with every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pixies made a move to return through the portal as well, their deed being done, one of them whispered again in your ear before going through. \u201cIf you need any help, go to the inn just down the street. One of our allies is hidden there, waiting for any helpless victims. See you for now!\u201d Wings just barely tickling your ear as she left you, you heard Eydr heave a sigh of relief at the momentary break from the tickling. However, even as the imps returned through the portal, the latter did not close, remaining open as dark red magic pooled in a fog around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now, this portal takes priority. There must be someone or something that\u2019s powering this portal, allowing those hellspawn to enter in our domain. We must find what it is, and stop it immediately before more of those fiendish creature\u2019s arrive!\u201d Nodding your head as you watched both Eydr and the paladin getting up; you see the latter give both of you a nod of the head as well. \u201cWell said, sister-in-arms. I am Vialle. As you can see, we were ambushed and being caught off guard, were swiftly defeated. However, we must not let our ally\u2019s sacrifice be in vain. We should press on and defeat more of these hellish beings!\u201d Opening your mouth, you suggested to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This mortal and I will find the source of the portal, and shut it down before any other intruders appear deep inside our ranks. If such a power was allowed to run rampant during the war\u2026 We might find ourselves flanked and getting nasty surprises much more than we would like it.\u201d As the female paladin gave a salute, straightening her gear before walking in the separate direction from where Eydr was beckoning you to follow her, you could only grimace at the missed opportunity to discover where the heaven\u2019s main quarters were located at. If you had refused to follow Eydr, it might have proven a tad too suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogging up to where the Valkyrie was walking briskly, you still had a question in your mind. \u201cBut how are we going to find where whoever is creating the portal is? For all we know, they could be all the way at hell\u2019s side of the battlefield, and no way are we going there!\u201d Pausing for a minute to take out something from a pouch on her waist, she handed it over to you. Curiously looking at the new object in your hand, you realize that it was just a plain lens, albeit that you could probably fence this off for a pretty penny judging from the intricate engravings and patterns on the metalwork frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it up to the light and look at the portal. This is an \u2018eye of osiris\u2019, one of the tools we usually use to see magic ley lines that are invisible to the naked eye. If you point it at the portal, you should be able to trace where the source of its magic is coming from.\u201d True enough, as you looked at where the shimmering crimson construct was through the new lens, you could see a faint red line snaking from it, through where you were walking, all the way to the top of a clock tower at the end of the street. Giving back the lens to Edyr, slight nervousness entered your voice. \u201cIf whatever is over there is making the portal, shouldn\u2019t it be with good reason that it should be strong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, if that were the case we would have to just have to hope for the best and catch them off guard. However, if it was just an object that was the thing that\u2019s the source of power opening the portal, we might be able to take down whoever is guarding it. Just in case, stay back and let me handle it.\u201d Proudly opening the double doors to the building, the pitch black and eerily silent interior greeted you both. As the old wooden stairs creaked with every step the both of you took, the both of you ascended to the third floor, one last floor before the attic of the clock tower. Even as you stood before the stairs leading up, you could feel the heavy aura of powerful magic in the atmosphere. One glance at Edyr also told you that she felt it, a bead of cold sweat sliding down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well then, we can\u2019t keep waiting forever. You still have that dagger I gave you right?\u201d Fingering the handle of the weapon by your waist, you nodded, confirming that it was there. \u201cAlright, on my mark, we go in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With only a few rays of light shining down from the alcoves into the dusty attic, the sound of quiet grinding of gears filled both your ears from above, the mechanisms of the clock tower working tirelessly away to move the massive timepiece displayed at the top of the building. Gazing in awe at the internal structure of this relatively undamaged building, you almost bumped into Eydr who had abruptly stopped in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly pointing to the center of the musky room, the Valkyrie directed your attention to where a ritual was being held, a glowing purple circle with a star and pentagram design in the center of four candle stands, laid out in four opposite corners. In the center of it, a woman with fiery red hair could be seen sitting down, the sight of her naked back and lack of clothes except for a tiny piece of cloth attached to strings all that is covering her below her waist already telling you which side she was probably on. Staying far enough from the tail which started from her rear, close inspection told you that the \u2018tail\u2019 was in fact a snake, its head hissing softly at you as its slitted pupils kept a constant gaze on you.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both Eydr and you slowly walked in front of her, the both of you could see that her eyes were in fact closed, her body in the typical meditation poses of the lotus position that monks from the highlands could be seen doing, the pair of wings made purely from flames on her back twitching as she sensed the presence of people around her. Lit up by the flickering flames on the candles, her beautiful face didn\u2019t as much move a muscle; even you could tell it was taking her quite the effort to supply power to the portal. Aiming the blade of her sword at the others neck, Edyr was about to swing when the other woman suddenly spoke up, one eye opened in humor, her tone remaining neutral. \u201c<i>I wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you, unless you know not the name of Lilith, head of one of the thirteen clans of succubi</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking her tongue in annoyance, you watched in surprise as Edyr halted just inches away from the other\u2019s exposed nape before reluctantly sheathing her sword. Pulling you back as she lowered her voice so as not to be heard by the still concentrating succubus, you questioned the Valkyrie at her strange behavior, still keeping up with your pretense. \u201cHey, why did you stop? If you had swung your sword, she would have been finished there and then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, human. I\u2019ve heard from my sisters of the tales of those that had happened to face that particular succubus on the battlefield. Along with her extraordinary magic prowess, that snake behind her back will automatically bite at anyone that tries to attack her with any type of physical attack, its poison rendering them unable to move and eventually succumb into a state of prolonged sleep, where she can finish them off at her leisure. We must be cautious of directly attacking her, lest we get bitten before we\u2019re able to take her out.\u201d Biting her thumb, Edyr continued to think, trying to find her weakness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that warriors had managed to lay a hand on her, before being blasted away by her magic. In that case, if we don\u2019t have the intention of bringing harm to her, we could possibly get close to her. But then what\u2026 All we have are our bare hands\u2026 Our bare\u2026 hands\u2026 Hmm\u2026 This could actually work\u2026\u201d A mischievous smile creeping up on her lips, Edyr whispered to you her idea, your eyes opening wide at what she was about to make you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Valkyrie had made sure that you had gotten her plan in mind, both Edyr and you sat in behind and in front of the still form of the succubus respectively. As the red-head opened her eyes once again in curiosity, you mouthed the words \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 to her before grabbing her foot, tracing one finger up and down her arches. Seeing her eye widen before closing shut in concentration, you were relieved to see that the snake, which had taken an interest in you, has yet to bite you, a sign that tickling was not counted as a form of physical harm. Continuing to stroke your fingers as slow as you could across her soles, a pair of hands made their way to her sides, poking the succubus\u2019 soft skin before giving them a few experimental squeezes. \u201cCoochie coo\u2026 Looks like someone can\u2019t stop us from tickling her poor ticklish skin. It would be so easy for you to just get up and swat us away like flies\u2026 But you can\u2019t do that, can you? Tickle tickle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Edyr continued whispering soft teases into Lilith\u2019s ear, you could see what Eydr could not, a soft smile stretching itself across her once-still beautiful fa\u00e7ade. Grimacing and hoping that she wouldn\u2019t hurt you if kept the tickling to a minimum; you softly scratched a few fingers into her toes as they started to wiggle a bit, her body language telling you that it tickled more than she had let on. However, Eydr had no such inhibitions as she relentlessly grabbed at the red-head\u2019s curvy hips, randomly alternating between extremely and soft kneading. Determined not to fail in her task, even you could see the slight smile that Lilith had on turn into a wide grin as her self-control slowly broke down inside her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that you could stop Edyr before Lilith actually starts to laugh, you try to appeal to the Valkyrie. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should stop soon? It doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s gonna laugh from this.\u201d Humming to herself as she plucked two flaming feathers from the succubus\u2019 fiery wings Edyr grinned to herself. \u201cLet\u2019s see if she can contain her giggles after I do this!\u201d Fluttering the feathery fronds along the undersides of Lilith\u2019s bare chest, you could see tears of mirth welling up in the corners of her eyes. After a few tense seconds passed\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, her monetary joy and your own soon turned into dismay as the Valkyrie exclaimed in delight. \u201cMy sisters, you have found us! Help us in ridding this filthy succubus! She\u2019s the one who\u2019s been opening up portals in our domain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you notice the two other Valkyries, both looking absolutely stunning by mortal standards, enter the attic as well, they were dressed in the same garb as Edyr with their only difference being their hair, one a long haired blonde while the other had similarly long haired dyed auburn and brown. As they took up their places around the succubus, following their fellow Valkyrie's lead, the blonde spoke up, already smiling at being presented with the opportunity to defeat a denizen of hell. \u201cSo sister, what have we here? Are my eyes not deceiving me, that the being in front of us is indeed the infamous Lilith of the thirteen clans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight you are, sister. Even though I felt that we didn\u2019t need any help, this mortal here advised me to contact you in the possibility that we found something dangerous.\u201d Showing off a blue mana crystal from a pouch in her waist, you assumed that was what Edyr had used to communicate with the other Valkyrie's, already regretting having telling her to do so in the first place. \u201cLike the rumors have said, we were unable to find a way to stop her without that snake on her tail from biting us. However, after fighting against one of Hell\u2019s spawn, I realized that perhaps they aren\u2019t so protected against their own types of pleasures. Allow me to demonstrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching out one hand towards Lilith, both of the other Valkyries had been prepared to stop Edyr for the fear of being stung. However, as Edyr started to softly trace her finger up and down the frozen succubus\u2019 sides without the snake beside her taking any action other than lazily staring at her, the look in their eyes turned from wariness to mischievousness as a smile also appeared on their lips, apparently getting the idea. Feeling some suddenly giving your shoulder a hard shove, you gasp as the blonde Valkyrie took your place. \u201cMove mortal, I\u2019ll take over from here. Time to show you what we sisters of Athena are can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tickling resumed once more, you could see that this time they weren\u2019t holding anything back, tormenting Lilith from the start with thirty individual wiggling digits. As the blonde raked her nails up and down their victim\u2019s arches and toes as if she were playing a melodious harp, her raven-haired partner had taken up a position on Lilith\u2019s lap, her chest almost touching the succubus\u2019 own as her hands moved fluidly across the latter\u2019s smooth belly, playfully pinching her exposed sides and ribs every once in a while. Lastly, your brunette companion still kept up with teasing the surface of the succubus\u2019 orbs with her own ticklish feathers, brushing and swiping their length along the sides of her barely jiggling chest, occasionally rubbing their fronds against the circumference of the globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it tickle in between your toes, succubus? How about these silky arches of yours? Not so mighty anymore, aren\u2019t you? Kitchy Kitchy Koo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you most ticklish on this lithe body of yours, Lilith? Don\u2019t want to tell us? Oh, we\u2019ll <i>make</i> you talk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though you\u2019re not laughing for now, even I can tell these boobies are ticklish! Look at how they just want to move away from your own ticklish feathers! Tickle tickle tickle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was a high succubus, even they too had their limits as she was unable to hold her laughter back for any longer, the sound of her guffaws and giggles bursting out like a rushing stream. \u201cI-I said\u2026 S-Stop it\u2026 Stop it right no-ahahahahAHAHHAAAHAA! Damn you Va-aaAHAHAHHALKYRIES! WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE-EHEHEHEHEEE, I\u2019LL MAKE YOU ALL SCREAM WITH LAHAHHAHHAAUGHTER! GAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!\u201d Still dedicated to holding up the portal, Lilith somehow still managed to power the spell amidst her raucous and frenzied laughter, her own body straining itself by sheer force of will to not move from her position. Not one to give up so easily, the Valkyrie\u2019s continued to tickle the lone succubus, knowing that she would break sooner or later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this might be your last chances to be in Lilith\u2019s good graces, you\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling the magic of the ritual that Lilith was holding still thick in the air, the thought of dark magic entered your mind as the symbol on your hand glowed purple, a sign that it was activating. Making sure that you kept out of the lines of sight of the Valkyrie\u2019s distracted by their tickling task, you went to each of them, waving your hand slowly above their heads as the magic took over, going along with your desire\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                               ************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think that she\u2019s taking some time to break, sisters? She\u2019s a lot tougher than she looks, heheheeee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that look on her face-ahahahahaaa!

HahahahAHAhahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Edyr and the Valkyries giggled and chuckled amongst themselves as their fingers never stopped exploring their victim\u2019s silky smooth skin, not once did they ever wonder why was it taking so long for Lilith to break, nor why were they suddenly bursting out into giggles and laughter occasionally for no apparent reason\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                 *************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a creative plan, mortal. I would have never thought to use illusion magic\u2019s like that.\u201d Giving a smug grin of approval, both you and Lilith watched the scene unfold besides the sitting succubus, where the Valkyries had unknowingly left their victim. Now mistakenly treating a wooden peg coat as the succubus\u2019s substitution as they were trapped in your illusion granted to them by the powers of the mark in your hand, they had retained their original positions. Instead of tickling demonic flesh however, their digits constantly teased each other\u2019s skin, none of them wiser of the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a tad sorry for Edyr, who was hysterically laughing as the brown-haired Valkyrie fluttered her fingers across the former\u2019s ticklish ribs, you knew that if you were to disobey your temporary demonic  masters a much worse fate would have befallen you until they got tired of you, which might be all eternity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that you were fidgeting nervously, Lilith\u2019s lips curled into a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, human. Even though I do absolutely <b>hate</b> being tickled, I understand your circumstances. However, do not expect the rest of my sisters to be as kind as me. For now head west, where another of my fellow sisters is in battle with one of heaven\u2019s warriors.\u201d Clicking her tongue in annoyance Lilith cocked her head to the side. \u201cIn fact, I can even hear her screaming for help through our mental link. Always the loudest of us\u2026 Go now human, and don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make sure to keep these Valkyries busy for a <i>looong</i> time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting one last pitying look at Edyr, you parted ways with her as you headed down the stairs of the attic, exiting the building.

Perhaps she had sent you off on a wild goose chase?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to leave, you hear a snarling voice call out to you atop some boxes. \u201cHuman, I know you have been marked. Come over and help me, mortal, or I\u2019ll flay you alive!\u201d Slowly turning around, expecting to come face to face with an similarly imposing succubus such as the one you met before, or someone as beautiful as Lilith, a blank look appeared on your face as you see only the head of a succubus on top of the wooden box with only one horn protruding out from under her hair, the other horn cut at its stump,  by who-knows-what, hidden underneath her dark hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill caught by surprise at seeing a talking head, an impatient look quickly appeared on her face. \u201cBow before me mortal, for I am Sarixis of the thirteen clans of succubi, bearer of the cursed tongue!\u201d Scratching your head, you wondered how you were going to tackle this. \u201cUhmm\u2026 My apologies Lady Sarixis, but if I may ask\u2026 What happened to the rest of your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a prideful \u2018hmph\u2019, Sarixis somehow managed to look down at you even as hard as it may be for just a talking head. \u201cThat damned paladin and her holy sword \u2018Rasheed\u2019\u2026 She managed to catch me off guard and use that damnable sword\u2019s power which allows its user to slice anything into pieces while keeping them alive. By the time I had realized what had happened, she had broken my body into parts, taking some of them back with her, laughing as she said wanted to \u2018play\u2019 with them. The nerve of her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get Sarixis to calm down, you proposed an idea. \u201cSo if we somehow manage to get all the pieces of your body together again, perhaps you would be whole?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that would most likely happen. However, since I was stuck here as just a talking head, I couldn\u2019t see where the rest of my body had been taken to. I only know that they\u2019re still close by. Now carry me human, I\u2019ll guide you to where I think they are. After that, I'll torture that paladin for 10 \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging your shoulders in defeat, you gently carried Sarixis\u2019 head in the crook of one arm as she directed you to head\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need those to strangle any paladins we might find.\u201d Nodding nervously, you followed Sarixis\u2019 cues. As much as a disembodied head could turn, you found yourself guided down winding alleyways by the occasional threats and head tilts. Eventually, you opened the door to a musky and empty bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the place?\u201d With the only light shining through the cracked windows, you could barely make out the worn-out furniture its previous owners had left in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake no mistake, mortal. I can sense my limbs nearby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be correct. Sadly, you won\u2019t live to use them.\u201d A flash of silver. That was all that appeared from the corner of your eye before your body instinctively ducked into a roll. From the shadows behind a counter, a female silhouette emerged. With the only defining features being her cold face hiding beneath a mouth mask, her long black hair tied in a ponytail only brought one two words to your mind: Hired Kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow pertinent. To have dodged my kunai\u2019s\u2026 You must be have been <i>chosen</i> as well.\u201d Raising up her right hand, you noticed a glowing white mark pulsating under her fingerless gloves. Bringing up your own, you see her narrowing her eyes. Before she could speak, however, a scream echoed in the room. \u201cYOU! I know you\u2019re hiding parts of my body! Give them back to me now, mortal, and you\u2019ll only be suffering for ten centuries under my wrath!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoh? By \u2018parts\u2019, might you be referring to this?\u201d The other female kicked an object from behind the counter before placing her foot atop it. From the alabaster skin to the small pieces of fabric covering the object\u2019s chest, Sarixis gritted her teeth at the sight of her upper body. While it had been cleanly sliced around her neck and ribs, neither her arms nor the rest of her body was anywhere nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bitch! Hand over my body, or I\u2019ll-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll what, Miss Succubus? Laugh for me?\u201d Placing the glowing mark on her hand over the disembodied part\u2019s ribs, bright light flared for a few seconds. In the same instant, your host screeched out in hysterics, laughter becoming intermixed with her cursing. When the light faded, you could almost feel the smirk on the stranger\u2019s lips at Sarixis\u2019 heavy breathing.  \u201cThat was just a taste of what my benefactor\u2019s powers are capable of. While I hadn\u2019t been too keen on receiving this\u2026 Perhaps it could be a useful tool in future missions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching your adversary admire her own mark, you gulped. You barely even had an idea what yours was truly capable of. What did the succubus who gave you it said? Something about coiled rope...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately racking your mind for the memory, you heard your opponent crudely kick aside the body part underneath her feet. \u201cWe kunoichi don\u2019t usually reveal our names, as our victims won\u2019t live to remember them. An exception can be made however, seeing as how these aren\u2019t usual circumstances. My name is Kugumi. Carve this name into your mind, mercenary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d You gently set Sarixis\u2019 head onto a table, ignoring the stream of expletives from her lips at the kunoichi\u2019s fate. \u201cThat first hit just caught me off-guard. Let\u2019s see you try it again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to.\u201d Feeling chills as she said that, her fingers easily toyed with a kunai. \u201cThat first strike was all I needed. <b>Fall</b> for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next moment, you felt your knees hitting the floor. It was almost as if gravity had been excessively increased for you. Your arms could barely even support your weight when you lurched forward, much less do anything as Kugumi closed the distance. \u201cIs this your mark\u2019s ability!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct.\u201d Giving your side a few pokes, you grunted as your elbows gave way, leaving you unable to move on the ground. \u201cWith every touch from my weapons or fingers, I can \u2018inflict\u2019 an action onto anything, or anyone. For example\u2026 <b>Spread your arms</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her fingers whisk along your shoulders, a grunt escaped your mouth when you felt your limbs following her every command. \u201cIs that all you can do? Forcing people into weird poses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. <b>Electrify</b>.\u201d Kugumi said, her weight pressing down on your back. Grabbing your hips with her hands, you let out an unnatural shriek at the electric-like tickles coming from that area. By the time she released her fingers, you were already gasping in the same way Sarixis was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuff\u2026 What\u2026 was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a taste of what I can do. <b>Raise your arms</b>.\u201d You felt another soft touch, before your body was forced to obey. A lone finger gently scratched in your underarms, your lips spreading in a ticklish grimace. \u201cSuch vulnerability. Come to me, <b>Feathers</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a finger tapping into your other hollow, snickers snuck their way through your mouth at the sensation of a dozen plumy feathers. Caressing you even through your shirt, it was insanity how two fingers were almost enough to break you out into giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch tenacity. I suppose I should try something more effective to someone associated with demons.\u201d Kugumi thought aloud to herself. You sucked in your belly when you felt ten fingers lightly planting themselves there, her next words almost a whisper. \u201c<b>Searing Light</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaaahhahahahhaaaat is this?! Geehehheheheet out of my clotheeeheheheeehees!\u201d You howled with laughter at the burning, ticklish feelings coming from her fingertips. It was certainly an apt description, \u2018Searing Light\u2019. To denizens of hell, it must have felt as if their nerves were seared with the memory of unfelt ticklishness. \u201cThehehheheees isn\u2019t fahahhahaaair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever heard of a kunoichi playing fair?\u201d When the light faded, you saw your tormentor waving a stiff, purple feather in front of your immobile head. You could almost feel her cheeky grin as she lightly tickled your neck and nose, causing your face to scrunch up. \u201cYou can barely even hold up against a feather. I almost feel sorry for your choice. However, we each merely picked a side. I just happened to pick the winning one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your eyes catching the mark on her hand glowing ever more brightly\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the centre was a large spire like construction, black and twisted with a magic light on the top of it. To each side of the spire were two figures, stretched out with black tenndrils along their arms and legs and... wings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, you realise that these are Angels a male and a female, some of Heaven's greatest warriors although in much diminished circumstances right now. Both were stretched out, the tendrils holding their limbs tightly and they were gagged. Not helping matters was the fact that both had been gagged and stripped to a loincloth as they were subjected to a very terrible looking tickle torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Angels were screaming into their gags, being muffled as their almost naked bodies were being stroked and teased by black feathers, conjured up by the spire and designed to torment them. They covered the most sensitive spots with the soft, long feet of the Angels having a feather to each sole, stroking across them lazily. A plume twirled in each navel, flicked across their underarms and, even worse, circled around their nipples with slow precision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the flushed appearance of their skin, the sweat slowly moving downwards and the fact neither had noticed you or Edyr, it appeared they had been here for a long time. Their laughter and torment were powering the spire and, therefore, the portals that were being conjured. Looking at the Angels, you noticed that the man's loincloth had a significcant bulge in it and the female's nipples were standing as hard as pebbles as the feathers brushed over and around them. As much as it must have felt like torture, it seemed like they either enjoyed it on some level, or the feathers could arouse even the most stalwart of Heaven's warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Edyr and see that she's gone a bright red. Whether it's from outrage from seeing two Angels treated in such a way or the sight was shamefully pleasing to her, you weren't too sure. She recovered swiftly though and managed to choke out \"W-We must rescue them! C-C'mon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdyr rushed forward past you, eager to rescue the Angels and...</span></div></div>",

However, as they got close to you, the symbol on your hand started to glow dimly as they barely slitter past you, making no attempt at tickling or attacking you like they are doing with Edyr, a fact the Valkyrie was too busy fending for herself to pick up on. Heaving a sigh of relief at the handy tool that the succubus had given you, you pressed forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure that your companion was still preoccupied with the other tentacles trying to grab and pull at her armor to get underneath to her skin; you glance at where the other two females were. While Edyr was doing a decent job at protecting her own body, with only the occasional tentacle slipping past her defenses before it was sliced in half, the same could not be said for the beautiful winged female beside her as the tentacles had changed their tactics, two of them flicking her erect nipples up and down with their tips, tears of mirth and the sound of hysterical screaming could be seen and heard even through the muffled gag on her mouth. Clearly neither of the angels had experienced this sort of thing while they were in heaven, both of their skins looking extremely smooth to the touch, which the spire was exploiting to its advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the center of the construct, you could see the male\u2019s angels eyes widen as he saw that the tentacles did not even try to make contact with you, the pieces of the puzzle quickly coming together in his mind. However, before he could even try to utter a word through the gag, a swarm of tentacles dived into his loincloth as he squeezed his eyes shut again in ticklish torment, barely audible male laughter coming from his gag. Walking past him, the swarm of purple tendrils opened a path for you, towards its center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the mechanism of the angel's torture, you lightly tapped the surface of the orb sitting atop the spire, a purple mist started to form in the orb, the method for deactivating it wordlessly forming in your mind. Although as you were about to initiate it, you notice another option that you could choose which would send an alarm of intruders near the spire to all of Hell\u2019s nearby forces.

You're not sure what the forces of good would do to traitors, but it can't be pleasant. You tap into the magic of the spire, feeling it go through you before focusing on the source. The magic is incredibly powerful, it almost overwhelming you as you lay a hand on the spire but you manage to rally. You're not entirely sure how you do it, all you know is that you call out for help from any of Hell's denizens. You don't have to wait long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a burst of darkness, a portal opens in front of the spire, causing Edyr to gape in horror, allowing the tentacles to reach up towards her. The wiggling appendages struck at her armpits, thighs and even her butt as they tickled over the sensitive skin. She instantly buckled and collapsed to the ground, allowing more tentacles to assault her sensitive skin. Edyr's mouth opened wide as she let out loud laughter from her skin being teased by the tentacles squirming and rubbing against it. Her arms and legs were pulled tightly and down to the ground as three figures stepped forward out other portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were tall, imposing and beautiful. You see the two Angels momentarily break from their laughter to look at them in horror, before the tentacles rummage around in their loincloths and make their moaning laughter resume to its previous levels. Stepping forward appears to be the leader of the trio, a tall woman with unnaturally pale skin and long dark hair that fell down to her hips. She had long nails, painted black and fangs poked out from the top of her teeth. A figure hugging red dress clung to her bofy, barely concealing her ample cleavage. She was a Vampire, a powerful servant of Hell and flanked by two succubi as she stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, looks like we got here in time.\" She said in a low, sultry voice as she and her companions stood over the howling Edyr, the Valkyrie trying all the harder to pull free as she saw the trio in front of her. Her armour was being yanked from her body though, leaving her completely vulnerable and quite naked while the tentacles wiggled over her now naked upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire smirked as she saw the two Angels and Valkyrie driven to hysteria thanks to the torturous tickling, being forced to scream with laughter as their naked skin was played with, the forced arousal adding humiliation on top of it all \"Since we have some guests girls, why not...</span></div></div>",

I know that you have the few magics that the succubus have given you, but please, take this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to ask the question of what was the mirror's purpose, as if reading your mind, the Vampire gave a haughty laugh. \"That my dear, is a trans-dimensional mirror, capable of transporting one person into it, allowing you to keep them in it for all eternity, if you so choose it. It also has the ability for anyone outside to touch anything inside, but not the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gears clicked in your head, your eyes widened as you knew your mission just got harder. \"You want <i>me</i> to trap their leader inside this mirror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the second benefactor licked her lips, already eyeing the Valkyrie who was still hysterically laughing due to the professional administrations of the additional succubi. \"In a nutshell, yes.

With a cry of outrage, Yvette is surrounded by darkness that pulls her right into the mirror, the magic working incredibly quickly. You look to the ground, seeing that Yvette's weapons and clothing have been left on the ground, making you blush a little as you realise that you'd stripped the woman, as well as capturing her. You pause, amazed by what you've seen until you here a small voice call out \"W-What's happened?! Let me go this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you turn to look at the mirror, seeing the trapped Yvette, held in a spread eagle position as the mirror held her at bay. With an increasing amount of blush to your cheeks, you see that the drapes match the curtains, so to speak. Yvette herself has gone a deep red, but you chalk that up to the look of pure fury on her face right now \"What have you done?!\" She demanded, yanking at the ethereal chains around her ankles and wrists that kept her trapped \"No mortal should be able to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had help.\" You answer, looking to the clock tower and sigh, knowing that you're in far too deep to turn back now. You start to walk up the stairs, Yvette howling protests and demands evey step of the way until they're drowned out by familiar laughter. When you reach the top, the Angels are still in their previous positions, although the tickling torment in their eyes now showing desperate lust as well. The tentacles under their loincloths tickled and stroked in the incredibly sensitive genitals of both of them and even Heaven's purest agents couldn't hold out against such tantalising torment for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centre of the room was taken up by Edyr though, who had been held up and stretched out tight by the tentacles as the two succubi and the Vampire teased her body. Dressed only in a loincloth that left little to the imagination, the Valkyrie's body was flushed red and sweating as she was tormented by the evil beings. Both her feet were being licked and sucked by the succubi, their long tongues licking over the ticklish skin as the two tormentors moaned joyfully at the taste. They sucked on the toes as well, going at them eagerly and even flicking their long nails over Edyr's heels, making her feet jerk violently with each touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire herself was at Edyr's torso, smiling with an evil glee as her long fingernails dragged over the Valkyrie's heaving chest, making her scream with laughter. Driven half-mad from the teasing touch, Edyr's face contorted into laughter as her body was tickled by her tormentors, the three getting great pleasure from her agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing you, the Vampire did a double take before breaking into a wide smile \"Oh my.\" She said, leaving Edyr for the moment. Whatever relief the Valkyrie got from that though soon vanished as the Succubi simply compensated by reaching up and tickling the insides of her thighs, wriggling their fingers into the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've completed your mission, and so quickly!\" The Vampire said as she approached you, taking the mirror from your hand and holding it aloft so that you could see as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the cursed object, you saw Yvette's previous anger and defiance melt away, replaced by sheer horror as she saw the woman now holding her prison \"M-Magla!\" She gasped in terror as he face went pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you do remember me!\" Magla said with a cruel laugh before turning to you \"I had a run in with Yvette before. She tried a raid to free some of her comrades from Hell's ticklish grasp only to spend a few days under my care. Sadly, she escaped, but it was a very fun few days, wasn't it my pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Yvette flinch and look more horrified by the moment as Magla speaks, but she rallies for the final bit of defiance \"I-I will get out of this Magla! I-I did so before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not again.\" Magla replied, conjuring up a feather, black as midnight, before placing it into the mirror. You see that while already rather long, the plume kept its original size rather than shrink down like Yvette had done. When the feather brushed over the archer, it was able to stroke her breasts, belly, womanhood and thighs with a single stroke. Instantly, Yvette gave an inhuman shriek as the tickling began, the giant (for her) feather, teasing so much ticklish skin at once that it was unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I look forward to thinking of so many new games to play with her.\" Magla says to you, leaving the mirror hanging in middair with her magic, the feather continuing to tickle Yvette's body from head to toe, literally \"These pious Heavenly types are so much fun to break down with tickling. First, they beg for it to stop, but the real fun comes when they lose all their high and mighty morals and start begging for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a laugh at that, Mala gives you a smile which sets you on edge \"As for now, I think...</span></div></div>",

The method to pass on my power is a bit\u2026 Unorthodox, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the floating mirror, the black plume still giving no mercy to the hysterically laughing Yvette trapped inside, the Vampire glided over to your side, one hand darting over your eyes. Feeling her husky breath now dangerously close to your neck, you gulp, remembering the tales of fellow bounty hunters who had encountered Vampires as well, only to fall prey to satiate their hunger. \u201cA-Are you going to bite my neck and turn me into a Vampire too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a haughty laugh whisped into your ear, you involuntarily swallowed your throat. \u201cNo mortal, I will not do something as <i>unsophisticated</i> as biting your nape. I did say that I had a unique way of transferring my powers, didn\u2019t I? Try not to squirm too much\u2026\u201d Expecting sharp canines to sink into your neck at any moment, you were caught unaware as fingers started to dig into your sides, causing you to splutter and snicker at the surprise tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your body tried to do a weird dance of pulling away from Magla, the female Vampire merely glided along with your macabre movements, her fingers not leaving your sides for one moment. Gliding her sharp nails easily under your clothes, you had to admit that she was an extremely skilled tickler, the wiggling and pinching motions of her digits already leaving you laughing and gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought that your knees would give out under you, Magla gracefully withdrew her hands, giving you room to catch your breath. \u201cThe pact is complete. Now you\u2019ll be able to use one of the many powers that I hold through the use your mark which is the ability to temporarily travel into the mirror dimension at will.\u201d As your face lit up in awe as you eyed up yourself, trying to find perhaps a change in your body, you were disappointed as no bright light or dark smoke came out from you. Well, at least you were glad that you didn\u2019t grow any wings or canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re in disbelief. Why don\u2019t you give it a try on our friend in the mirror? I\u2019m sure she could use the company.\u201d Beckoning you towards the floating mirror, you stretch out your hand and activated your mark. Already feeling a force sucking you in, the world around you faded to black as you were transported into the same realm that Yvette was sent to by yours truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                   *********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding into the darkness with a small grunt at not being able to clearly see the floor of this dimension, you were relieved to find that unlike the disciple of Artemis, you had kept your clothes upon being taken into the mirror. Hearing tortured laughter coming from in front of you, you looked up with a crimson blush on your face again, seeing the still-naked and bound Yvette being dusted over the entire front of her body with the black feather, which while in the real world was only about the length of your palm, was now the size of a fully-grown adult, having no trouble at all at tickling every inch of Yvette\u2019s body at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure that you carefully avoided the floating feather, you walked over to the laughing female\u2019s side. \u201cSorry for deceiving you, but it was either you or me. And hey, you know what they say, survival of the fittest and all.\u201d Gibberish words intermixed with her constant laughter; you took a guess that she was probably not saying very nice things about you, hearing the occasional cursing in between her giggling. \u201cWell in your case, its survival of the most ticklish. To the victor go the spoils eh?\u201d Choosing not to waste any more time, you dug your fingers into her abdomen, the feeling of taut muscles underneath her smooth skin no surprise to you. However to Yvette, the belly tickling along with the feather torture was already more than enough to send her into hysterics, the latter shrieking with laughter, vainly pulling at her ethereal bonds with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoochie Coochie Coo! Such a ticklish belly. Are all the disciples as ticklish as you? I must go find out for myself!\u201d Tears of mirth rolling down her eyes, Yvette didn\u2019t even have the energy to swear anymore as only laughter poured out from her throat now, her strength mostly spent. Caught up in the moment of teasing a weakened opponent who couldn\u2019t fight back, you shifted your body unknowingly in between the giant feather and Yvette\u2019s own body. As the gigantic plume stroked itself across your back, you were surprised that it tickled even more than you thought it would, perhaps enchanted by the Magla\u2019s magic. Letting out a few short but surprised giggles, you felt your vision fade away again, much like when you entered the mirror dimension\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                  *********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your eyes slowly adjusted to the light of the attic again, familiar laughter, both male and female, filled your ears. With the tentacles previously tickling the female angel now having been doubled as they now covered every inch of her ticklish skin, her screams of pleasure and laughter rose to new heights as the tendrils openly fondled with her breasts, many of them flicking their hardened peaks like a light switch. What\u2019s more, a swarm of tendrils had congregated around her womanhood, stroking all along her inner thighs and genitalia with not a care in the world. Letting out another loud moan, begging for more tickling, even you could tell that she was a lost cause, her mind already broken from the tickling and constant pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the female angel was certainly broken, you couldn\u2019t tell who was having it worse, her or your former companion, Edyr. Now with only the succubi accompanying her like you last witnessed, they had certainly found new areas to torment their prey to get her laughing as much as the other female, a lusty look on both their of their faces as they drank in the laughter. With one of them skittering her fingertips under her jiggling chest while the other raked her sharp nails like a rake up and down her belly, even the Valkyrie stood no chance as she herself was lost to laughter, begging constantly for the tickling to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as soon as you saw Magla sitting near the male angel, you knew instantly that he was having it the worst of the three. Using only one hand to slowly pleasure him, the seductive Vampire had placed her pale feet near his hands, keeping them just out of his reach, enough to drive him almost to insanity with how close they were. Every time he tried to reach for them however, she merely sped up the rate at which her hand moved up and down, expertly making him moan. Even worse, she had begun to use a similar midnight feather to glide along the length of his erect member, boyish laughter mixed in with moans. Unable to concentrate between laughing, moaning and reaching for her vulnerable soles, he could only resign himself to doing the former two, not having even the ability to even think straight through the multiple orgasms Magla was putting him through. Turning to face you, a cruel smirk appeared on her face, clearly enjoying tormenting the angel. \u201cDid you have your fun in the mirror world?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it was something else entirely to say the least. When I got tickled by your feather though, everything turned to black and I was quickly kicked out.\u201d A look of mock surprise entered her face as Magla made a show of forgetting to tell you something, giving her feather another stroke as the male angel writhing in laughter. \u201cAh yes, I forgot to tell you. If somehow you get tickled and burst out laughing in the mirror realm, you\u2019ll be forcefully expelled out until sometime later. You\u2019ll also be forcefully kicked out after a few minutes inside there, seeing as how you don\u2019t have my full power. This much should be able to suffice in aiding with your duties, however. Now scuttle along and leave me with my toys, before I make you join that little disciple of Artemis in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily stepping back from Magla who grinned as she got back to her task of breaking the male angel\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought I told you to-\u201d Before she could finish berating you however, her eyes opened wide at the realization of being tricked as the mirror flashed again at being used, blinding light flooding the attic. As willed yourself into the mirror as well, you noticed a red dress now lying in a pile on the floor where Magla had been as you take a mental note that if someone was transported against their will, any belongings would be left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding more gracefully than the previous time you were here, you could now see two naked beautiful females stretched out before you were there was only one, a furious Magla also bound in the same position that Yvette had been. While the leader of the disciples had a more toned and lithe look to her body, Magla by comparison had a more curvaceous and filled-out proportions, easily giving the disciple a run for her money in terms of their looks. Raising your hand, you stopped the feather which was tormenting Yvette all this time, the latter letting out a few last giggling gasps as she gratefully got her breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMortal, you dare to trap me in my own mirror? When I get out, I\u2019ll send you to an eternity of torture in my castle\u2019s own private dungeons. Now release me at once.\u201d Trying all that she could to use her powers to free herself from the ethereal bonds holding her, you were relieved at the fact that even she could not break free from the mirrors powers. Ignoring the seething look of anger that she gave you, you walked over to her side, innocently dragging a finger up and down her pale sides. Trying to shy away from your wiggling digit, the furious look on the vampire\u2019s face soon turned to one of fear as she finally understood what you were about to do. \u201cW-Wait, now hold on mortal, how about we talk about thi-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been acting rather arrogantly at me, haven\u2019t you? I had a really curious question in mind since the moment I saw you. Are Vampires\u2026 ticklish?\u201d Now running all ten of your fingers against her ticklish sides, you were rewarded with howling laughter as Magla\u2019s body strained in the air, futilely trying to pull away. Wiggling your fingers in the space between her ribs and her chest, a loud shriek of girlish laughter was heard as you discovered a particularly sensitive area for the naked vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Are you going to let me go? I promise I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d Almost forgetting that there was also another person trapped in the mirror, you walked over to where Yvette was, placing a hand on her firm belly. \u201cOh don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t be as mean as your Vampire friend over here. As for what I want you to do\u2026 How about you help me find out who is the more ticklish species, humans or vampires?\u201d Dashing the look of fearful hope in her eyes, you skittered your fingertips against her belly, sending the disciple back into girlish giggles as well, both of your hands each busy with tormenting both occupants of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to tease the laughing Yvette\u2019s rippling belly, playing them with your digits like piano, your other hand wandered to where Magla\u2019s large chest was. Playfully running your nails along their sides, the vampire gave a sudden gasp before collapsing into another bout of giggles, surprised that even her breasts was that ticklish. \u201cSuch a ticklish chest! I suppose it\u2019s fitting for wearing such a tight dress. Speaking of which\u2026 If I recall correctly, someone else was also wearing a tight dress\u2026\u201d Even though her chest couldn\u2019t compare with Magla\u2019s globes, Yvette\u2019s own chest were still quite ample and perky enough for you to run your fingers over their stiff nipples, the disciple screaming again with frenzied laughter at the sudden stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back from the still-laughing pair, their brief respite was short-lived as you waved your hands in the air again, conjuring yet another similar giant black feather, exactly identical to the first one floating in wait in the air. Grinning as you pointed towards both Magla and Yvette, the plumes quickly got to work again. Screaming aloud with hysterical laughter once more at the feathery fronds stroking across her whole body, the disciples loud laughter was soon joined by her former captor\u2019s own feminine laughter as she too experienced what a dozen feather stroking all over her pale skin felt like as well. Patting yourself on the back for a job well done\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t until that the vampire managed to bark out a phrase you couldn\u2019t understand did you notice something amiss. It was too late by then however as the lighting zipped from her hand to where you were, wrapping around your wrists and ankles as it brought you beside Magla, in the same position that both she and Yvette was, pulling your arms and feet apart in the air. Testing your new magical bonds, you were dismayed that the mark of the succubus did nothing to it, leaving you hanging in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her magic to give the tormenting feathers sweeping across her body and the disciple\u2019s a temporary pause; the still-furious vampire slowly got her breath back as she turned to face you, baring her canines. \u201cYou think you can trap <b>me</b>, Magla, inside <b>my</b> mirror?! I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret, mortal. If the person who trapped the others in the mirror is expelled out from it, all the contents in the mirror are freed too.\u201d Already nervous at the growing magic\u2019s in her hand, you could only watch as Magla pointed towards you. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure that when I\u2019m out of here, your laughter will be the first thing decorating the room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another spell shot from her hands, this time instead of chaining you, it merely wrapped around your hand, its other end also wrapping around Yvette\u2019s own wrist with only a thin green line in the air telling you that it was there. \u201cOh don\u2019t give me that curious look, human. You\u2019ll find out what it does soon enough. Try not to laugh, will you?\u201d Thinking about this, along with the warning that she gave you earlier about being forcefully expelled from the mirror, you wondered what the vampire was cooking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in the midst of your thoughts, you were called back to earth as Magla snapped her fingers, the giant plume stroking Yvette now coming back to life, animatedly brushing across her legs as the disciple burst out in laughter again. To your surprise, you almost let yourself burst out giggling as well as you felt the sensation of feathery fronds moving across your knees, even though there was actually nothing there. Already guessing what magic Magla had casted, your cheeks bulged with the effort of not letting a single chuckle out, a wide crack of a smile on your fa\u00e7ade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ticklish too are we? Don\u2019t let out a peep, or else these fingers will be the ones stroking across those legs.\u201d Gesturing with her finger in an up-and-down motion, the black plume now shifted its movements, licking the front of Yvette\u2019s body with its feathery fronds. As you heard hysterical laughter coming somewhere from your side, you had no time to think about such things as you too felt the exact same sensations, your body wriggling from side to side as it tried to avoid the phantom feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears of mirth already in your eyes along with a forced smile that stretched from ear to ear, Magla taunted even further, sensing your weakness. \u201cIs this all you thought would happen if you dared to tickle me? No, when I break myself free, I\u2019ll torment you for hours and hours on end. I\u2019ll even make you my personal plaything for all my clan members to enjoy. Rejoice human, for you are going to become property of the infamous vampire, Magla!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re quite stubborn, aren\u2019t you? It seems you\u2019ve forced my hand. I\u2019d like to enlighten you on a small fact of the magic I\u2019ve casted upon you.

Let\u2019s try opening that mouth of yours from a different angle\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready resigning herself to her plan, Magla snapped her fingers once more as she relaxed her body, another thread of magic, this time red in color, attaching itself from her wrist to yours. As the feather above her slowly came back to life again, however, this time instead of stroking and tickling over her entire body, it delved just its tip into the space between her pale thighs, slowly wiggling in there. A slight blush appearing on Magla\u2019s face as she let out a soft gasp, you too felt a warm yet pleasurable sensation coming from in between your legs as you fought back the urge to let out a moan yourself, already regretting the decision of making Magla an enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhats wrong, human? Can\u2019t handle the pressure? Or should I say pleasure? Here, have another wave of sweet bliss, you sensitive little thing.\u201d Letting out another moan as she made the feather to stroke faster, you felt a crimson flush fill your cheeks as well as the urge to moan, along with the urge to burst out laughing, slowly but steadily wore down your mental defenses. Even though you could see and expect what was about to happen, that fact didn\u2019t help you very much as even you couldn\u2019t touch the phantom sensations, much less stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout to break soon, hmm? In that case, let me deliver the finish right here and now. Laugh and moan in agony, you ticklish human!\u201d Snapping her fingers for the last time, Magla caused the feather stimulating her to now stroke her breasts and her womanhood, her loud moans now echoing with each pass of the dark plume. Furthermore, the feather teasing Yvette had resumed its original position of moving along her entire body, with not even an inch of her taut skin being spared from the wrath of the feathery fronds, tears of mirth rolling down the hysterical disciple's beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready on the verge of giving in to lust and libido, along with the fact that your dam of penned up laughter was about to come gushing forth like a tidal wave in the next few seconds\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The city now lay before you and you had a mission to do, although you were unsure about how to do it. You had to get information on the forces of Heaven, or the cursed mark you'd been given might just start up again. Or Magla might carry on with her threat and make you spend an eternity alongside Yvette. That thought makes you shiver and you decide to press on to find anything to do and prevent being punished in some manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your ways through the streets of the city, wondering about what to do when you hear the sounds of battle faintly in the distance. You make your way towards the sounds, getting louder as you can clearly make out mad laughter and cries for mercy as you reach the corner of a street. Not wanting to risk making yourself vulnerable again, you instead go to a nearby tower and start to climb up its stairs, being able to get a clear view of a large city square two storeys up, the sights and sounds of battle much clearer now. Looking over the square, you could see the forces of Heaven and Hell locked in battle and Heaven wasn't doing too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a start, they were outnumbered, with their backs against a wall. You see several archers protected by Valkyries and warriors with shields linking up like a shield. You see by the outfits that the archers are disciples of Artemis and you wonder how they would react to the knowledge that their leader was now a ticklish plaything to Magla. They managed to carry on shooting a steady stream of arrows into the Hellish hordes around them, Demons, Orcs and other creatures of the night jeering as a dark sorceress managed to deflect the arrows or make them vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's even worse for the warriors of Heaven is that several of their number had already been captured and pulled away from the front lines. Hoisted up into the air, men and women had been stripped naked alike and were now being tickled by several flying Pixies, the evil cousins of Fairies darting into the skin and tormenting and arousing their victims. Such a tactic was certainly designed to destroy the morale of their opponents and you can start to see the pressure getting to those remaining, the horde pushing at the shield wall as Heaven's defenders started to weaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it seemed as if things couldn't get any worse, one of the sorcerers from Hell called out an incantation and a large, four armed naga on one side of the shield wall vanished, only to appear in the midst of the archers. Wasting no time, the snake woman cried out with glee and stretched out her four arms, tickling the women archers along their sides and underarms, sending their aim into chaos and diverting the attention of the other warriors of Heaven at a crucial point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point...</span></div></div>",

Hey, you would even be helping them with the battle at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing down the stairs before making sure that you weren\u2019t followed, you circled around the circumference of the square using the many alleyways littered about in the city until you heard the sound of metal clashing with metal and laughter just outside a particular alley. Peering out from the corner, you could see that you\u2019ve successfully gotten behind the enemy lines, per say, the backs of the rear line of Archers exposed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smirk on your face, you quickly got to work, making sure that you weren\u2019t seen. As one of the Disciples was about to knock another arrow onto her bow, you slid behind her, giving her a playful poke to her side before running away as the archer giggled, missing her shot before being pulled into the air by a group of devious pixies, her laughter now being added into the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying yet another pair of female Valkyries wielding swords, still in combat with the four armed naga who had drawn two of her scimitars as well, you crawled through the various heavenly warriors distracted by the ongoing battle until you\u2019ve reached behind them, a plan already forming in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the naga spotted you through the furious clashing of steel, you gave her a smile as she acknowledged the mark on your hand, both of you exchanging a knowing glance. Tip-toeing behind one Valkyrie, you quickly pulled her helmet over her head, effectively blinding her as she dropped her sword, panic setting into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What\u2019s going on! I can\u2019t see! Someone help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other Valkyrie turned to where her partner was, she made the fatal mistake of ignoring the naga in front of her. As the latter slithered surprisingly quickly to her opponent, by the time the Valkyrie had turned back, it was already too late as four pairs of hands found their way through the gaps in between her tight armor, forty fingers wiggling about in her ribs and underarms. As the heavenly warrior dropped to the ground, already bawling with feminine laughter, you kept her partner busy, giving her sides a quick squeeze whenever she tried to take off her helmet, forcing her to clamp her arms around her torso in giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good for a human. Leave these two to me. I\u2019ll make sure that they stay laughing for a <b>long</b> time.\u201d Giving her a thumbs up, you dived back into the fray of confused and disorientated heavenly warriors, searching for your next victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even you couldn\u2019t expect what happened next. One moment you were moving through both male and female warriors of heaven alike, and the next moment you were on the ground, a weight pressing into your back as a dagger slid next to your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk, human.

Long, black hair and a worried expression greets you as the Valkyrie helps you to your feet \"Any friend of Edyr is a friend of mine.\" She says \"I am her Diana, her sister in arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod politely, further introductions cut short by a screech of laughter to your side. You both look to see that a tall, muscular barbarian warrior fall to his knees, his loincloth being invaded by a rather sneaky Pixie. You can't really tell what's happening underneath the clothing, but it's obvious that the barabarian is having somewhat conflicting feelings. His howls of laughter are broken up by moans as his loincloth soon shows a noticeable bulge underneath, the tickling mixed up with whatever the Pixie had in her ability to tease him. The barbarian's weakness is soon noted and several minions of Hell grab him and drag him into the horde to meet a ticklish captivity, no doubt. His gap in the line was filled, but there was little chance that the same could happen for others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of screams came from the archers as the Naga quickly fell among them once the Valkyries had been tickled to exhaustion. Their bows of very little effect at such close range, the Disciples of Artemis found their robes being torn open and bare skin tickled as the Naga unleashed a frenzied attack against the group that saw them scatter as much as they could in the limited space.

As the archer\u2019s continued to hold a firm grip, another two amongst their rank quickly straddled onto her vulnerable back, digging both their pairs of wiggling hands into her four underarms, making the four-armed tickling force grind to a halt as giggles started to bubble out of her mouth, the amount of tickling spots on her body twice that of any normal human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, victory cannot be obtained without sacrifice. While the disciples were busy taking care of the naga, the large group of mischievous pixies had no one attending to them, giving them free reign into the suddenly open hole in heaven\u2019s defensive wall.

Dropping her sword from shock, the Valkyrie is open to the chains shooting out and grabbing the rest of her limbs, stretching her body to being as vulnerable as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Diana unable to defend herself, you continue tickling her, her breastplate leaving her underarms, hips and a thin sliver of her midriff open to a tickle attack, your fingers wiggling over these spots and making her burst into helpless laughter, yanking at her chains helplessly as she spluttered demands to be let go. Her words were to only get worse as you walk around and look her in the eye, the Valkyrie's face frozen in shock as she realises that she was been betrayed \"YoouuuOOHOOOHAAHAHAHHAAAA!!\" She cried out, trying to curse you, but stopping short as your hands squeeze her bare thighs and make her throw back her head in ticklish torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Heaven's forces were doing just as badly as the last of the Disciples were being taken down by the Naga and Pixie assault while the Valkyries and Warriors were overwhelmed without their support and sheer numbers. They were tackled down to the ground and disarmed, fingers wiggling into their skin and making them burst into laughter, weakening their resistance while sorceresses and warlocks used their dark arts to trap their limbs to prevent any chance of them fighting back. The Godly fighters were soon stripped and humiliated as their naked bodies were on display, being played with by the hordes of Hell in their victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the Disciples of Artemis to the Pixies and a particularly eager Warlock, the Naga approaches you and Diana, grinning hungrily as she reaches over and rips off the breastplate of the Valkyrie, her skirt soon following and leaving the former proud commander in some rather plain underwear, causing her to go bright red. The Naga laughed at such modesty and leaned into Diana's ear, taking on a seductive tone as her hands played with the naked skin idly, teasing the Valkyrie's buttocks and with with long, idle strokes that made her stutter and giggle \"Aww, don't worry, we'll have much more appealing clothing for you when one of Hell's nobles take you on as their personal pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana let out a cry of pure horror at this, soon descending into laughter as the Naga's long nails dug into her cute rear, gossing and squeezing it as Diana went a deep red and screamed in ticklish agony. Her hair whipped back and forth while her navel was licked and teased by the Naga's long, rough tongue in a way that made Diana's scream reach new heights, the fingers scribbling into her armpits just adding a fresh piece of woe onto her torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull away from Diana to look around the battlefield, Heaven's forces now all captured and being played with in many wicked ways. The Disciplces of Artemis had all been lined up besides one another, a soceress conjuring up a long set of stocks with their feet poking out of the holes. Each of the archers howled with laughter as their long, shapely feet were teased and tickled relentlessly by the horde around them, tongues, fingers and feathers all joining in a mass tickle attack. Already, some were begging for it to stop and crying with laughter, their soles and toes subjected to such evil tickle torture that it would be inevitable before they would all be broken in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Succubi who had taken part in the battle also had their fun, selecting a few of the warriors and Valkyries for teasing. Stripping them naked, the beautiful female Demons subjected their victims to long, slow teasing over their bodies, making them gasp with pleasure as long black feather teased over their most sensitive of areas. One male warrior, muscular and powerful, was already letting out a stream of high pitched giggles asa  feather teased along his cock and balls, making them twitch as a succubus cooed sweetly into his ear, her hands stroking idly up and down his sides as his arousal and torment only increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such succubus noticed you and used her bat like wings to fly over to your spot, smirking at you as she said \"Ah, you're the reason we had this victory so easy. Well, I think...</span></div></div>",

Absentmindedly rubbing the area where you had been branded, your curiosity was intrigued by the rough map of the town that appeared in the mist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though winning this little battle is a good start for us, those goody two-shoes from heaven have already set up a barricade stopping us from moving further.\u201d Swiping with one finger at the mist, the image took form as the image of an arched-stone bridge came into view, dozens upon dozens of Warriors and Valkyries already taking up a defensive formation on one side of it with their shields raised like a wall to prevent anything from getting across. Behind them, a makeshift encampment could be seen toiling about, angels keeping a watch from above while the Disciples took to the roofs of nearby buildings, acting as both scouts as well as surveillance against Hell\u2019s army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s where you come in! After seeing what you can do today, we had hoped that you could somehow sneak in\u2026 Soften them up from the inside, if you get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Giving you a quick poke to the ribs to make sure you were paying attention, you nodded earnestly, suppressing the urge to grin. Giving you a sultry smile as the mist dissipated, the succubus raised a finger, pointing west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you head down that street, the stone bridge where those heavenly smucks are should be visible. Wade through the waters to get to the other side, infiltrate as a lost human, we don\u2019t care how you do it. Once you\u2019re ready, just send us a signal through the mark on your hand and we\u2019ll start the advance. Just make sure not to get caught, or we might not be able to save you! And I do <i>hate</i> to waste such a ticklish human such as you.\u201d Giving you one last poke before urging you on, you see sexy demoness give you one last wave before heading back to where a male warrior was, constantly being held on the edge of hysterics by another giggling succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to keep her warning in mind, you headed down the path, leaving the sound of male and female heavenly laughter behind. After a few minutes of quiet walking, thinking to yourself how you had gotten yourself into this mess as an agent of hell, you start to slow down, hugging the walls of an abandoned tavern as you peered around the corner. True enough to what you had seen in the mist, a small army of heaven\u2019s warriors had congregated just beyond the bridge, the only thing you could see from your position was a couple of Warriors and Valkyries standing guard, shields raised towards your direction on the opposite side of the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready knowing that your prospects of getting in there and getting out were slim at best, you debated to yourself on what the best course of action would be. Perhaps you could go back to the succubus and hope that she would hand you some small form of punishment at best?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in thought, a ray of sunlight reflecting off the glint of metal caught your eye from across the bridge. Squinting your eyes to see what it was, you let out a soft gasp as you see about half a dozen Valkyries and Disciples of Artemis carrying what looked to be heavy chests behind the lines into an abandoned building, the boxes clearly engraved with beautiful gold trimmings and inlays. Could that be the war loot or armory of this small army from Heaven? Already smelling the potential gold you could pinch while completing your mission\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The forces of Heaven were steadfast in their resistance here, even with the losses they had endured. Despite that, you see a few little signs in the groups that you can see, people looking downcast, talking to the person closest to them and then looking around nervously. It seems that morale is quite low, an excellent chance to undermine it further was in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how gullible the forces of Heaven have been so far, you try the direct approach. You rush towards the bridge as if being chased \"Help me!\" You call out, getting the attention of the forces on the bridge \"I need somewhere to hide, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defenders on the bridge pause, before they stand to one side, allowing you to go through a small gap that was quickly closed after you got through. You had succeeded in your first part of the mission, although there was still much more to come as you saw a tall, muscular woman clad in the armour of a Valkyrie approach you \"A non-combatant?\" She asked, her voice loud and brash \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend came here to help volunteer on your side.\" You quickly lie \"I haven't seen her in days, I had to come and look but almost got grabbed by some Demons. Can I stay with you until I find a way out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Valkyrie looked thought the problem over for a moment. While thry were fighting a war and couldn't take in everyone, they had also sworn to protect the defenceless anyway they could. With a sigh, she nodded \"Very well, you may go to the barracks to find somewhere to rest while we try to get you out of here. It's down the large street. Do not dawdle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a nod of your head and saying your thanks, you make your way down the street indicated, catching a few glimpses from the other defenders around you as you try to decide what to do next. The mission you had been given meant you had to take action on some level. You're interrupted in your thoughts by the sound of tortured laughter. It's very faint and far into the distance, but you can just make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that you had a choice in front of you. After some musing, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds of getting used to the slight darkness of the room, your eyes glinted with greed, the sight of about a dozen or so treasure chests lined up in a haphazard manner lying in front of you enough to send you into a giddy daze at how much treasure and gold all of them could possible contain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking closer, you trace your hand over the covers of the nearest chest, your heart nearly stopping as the sensation of cool metal already told you that the shiny trimmings lining the boxes were actually real gold trimmings. From just a rough estimate, if you could even manage to sell these chests, or even just the components making them, you would have enough money to comfortably live ten years of your life in peace without the need for anymore bounty hunter work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening one of the many treasure chests, the sparkle of coins reflected well in your eyes even in the dimness of the room, several hundred, maybe even thousands of gold and silver coins lining the insides of the chest, almost like a river of metal inside the container. Grabbing a handful of it, a soft \u2018ah\u2019 escaped your lips as you took in the tinkling sound of coins slowly falling back into the chest, confirming what you were seeing wasn\u2019t just an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to close the first chest however, you remember what another of your fellow bounty hunters had informed you in a tale over a drink in a faraway bar. \u201cAye, don\u2019t let chests full of gold fool you. I had the misfortune of running into a mimic the other day. Stole my sword, did she. Mimics love metal, so keep your gold away from them. Actually, just keep away from them, period. From what I heard, some of them can manifest as a girl popping out of the box, dragging you into god-knows-where the inside of that chest leads to! I bet my coin that what\u2019s inside is another dimension! Hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the lid of the first chest with a sigh at remembering your previous conversation, you were glad that at least the first chest wasn\u2019t a mimic. Moving onto the second chest, your heart almost leapt out of your mouth as the door to the building suddenly creaked open. \u201cHello, is anybody there? I\u2019m here to confirm the quantity of gold looted from that stronghold we broke into last week\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With more than a little luck, you see a half empty chest nearby and dive into it, wincing at the fact you've basically just jumped onto solid gold. You try to close the lid, but it's too tight for that and a thin opening was left, enough for you to peer out and see what was going on. A small, mousy looking woman dressed in red robes had walked into the treasure room, looking around quizzically. She was quite short with pulled black red hair and a surprisingly curved figure under the robe. The robe design was familiar to you and you recognised her as belonging to The Order of Aid, those who basically handled the logistics of all operations handled by Heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not imposing, you decided not to risk anything and remain silent as the woman looked around for someone to help her, the sound of the door opening behind her causing her to jump and turn around. She looked relieved when a tall woman stepped in, wearing the few items of clothing that the Warrior class were famous for \"Oh, one of you quill-pushers.\" The warrior commented icily. Walking into the room fully, you could see the woman's bronzed skin, her muscular physique and long, black hair certainly catching the eye. Her piercing eyes gazed at the smaller woman with something approaching contempt \"And what're you doing in the treasury?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your first impressions of the smaller woman, she actually met the Warrior's gaze with one of her own \"I am Sister Andea of the Order of Aid. I have every right to be here to catalogue our resources. And what are you doing here?\" She countered, looking the Warrior in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, the Warrior paused before breaking into a grin, evidently impressed by Andrea's nerve \"I'm Sondra, Warrior and I came in here once I heard someone lurking about. I was hoping it was some Demon, I'm eager to get into action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a wide grin at that, Sondra practically flexed as she grabbed onto the swod hanging from her hip, the thought of combat making her almost giddy. Andrea looked more serious though, frowning a little \"Easy to say, but this war's not been going well. We've lost half of the city to Hell's forces and even Yvette has gone missing. If the city is taken, Hell wins this round and we all spend the next century being their tickle toys.\" Andrea's cheeks flushed a little at that, knowing the cost of losing was a heavy one. Whoever won the Battle over Areindal gained great influence over the world for one hundred years before it started again. Nothing that the forces of Heaven really looked forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSondra seemed to look past that, merely giving a smirk \"Oh, we'll get through this! Word is that Artemis and Athena themselves are going to take part in this war. What does Hell have that can match actual Gods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are the Arch-Fiends.\" Andrea countered \"Succubi of immense pOOEEEYYY!!\" She was cut off suddenly as a finger prodded her belly, proving it to be quite sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're just worried that you'll spend one hundred years getting your cute, chubby belly tickled, aren't you?\" Sondra teased, suddenly pressing into Andrea and tickling her. The Warrior's hands reached down to the belly and sides, clawing at them as she tickled with her powerful fingers. Andrea fell onto a nearby cheat, squealing with laughter as she tried to weakly bat the hands away. Her robe offered little protection from the fingers and Andrea was laughing up a storm as her belly did prove to be sensitive to Sondra's wriggling fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two do distracted, it could be time for an escape attempt, if it's worth the risk of being spotted. Alternately, you could either wait it out for them to leave (And enjoy the show) or take advantage of the situation. They both seem to have good information and perhaps a quick interrogation will bring some good results.</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t worry, just focus on your job and leave the heavy lifting to us warriors!\u201d As the sound of a door opening and closing signaled her exit from the building, you give a sigh of relief at not being found out, although you would have loved to eavesdrop more about heaven\u2019s reinforcements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering through your narrow peephole, you see the robed figure let out a sigh of relief herself, glancing around the room to make sure that no one else saw the spectacle before going back to her initial objective, searching around the chests nearest to the back of the room for something as she muttered beneath her breath. \u201cIf anyone would tickle that ape, I bet she would melt down into a giggling mess herself\u2026 Now let\u2019s see\u2026 Where did I put that item list\u2026 It should be here somewhere from the previous inspection\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the room one last time before making sure that the two of you were the only ones in the treasury, you opened the lid of the chest you were hiding in slowly, gingerly stepping out with one foot before quietly stepping out with the other. Tip-toeing silently towards the unsuspecting aid, the latter had no time to react as you cupped one hand over her mouth and another around her waist, her eyes shooting wide in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready feeling her smaller frame struggle against your grip, you thank the stars you had the enhanced strength from the mark of the succubus. Maneuvering her towards the nearest closed chest, you forced the raven-haired woman to double over the lid of the box, your body weighing on her back from above. Already mildly annoyed at having to keep her in check, an evil thought crossed your mind. \u201cSince you have such a sensitive belly, I wonder how ticklish it actually is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fingers wrapped around her waist started to dig in, your suspicions were correct as you quickly heard muffled giggles coming from her silenced mouth, her struggling increasing two-fold. \u201cOh ho ho, ticklish there, are we? Tickle tickle tickle!\u201d Running your fingers along the curves of her robe highlighting her hips, another bout of snickers were heard coming from your hand, her own pinned arms trying their best to wriggle free from underneath her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a ticklish aid! Did that warrior tickle you like this? Kitchie Koo!\u201d Snickering in your mind as you prodded her naval through her thin robe, you absent-mindedly gave her hips a few squeezes, each squeeze bringing about a new series of muffled giggling. During the struggling however, you failed to notice a sneaky hand free itself from underneath you, quickly and frantically using its new found freedom to skitter across your belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a spurt of laughter yourself at the unexpected attack, a sharp pain registered in your mind as the heel of a boot slamming into your toes soon had you wincing, making you carelessly let go of your quarry. Biting your lip to numb the pain, a kick straight into your abdomen soon had you stumbling backwards, your arms flailing but failing to find balance as you tumbled backwards into the chest you had originally hid in, your bottom once again feeling the hard sensation of gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get your bearings together, the sound of creaking wood suddenly sent alarm bells ringing in your head, the light of the room quickly fading away as the lid of the chest slammed down on the stretch of your legs around both your ankles before being weighed down by a catch mechanism, the brunt of it luckily being absorbed by the material of your footwear. Being barely able to see the confines of the chest through the narrow slit of light entering it due to your legs being wedged in, you had another problem now as you could glimpse the shadow of a figure appeared outside the box, the hands on her hips already giving away who and how pissed she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever you are, do you think that hiding in here and having the gall to disrupt the work from one of the Order of Aid would have no dire consequences? I think the answer to that is a definite <b>no</b>.\u201d Feeling your boots getting tugged off your feet for the up tenth time this day, you already guessed what manner of payback she was willing to use on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem that distracted just now when Sondra tickled you, O\u2019Sister of the Ticklish Aid.\u201d Getting a reaction at of her at least with your last jab, a flustered Andrea merely growled before running her sharp nails along both your bare and trapped feet as you fought to keep the snickers in check. Contrary to your assumptions, she was surprisingly skilled at dishing it out, finding a small spot in the center of your arches to dig into with fervor. Before long, your dam of giggles burst free in a torrent of splutters and chuckles, your fists pounding against the gold coins beneath you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot feeling so hot anymore now, huh? Let\u2019s see if a few tickles can cool down your attitude.\u201d Rapidly stroking along the sides of your foot, Andrea took pleasure in seeing your feet wiggle about as you tried to shy away, your soles moving left and right along with her scratching digits. Practically howling with laughter by the time she got to your toes with a feathery end of a quill pen she found, the sensation of the fronds sliding in the sensitive regions of your toes proved too much for your pride to take. \u201cW-Waahahahaait! I\u2019m part of the a-aahhahaaalliance! I promise I won\u2019t tickle you anymore! I promise-eehheheeee!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking note of their \u2018believing\u2019 and gullible nature, you headed down the street, the sound of periodic laughter catching your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the corner, you saw another large building in the corner of the streets, two Valkyries standing guard at its entrance as laughter came out from the second floor, occasionally starting and stopping for a few minutes. While the sound of people laughing constantly was not a surprise to you anymore, the way the mark of the succubus on your hand was reacting to the magic energies on the second floor did definitely catch your attention. While you could walk away, you had to satisfy your inner curiosity a little at what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to act as if you were definitely part of the alliance as you pass the two female guards, both of them stood at constant attention, their eyes not leaving you until you disappeared from their sight. Circling around through the alleyways of the town, you were right on your hunch as you entered through the unguarded back entrance of the building, the soft aroma of perfume tickling your nose as you closed the door softly behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking care to not make any creaking sounds of the wooden floorboards of the stairs as you climbed upwards, you took in the pastel colored wallpaper and smell of musky perfume, the two of which already telling you that this building was probably a brothel before the holy war took place. Following the sound of laughter, which was getting louder and clearer every step you took, you finally found yourself arriving behind a white ornate door, its hinge slightly ajar. Praising your ever-present luck, you crouched down at the entrance, peeking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from being surprisingly spartan with only a table with a perfume bottle resting on it serving decoration, a large pink lounging couch and rug were the only other furniture being present in the room. What caught your attention however, were the occupants of the room. Lazily laying on the couch was a blonde woman, the curves of her Chiton dress hugging her figure enticingly as she held a smoking pipe in one hand, inhaling from it before exhaling a cloud of sweet vapor. On the rug, two barely clothed succubi, one with flowing jet black hair while the other with brown hair were giving the woman defiant looks, both of them with a thin sheen of sweat on their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another smoke of her pipe, the blonde lazily twirled her pipe in one hand, clearly bored. \u201cHave you had enough girls, or would you like another round?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would never give in to you, we\u2019re proud succubi! Like we would ever tell any of you whores of heaven our secre-\u201d Before the succubi with jet black hair could finish her sentence, the blonde merely grinned as she raised her hand, both of the succubi strangely looking at a pink mark on their captor\u2019s hand, similar the purple mark on the top of your hand. Seeing the empty look in their eyes like they were caught in a trance, the blonde smirked. \u201cI was hoping you would say that. I rarely get to hear laughter from succubi while cooped up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering her voice to a husky whisper, you had to strain your ears to hear what she said next. \u201c<i>The next time I click my fingers, the both of you will act like chickens.</i> Now, wake up.\u201d Clapping her hands as the glow from her mark faded, the blank look on the succubi was soon replaced again with one of anger and rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what magic you can use, but if you think these ropes can hold us peons of hell, we\u2019ll be happy to teach you a ticklish lesson.\u201d Merely snapping the binds on their wrists with a simple tug, both demonesses advanced slowly on their captor, a triumphant grin on their faces. Merely giving a yawn she snapped her fingers, both the succubi and you were surprised as the former two found their bodies slowly squatting down, their arms folded against their sides imitating chicken wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to us, you bit-Bwak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you free us now, I promise you\u2019ll only spend an eternity in our personal tickle hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon getting tired of the chicken routine and empty threats that the two seductive women were performing in front of her, you see the blonde raise her hand one more time, the life being sucked out from the other two\u2019s eyes. \u201cI have an excellent idea with all this talk about tickling\u2026 You both seem close, so I bet you know a few <i>secrets</i> about each other, wouldn\u2019t you? <i>The next time I snap my fingers, you\u2019ll both tickle the <b>most</b> ticklish spot on the other\u2019s body.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her hand fall once more as the succubi got their bearings back, still furiously clucking at her, their captor snapped her fingers a second time, a malicious grin on her face at what was about to happen next. A look of pure shock on their faces once more as their bodies refused to obey them, horror soon appeared on the face of the succubi with jet-black hair as she found her feet drawing closer into the open hands of her partner, the other succubi also having a similar look at seeing her partner\u2019s hands draw closer to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, the coup de grace. Laugh you ticklish succubi, and repent!\u201d Immediately bursting out into giggles as she felt her two sets of manicured nails being deposited on her bare soles, it made it all the worse for the first succubi as her body refused to move away, leaving her with only the option to take the tickles. In just a few seconds, another feminine stream of laughter joined the first, the fluttering sensation of fingertips stroking the sides of her bare chest proving too much for the other succubi to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling to herself as well as she looked on at the amusing sight of two of hell\u2019s strongest warriors tickling themselves\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, amuse me more. I command the both of you to\u2026 <i>pleasure</i> yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror appearing on their laughing faces as they were forced to obey, the sound of constant cackling soon turned into one of moaning as their hands moved away from each other\u2019s bare bodies to delve into their own loins, one of their hands pulling the tiny piece protecting their nether regions to make room for the other hand. In time, both Succubi were reduced to a moaning mess, their faces flushed with the constant pleasuring that their own skilled hands were causing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your own cheeks blushed crimson at hearing the alluring sounds coming from the other side of the thin door, you found that your own hands had unexpectedly started to move on their own, reaching under your clothes despite your protests. \u201cW-What\u2019s going on!

Everything was coloured in bright colours, flowers were blooming and everything was provided by the government. All it asked for in return was that people gave what the state asked for and that they smiled when doing so. And if they didn't, there were ways to get them to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are currently enjoying a day off from work in the park where everything is, by law, bright and cheerful. You stretch out on a bench, relaxing as the people go by when a commotion is heard from the side. Looking over, you see a young blonde woman burst through the crowd, running in a frenzy and looking panicked. Before you can react to this, you see the reason for her fear, she's being chased by the Jesters. Clad in colourful clothes and make up that had them always smiling, the Jesters were the easiest to spot enforcers of Laufania's government.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Jesters were both attractive looking women, one tall with flaming red hair and the other shorter with dark skin that sent out a weighted rope towards the fleeing woman, hitting her around the ankles and making her fall to the floor. The impact caused something to roll out of her hand and land near you, although your attention was taken up elsewhere \"N-No! Please don't!\" The woman cried out as the Jesters reached her, tying her hands behind her back before quickly stripping her of her clothing, leaving her in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you know the rules.\" One Jester said as she sat down beside the woman's torso and began to dig her fingers into the ribs. Tickling was the way in which the populace was kept in line, the most dreadful tickle torture being handed out for the smallest of infractions. The woman began to laugh as her torso was tickled and the other Jester sat by her feet, holding them under one arm and raking her fingers up and down the trapped soles with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman screamed with laughter under the dual assault, both Jesters being expert ticklers as they exploited her bare skin with wiggling fingers, one finger dipping into the woman's navel making her scream in ticklish agony as it wiggled around in the spot \"Oh, so cute!\" The Jester at her feet cried out as she wiggled her fingers over the woman's cute chubby toes \"You're going to have so much fun at the Happy Place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver went through the crowd as they heard that. The Happy Place was a tall, imposing building where the very worst of the tickle torture went on.

Stepping out of line for one fateful moment of your life, you reach down and grab the object, which is a few inches long and wrapped in cloth. Before anyone noticed, you crammed it into your jacket pocket, heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Jesters are wrapping up their tickly torment of the woman and hauling her to her feet, but it's clearly hard for her as they repeatedly sneak jabbing fingernails into her exposed underarms and ribs. She's panting hard from her torture and can't use her bound hands to steady herself, but the redhead and the dark skinned woman each clamp down hard on each arm and begin to call in a transport for immediate extraction to the Happy Place. You hoof it away from the scene, the object seeming to throb in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter escaping from the park unnoticed through the crowd, you caught the monorail back to your apartment. Intrusive and non-sanctioned thoughts raced through your head, the woman's capture had perhaps sparked a little feeling of rebellion in you.

Attractive, fit, and horribly sensitive to the slightest touch.  You are the sort of Gargelia specimen they consider a ticklish treasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When your friend went missing in the woods, the elders warned you and the other young who knew her not to go looking for her.  It was as if they knew she was already lost to them forever.  But you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that, and went off into the misty jungle depths to find her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And that is how you wound up in your current situation.  As you made your way through the dense jungle, you were chased by a pair of enormous beetles who corralled you down a slope near the edge of a muddy bog.  Once there, it was a simple process to slop enough mud on you before they rolled you into thick ball of muck, with only your head and hands and feet still poking out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The beetles then left you there like that, utterly helpless to what or whoever might come along.  You spent an entire night like that, being driven mad by especially tickly insects that would alight on your feet, head and hands, seemingly intent on inflicting the worst possible ticklish sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The following day, you were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrescued\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by a group of croaking, slobbering amphibian creatures who proceeded to clean you up and sell you to your current masters, an aristocratic family of Laphu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gorgeous matriarch is Frau Scratchen, and she has a most cruel imagination when it comes to tormenting bare-skins.  For some reason, she seems to take an especial glee in making your pathetic life utterly humiliating.  As if she has an innate understanding of what the Gargelia find most mortifying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Alpha male is rarely around, but takes about the same notice of you as you might the family pet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There are two older, almost adult members of the family.  The female seems to almost really care for you, while the male seems to have nothing but disdain for you, and has nearly injured you on more than one occasion.  He feels that you should be bred for the tickle-wrestling ring to battle other bare-skins in bouts for the betting amusement of Laphu who attend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The younger children of the Scratchen clan are a lot more playful and innocent in their tickling antics than the adults.  The drawback is that they just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when to quit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To judge by the star cycles, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a captive slave to these fur-skins for nearly a month.  You have to admit, they do feed and care for you, and you are kept more safe and comfy then you ever were with your own people; but you find the extended bouts of tickling, the ridiculous, humiliating costumes and adornments you are made to wear, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctricks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 they have you perform are just too much for you to take.  Strangely, though you can make out most of what they are saying, when you try to communicate with them, they treat it much as you would if your dog started barking for nothing, seemingly unable to grasp what you mean.  Or unwilling to believe that you have that level of intelligence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All this, and you are still no nearer to finding out what happened to the dear friend you originally went out looking for in the impenetrable wilderness. </div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[Chapter Addition Note: While familiar with MTJ Pubs, I have no more idea of what I'm going by than the descriptions of the milieu as described in the previous branches.

Sure you'd get punished but their playtime was something you really hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''My little one's what's the matter? Why all of the banging?''<br>\r\n''We wanna play with Pinky.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat dream died on the vine with the voice of Frau Scratchen. She was tall enough to get the door open and since it didn't have a lock you were done. You hid your head under the pillow as the door opened, best to pretend you were asleep anyway maybe they'll go away? You bundled the sheet's on your floor bed around as you heard all those damnable little Laphu kids crowd in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ohhh he's still asleep. Maybe you should let him sleep. He is still new here after all.''<br>\r\n''Moooom my friends came over to see him though! Your making look dumb in front of all my friends!''<br>\r\n''Ohhh Est fine but go easy on him. He's in a new place after all and it's probably frightening.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many friends had they brought over?

It sounded like there was a whole pack of them in here what was it ''Bring your class home day?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fiiine we're only playing anyway.

I want to get him while he's sleeping so we can show what being a lazy bones gets you.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...This seemed to have backfired on you. As you heard them crowd around you weighed your options. Wake up now and they'd figure out you'd been pretending then you'd really get it. You tensed beneath the sheets as furry little hands tucked the sheets under you and wrapped them before they pulled you from your floor bed and out of your hole in the wall room and down the hall. You kicked and struggled but your damnable bracelet had you weak as...well weaker than these kittens. Every once in awhile either one of the youngest or their friends would sneak a devious little hand in and get you squealing like a newborn Laphu. When they finally stopped and you shook yourself out you saw that you were now in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wakey wakey Pinkie! Time to greet the day and our friends!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sheet on your head was pulled back you couldn't help yourself from going pale. Gods the Scratchen's had five of their kit's but now there was almost a dozen of them. The demonic little littler that had tormented you for almost a month had more than doubled! You tried to squirm in your hastily made mummification but one evil little kitten climbed atop your chest and stared you down so that the bracelet kept you so weak that even the sheet might as well have been steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I wanna play the piggy game already Est!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a pair of furry little hands rummaging around in the sheets down past where you could see and knew that they were your hunting your piggies. You pulled and juked your feet in your tomb as best you could getting many frustrated groans from the brats. You were doing a good job at keep away until the little jerks cheated. You felt something almost impossibly soft and definitely tickly intrude upon your ear and the fit of giggles you burst into distracted you long enough that that little turd playing at hunter almost got your left foot instead of having it in their hands they light scratched along the sole and made you jump in your wrappings and yipe loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">''EEEEHHHEEEEPPPAHA!!''</font><br>\r\n''Wow! that was loud Est!''<br>\r\n''Yeah it was!

Humans....hang on my brother told me what it's called...Squeak! That's what humans do they squeak!''<br>\r\n''EST!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrau Scratchen screamed down from upstairs and all the kids winced at her volume. It easily dwarfed your own ''squeak'' from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''YEAH MOM?!''<br>\r\n''WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THE HUMAN!?''<br>\r\n''WE WERE JUST CLEANING PINKIES EARS MOM! HE WAS SCRATCHING AT THEM SO WE THOUGHT WE'D HELP!''<br>\r\n''YOU KIDS BE NICE TO THAT POOR THING! KEEP IT DOWN TOO!!''<br>\r\n''OK MOM!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I nearly got his paws that time Est!''<br>\r\n''How is this human beating you?!''<br>\r\n''Gimme another chance Est!''<br>\r\n''No you're useless. Shanna help him here and catch those paws! As for you human, you make that much noise again and we'll have to fill that silly mouth of yours with something other than pet food. Now you know what this is right Pinky?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup Hunter held up the tool that had led to your near-miss and you instantly recognized it. An Iksi frond. The Laphu used the stems of the plants to clean their damnable paws and ears.The Lady of the house Frau Scratchen had first introduced you to them one night when she cleaned your ears with it but that had gone further when due to what she called ''Your absolutely adorable'' reactions and before you knew it she was using it for more than just that. Thankfully she'd really seen to taken a shine to you and was always kind to you. You now really appreciated her restraint since you found out how bad the evil little flower could be in the hands of a meaner Laphu and in the ears of poor old you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair of Laphu pups once again began rummaging in the sheets for your sensitive feet for wahtever ''The Piggy Game'' was the head troublemaker himself Est held you tight and inserted the Iksi stick into your ear and teased you mercilessly. You bucked and squirmed in the pup's grasp giggling and wheezing while fuzzy fingers caught ahold of your feetsies and dragged them out in front the whooping and hollering Laphu jackals.The two little monsters held your ankles as the others crowded around to view their new toys. Est gave the frond one last little twirl in your ear before finally pulling it out of your poor sensitive ear and letting you catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See Pinky? Was that so bad?! Let's play a new game. The piggy game!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to pull your feet out of the grip of the diminutive devils but that bracelt had you weaker than a newborn human in these adolescent's paws and so they kept hold of there prizes. One of the little devils had taken up Est's iksi stick and was now gently tickling around your ear driving you into snickers as the others crowded around for Est's show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okaaay now first this piggy shows that humans are weak, They giggle and squeal at the slightest toe tweaks!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped your big toe at the beginning of the and lightly twiddled it back and forth as she sang while scraping at the delicate pad. You bucked and went mad but wisely kept your voice down knowing how cruel kids could really get. The other pups laughed and climbed atop you to get a better look at your reddening cheeks which they poked and scratched at while the Iksi stick bothered your ear. Your attempts to turn your head away led the pups atop you to grip you by the chin and hold your face steady for their compatriot's ease. Est laughed as she continued on with her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This little piggy's called the lever everybody!''<br>\r\n''Why Est?''<br>\r\n''Watch!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent the toe back abit and you felt hot tears start to leak out from behind your eyes which you'd screwed shut at the embarassing torment. The pups laughed harder at your hilarious expressions and you even felt a tongue sneak in and taste of your tears. You heard a voice in your ear reminding you to keep quiet or it would get worse for you. You were trying to keep it in in but you and them knew it was a matter of time till you broke. You were holding your breath in to try and choke it down...</span></div></div>",

Watch the show of the most <b>tickle-sensitive</b> man alive!\" It announces aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tickle sensitive, what kind of joke is this?</i> You think to yourself as you pull at your chains. You begin to observe your surroundings; it's a large circus tent, with dark red walls, and a large entrance near the front. You look down and notice you are in the middle of a hardwood stage, with curtains behind you. You also notice a spinning wheel on the side of the stage, something like out of a game show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to squint and read it, a girl dressed up as a clown comes out from the curtains. She has red hair, with white face makeup and red lipstick. She's wearing a colorfully striped skirt and shirt with black shoes.

While researching in a laboratory just on the outskirts of Megapolis, an accidental slip-up caused you to fall into the prototype mass-ion chamber before the automated protocols started to activate the machine, bombarding your whole body with blinding purple UV light. By the time the machine powered down, you found yourself looking into a mirror, amazed at how you survived. However, as you reached out, the warm sensation of a hand touching yours almost made you pass out from shock; the sound of two females screaming could be heard coming from the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that day, you tested your newfound powers in the comfort of your own house. After the first few episodes of shrieking at the fact that you could make multiple copies of yourself appear, your power came in surprisingly handy in everyday chores. Soon, it almost became a daily routine for you to clone yourself to grab a mug of coffee, clean your room and wash the dishes all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while amazed at having such a power, you realized it also came with drawbacks. During an incident were one of your clones spilled some hot coffee on her arm, the many sounds of your voices could be heard hissing and swearing around the house as all of you fell to the floor, nursing your hand. Deciding to test your powers once more, you started with one clone before pinching yourself, both of you winced at the pain, even though no one was actually pinching \u2018you\u2019, per say. Gulping, you already realized the implications of this. If any of your clones were to get hurt\u2026 it certainly wouldn't go well for all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, you encountered another problem. While you <i>could</i> clone yourself up to a maximum of six times, you had to actually be in physical contact for your clones to return into you. Rubbing your head as you sighed; you recalled that particular incident when you had to trawl across the entire 20 floors of the recently constructed Displexian mall just to find one of your lost selves who went shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile satisfied at having a decent understanding of your powers, the thought of doing something more came to you one day as you turned on the television, another commercial of Supergirl capturing two robbers playing during the commercial intermission. You could become a superhero with your powers! With many copies of yourself, you could outnumber the enemies and capture them! You\u2019ve even heard of the Superhero\u2019s association in the middle of the city, where rookie sidekicks up to veteran heroes frequently visited and stayed at, training and resting before their next mission. While you <i>are</i> technically a superhero for a hobby now, it was still worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to turn off the tv, an alert blared past, a news anchor reporting on the recent attack upon the local bank by the Grinning Goons. If you were to drop by and stop them, word would quickly spread about the new superhero on the block. Looking at your wardrobe however, you wondered if you were even fit to appear on the news\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch the light seep through the edges of the city, turning the grey skyscrapers into bright golden towers, the skyline into a glowing magnificent landscape straddling the horizon. The people, milling across the narrow streets, and the cold morning air crystallizing their breath. The cars already choking the roads. Shopkeepers dusting their entrances with brooms. Stray cats and dogs prowling behind alleys. The beginnings of life starting to seep into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the heroes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first ones come flying through the air, drawing pale knife edges in the sky. From this far, even with my supervision I can't tell the colors of their capes, the symbols on their chests. Their formation is perfect, like fighter jets, and the gust of their passing is like a beckoning to us mortals. The newspaper flaps in my hand, some rats near the gutter are sent into a frenzy, a few people to look up in awe, hands holding their hats from being blown away, children point and scream in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next heroes are the digital ones. Even worse. Their faces flicker to life in blazing color across animated billboards and built-in TV screens across skyscrapers and glass buildings. Gorgeous radiant 50 foot tall faces smile down at the streets, promoting brands, promoting justice, promoting themselves. I sip my coffee quietly as I watch a Lightning Girl commercial leap across four building faces as she fights Dr. Nefarious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's such a disgrace that I almost break my coffee cup. Beneath my thick overcoat, my own supercharged suit thrums with righteous anger. At the moment, in Megapolis' asylum, screams are being emitted and flashlights dropped in shock as my former guards are discovering the body double I had swapped myself with. Soon the heroes will be alerted. Soon the hunt. But for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee cup shatters in my augmented strength. For now I shall have my reckoning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who is to be my target? I can think of two options. The first is Nightingale. A lone wolf. She haunts the deepest underbelly of glorious Megapolis. A whispered terror among criminals, an anti-hero of sorts, who strikes fear in the hearts of criminals just as surely as conventional heroes foster inspiration in citizens. She wears a ninja-like outfit with tattoos over her bare arms and wields a high-tech arsenal of laser katanas, energy shurikens, and who knows what else. Her inky dark hair is tied in a long ponytail behind her and she sports an onyx mask shaped vaguely like the curved wings of a nightingale. I had lost to her in combat two times in the past because while she does not have super strength per se, she relies on martial arts and cunning and her technology which has earned her the reputation as one of the deadliest heroes out there. Luckily for me, due to our constant encounters I have a good idea where she'll be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second is Sunfyre. She's fairly new to the hero scene, and enormously popular due to her natural beauty and sheer power. She has bright red hair framing a freckled slender face, green eyes the color of shamrocks, and expressive, plump lips that can flash into an irresistible smile for her followers. Her outfit is surprisingly conflicting to her natural advantages for it is conservative: a white and gold spandex with golden gauntlets and boots and a huge cream colored cape. Like most overpowered heroes, she has no mask, and is very friendly and open to reporters. I'm not sure what her full power set is but I've seen her throw massive pillars of golden light that cut through concrete like butter. She can cloak herself in a supernova of that stuff and be pretty much invulnerable. Cons are that she'll be a nightmare to defeat but nothing will feel better than taking Ms. Beauty Pagent down a notch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some people just have to live their lives knowing that they won\u2019t be the hero saving a bunch of people with powers, or the villain capturing civilians to torment. You know this quite well, as you are one such person. However, you also know that not having powers does not mean that you are protected from the true curse of Megapolis: being extremely ticklish. This has been evident by the videos of villains picking out civilians to torment with tickle torture until a hero comes to rescue them. Of course, the heroes aren\u2019t immune to dishing out tickling: they have found that a villain\u2019s henchmen or bounty hunters working for villains can be persuaded to give out valuable information through a tickle interrogation. And it would be a true shame to leave out the fact that villains tickle the allies of heroes to get them to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which part of the population of Megapolis are you with: are you just a civilian trying to lead a life in a town of supers, or do you have a stake in who should win (even if it can change from time to time)?</span></div></div>",

(Y/n) (l/n).\" You say shaking his hand. ( y/n means your name and l/n means last name.) \"It's um nice to meet you.\" Shawn says.\" I hope you don't mind but I took the left side of the room. If um that's um okay with you. If you want the left side I totally understand! I could change sides it dosent matter!\" \"No no no. It's okay I don't care.\" You say. \"I am so so sorry I should have waited.\" Shawn quickly said. \"Its okay I was late so it's my fault.\" You said. You were wearing a white shirt and a black sweater to hide bruises your abusive parents gave you. You also wore a pair of blue jeans. You don't have any friends because everybody always thinks your wired. But Shawn. Shawn didn't treat you like you were diffrent. Shawn was in all of your classes and so we're Shawn's friends. You weren't friends with Shawn. You don't talk much ethier. At the end of your last class Shawn's friends started to pick on you. \"Hey guy look what we have here.\" One of them said as they they approached you. \"It's the little creep.\" he said. \"W-what do you w-want.\" You say. \"W-what we w-want is you gone.\" He said as he pushed you into another one of his  friend. The friend he pushed you into then kicked you behind your knee making you fall down. They then kicked you a while then left. \"Ha what a loser!\" One of them said. You then got up and started to limp toward your dorm. When you got inside Shawn was already there. Shawn saw that you looked scared. \"(Y/n)!\" He yelled. \"What happened you?\"  He asked. \"G-get away from me!\" You told him. \"(Y/n) I'm not going to hurt you!\" He yelled. \"Calm down!\" Shawn said as he was holding your shoulders. \"Let go of me!\" You yell. You try to shake him off but he is too strong. \"(Y/n) please calm down I promise I'm not going to hurt you I promise!\" You don't listen to him because that's what everyone tells you before they hurt you. As you keep struggling he sits on your waist v and pins your arms above your head. Your sleeve rolls up a bit revaling multiple cuts on your skin made from you, your parents, and school bullies. \"(Y/n) what's that! Who did this?\" Shawn says. \"Let me go!\" You yell. \"I'll let you go when you tell me what happened!\" \"No I'm not going to v tell you!\" You yell. Shawn holds your arms up and removes your shirt and sweater revaling multiple cuts and bruises. Shawn was heart broken when he saw you. \"Come on just tell me!\" You finally tell him what happened. You told him everything. As you tell him what happened your eyes tear up. After you tell him everything you start crying. Shawn then pulls you in for a hug. \"Shhh. I'll never hurt you not ever.\" You hear him say. His fingers were placed on your sides. As you stopped crying you felt his fingers tickling your sides. \"Gahah S-Shawn! HAHAHAHAH s-st hahahahap!\" You say. \"Hmm no!\" He says as he starts tickling you more and more. After 20 minutes he stoped and hugged you. \"Want to hang out later?\" Shawn asked.</span></div></div>",

See you later Oliver!\" Shawn said. \"Bye Shawn.\" you say while putting your shirt on and sadly cutting yourself on your forearm. After that you then put your sweater on to cover the cut. You sit on your bed and start to cry. After you stop crying you wait for 20 minutes to make it stop looking like you were crying it was an hour since Shawn left so you waited another hour before texting him you were ready.<br>\r\nOliver: Hello?

Go get your softest blanket.\" Shawn said. \"Um o-okay.\" You say as you go and get what he told you to get. \"Lets go.\" Shawn said. Shawn led you out to a grass field and told you to lay down on your blanket and look at the sky. \"Woah!\" you said as you look up at the stars. \"Pretty cool huh?\" Shawn says as he lays down next to you. \"Y-yea.\" You say. \"Hey Shawn.\" You hear someone say. \"Hey Trent.\" Shawn replied. \"Why you hanging out with this freak?\" Someone else said while kicking you. \"Troy cut it out! He's not a freak! Troy stop your hurting him!\" You hear Shawn yell. \"Well duh the freak deserves it\" someone else says. \"Thomas he's not a freak! He didn't do anything wrong!\" Shawn yells. Shawn runs towards you but then someone else grabs you. \" Tanner put him down!\" Shawn yells. \"Lets see um no.\" Tanner said. \"If you still want to be in our group you need to hurt this freak!\" Tanner says. \"No I'm not hurting him!\" Shawn says kicking Tanner in the balls. \"Agh!\" Tanner yells. \"Thomas grab the freak! Tent grab Shawn!\" They did as they were told. \"Agh! Let me go Trent!\" Shawn yelled. \"Ha no your going to stand here and watch your friend get beaten up!\" Trent said. \"Troy give him a black eye!\" Tanner said. \"Sure thing. Hold still freak. Troy said as he punched you in the eye. \"Have fun with the freak Troy go all out!\" Tanner said. \"No stop it leave him alone!\" You could hear Shawn being Troy to let you go. (Meanwhile) \"Psst Mason.\" \"What Jason?\" Mason replied \"do you hear that?\" Jason said. \"The screaming?\" Mason asked. \"Yea. It must Tanner and his friends.\" Jason said. \"We need to help whoever their victum is.\" Mason said. \"I agree lets go.\" Jason said. (Back to you and Shawn) \"Please stop!\" Shawn screamed. As soon as he screamed that two people went and hit all of the bullies so hard they all fell. As soon as that let go Shawn went and grabbed you in his arms. \"S-Shawn....t-take me to the...n-nurse.\" You tell Shawn. \"All they'll do is give you an ice pack.(full credit to Shawn Mendes for the treat you better song refrenses) I know I can treat you better than they can.\" Shawn said as he was starting to tear up from you being hurt. By the time you made it to your room you were knocked out. While you were knocked out Shawn thought it was best that he talks you to the nurse. You were taken to the hospital with Shawn by your side when you woke up. \"Ughh.\" You groaned. \"Oh my god your awake! Your finally awake!\" Shawn yelled with excitement. The doctors came and told you that you had a black eye and a couple of dislocated bones but you were ready to leave. As soon as you got back to your room Shawn pushed you on your bed and jumped climbed on top of you. He then took your shirt off and started tickling you. \"SHAHAHAHAHAHAWN STHAHAHAHAP IT.\" Shawn continued to tickle all over your belly and armpits. He then moved to your sides and ribs. When he stoped the two of you got ready food bed. You slept with just your boxers and sweat pants and Shawn slept in just his boxers. \"Hey um Oliver?\" Shawn asked. \"Y-yea?\" You answered. \"Will you um.... I thought you might like to um...can you please um...\" Shawn said as his face turned red. \"Maybe um... I'm not sure if you um feel the I'm same way but will you um at least um mabey think about um being my boyfriend?\" Shawn asked.

I will be back. I'm not going off to war.\" He tells you. \"I know\" you say as your eyes start to tear up. \"Oliver its okay.

Your parents were out getting groceries with your older sister. You fell asleep in Shawn's arms so he laid you down on your bed and gave you a kiss on your forehead. You woke up an hour later and Shawn was done packing. Shawn was practicing his songs when you woke up. \"I'm telling take your shirt it might be scary,\" Shawn sang. (The song is life of the party if you haven't listen to it I higly suggest it.) \"Together we can just let go. Pretend like there's no one else here that we know.\" He kept singing as you watched him. When he finished singing you started claping. \"You Mr are supposed to be in bed.\" Shawn said walking over to you. \"I woke up and heard you singing. I couldn't just go back to sleep. And I'm not tired.\" You say. \"Your not tired? Guess I'm going to make you tired.\" He said pushing you down on the bed and sitting on your waist. You started squirming trying to get away from your brother. \" Shawn no! Don't! I'm tired I will go to sleep!\" You begged \"I don't believe you.\" He said slidding his hands under your shirt and into your armpits. \"HAHAHA SHAWN NO HAHAHAHAHA STOP HAHA!\" You begged him. Shawn didn't show mercy. Shawn tickled you for an hour just focusing on your armpits. \"HAHAHA OKAY HAHA YOU WIN HAHAHA I GIVE UP HAHA I GIVE UP HAHA!\" You said. \"Hmm okay now I believe you.\" He said finally stopping. \"Oliver rember when I'm gone don't let those idiots bully you.\" He told you. \"I will try.\" You tell him.

Just remember that we lay under the same stars.\" That was your favorite part of the song and not long after you fell asleep. \"Goodnight little one.\" Shawn said giving you last kiss on the forehead. \"We have a big day tomorrow. You then</span></div></div>",

You walked down the street and saw a tv. It was the news. \"We have terrible news.\" The news reporter said. \"It appears Shawn Mendes is canceling the tour.\" Was this your fault? Is he canceling the tour for you? \"It appears that he will do yhe tour in three months. He is canceling it because his little brother has been kidnapped.\" They showed a picture of you. You were sure it was you. It had your curly dirty blonde hair thats slowly turning brown, your brown eyes, and your light skin. \"No no no this can't be.\" You said. \"I'm lost. Where am I supposed to go?\" You asked yourself. \"There's nobody around. In never going to see anyone again.\" You said to yourself. \"Im going to die here. Im never going to see Shawn again.\" You said as you started crying. \"S-Shawn h-help me!\" You said through your tears. \"F-find me. P-please I'm not gone.\" You say as you cry. Then you woke up crying. \"No!\" You said sitting up. \"Oliver!\" Shawn said running over to you. \"What's wrong?\" Shawn asked you sitting by you. You then tell Shawn your nightmare. \"I promise you that you will never get taken away.\" Shawn said hugging you. Shawn then slid his hands under you shirt and started lightly tickling your ribs. \"Hehehe S-Shawn hehehe st-stop hehehe!\" You giggled. \"But you seem so happy.\" He said using 4 fingers on each hand to tickle your armpits and and his thumbs to tickle your ribs. \"Hahahaha S-S-Shawn. Hahaha st-hahaha-ap!\" You laughed loudly. \"But I don't want to.\" Shawn whispered in your ear. Shawn took your shirt off and continued doing what he was doing. Shawn then started to blow raspberries while tickling your armpits and ribs. \"NO HAHAHA SHAWN STOP HAHAHA I CANT HAHAHA I CANT BREATH HAHAHA!\" You laughed and squirming trying to get away. \"Okay I don't want you to die without saying goodbye tomorrow. Go get a new shirt this one is all sweaty.\" Shawn said. \"Okay.\" You say and get a new shirt. When you came back Shawn was wearing sweat pants and a plain white shirt ready for bed. \"Do you want me to lay down with you?\" Shawn asked you. You nodded yes. As you tried to go to sleep Shawn played with your hair and rubbed your back. Shawn also sang you never be alone in a lulaby tone wich made you fall asleep. By the end of the song you both fell asleep. You both were awakend by the sound of Shawn's alarm. It was time. You needed to take Shawn to the airport and say goodbye. Shawn had a lot of suitcases when you arived at the airport. You and your family where at the part where they had to say goodbye to Shawn. You were already crying. You donr like goodbyes so you just looked down crying and waved good bye. \"Oliver. I know you would hate to say goodbye but before you say goodbye...\" Shawn was cut off bye you giving him a big hug. Your head only reached his stomach because you were still young. \"Oliver. Look at me.\" You obeyed. \"Come with me on tour.\" Shawn said holding up your passport and two tickets. \"O-okay.\" You said through your tears. You were so happy. \"Ready?\" Shawn asked. \"Ready.\" You said crying on a bit. \"Shawn. Take care if him.\" Your parents said. \"I will.\" Shawn said. And now you were off to Stockholm, Sweden - Debaser Strand.</span></div></div>",

I was at the hospital waiting for the arrival of my new baby brother or sister. My mom wouldn't tell me if he was a boy or girl. She also wouldn't tell me the name. Then when they said I could go in I was so excited to too meet my new youngest sibling. \"Shawn this is your baby brother Oliver.\" My mom said handing Oliver to me. As I held him in my arms I felt super happy. I instantly knew that there wasn't anything I wouldn't do for him. I tickled his tummy and his giggle was so amazing it made my hear melt. I kissed him on the head and he patted my stomach.(6 years later) It was Oliver's birthday and I got him a brand new bike. Our parents and sister weren't home but they said I could take him to the park and teach him how to ride the bike. About an hour later he was starting to get the hang of it. He was really good at it but then he fell and skinned his knee and elbow. I took him home and he tried his best not to cry. I was heartbroken at seeing how hurt he was. When I poured achohal on his skinned knee and elbow to disinfect it he was trying his best to look strong but tears just kept comming form his eyes. He sat there crying silently. As I wrapped a bandage tightly around his knee and elbow he couldn't hold it in so he cried loudly. \"A-are y-you done?\" He asked me through his tears. \"Yes I'm done.\" I said kissing him on the forehead. He then patted my stomach. When we do this it means many things. The first time ment that I loved him and I would keep him safe no matter what and that he loved me too. In this case it meant in sorry and when he patted my stomach it ment its okay and thank you. I felt like I failed him. I let him get hurt. I should have done something. Deep down I know that there was nothing I could have done. (End of flashback) I could see that Oliver was scared to fly. I knew this would happen so before we left I packed his favorite stuffed animal. \"Oliver.\" I whispered. \"I brought Barry.\" I say handing him a soft stuffed sloth. \"T-thanks.\" Oliver said holding him in his left arm. \"C-can I hold y-your hand S-Shawn?\" I hear him ask me. \"Of course.\" I say handing him my left hand. He grabbed my hand tightly but not enough to hurt at all. As we took off I squeezed his hand to let him know that it was going to be all right. \"Do you want me to sing to you?\" I asked. \"Umm y-yes p-please.\" He tells me. He's obviously stressed from flying. (The song is bad reputation by shawn mendes and if you haven't heard it I highly suggest it.) \"She got a bad reputation. She takes the long way home.\" I sing to him. I run my finger over his hair with my other hand. As soon as he fell asleep I kissed him on the forehead. \"Sleep well little one.\" I see that he looks cold and give him my jacket. Not long after I fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

She told us that after I was born my dad cheated on her but she forgave him. She said he had another son 4 months after I was born on December 3rd. (You are the brother who aas born) She explained that he lived with his mom and not us, but his mom was caught abusing him so my dad went to pick him up so he is going to live with us. My heart started to beat quickly. She asked if I would share my room with him and I agreed. When he came he seemed really scared and shy. My mom put him and my little sister in the living room to talk and get comfortable with each other. When it was my turn he stared at the ground shyly. I felt bad for him. \"Hi im Shawn.\" I tell him. He for sure looks like my brother. \"Im Nolan.\" (Aka you) He says still looking at the ground. \"What do you like to do for fun?\" I ask him. \"I like to play gutair but i havent played much since my mom smashed it on the ground.\" He says. \"Im sorry she broke it.\" I say feeling sorry for him. \"Stay here I'll be back.\" I say and run up to my room wher my dad is assembling a bed for him. I grab my second gutair (since my first is my favorite and my new one broke) and run down stairs to him. \"Here. This is for you.\" I say and give him the gutair. His face lights up and he smiles. Seeing my little brother smile melts my heart. \"Thank you.\" He says. \"I don't mean to brag or anything but I'm famous and write and sing songs so I was wondering if you've heard any of them?\" I ask. He starts to blush. \"Yes my mom showed me them. I think you are very talented.\" He says blushing. \"Aww thanks.\" I say. \"Can I give you a hug?\" I ask him. \"It's okay if you're not ready.\" I say. \"You're my brother. Go for it. Just not too hard.\" He says. I give him a hug and it takes a second but then he hugs back. \"Agh that hurts.\" He says. \"I'm sorry.\" I apologize. \"Its okay. That's where my mom hit me with a pice if wood yesterday.\" He says. \"Here let me see. Turn around.\" I say in a calm voice. He is scared at first but dose so. I ask him to take his sweater off and he does so. I roll up the back of his shirt and see a big bruse on his back. I put my hand on it slowly and he flinches. \"Please don't my dad or your mom?\" He asks me. \"Okay. But I'm going to tell my sister she's good at this stuff.\" I say and he nods. I took his shirt back down and he puts his sweater back on. My dad knocks on the door and says the room is finished. I help him move his things into our room. When we finish I go to my little sister Aaliyah's room. \"Hey can you look at this huge bruise on Nolan's back please?\" I ask. \"You know the cost.\" She says. \"Aaliyah I don't have any right now.\" I say. \"You're lying. So make it double.\" She says. \"Okay okay fine. I was lying. Just don't tell mom and dad about the brusie.\" I say. \"Then I want 6.\" She says. \"Aaliyah you're going to far.\" I say. \"No no no. You want me to look at the bruise. That's 2. You lied. That's 4. You want me to keep it a secret that 6.\" She says. \"Fine.\" I say. I take her to my room. \"Hi Nolan. Can you take your shirt off so I can look at your bruise?\" She asks in her sweet voice. He blushes and dose so. \"Lay down on your stomach.\" She says. He dose so. \"What know doctor Mendes?\" I tease her. \"Get me an ice pack nurse Mendes.\" She teases me. \"And a towel.\" She adds. I come up with what she asks me. She places the ice packet on the bruise and wraps the towel around it so its stays. \"Your good to go Mr. Mendes.\" She says to him. \"Thank you.\" He says to her. \"Pay up.\" She says to me. I go to my drawer and pull out 6 chocolate coins. \"You're really stretching it.\" I say to her. \"Pleasure doin business with you.\" She says leaving. <br>\r\n(Your/Nolan p.o.v) <br>\r\nAs Aaliyah leaves put my shirt back on. \"Not so bad huh?\" Shawn says to me poking my side. I flinch when he pokes me. \"In sorry did I hurt you?\" He asks. \"No.\" I say blushing. \"Wait. Are you? Ticklish?\" He says wiggling his fingers at me. \"Yes.\" I mutter and blush a lot. \"You poor ticklish thing. You're in for for a long life.\" He says before pouncing on me and tickling my....</span></div></div>",

Mom and dad leave the next morning and put me in charge. Aaliyah gose to her friends house at lunch time leaving just me and Nolan. He plays around with the gutair I gave him. Around 3 I tell him I'm going out with my friends and if he wants to go. He declines and I leave. I while I'm out with my friends I buy a lot more chocolate coins for Aaliyah. I also buy Nolan a stuffed animal of a dog. I come home around sunset and hear Nolan playing the gutair and singing. I go upstairs and knock on the door and come in. \"I got you something.\" I say. \"You really didn't have too.\" He says. \"But I did.\" I say and giving him the stuffed animal. \"Thanks.\" He says. After dinner we watch a movie and he falls asleep on the couch. I lift up his shirt and blow rasberries on his stomach. He wakes up and explodes with laughter. \"Haha quit it haha!\" He screams before rolling over on the ground. \"Come on lets go to bed.\" I say. In the middle of the night I wake up and stare at the ceiling. I see Nolan start to squirm around in his bed and then wakes up gasping and sweating. \"Are you okay?\" I ask him and turn on the lamp. \"F-fine.\" He says whipping his eyes. \"J-just a bad dream.\" He says. I take my shirt of and wipe the sweat off of his face. I get him a new shirt and myself a new shirt. I sit down next to him on his bed and run my fingers through his brown hair. \"What was it about?\" I ask. \"M-my mom found us. A-and she hurt you badly and t-took me away and hurt me every day.\" He said. I could see that he was holding the dog tightly in one hand and gripping the bed sheet with the other. \"That will never happen. I promise she won't hurt you again.\" I tell him. \"What if she dose? What if she hurts you? Or Aaliyah? Or your mom? Or dad? What if she takes me back? What if-\" He says with tears in his eyes. I cut him off by giving him a big hug. \"Let it out.\" I say into his ear. He starts to cry into my shoulder. </span></div></div>",

Shawn starts packing his thigs for tour and sings with me. When the song finishes Shawn turns around and smiles at me. He stands up and sits next to me on my bed. \"I knew I made the right choice.\" He says. \"What?\" I ask confused. \"Close your eyes.\" He tells me and I do so. I hear the sound of a zipper unzipping and the sound of him looking for something. \"Rember when I had you fill out that wired paperwork?\" He asks. \"Yeah?\" I reply. \"That was b.s. Rember when I took you get your picture taken?\" He asks. \"Also b.s.\" He says. \"Hold out your hands.\" He tells me and I do so. I feel something like a small book in one hand and in the other something long and thin. \"Open.\" He says. When I open my eyes I couldnt belive what I saw.<br>\r\n(Shawn p.o.v.)<br>\r\nWhen I saw the huge smile on his face I instantly felt happy. He stood up and jumped on me in a tight hug. \"Pack your things we're going on tour.\" I tell him. \"What. I'm not singing in front of millions of people.\" He says. \"Oh yes you are. Unless you don't want to see me for about a year?\" I tell him. \"Okay fine I'll do it with you.\" He tells me. \"Pack your things.\" He tells me. We leave Saturday.\"<br>\r\n(The day you leave)<br>\r\nWhen we get on the plane I can tell Nolan is scared. \"What if the plane crashes? What if we run out of gas?\" He starts. \"Nolan breath. In. Out. In.\" I guide him and he follows. \"Here I'll hold your hand.\" I say grabbing his hand. I feel bad for Nolan because of his bad anxiety. He bolds my hand tightly and rest his head on my shoulder and I rest my jead on his. \"Its going to be alright.\" I tell him. When the plane takes off be holds my hand tightly and closes his eyes. He ends up falling asleep on me so I try not to move. When we land he is asleep so I squeeze his thigh wich is one of his most sensitive spots. \"Hehe quit it.\" He says slapping my hand. I squeeze it more and he wakes up squirming and holding his hands to his mouth trying not to cause attention. \"Haha quit it haha!\" He says through his hands. I stop and tell him we're here. When we do a meet and greet with the fans a lot of them tought Nolan was my boy friend so later at the show we're going to clear things out. Before the show I see Nolan sitting on the bed holding the stuffed dog I got him a year ago. He was sweating and breathing heavily. \"Shawn what if I mess up? What if they don't like me? What if they dont believe in your brother? What if they hate my voice?\" He begins. \"Shut up.\" I say before jumping on him and squeezing his thighs. \"HAH QUIT IT HAHA WE NEED HAH TO GO HAHA!\" He screams. \"You're right.\" I tell him.</span></div></div>",

When you walk towards stage before they can see you, you stop and start breathing heavily. \"I can't do this.\" You say to Shawn. \"Calm down. Breathe. In. Out. In. Out.\" He guides you. \"Here you can hold my hand.\" He says and you grab it tightly. \"Lets go.\" He says. You take in a deep breath and go with him. When the crowd sees you two hold in hands they start cheering. \"Hey everybody. In Shawn Mendes and this is-\" Shawn gets cut off by the crowd shouting out boyfriend. You both start to blush. \"Haha no he isn't we're both straight. He's my little brother Nolan Mendes.\" He says and the crowd cheers. When the show is over you have to do a meet and greet before you can go back to your hotel room with Shawn. On your 6th show you mess up on the gutair and the words to the song a couple times. On the 8th show you mess up a lot more. When you get back to the hotel room you kick the bed. \"Chill out.\" Shawn tells you. \"Next show is my last show. After that I'm going home.\" You tell him. \"What do you mean you're going home?\" Shawn says. \"I mean I'm going home after next show.\" You say. \"But they love you! You're doing great!\" Shawn tells you. \"I know but I keep messing up and my anxiety isn't helping.\" You say. \"We'll get through it together.\" He tells you. \"Shawn I told you I cant. I just can't I'm sorry.\" You tell him. You stand up and walk twoards the door. \"It's not my fault you have anxiety.\" Shawn tells you. \"Maybe its not but its still a problem I'm having trouble with.\" You say sternly at Shawn. \"Then leave. Leave like you said you're going to. Go home you can't handle it.\" Shawn said with tears in his eyes. \"I'm not like you! I'm not as talented as you! I'm not as cool as you! I'm not as popular as you! I'm not like you!\" You say to him. \"You're right you're not like me. You're not like me at all but you've proved me wrong. I made the wrong choice.\" Shawn said standing up. \"I'll help you pack your stuff.\" He said angrily. You then walked over to him and shoved him on the ground. \"I can do things my self.\" You said. \"Fine.\" Shawn said standing up and shoving you. You quickly packed your things and shoved him out of your way. \"Out of my way jerk.\" You tell him. \"Hey!\" He called you as you were near the door. You turn around and he punches you in the face. You fall to the ground and tears fall from your eyes as the tase of blood fills your mouth. \"You're just like the rest of them.\" You say to him slightly crying. \"Like who?\" He asks. \"I never get hurt by myself on accident. I get beat up at school when you're not around. You're never there. And I hope you never will!\" You say getting up and grabing your things and storming out the hotel. When you are about to leave a little boy around 6 years old stops you. \"Exuse me.\" He calls you. You kneel down to his hight. \"Yes? How can I help you?\" You ask him. He holds out a small notebook and a pen to you. \"Can I have your autograph Mr?\" He asks you blushing. \"Of course.\" You say smiling. \"Never give up on anything okay?\" You tell him. \"Okay.\" He agrees. \"Is your brother here too?\" He asks you. \"Yeah he is.\" You say. \"Can you take me to him?\" He asks you. You agree and check in with his parents and they agree. You hold his hand and walk to his hotel room and knock on the door. \"What do you want?\" He says looking at you. The little boy tugs at Shawn's pants and Shawn looks down. The little boy holds up his little notebook and pen. \"Can I have your autograph?\" He asks Shawn. Shawn does it and gives him a high five. You walk him down to his parents and leave to the airport. After you get off your eight hour flight and you get out the airport, you check your phone.

They start to wiggle their fingers in your armpits and you laugh loudly. You grab your shirt and throw it in their face. When they move the shirt from your face you push them off. You quickly put on your shirt and see your phone and luggage by the door. You grab your things and run out. You see that it is pouring and its dark. Your hair and clothes are completely soaked amd you don't know where you are. You fall to the ground and sit in the rain. A couple minutes later you seeva police officer. \"Out your hands where I can see them.\" He tells you. You show him your shivering hands. \"Come here son.\" He tells you. \"Y-yes sir.\" You say. He points a flashlight in your eyes. \"Where have you been?\" He asked. \"I dont know sir.\" You tell him. \"You must be terribly cold. Get in the back with your things I'll take you to the station.\" He tells you. \"Yes sir.\" You tell him. When you get there he takes you to an interrogation room. He gives you a towel and blanket. You tell him what happen and you wait in their while your parents come to pick you up. You look at the t.v in the corner and see Shawn getting interviewed by a female British news reporter. \"Can you tell us what happened to you and your brother?\" She asked him. \"Long story short we got in a fight and k hurt him.\" He said. \"Do you know where he is now?\" She asks him. \"I hope he's at a hotel or friends house. My parents say he's not home yet and he won't answer me.\" He says. \"If he can see or hear you right now would you like to say something to him?\" She asks him. \"Um I just want to tell you Nolan if you can hear me that I'm sorry.

You watch as he answers. \"Hey doofus.\" You tease him. \"Hey. I'm so sorry. I love you so much-\" he begans. You can see that tears are falling from his eyes. \"Stop being a baby. I'm fine. I'm okay. I dont want to see you home till the tour is over. I want you to finish the tour. And I don't want to see my big brother crying.\" You tell him. \"Okay. Fine.\" He says whipping away his tears. \"Finish the interview. I'm going to hang up.\" You say. \"Okay I love you.\" He says smiling into the camera. \"I love you too doofus.\" You say and hang up. Your parents and Aaliyah come rushing in and hug you. They take you home and have you change into new clothes. They have you sit in the living room with multiple blankets. Aaliyah sits next to you. Your parents go to sleep and Aaliyah falls asleep next to you. You cover her with a blanket and eventuality fall asleep. You then wake up feeling sick. Aaliyah feels your burning forehead. She tells your mom and she checks on you. They assume you got sick because you were wearing jeans and a shirt sleeve shirt last night in the raid without an umbrella.

He grabs your hair and slams the back of your head into the lockers. \"What you call me?\" He asked angrily. \"Agh. I called you a doofus you morron.\" You tell him trying to get his hand off of your brown hair. \"Morron huh? Your the morron, you dont know what you've gotten yourself into.\" He says. The boy then punches you in the gut. \"Agh!\" You let out a small scream of pain. He repatively punches you in the gut. \"Want more?\" He asks you holding you up by your hair. \"Let go of me.\" You say gasping for air. The bully drops you to the ground. \"Lets go.\" he says to his friends. As they leave you look at the end of the hallway where Shawn usaly appears with his happy smile but see he doesn't come. As you walk home you see the same bullies from earlier picking on a little kid. \"You want this shorty?\" He teased the little kid, holding his backpack in the air. \"Yes! Give it back!\" He yelled at him jumping up trying to get it. \"Come on its right here.\" He said holding it higher. Your run and jump up grabbing the backpack and returning it to the little boy. \"Thank you.\" He said. \"Get out of here.\" You tell him. He runs away and you are left with the bully. \"You ruined my fun.\" He says punching you in the eye. \"So what.\" You tell him. \"You're going to be the new fun.\" He says kicking you in the gut. \"At least its not the 2nd grader.\" You tell him. \"Thats right. Beating up a famous person is much more fun.\" He says stepping on your hand with all is weight. You here a pound cracking sound and pain fills your hand. \"Agh!\" You let out a scream of pain. The bully laughs at your pain. You see a rock fly and hit him in the head. \"Ouch.\" He says looking behind him just in time to see another rock hit him in the face. You see Aaliyah throwing rocks at him. \"Leave him alone!\" Aaliyah yells holding up more rocks. \"Ugh fine.\" He yelled and ran away. \"Are you okay?\" She asked running up to you. \"Ugh no I'm not!\" You say with tears in your eyes holding the hand be stepped on. \"I'll call mom.\" Aaliyah said looking at your eye. Aaliyah and Shawn's mom comes and takes you to the doctors. They find out you have a broken hand and a black eye. You are sent home with a cast and an ice pack. You were sad that tomorrow is December 3rd wich is your birthday and Shawn isn't here and you have a broken hand. That night you go upstairs and put on some pjamma pants and take your shirt of, you then go to sleep. You wake up and struggle to put a shirt on. You drop your left hand onto the bed without thinking and quickly muffle your scream with your right hand. Surfing the whole day nobody says anything about your birthday. When the sun sets all the lights go out so you are left in your room in the dark. Your step-mom, dad, and Aaliyah come into your room singing happy birthday. Your step-mom and dad are holding a cake with candles and Aaliyah is holding a tablet with the screen facing you. On the screen you see a video call with Shawn singing happy birthday to you in the dark to make it seem like he is there. Shawn apologizes for not being there. You blow out your candles. \"Did you wish for me to be there?\" Shawn asks. \"What else?\" You say. \"I don't know mabye for your hand you broke that nobody told me about to be healed?\" Shawn said looking shocked at your left hand. \"Why if you're cooler?\" You say. \"Well, look outside your window.\" Shawn says. You look outside and see a man. \"Your wish has been granted.\" Shawn says. \"But can you unlock the door its been snowing out here.\" Shawn says. You quickly run past your parents and sister, down the stairs to the front door, out the front door, into the snow, and into Shawn's arms. As soon as you hug Shawn you start crying tears of joy. \"Shh. Its okay I'm here now.\" Shawn says. \"I'm sorry for pushing you.\" You say through tears. \"In sorry for punching you.\" Shawn says tickling your neck but you don't laugh. \"Not ticklish there.\" Shawn says to himself.

There was an interview with Shawn. \"So hows your brother?\" They asked him. \"Step brother.\" He corrected. \"Oh in sorry, step brother.\" They apologized. \"I'm going to be honest. I dont know where he is. And I dont care where he is.\" He said. \"Why's that?\" They asked. \"My girlfriend cheated on me with him.\" Shawn said. \"I hope I don't have to see him again.\" He says. You were completely shocked. You continued driving. A car came out of nowhere. \"Whach out!\" Alice screamed. The car smashed into you. Your car flipped down a hill. You held Alice's hand tightly. A pice of glass got stuck in your leg and you screamed. In a couple of minutes you were in the hospital. When you were ready to leave, Alice's friend drove you home. When you got home you found out that the person who crashed into you was also listening to the interview. They apparently got angry and saw you. They then hit the gas and purposely hit you. On the news was another interview with Shawn. He said that it was good that you got hit. He also announced that he and Camila Cabello were dating. He also anounced be was going on tour again without you. A couple of months later you're in college and you and Alice went to go and street perform at a popular marketplace. You were singing I know is what you did last summer by Camila Cabello and your brother Shawn Mendes. \"I can't seem to let you go! I can't seem to keep you close!\" You and Alice sang together. You looked at the huge crowd and saw Camila Cabello. You foze and people were wondering what happened. Camila felt bad and walked up to you. \"I know what you did last summer.\" She whispered in your ear. You snapped back to reality and continued. You finished the song and everyone clapped. \"Your amazing!\" Camila told you. \"Thank you. We really should get going. Right Alice?\" You said. \"But its still early.\" She said. You gave her a look. \"Oh. Oh yeah we should go. Yeah sorry. Huge fans.\" Alice said picking up. \"Here let me help you.\" Sje said and helped you pick up. \"No its fine we got it.\" You say. \"Hey you look really familiar.\" She said. \"Oh um people say I look like Shawn Mendes sometimes.\" You say. You look up and see Shawn in the crowd giving someone an autograph. \"You do.\" She said. You put your hood on and try to hide your face. \"Hey Shawn look I found your twin.\" Camila called Shawn. Alice also put on her hood and some sunglasses. \"Oh look at the time.\" Alice said. Shawn came up to you guys. You hide your face. \"Hey its really hot you shouldn't be in black jeans and a sweater.\" Shawn says. You nod your head. \"Camila here says you look like me. Let me see.\" Shawn says. You put on sunglasses to cover your green eyes that turned into brown eyes and quickly put on a hat to cover your brown hair. \"I can't realy tell cause if your hat and sunglasses.\" Shawn says. \"Oh um sorry.\" You say making your voice deeper. You squeeze your eyes shut. Shawn takes off you sunglasses and hat. \"Lets go Camila.\" Shawn says. \"What why?\" She asks taking another look at your face. \"Oh!\" She says realizing that you're brothers. \"Shawn.\" You say with tears in your eyes. \"What!\" He yelled at you. A crowd started to form. You rolled up your sleeves revaling cuts you gave yourself. You show Shawn. \"I'm sorry.\" You say with tears. \"I really hope this makes you feel better, seriously.\" You say and turn to leave. \"You cut yourself?\" Alice and Camila say at the same time. You looked down ashamed. \"Yes.\" You say. \"I thought that if I was in pain it possibly dead then Shawn would be happy again.\" You say with tears. \"No. Stop. I'm sorry. I should've let you explain.\" Shawn said with tears in his eyes. Shaw. Was on his hands and knees. \"I'm so sorry. I never should've broke your gutair. I shouldn't have hit you. I shouldn't have tossed you on the ground. I shouldn't have pulled your hair.\" Shawn apoligized. You saw tears falling from his eyes. Tears started falling from your eyes. \"No I'm sorry. She was giving me signals. I should've noticed. In an idiot!\" You say starting to hit yourself. Shawn pulled you into a hug and held your fists. \"Stop. Yiur not an idiot. Your amazing. Your my brother. Even if our moms are diffrent. We still have the same dad. We will always be related.\" Shawn tells you. Camila also joins the hug and so doae Alice. \"Do you two want to go on tour with us?\" Shawn asks.</span></div></div>",

You went home and stared packing some things to take with you. \"I'll be home before you know it.\" You tell Alice. You went to Shawn and Camilla's hotel to talk about the tour. You got home an hour earlier than you expected. When you walked in you saw Alice kissing another man and rubbing his growing bulge. She saw you and her face turned red. You went to your room and packed your things. You rushed out and drove to the beach. You got out if your car with tears in your eyes. You sat on the sand near the water. You remembered your first kiss with Alice at the beach watching the sunset. You imeaditly broke down and started crying. <br>\r\n(30 minutes ago at the hotel.)<br>\r\n I'm going to go out on a walk. I'll be back in an hour.\" Camilla said. \"Alright be safe.\" Shawn tells Camilla. Camilla was walking around and ended up at the beach. <br>\r\n(Back to present time.) You burried your face in your hands crying. Someone taps you on your shoulder. \"I'm sorry not now.\" You say through tears. \"Its me.\" Camila says. You quickly wipe your eyes and quickly get up putting on sunglasses to cover your red eyes. \"Hi Camila.\" You say. \"Come on sit.\" She tells you as she sits down. You do as she says and avoid eye contact. \"What's wrong?\" She asks you. \"Nothing I'm fine.\" You say sternly. \"Maybe I should call Shawn.\" She says getting ready to stand up. You grab her arm. \"No! Please.\" You say. \"What's wrong?\" She asks again. Tears fill your eyes. \"I got home and caught my girlfried cheating on me. And I really liked her.\" You say. \"I let her play me. I'm such a fool. An idiot! I should've known. Why would I think someone would like me and want to be my friend in school? Everybody hated me. Why would I think she's diffrent?\" You say crying. You grab a plastic knife that was in the sand and drag it across your arm. The knife only leaves a red mark. \"Stop! Your not an idiot. Your a kind, thoughtful, talented, sweet, awesome young man. Stop doing that.\" She says grabbing the plastic knife and throwing it. \"In sorry.\" You say burying your face in your hands and crying. \"There are people here who love you. Shawn, me, Aaliyah, your dad, your step mom.\" Camila says. \"That's it. Just you and my family. It seems like everyone else hates me. No girl talks to me.\" You say through tears. \"You'll find someone who loves you. I promise.\" She tells you. She gives you a hug and you cry into her shoulder. \"I won't lie to you.\" Someone sings from behind you. You turn around and see a crowd of people. You even see news reporters. You see that Shawn is the one singing. \"I know she's just not right for you.\" Shawn continues singing the song he wrote called Treat you better. \"We all know you can't tell me off even if you say she's the one that you want.\" Shaw sings. \"And you were slending all your time in that wrong situation and anytime you want it to stop.\" He sings. \"We know we can treat you better! Than she could! And any king of guy like you deserves a great life!\" Shawn and everybody else sings. \"I'll stop time for you. The moment you admit that others love you too!\" The crowd sings. \"Cause we knoa we cam treat you better! Than she could!\" Everbody sings. At the end of the song everybody holds up a board with letters that spelll out, \"We Love, Care, And Adore You!\". You run to Shawn and hug him. You cry into his shoulder. \"Awww.\" The crowd awws. \"Thank you all!\" You shout and the crowd cheers. \"Alright nkw hide us from the new!\" Camila yells. \"Lets go you two. Into the crowd. We meet at your car.\" Camila tells you. You all split up into the crowd. When you all make it to the car you all burst out laughing. When you get to Shawn and Camila's hotel you all sit on the couch. Camila and Shawn look at each other. \"Hold him.\" She tells Shawn. \"What?\" You ask. Shawn pins your arms above your head.

Not even that he's the coolest guy I met. Our friendship is so strong that he said we could be roommates. His new house is so big for just one person so he said I could move in with him. So I'm on a plane super excited to see my best friend. As soon as I got off the plane I texted him.<br>\r\nShawn: Guess what?<br>\r\nNolan: What?<br>\r\nShawn: Im at the airport. <br>\r\nNolan: And you didn't tell me to pick you up?<br>\r\nShawn: I didn't want you to drive all the way over here<br>\r\nNolan: Look up<br>\r\nI look up and there he was. My best friend. Nolan. As soon as I saw him I instantly ran up to him and hugged him. \"I missed you too.\" Nolan tells me as he huggs back. Nolan has dirty blonde hair and blue eyes with slightly curly hair at the tips of his hair and light color skin. I'm older than Nolan by 3 months.<br>\r\n(Your pov/Nolan) <br>\r\nI'm so happy to see my best friend again that I could scream. \"You ready?\" I ask him. \"Yea lets go.\" When we get there I give him a house tour. \"This is the living room.\" I show him. \"This is the kitchen have anything you want anytime.\" I tell him. \"Gee thanks.\" He says. \"This is the bathroom.\" I show him. \"This is your room.\" I show him. \"This is a spare room. This is my room. This is the basement. This is another bathroom. This is another spare room. This is the attic. And that is the backyard.\" I tell him.<br>\r\n(Shawn pov)<br>\r\nHis house is huge. So is my room. He decorated my room perfectly. I wonder if he's still ticklish?. \"Wow your house is amazing.\" I tell him. \"Thanks.\" He says blushing. \"Come with me.\" I tell him. This is my room right?\" I ask him. \"Yes.\" He tells me. \"Its amazing. You couldn't have done a better job.\" I tell him. \"Thanks.\" His face bright red. \"Lay down. I want to try something.\" I say poiting at the bed. \"I umm o-okay.\" He says his face extremely red. This must be really embarrassing for him. I slid my fingers under his shirt and started wiggling my finger in between his ribs. He started squirming and giggling. \"Sh-Shawn haha st-sthahahahap.\" He giggled. Man his laugh is still cute. \"It seems like you're enjoying it though.\" I tell him.<br>\r\n(Your/Nolan pov)<br>\r\nShawn kept wiggling his fingers in between my sensitive ribs. \"Hahaha Shawn hahaha thats hahaha enough hahaha.\" I said through laughter. \"But I love your laugh.\" Shawn said taking your shirt off. Shawn then held my hands above my head with one hand because he is so strong and stuck his tounge in my bellybutton making me squirm and buck my hips. \"SHAWN NOT THERE HAHAHAHAHA PLEASE HAHAHA!\" I yelled. \"Aww but I don't want to.\" Shawn said with sad eyes looking into my eyes. \"Ughh fine only 1 more minute.\" I said. \"Yay!\" He said happily. He then repeatedly squeezed my thighs making me squirm and thrash wildly like a fish out of water. \"OH MY HAHAHAHA GOD AHHAHA OKAY HAHAHA ENOUGH HAHAHA!\" I screamed. \"Come on just a little longer your laugh is so cute.\" He said squeezing my thighs again. \"No MORE.\" I jumped as he squeezed my thighs again. \"Aww please.\" He said looking at me with pleading eyes. \"I said no.\" I say pushing him on the bed. I took off his shirt and tued his hands together with his shirt. \"No dont! I'm sorry I won't do it!\" He said. \"Too late.\" I said blowing many rasberries on his sensitive abs. \"HAHAHA COME ON HAHHAHA STOP HAHAHA PLEASE HAHAHA.!\" He begged me for about 10 minutes straight until I stopped. We both gave each other a hug. What do you want to do now?\" I asked. \"How about....</span></div></div>",

The only people who noticed me or interacted with me were the bullies usaly pushing and hitting me. I hated my self. I rarely ate and was abused by my parents. At lunch I sat down at a table and waited for lunch to end. At tge end of the last class everybody left but my teacher needed to talk to me. Another student was standing next to my teacher. \"Nolan.\" He said to me. \"Shawn here doesn't under stand the math lesson. Would you be willing to tutor him after school?\". He said. \"O-oh. O-of c-course.\" I said afraid if I said no Shawn woukd get mad and hurt me later. As we walked to my house I was nervous of what my parents would think. As we got to my house we went straight to my room. I did my best to explain the math and he listened. By sunset he understood the math well. \"NOLAN!\" I heard my parents yell. \"Comming.\" I say walking out of my room and towards them. \"Wash these dirty dishes.\" My mother said. \"C-can it w-wait. I ha-\" I was cut if mid sentence by my mother slapping me across the face extremely hard knocking me on the ground. I tried to grab onto something but instead knocked down a cup of water on the ground. \"Nolan!\" I heard Shawn yell. \"How could you do this to your own son?\" Shawn said helping me up. \"He is not my son he us a disapointment.\" My dad said pushing Shawn away. \"Thisvis family business so stay out of it.\" My dad said pushing me back to the ground. This made Shawn furious so he charged at my parents and pushed them over and grvbed me then ran out the door. Shawn grabbed his phone and called 9-1-1. I was taken away and put in foster care. (1 month later.) I was taken in by a good group of people. I had two 10 year old twin brothers and a kind father. I haven't gone to the same school since 9 months ago and I lost contact with Shawn until one day he showed up at my door. I instantly hugged him and he hugged back. \"Thank you.\" I cried into his shoulder. \"For everything.\" I invited him in and we talked about how our life has been. My dad was with the twins on a vacation I didn't want to go in but he said Shawn can stay as long as he wants. \"Can I try something on you? Its okay if you say no I wont hurt you.\" He said. \"I um oh okay.\" I said nervously. Shawn held my arms above my head and started tickling my armpits. \"Hahaha what haha are you hahaha doing haha!\" I ask him. \"Its called tickling.\" He said moving down to my ribs. \"Hahaha what haha am I haha doing haha.\" I ask him. \"It's called laughing. You laugh when someone touches touches your tickle spots or you see ir hear something funny. \"Hahaha oh haha it feels haha good haha!\" I laugh. \"Some people dont like being tickled but some do and sometimes its both.\" He tells me tickling my sides. \"I haha kinda haha hate it haha and haha like it haha!\" I laugh. \"That's goof because I like to tickle people.\" He whispers into my ear and sliding his hands under my shirt and starts tickling my slightly toned stomach. \"HAHAHA OKAY HAHA THATS ENOUGH HAHA PLEASE STOP HAHA!\" I laugh. \"But I don't want to.\" He says circling my bellybutton. He tickled me everywhere and when I sat everywhere I mean everywhere. </span></div></div>",

I blush. \"Thanks.\" I say. \"No problem. In sure you'll get in.\" He says. A week letter there were not one but two letters from W.C.C. One was adreesed to me and the other to Shawn. Apparently he applied after I told him I applied. We both got accepted. W.C.C was far away about 2 and a half hours drive so I guess he didn't want to be alone. \"Nolan.\" I heard Shawn call me. \"Yea?\" I asked. \"Come here.\" He said.

I constantly move from diffrent places I call home to more places I call home to avoid being taken away and put in an orphanage. <br>\r\n(First day of high school)<br>\r\nAs soon as I step in I feel somethings wrong. At lunch a boy walks up to me. \"Hi im Tanner.\" The tall boy with dark green eyes, light skin, and brown hair introduced himself. \"This is Troy, Thomas, and Travis.\" He says pointing to an average height boy with green eyes, light skin, and light brown hair. A boy with blonde hair and blues eyes with tan skin. And a boy with black hair brown eyes and light skin. \"I um h..hi.\" I say. Tanner holds out his hand and I'm hesitant at first but the shake it. \"You think we would be friends with a freak like you?\" Tanner asked before twisting my arm and pushing me onto the ground. \"You wish loser.\" He tells me. They laugh and walk away. I scraped my arm on the ground and heard someone walk up to me. \"Hey are you alright?\" A boy asked me. I sat up and backed away afraid of him. People looked at me like I was crazy. He lifted his hand and I closed my eyes ready for him to hit me. I waited but he never hit me. I opened my eyes and saw that he was holding his hand out to help me up. Nobody can be that kind so I got up myself and slowly walked backwards. \"In not going to hurt you. I just want to see if you're okay.\" He said. \"I-I'm f-f-fine.\" I tell him. \"Are you sure?\" He said steping towards me. \"Let me see your arm.\" He said. More people were looking at me. \"Let me see your arm.\" He said again. I was scared but I had to show him. I lifted up my Aleve from my sweater and long sleeve shirt and showed him. \"Ooh that looks bad.\" He said to me and it did look bad. \"All the nurse will do is give you an ice pack. Meet me at tge front gate after school so I can fix you up got it?\" The boy said. \"Y-yes.\" I tell him. \"I'm Shawn. Shawn Mendes.\" He tells me. \"I-I'm N-Nolan. N-Nolan H-Hatch.\" I tell him. \"It's nice to meet you.\" He says. The bell then rings. \"Got to go. See you later.\" As I walk to my next class a group of girls came up to me. \"We saw how you were talking with Shawn earlier. Just wanted to let you know that the two of you will never be together or even friends.\" She said. \"Come on girls.\" She said and walked away. At the end of school I go to the front gate. \"Hey. I have all the stuff at my house so we would have go go there. My parents won't care I don't know about yours though. I don't have to fix it you you don't want me to though, but if I don't you'll probably get an infection and get sick.\" I don't have enough money to get medication if I get sick so I have to say yes. When we get there he tells me to sit down on his bed while he gets the things he needs. He comes back with disinfecting achohal and a bandage. \"Can you take your shirt off please?\" He asks. I blush and do as he says. \"This might hurt a bit.\" He says before pouring some disinfecting achohal on my arm. It stings a lot but I try to hide my pain. He wraps a banage around my arm and says I can put my clothes back on. \"You can stay longer if you want.\" He says. \"N-no t-t-thank y-you. I s-s-should be g-g-geting h-home.\" I tell him. \"Here I'll drive you.\" He says. \"I-I'm o-o-okay.\" I tell him. \"Alright. Get home safe Nolan.\" He tells me. I nod and leave. When I get to the ally im staying at I change into my more dirty clothes and look through trash to find if anybody accidently threw away money or if I can find something valuable or to sell. At sunset in lucky enough to find some batteries for my lantern, an old pillow, and a small piece of chicken in a box. I pull out my water and start having dinner. After that I take off my shirt and pants the go to sleep. I wake up and get dressed for the day. I go to school early and see that there's not many people here yet. Then the girls from yesterday come up to me. \"What happened to your arm sweaty.\" The girl said. \"S-Shawn h-helped m-me.\" I told her. \"S-Shawn h-helped y-you?\" She mocked me. \"D-don't m-make f-f-fun of m-my s-s-stuttering p-problem!\" I tell her. \"Oh i-I'm s-sorry. W-why d-d-don't you h-h-have S-Shawn h-help you? Oh w-wait. He didn't really help you at all.\" She said slapping me across the face with a loud slap noise. \"Next time think twice before you lie to us.\" She said before leaving with her friends. A couple minutes later Shawn comes up to me. \"Hows your arm?\" He asked. \"G-good.\" I tell him trying to hide the very red hand mark on my face. \"W-why a-a-are you b-b-being n-nice to me?\" I ask him. \"Because you seemed sad. Lonely. Alone.\" He tells me. \"W-why d-don't y-y-you think im a f-f-freak? W-why c-can't you o-ordaniry a-and t-treat me l-l-like a f-f-freak?\" I ask him my eyes tearing up. I look down as he stands behind me rubbing my back. \"Well for starters please dont cry. And dont call yourself a freak just because of your stuturing. Plus we dont have to be ordaniry just because everybody else is you just need to give it your all even though it might be scary just make your best mistake and learn from it. I don't treat you like a freak because you aren't one. I know that I can treat you beter than all the other teens in the school all the stars in the sky could see that.\" At this point I was silently crying. Tears pouring down my eyes. \"You know how I said don't cry?\" He asked. \"Y-yes.\" I say through tears. \"Just let it all out.\" He says hugging me. He slid his hands under my shirt and started running his fingers up and down my sides. \"H-hey haha w-what hahaha are haha you doing hahaha.\" I said through laughter. \"Its called tickling.\" He tickled me for 20 minutes straight before we needed to go to class. Before I left to class I gave Shawn the biggest hug ever and he hugged back. The only class I have with Shawn is math wich is before lunch. Durring that class there was a...</span></div></div>",

Everybody ran out including me. I was worried everybody pushed Nolan (you) out of their way making him fall and people running over him. I ran over to his class room and I saw him lifting a desk of a girl. I helped him get the desk off the girl and helped her get up. \"Come one we need to get out of here quick!\" I say. Before anyone can do anything the roof falls down crushing Nolan. Next thing I know I'm sitting next to the hospital bed Nolan is in. \"S-Shawn?\" I hear him whisper. \"Yes?\" I say. \"W-where am I?\" He asks. \"Your in a hosptal Mr Hatch.\" Said the doctor. \"Your ready to leave.\" He said. \"R-realy th-thanks.\" Nolan said happily and for the first time he smiled himself. Seeing his smile made my heart melt. \"You will have to come back in two weeks so we can remove your casts.\" When we were in my car I had to tell him some sad news. \"Um Nolan?\" I say. \"Y-yes?\" He responds. \"While you were out. We couldn't find your parents or your home.\" I tell him. He the starts tearing up. \"Hey its okay. You can stay with me and my family.\" I say. \"I-its n-not t-that I don't have a home anymore.\" He said through tears. \"What is it?\" I ask. \"M-my parents d-died when I was 8. A-and I h-have been living o-on the streets. T-the t-thought of my p-parents remind me of w-when they w-would h-hurt m-me.\" He said. \"Oh Nolan in sorry I didn't know.\" I said. The rest if the way to my house was quiet. My parents already got another bed set up in my room for Nolan to stay in. I helped Nolan up the stairs because of his broken foot and arm. I told him to rest. I went down stairs and told my parents about Nolan. I went up to see how he was doing and saw that he was asleep. I sat down next to his bed and ran my fingers through his hair. I run my fingers through his dirty blonde hair. I go back down stairs and make him something to eat. I go back up with a tray of food and set it down on the dresser. I walk over to him and gently lift his shirt up. I run my fingers up and down his lightly toned stomach trying to tickle him. He starts to squirm and giggle a bit before waking up. \"I brought you food.\" I say pulling his shirt back down and helping him sit up. After he eats I ask him if he wants to go back to sleep or do something else.</span></div></div>",

You see your little brother Oliver sitting on a chair looking worried and Shawn trying to make him laugh. Oliver looked up and saw you were awake so he ran over to you and hugged you and you hugged back. \"H-how d-did you g-get h-here Olive?\" You asked. Olive is your nickname for him. \"The butler drove me here because mom and dad didn't want to come so I came instead. I was worried about you No Land.\" He said. No Land is his nickname for you because it sounds like Nolan. \"I told Mr Mendes that-\" Oliver began. \"You can call me Shawn.\" He said. \"I told Shawn that you sleep in your boxers so we took your clothes you could sleep well.\" Oliver said. Your face turned a bright red. \"I-I d-do sleep in m-my u-underwear b-but o-only at home O-Olive!\" You say. Shawn's parents were on vacation for the week and Shawn's sister was at a sleepover for the weekend so Shawn and Oliver take care if you. They go down stairs to make you something to eat. \"You can stay the night if you want. I can call your house and ask them to drop off some of your clothes if you want.\" Shawn tells Oliver. \"Thank you.\" Oliver says. \"No Land is staying on Saturday and Sunday right?\" Oliver asks. \"Only if he wants. I'm not sure if he wants to because he's sick though.\" Shawn says. \"I think he will. When he was getting his things he talked about how he thinks you might actually be his friend. He used to get picked on so he was scared of you at first but you started being nice to him. He has p.t.s.d about what happened to his parents but tickling or rubbing his back might help him. Tickling and rubbing his back helps him with a lot of things.\" Their butter arives with Oliver's clothes. \"This is for you.\" Oliver says pulling out a real gold coin with the word friend on it. \"Oh I can't take this. Its yours.\" Shawn said holding it out to Oliver. \"No its yours now. Do t lose it.\" He said. \"Thanks and I won't.\" Shawn says kneeling down to Oliver's hight and giving him a hug. Oliver hugs back. \"Please take care of my brother when I'm not around?\" Oliver asks. \"I promise I will.\" Shawn says. Then they hear someone trying to break into the house. Shawn picks up Oliver and runs up stairs and sees that you are sitting on the bed fully clothed rubbing your throbing head. Shawn closes the door and locks it. He turns of the light and sits Oliver in your lap and pulls you to the corner of the bed and room. \"W-what's g-going o-on?\" You ask. \"Someone's trying to get in.\" Shawn whispers. Oliver burries his head in your chest and holds your hand and Shawn's hand. Shawn holds his hand out for you to hold and you take it. Eventually whoever was I side the house leaves and Shawn goes out to look. Shawn comes back with three bowls of soup and says nothing was stolen. He locks the bedroom door and when it gets dark he turns on his flashlight from his phone. The three of you argue on who gets the bed. You say it should be Shawn and Oliver. Shawn says it should be you and Oliver. Oliver says it should be you and Shawn. You all end up sharing the bed. The next morning Oliver goes home and Shawn shows you something. \"Whoever was here yesterday left us this.\" He showed you a note. The note read<br>\r\nDear Shawn Mendes and Nolan Hatch<br>\r\nI will be comming back tomorrow at 10:00am if you are not here at this adress <br>\r\n(Adress) at 9:30am sharp. We will have a lot of fun.<br>\r\nYou looked at the note shocked then at your watch. Its 9:20am.</span></div></div>",

Feel free to watch TV or eat something from the fridge.\" Shawn says. \"Thanks.\" You say. Shawn comes back into the room after his shower and sees you laying down on the ground asleep with your somewhat old phone in your hand. Shawn saw that your phone got a text message for your brother<br>\r\nOlive:No Land is something wrong why haven't you been answering me<br>\r\nOlive is what you have him set as a contact and No Land is what he has you as a contact.

Nolan or No Land as you like to call him is asleep so don't worry about him.<br>\r\nOlive: Okay thanks. Take care of him<br>\r\nNo Land: I will.<br>\r\nShawn puts your phone to charge and sits on his bed. Shawn looks at his watch and sees its about to be 12 so he goes down and makes lunch. Shawn comes back up with 2 bottles of soda and 2 sandwiches. Shawn puts the drinks and plates on the dresser. He the sit on your waist and lifts up your shirt. He then dances his fingers over your slightly tonned stomach. You start to squirm in your sleep but then wake up laughing. \"Haha cut haha it out haha please haha!\" You beg. \"Alright I brought you a sandwich.\" Shawn says passing you your plate and a soda bottle. \"Your brother texted.\" Shawn said. \"W-what did he want?\" You ask. \"He wanted to know why you weren't answering but I told him you were asleep.\" Shawn says trying to open his soda bottle. \"T-thanks. Do you want me to open that?\" You offer him. \"Uhh yeah.\" Shawn says embarrassed. Shawn passes youthe bottle and you open it but it sprays in your face. You look at Shawn and you both start laughing. You go on YouTube and see a music video and you see it was made by the person sitting in front of you. Your jaw drops and you look at Shawn. \"Y-you never told m-me you w-write and post your own music.\" You say. \"Oh haha yeah I should have told you.\" Shawn says blushing. A week later on December 2nd Shawn invites you to his house. You ring the doorbell and hear your phone vibrate. You look at your phone and its a text from Shawn. It said :if that's you at the door the come in. You go inside and see that's its pich black inside his house. All the lights turn on and you see Shawn, Mr and Mrs Mendes, Oliver, and Shawn's little sister all yell at you \"surprise!\" You see a big happy birthday sign in the back. They threw you a surprise birthday party. When the party finished, Oliver went home, Shawn's sister went to her friend's house, and Mr and Mrs Mendes went to work. You and Shawn went up to his room and be surprised you with a gutair with the words \"Shawn Mendes and Nolan Hatch BFFS\" you hugged Shawn for about a minute. \"You know that now that now you're 16 you need to be tickled for 15 minutes right?\" Shawn said. \"W-what!\" You yell. \"You're going to need to catch me first!\" You run all over the house and eventually Shawn traps you in his room and tackles you on his bed. \"You're not escaping that easily.\" Shawn said and tickled your..</span></div></div>",

As you walk some 11th grade boy pushes you on the ground. \"Hey rich boy.\" One of his friends says grabing you. \"Got anything for us?\" He asks. \"W-want a pice o-of my m-mind?\" You tell them. \"Don't be a smart ass.\" Another one said. The one holing took your backpack and passed it to another one of his friends and held your hands behind you back. His friend opended your backpack and dumped everything out. \"He's got nothing. No lunch money. No wallet. Only books and notebooks. What a book worm.\" He said. He then grabbed your note book and ripped pages out of it. \"Oh no! My bad sorry dork.\" He said. \"Ooh whats this?\" He says grabing a note from Oliver. \"L-let go of me! D-dont touch t-that!\" You yell. \"I can't get my mouth to say the things I want to say to you that's why I wrote to you. When we walked, when we laugh, when we spend our time walking by the ocean side. Our hands are gently intertwined. I have a feeling I just can't describe. I assume this is typical of love. In my dreams. When you're with me I always have a feeling that's hard to describe. But I know now that it is love. I love you Oliver no matter what.\" He read. \"Its a love letter. You're gay aren't you.\" He said. \"I-I'm not. Thats f-for my b-brother.\" You call Oliver your brother and not your adoptive brother for the first time in a while. \"Oh yeah right.\" The one holing you says throwing you on the ground. \"G-give it back!\" You yell. \"No no no.\" He teases you. He then rips the note into 20 pieces and gives 2 to each of friends. Your eyes start to tear up. \"Oh no he's going to cry over your note for your boy friend?\" One of them said. \"Give those back to him. Now!\" You look up and see that Shawn is furious. \"What are you going to do about it huh little singer?\" They tease him. \"In famous. In sure the fans would hate to know my best friend is being bullied.\" Shawn said looking angry. You start to pick up the papers that were ripped out of your notebooks as tears fell from your eyes. \"You win this time singer.\" He said as everybody gave him the paper pieces. They leave and Shawn helps you get your things. \"Here.\" He says handing you the ripped pieces of paper. You grab them and put them in your pocket. \"I don't care if you like guys.\" Shawn says standing up and holding out his hand. You get up yourself and show him a pice of the paper that said: that it is love. I love you Oliver no matter what. \"Oh. I'm sorry I didn't know.\" He says to you. \"Course you didn't.\" You say and walk to your locker. \"Hey I didnt mean to offend you!\" Shawn calls after you. \"Im not offended.\" You tell him sternly. \"You clearly are and I'm so so sorry.\" Shawn says. \"I said I'm not offended!\" You yell at him. \"O-okay I'm sorry.\" Shawn tells you. \"No I'm s-sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you.\" You say starting to tear up. \"Imma g-go now.\" You say and run to your next class. After school you don't wait for Shawn to drive you home instead you run home. As soon as you get to Hatch Manor you run to Oliver. \"Oliver. Come here.\" You tell him. \"Um okay?\" He says. You take him to your room nd he sits down on your bed. \"When we walked, when we laugh, when we spend our time walking by the ocean side. Our hands are gently intertwined.

I love you Oliver no matter what.\" You tell him. \"Oliver stands up and walks over to you. He then hugs you. His head only reaches bellow your chest and above your slightly toned stomach. Just then the doorbell rings. You and Oliver go downstairs and see its Shawn. When you open the door Shawn gives you a big hug. \"Is e-everything o-okay?\" You ask. Shawn kneels down a bit and hugs Oliver. \"Sorta\" He says. \"I'm going on tour.\" He says. \"Oh.\" You and Oliver say. \"Um...congratulations.\" You say. \"Thanks.\" He says. \"I just couldn't leave without knowing that were cool. Right?\" Shawn says hopefully. \"Always no matter what.\" You tell him. \"Thanks. That means more than you could imagine. Anyways. I brought you guys something. These are really important to me. So its like pices of my heart, make them all your own, so when we are apart, you'll never be alone. And when you fall asleep just rember we lay under the same stars. I may be far but never gone. Oliver this is for you.\" Shawn says giving him a custom doller coin with the word friend ingraved on it. \"It looks similar to the one I gave you.\" Oliver tells him. Shawn pulls out the gold coin Oliver gave him. \"And I will never lose mine.\" Shawn says. \"Then I won't lose mine either.\" Oliver says hugging Shawn. \"And for you.\" Shawn says pulling out a string. \"This is a string from my first gutair. Don't ever take it of. Unless you're taking a shower or swimming or something that might cause you to lose it of course.\" Shawn tied the string around your wrist like a bracelet, not loose enough to fall off or tight enough to cut off blood flow. \"I have one too.\" Shawn said lifting up his hand showing you his string from his gutair. \"I won't ever lose it. Nor take it off.\" You say giving him a gigantic hug. \"I promise I will see you again.\" He tells you. \"Here's proof.\" He says giving you v.i.p tickets to a show. \"These tickets are v.i.p. Best seats. Its the last location right here in Toronto. After the show come backstage.\" Be says. \"Thanks. We'll be there.\" You tell him. \"Until next time.\" Shawn says. \"Untill n-next time.\" You say. Oliver begans to cry into your chest/stomach. \"Shawn.\" You call after him. \"Yeah?\" He turns around. \"Break a leg.\" You say giving him a thumbs up. He smiles and nods. \"I'll keep in touch.\" He says.</span></div></div>",

You get through your classes well and at lunch time like usual you don't eat. You get through the rest of the day but feel emlty. When you get home Oliver asks you to call Shawn. You put it on speaker while it rings. You are instantly sent to voicemail and listen to Shawn's voice. \"Hey there. I'm probably busy at the moment and I will see if I can call you back got it? Have a nice day. And if you want to leave me a message press one please.\" The recorded message Shawn made said. You looked at Oliver and he nodded at you. \"H-hey Shawn just wanted to see how you're doing. And we miss you. Hope you're having a great time and hope you're killing it.\" You say. \"Now Oliver wants to leave you a message so here he is.\" You say. \"Hi Shawn. I still have the coin. Hope you didn't lose mine. I really miss you and hope to see loss you soon. Bye.\" He says. You then end the message. About 5 hours later at 8:00pm Shawn face times you. \"Hey buddy.\" He says. \"Hi Shawn.\" You say getting up from your desk and walking up to the 4th floor where Oliver's room is. \"How you doin.\" He says. \"Good. And you? How did you're first show go?\" You ask walking up the stairs. \"It was great. They really loved the song we made together. I told them it was for my best friend and they started cheering super loud.\" He says. You then start to blush. \"Oliver!\" You call. \"Yeah?\" He says comming out from his room. \"Look.\" You show him your phone. \"Is that Shawn?\" He asks. \"You bet its me!\" He says. \"How you've been?.\" The three of you talk for hours. <br>\r\nThe day before Shawn gets home.<br>\r\nYou go to your locker and grab your things. You turn around and see some bullies. It was the begging of summer so you were wearing jeans and a short sleeve button up shirt. One of them grabs your arm. \"What's this? A braclet from your boyfriend?\" He teases you. \"Singer boy isn't here to help you now is he?\" He says. \"No! Don't touch that! Leave it alone!\" You yell. The bully then unties the string Shawn gave you from his first gutair. \"No!\" You scream. \"Oh you want this?\" They tease you. \"Yes I'll go anything. That's really important to me! Please give it to me I'll do anything!\" You start to sob. \"Then scream you have a boyfriend.\" He says. \"Scream it!\" He yells. You stop crying and do what he says. \"I have a boyfriend!\" You scream. The bullies start to laugh it you. \"Here.\" He says throwing the string on top of a door frame. \"No!\" You scream. The bullies leave and you jump trying to get the string. You're so close to grabing it but its to far. You sit on the ground and bring your knees up to your chest and start to cry. Someone taps you on your shoulder and you look up and see the string hanging in front of you. You grab it and tie it around your wrist. You look up and see Shawn's sister. \"Hi.\" She says. You wipe away your tears. \"Um H-hi.\" You say getting up. \"I was wondering if Shawn told you anything about what time he was comming back?\" She says. \"Oh. He's comming t-tomorrow at 7:00am.\" You tell her. \"Thanks.\" She said. \"How did you get this down?\" You ask her showing her the string. \"I threw a rock at it.\" She said. \"See you later I need to get to my school.\" She says. \"Bye.\" You say. <br>\r\nThe day Shawn gets back. <br>\r\nThe whole day at school you were smiling and didn't let the bullies bug you. When school ended you ran home, changed, grabbed Oliver, grabbed the tickets, and ran to where the concert was going to be. You held Oliver in your arms and he held the tickets. You ran past the security guards and ran towards Shawn. Shawn was facing the other way when you put Oliver down and the two of you ran towards him but a gaurd jumped on you and grabbed Oliver. \"What do you think you're doing boys?\" He said sternly. Shawn turned around and saw you and Oliver. \"Its okay they're with me.\" Shawn says. \"I should've told you before sorry.\" Shawn tells the gaurd. \"If you say so.\" He says. You run and over push Shawn over when you give him a hug. After the show is over...</span></div></div>",

We were walking by the lunch tables and saw a boy(you) sitting alone looking down. We walked to him. \"Hey there.\" My friend Trent said. \"Nolan right?\" Nolan(you) nodded his head yes. \"Y-yes.\" He said nervously. \"Why don't you come with us and we'll find you some friends.\" Trent said. Nolan shook his head no. \"I-I'm o-okay.\" Trent stood behind Nolan and started raking his fingers up and down his sides tickling him. Seeing Nolan laugh and squirm was kinda cute. \"Haha o-o-okay st-stop p-please o-okay m-mercy haha!\" He squirmed. \"Here come with us.\" Trent said holding out his hand. Maybe I am hanging out with the right kids. Nolan was hesitant at first and I could tell he didn't want to but just didn't want to get tickled but took Trent's hand. \"Ha loser.\" Trent said throwing Nolan on the ground. \"Nobody will help you just because freak. Lets go boys.\" Trent said kicking Nolan. As the others followed Trent they kicked Nolan. When it was my turn I knelt down by him. \"In sorry they did that.\" I said. \"P-please d-don't hurt m-me.\" Nolan said. This made me feel really bad. \"I'm wasn't planning to.\" I reached my hand to pat his shoulder but he scooted back. As I looked at where he was before I saw that there was a bit of blood. \"Wait I won't hurt you.\" I tell him. \"Come on Shawn lets go.\" Trent called. \"Go on without me I'll catch up!\" I yell. \"Let me see your elbows.\" I tell him. He's scared but he shows me. His black long sleeve shirt us ripped atvthe elbows and I can see a gash on his elbows. \"After school, meet me here and I'll fix your cut. I'll come alone. I won't hurt you.\" He looks nervous. \"If you don't come and I don't fix it then your cut will get infected wich will make you sick.\" I tell him. \"O-okay I-I'll c-come.\" He says. At the end of the day I wait at the benches. He eventually shows up. \"We're going to beed to go to my house so I can fix it if thats okay with you.\" I say. \"I-its o-o-okay.\" He says. When we get their I ask him to take if his plaid shirt he has over his black long sleeve shirt. Its already unbuttoned so he just slips it off. I lift up his selves and pour some disinfecting achohal on his cuts the wrap a bandage aroubd each one. \"See it wasn't that bad was it?\" I say running my fingers through his yellow brown hair. \"N-no.\" He says. \"Your're welcome to stay the night. I can lend you some clothes.\" I offer. \"M-my p-parents w-wouldn't c-care b-but I s-should really g-get g-going now.\" He says. \"Here I'll drive you.\" I say. \"I um... o-okay.\" He says. I find how shy he is cute. When we get their his parents are outside and look mad. <br>\r\n(You/Nolan pov)<br>\r\nI step out the car and walk slowly twoards my parents. \"Where were you?\" My mom says sternly. \"I-I w-was at a k-kid f-from s-school because s-some k-kids m-made m-me f-fall and s-scrape m-my elbows s-so h-he h-hel-\" I got cut off by my mother slapping me across the face making me fall the the ground. My father walked up to me and put his foot on my head. \"You couldn't do this yourself boy? You were at a boy's house? Your not that are you boy?\" My father asked putting pressure on my head with his foot. \"I-I don't k-know s-sir!\" I scream in pain. He put more pressure on my head. \"What was that boy?\" He asked again \"N-no sir!\" I said. He put even more pressure on my head. \"And why couldn't you heal your own elbows boy?\" He said. \"Agh s-sir s-stop!\" I yell. I hear a car door slam. \"What was that boy?\" My father asks putting more pressure on my head. Tears start rolling down my face. \"S-SIR P-PLEASE S-STOP!\" I scream. Then all the pressure from my head gets released. I see the boy from earlier Shawn I think is his name on top of my dad punching him. I pass out and wake up in a hospital with Shawn next to me. \"Ughh w-where a-am I?\" I ask. \"Your in the hospital buddy. How you feeling?\" He asks me. \"M-my head h-hurts a bit.\" I say. <br>\r\n(Shawn pov)<br>\r\nI see his feet sticking out from the blanket. \"Your parents are in jail. I'm...I'm sorry.\" I tell him. \"D-don't b-be t-they're b-bad people.\" Nolan says. I move to the foot of his bed. \"Can I try something?\" I ask. \"Y-you technically s-saved m-my life s-so s-sure.\" He says nervously. I pick up one foot and run my finger up and down it. He squirms and starts gigling. I pick of the paste and he starts laughing. \"Hahaha what haha are you doing haha.\" I use all of my fingers on his foot. \"It called tickling buddy, like it?\" I ask. \"Hahaha a bit haha!\" I then run my tounge up and down the sole of his foot. \"Hahaha!\" He laughed but didn't squirm like he did with Trent. I use my five fingers to tickle his toes while I like the heel of his foot. \"Haha that haha kinda haha feels good haha!\" He says blushing. I start sucking on his toes and he starts laughing a moaning. \"Haha oh haha enough haha!\" He laughs. \"Aww okay.\" The doctor comes in, gives me medicine for Nolan and says he can leave when he's ready. On our to my house I asked him a question. \"Hey um Nolan?\" I ask. \"Y-yes?\" He says. \"Will you um go um out with me?\" I ask blushing madly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're 16 almost 17 and you and your friends Emma and Jason are going to a popular outside place surrounded by stores to sing and play music to whoever would listen. \"Alright No No you know what to do.\" Emma says. \"Don't get nervous Nolan.\" Jason says patting you on the back. \"Alright Dil-Emma, Michale Jason, 3. 2.\" You take in a deep breath. \"1.\" You say and start playing Show You by Shawn Mendes. \"You can't walk the streets at night.\" Emma sings. While you play the gutair you start to blush as people gather around and start recording. When its tine for all three of you to sing you get really nervous but do it. \"I will walk this road ahead.\" You sing with Emma and Jason. \"Hundred miles on my hands.\" Lucky for you thats all you have to do for a bit until your solo. \"Do I really gotta show you now?\" You sing. As soon as you start everybody starts cheering. \"Really, really, really, gotta show you now?\" You sing. When the song is done you feel relived and sit down to catch your breath. People clap and put money in a jar Emma put out before you started. Then a boy about 18 walks up to you. You look down trying not to make eye contact because you're shy. \"You did pretty good.\" He says to you. \"Thank you sir.\" You say blushing. His voice sounds familiar. \"You Shawn Mendes fans? He asks Emma, Jason, and you. \"Y-yes sir.\" Emma says excitedly. \"H-huge.\" Jason replied. \"Extremely.\" You say confused. \"C-can you sign my phone case?\" Emma asks the boy. You wonder why she asks him that. \"Sure thing.\" He says to her. \"Can you sign my microphone?\" Jason asks. You wonder why Jason would want this person to sign his favorite white microphone. \"Here you go.\" He says giving Jason back his microphone. The man kneels down in front of you while you play around with the strings on your gutair. \"I can sign that for you if you want.\" He offers you. You look up and see the person is Shawn Mendes. \"Oh. Yes please. I'm s-sorry I'm being very rude.\" You say standing up and handing him your gutair. He signs it and gives it back to you. \"Do you guys want to be part of my new band? I'm going on tour in a bit but I need a couple more people and you guys seem like the perfect people.\" Shawn offers the three of you. \"Yeah we would!\" Emma almost screams. \"I mean we accept your offer.\" She says politely. \"Great come here real quick.\" He says. \"Here's my phone number.\" He whispers giving all three of you a paper with his number. When you get to Emma's house She and Jason look at you. \"How do you feel No No?\" Emma asks you. \"Like can rule the world.\" You say looking at your signed gutair. \"Imma go home. I don't care what my parents say to me or do to me.\" You say. \"If they beat you again you can always come here.\" Emma says. Your parents hate you but you asked your friends not to tell anybody because you love your little brother more than anything and he cares about your mom and dad. \"Good luck.\" Jason says. \"Thanks.\" As you walk hone you get a text. It is.....</span></div></div>",

You walk into stage while Shawn walks off. \"You'll do great.\" Shawn says to you. When when you to the microphone your heart beats quickly. You can hear the crowd talking about how he shouldn't have invited somebody so young. \"I'm sorry everybody I can't do this.\" You say and walk off stage and walk outside. You sit down on the ground and look at your signed gutair. Shawn comes walking up to you and sits down next to you. \"Look. You're an amazing singer. But if you really can't do it then you dont have too. But I know that the crowd will love you. What do you? Want to try again?\" He asks you. \"I dont know if I can.\" You say. \"I'll make you look bad.\" You say. \"No no no you won't. If I say you're great I'm sure they'll say your great too.\" He says. \"Okay. I'll do it.\" You say.

I showed you to my friends and each time something else came out I showed them. All we ever wanted to do was meet you.\" You say blushing. \"Anybody ever tell you that you kinda look like me?\" Shawn asks you. \"Yes sir. They think I'm your brother.\" Your phone keeps dinging and you see you keep getting more followers for Instagram.

Your having trouble finding your classes so you ask some kids to help you. \"Hey, um I'm excuse me? Do you know where class-\" You begin. \"Sorry I'm going to be late!\" He says. \"Hi, can you he-\" You began to ask a girl. \"I have a boyfriend.\" She answers and ignores you. \"Exuse me-\" You begin to ask a teacher. \"Get to class.\" He says strictly and continues walking down the hall. As kids walk past and into class, the hall becomes emptier. \"Ugh!\" You let out a sigh. The bell rings and everybody rushes to class. \"Exuse me? Can you-\" you began to ask. Everybody ignores you. \"Hello I'm new. Can someone hel-\" You ask the other students rushing by. \"Not now.\" They answer. You see a boy around you age speed walking down the hall. \"Exuse me?\" You call out to him. \"Yeah?\" He stops and walks back to you. \"Um I um I'm new here do you um know where um these classes are?\" You ask and hand him a piece of paper. \"I'm going to be late. But I'm going to feel like a jerk if I just leave you here.\" He says grabing the paper from your shaking hands. \"Oh. It's your lucky day. We have the exact same classes. Come on follow me or we'll be late!\" He says. The two of you speed walk down the halls. \"I'm Shawn. What's your name?\" He asks as you walk down the halls. \"Oh um its Kaden.\" You say. \"I like that name.\" Shawn says. You blush and look down. At lunch the two of you go separate ways. On your way to school you saw a dog that looked hungry so you decided you were going to save the food for the dog. You were walking to a table to wait when somebody tripped you. \"Whoops my bad.\" They said sarcastically. \"What's your problem!\" You tell at the getting up and rubbing your elbow. \"New kids are the problem.\" He says and stands up. He pushed you back onto the ground. \"I don't want any trouble.\" You mumble. \"What I can't hear you from up here.\" He tells you. He then kicked you and dropped a tray of food on you. He crouched down next to you and punched you in the mouth. \"Go on. Go find a table to sit alone at. It better yet just kill yourself.\" He said standing up. \"Hey.\" Some said and tapped the boy on the shoulder. \"What?\" He asked and turned around. You looked up and saw Shawn punch him in the face. \"Here come with me.\" He says and holds out his hand to you. You back up. \"I'm not like them.\" He said. You looked at him then at his hand and back at him then took it. He took you over to the bathroom. He grabbed some napkins and got the wet. He dapped the wet napkins on your bleeding lip. He slid his hand under your shirt and with his other hand tried to clean your shirt. When the back of his hand acidently touched you bare skin you blushed wildly. \"He kicked you here right?\" He asked placing his hand on your ribs. \"Yeah.\" You said blushing. He lifted up your shirt to the top of your ribs. He placed his cold hand on your bare ribs. \"Dose this hurt?\" He asked moving his hand up and down your ribs. You covered your mouth and nodded no. \"Are you sure? Your face is really red.\" He said. You nodded your head yes. \"What's wrong?\" He asked you and continued moving his hand up and down your ribs slowly. \"Tickles.\" You mumble and blush. \"Oh shoot im sorry.\" He said.  \"Want me to stop?\" He asks you. </span></div></div>",

Later when Shawn is driving you to therapy you tell him to stop at a corner. You get out and pull your lunch out from your backpack. You place it on the ground and watch a dog come. You hold it up to the dog and he eats it. \"I'm sorry this happened to you.\" You say to the dog as tears fall from your eyes. You get back into the car and hide you face. \"You didn't eat at lunch?\" He asks you. \"N-no.\" You answer. He walks you into therapy and waits in a waiting room. You come out and leave with Shawn. \"Sorry I wasted your time.\" You tell Shawn when you get into his car. \"No dude you didn't.

You don't know what's going on.\" He yawns again. \"Its Friday you can just back tomorrow.\" You yawn. \"Alright.\" He says and gets up. \"Here.\" You say and hand him 50$. \"No.\" He says. \"Take it.\" You reply. \"I said no. It's your money. Keep it.\" He says. \"You drove me. You showed me to class when nobody else did. You helped me after I got hurt. You got me food I needed but I didn't want.\" You say shoving the money into his hands. He put the money on your desk and ran for the door. You grabbed his leg and you both feel. You took off his shoe and raked your fingers up and down the soles of his feet. He burst out laughing and started squirming. \"No Haha please stop Haha! Haha I'll take it haha okay il take it haha just stop haha!\" He said. You stopped and you both got up. He ran and pinned you to your bed. \"I'm the one who tickles.

We have a community called the sanctuary. That's where we're going.\" Negan explains. \"Any questions?\" He asks the two of you. \"No.\" Troy says. \"Are you talking to me?

You stand next to the door and Troy stands on the opposite of where you are. Negan then steps out. \"Pissing our pants yet? Cause I feel like we're getting close.\" He says.

Troy offers you his hand and you squeeze it tight. You watch as he kills another man. Negan takes the leader into the r.v. and drives off. \"Carter, Troy, you're in charge.\" Negan says.
