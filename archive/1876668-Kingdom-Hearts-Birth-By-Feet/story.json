Then she slipped off her boots and places her feet into Ven's lap. He then playfully tickled her soles which made the blue-haired haired girl giggle like crazy. Suddenly, Aqua lifted her barefeet up to Ven and placed them on his face. Everything went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentus awoke. He had been dreaming the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" he said, \"It was only a dream. Wait! Why on Earth am I having dreams about Aqua's feet? That's weird, isn't it?\" He thought hard about why he dreamt of Aqua's feet. He had always liked her, but never thought of her feet as being attractive. Ven then remembered about something Terra once told him about how he read somewhere that some people would develop a fetish for girls feet at a young age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I starting to get a foot fetish? That's crazy! I-isn't it?...\" he then got out of bed and put on his usual gear, \"Well, I guess there is only one way to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many worlds with many feet in them... Which shall you choose?</span></div></div>",

After all, she has been his friend for years and there was no way something like that would ever happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Roxas!\" he heard a familiar voice call to him. He turned to see Aqua herself waving at him. But now his heart began beating rapidly as the thoughts of his foot fetish dream snapped back into his head. What was he to do? Would he go talk to Aqua about it? Or... would he simply ignore her to try and get rid of these feet feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

Maybe he ignored you because he is going through a lot of things both mentally and physically and being around a girl can make it worse.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\" <br>\r\n\"You know...\" Terra then whispered in Aqua's ear how Ven could be getting a lot of sexual thoughts lately and maybe Ven is uncomfortable with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Terra got a call from Master Eraqus stating he had a mission. He then summoned his Keyblade Armor and flew away, leaving Aqua by herself.<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she murmured. \"Ven doesn't have to ignore me just because he's having strange desires.

I'm flattered you like my feet by the way\" She actually wasn't freaked out?! Ventus was overcome with relief.\" Ven, how about we test out your dream..\" Aqua said.

Well, I guess that's innocent enough.\" Aqua started to slip her shoes and stockings off ever so slowly and sneaked a glance at Ven and smiled. He was staring intently at her feet as Aqua swung them over and raised them up to Ven's face so that her soles were in clear view. Ven just stared for a minute at Aqua's Perfect, smooth toes and soles. He couldn't take it anymore and dug his nose into both her soles, taking big wifs of her sweet scent. \"Aqua... Your feet... smell so good\" he panted between sniffs\" \" Hehehe. Thank you Ven. Wanna keep smelling my feet or do something else?\"</span></div></div>",

First he tickled them, the massaged them, eventually he started to lick them, and just as he had started to suck her toes, Master Eraqus Burst Through Ventus' door!<br>\r\n\"Ventus you better have a good reason for being over an hour late to trai..... WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON HERE! <br>\r\nAt that moment, Aqua showed Ventus the fastest reflexes he had ever seen! Being the excellent magic user she was, she quickly froze her master where he stood and blinded him using various spells. <br>\r\n\"Aqua, I could understand Ventus oversleeping a little but this is madness! Says Eragus<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ventus looked mortified, the speech Eraqus was giving about temptation and opening your hearts to the darkness was completely toned out by his inner thoughts. What now? His secret was out! He would never be a keyblade master! Eraqus would lose all respect for him! His life was over! <br>\r\nSuddenly, he awakens back to reality and Hears aqua yell \"Collapse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up to see Aqua standing by the sleeping frozen Eraqus.<br>\r\n\"Ok look, we have about ten minutes until this guy wakes up I say we move him to his bed, and when he wakes up we need to be out on the field looking confused and ask him where he has been for the last hour and ten minutes. He will think it was all just a dream and nothing ever happened. Either that or my mastery will be revoked and you wont have a shot at ever getting one!\" Said Aqua<br>\r\n\"Ok, but, what about Terra?\"Said Ven<br>\r\n\"Terra is really understanding you know that! plus ill deal with him if he starts giving you and mouth about it!\" Said Aqua<br>\r\n\"Aqua, thanks... for everything\"<br>\r\nEverything? What are you talking about we didn't do anything\" She said sarcastically as she winked at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey move Eraqus to his bed she unfreezes him and they run to the field.<br>\r\nTerra is there waiting on them with his arms crossed and he says \"Decided to take the day off did you?\"<br>\r\nAqua tells him the story while panting, and like a good friend he he just laughs and gives them both potions to stop there heavy breathing.<br>\r\n\"You don't want to be a dead giveaway, Eraqus knows if he was late we wouldn't work so hard we would be out of breath! <br>\r\nEraqus shows up on the field \"Aqua I want to know whats going on and I want to know now!\"<br>\r\nAqua puts on a confused look \"What are you talking about? We've been sitting here all morning waiting for you!\"<br>\r\n\"Dont lie to me young lady or that mastery is as good as lost! Terra wasnt I out hear eariler looking for them!\"<br>\r\nSays Eraqus<br>\r\n\"I didn't see you\" lied Terra<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\nI didn't see you its just been Ventus, Aqua, and I out here all morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...... well I must have had a VERY strange dream then\"<br>\r\nSaid Eraqus<br>\r\nVentus chuckled at this but Eraqus didn't notice<br>\r\n\"Anyway, time to salvage whats left of the day\" Said Eraqus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua knocked on Ventus' door<br>\r\n\"I cant believe that worked!\"<br>\r\nVentus Said as she steps inside<br>\r\nThey laughed and laughed at how dumb Eraqus actually was that day<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing to he might not have respected me after that\" said Ventus<br>\r\n\"Look Ventus... I\"<br>\r\nVentus cuts her off<br>\r\n\"I know I know we shouldn't have done it and it'll never happen again I get it\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's not exactly where I was going.\" Said Aqua<br>\r\nVentus looked confused<br>\r\n\"Well it's not weird that your attracted to feet, a lot of guys are, I actually think Terra is as well, he would never admit it, but that's beside the point. The problem is there as some guys who are ONLY attracted to a womens' feet and the rest of the body that attracts most people don't do it for them. I don't want that to be you Ven. If you indulge in girls feet and only that now you might not enjoy the rest of her later on in life. So tonight ill do whatever you want that doesn't involve feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVentus' jaw dropped to the floor<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared, here put this in your pocket for later I don't tiny Vaqua running around in about night months We might not need it but who knows..\" She pulls a small square object with a circle in the middle out of her pocket and tells Ventus to meet her at the observatoy where they watch the meteor showers with that object later that night. She really stresses the importance of that thing and tells him if he doesn't have it wont happen! During the rest of that day Ventus...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Part of him wanted to lie and make up some excuse to her. However, Aqua was his friend and he just couldn't leave her in the dark about it. Maybe he should talk to her and perhaps she would be understanding. With that, he hesitantly opened the door. <br>\r\n\"May I come in?\" Aqua asked. <br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" replied a nervous Ven. Aqua entered his room and sat down on his bed. She looked down as if something was bothering her. <i>Oh no</i>, thought Ven, <i>I made her feel bad from before</i>. He had to fix it quick. \"Aqua, I'm sorry about earlier. It's just that...\"<br>\r\n\"I know what you are going through, Ven,\" said Aqua, cutting him off. <br>\r\n\"Y-you do?\" he asked. Did she know about his foot fetish?<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"You don't have to worry about it. It's perfectly natural.\"<br>\r\n\"It is?!\" Ven was a bit confused upon hearing that. <br>\r\n\"Of course it is. At your age, it's normal to be feeling the type of attraction you are having,\" she blushed upon saying that. Ven blushed too and looked down at her heavily booted feet. <br>\r\n<i>Does this mean she is cool with foot fetish?</i> he thought, smiling with joy. <br>\r\n\"That's why I am here,\" Aqua continued. \"I am here... to help you with this attraction.\"<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Ven became extremely happy and sat next to her on the bed. \"Oh my, Aqua. You are a true friend to be doing this for me!\" He then began thinking what would he do first to Aqua's feet. Should he rub them? Tickle them? Smell them? Lick them? Suck them? Or even... receive a footjob?! His heart began pounding with anticipation. <br>\r\n\"Well, it's the least I can do for a friend who is going through puberty,\" she stated. <br>\r\n\"Oh, well I... wait... Puberty?\" Ven was caught off guard. Was THIS what Aqua was thinking was going on with him?<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she replied. \"But don't worry, it's normal to be thinking of things you are thinking of. Even if they are of me,\" she blushed upon saying that. \"So there is no reason for you to be shy around me, ever.\"<br>\r\nVen rubbed his neck, embarrassed a bit. \"Look Aqua, I appreciate it but I think you have the wrong idea-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be soo modest,\" said Aqua, leaning closer. \"I'm here to help you get all these feelings out of the way.\" She then looked at Ven and Ven looked back. Suddenly, she then lowered herself to the floor in front of Ven and started unbuckling his belt. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Aqua!\" he yelped. \"W-what are you doing?!\" <br>\r\n\"Relax Ven. I'm trying to help you relax,\" she said as she unbuttoned his pants and then unzipped them. Ven watched with great anxiety and anticipation; He could not believe his friend was doing this. Seconds later, Aqua took hold of his underwear and lowered them to reveal his now erect penis, which sprung up upon release. Aqua was shocked. \"Oh my, Ven! You really aren't a kid anymore are you?\" Ven looked a way, still embarrassed and nervous. Aqua saw this and said in a comforting voice, \"Don't worry Ven. I'll take care of you.\" With that, she reached up and wrapped her hand around his penis. <br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Ven twitched and looked back at her, \"Aqua?\" <br>\r\n\"It's okay, Ven,\" she said. \"Trust me.\" She then began moving her hand up and down on Ven's penis, giving him his first handjob. Ven wanted to stop her, but upon feeling the pleasure from her hand, he froze and within seconds began to sigh in ecstasy. </span></div></div>",

She then smiled and playfully pushed him back on the bed so he could lay down.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ven laughed as he fell backwards. \"What are you... ah!\" He gasped at the feeling of Aqua kissing his stomach. <br>\r\n\"Just relax Ventus,\" Aqua said in a calming voice. \"I'll take care of you.\" The blue haired girl smiled and started kissing down Ven's stomach. She then took hold of his penis once again, lifted it back up and started kissing it. Ven was stunned as he felt her lips making contact with his erection and gasped with each wet kiss. However, it wasn't long before he felt Aqua's lips wrap around the tip of his penis and start to engulf it into her mouth. He couldn't believe it... She was actually sucking his dick! He sighed and moaned as he felt Aqua's mouth moving up and down on him. He could even feel her tongue licking the underside and even swirling around the tip like it was a sea-salt lollipop. He couldn't help but raise his head and stare at his friend delicately giving him head.<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, Aqua,\" Ven moaned with great pleasure.<br>\r\n\"I take it it feels good?\" Aqua laughed, playfully licking up and down the underside of his penis. <br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" he uttered, distracted by how good it was feeling. \"Please don't stop...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't plan to,\" replied Aqua. With that, she began sucking on Ven's penis more quickly, bobbing her head up and down. Ven moaned loudly, not believing what he was seeing and feeling!</span></div></div>",

The feeling of her tongue gliding up and down on his shaft as she quicked her pace with her lips wrapped around it felt orgasmic (funny because that's exactly what Ven was thinking as well). He twitched and gripped his bedsheets in ultimate pleasure. <br>\r\n\"Ahhh... Aqua...... please don't stop...\" he moaned, eyes rolling to the back of his head. <br>\r\n\"I take it you like my blowjob?\" Aqua asked, giggling at his reaction. She then playfully flickered her tongue on the tip, teasing him. <br>\r\n\"Yes!\" he replied. \"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad,\" Aqua smiled right before she then engulfed his cock once again and started deepthroating it, making Ven gasp loudly! His body began to spasm a bit and he bit his lip, feeling a great tingling begin to rise from his loins. <br>\r\n\"Ahhh... Aqua... if you keep that up... I'll...\" he stuttered, trying to get his words out. <br>\r\n\"Cum?\" Aqua looked at him. She then bit her lip and blushed. \"It's ok, Ven. I want you to. Don't be afraid.\" She then grabbed his cock with her right hand and began stroking it as fast as she could. <br>\r\n\"Mmmmm... Oh my gosh...\" Ven shivered, feeling an orgasm begin to occur. <br>\r\n\"Go on, Ven,\" Aqua whispered, almost seductively. She stared into his eyes while she jerked him off faster and faster. \"Do it! Cum for me! It's alright! I want you to cum! Cum for me, Ven! Cum!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm cumming!\" Ven yelled as he felt it rise up to his dick. With that, Aqua suddenly lowered her mouth to his penis and allowed it to shoot every drop of cum inside. When Ven saw this, he slammed his head back down to the bed and moaned as loudly as he could, feeling so much pleasure that he just couldn't bear it. After a few more seconds, he was done and he just laid there, panting, as Aqua removed her face from his dick and swallowed. <br>\r\n\"Mmmm....\" Aqua smiled at her young friend. \"Feel better?\"<br>\r\nVentus looked at her, bewildered at what had just occurred. He knew things would never be the same between them, but he didn't care at all. \"Yeah... I would think so,\" he gave her back a goofy, bashful smile. <br>\r\n\"Heehee, I'm glad,\" she said as she gave the tip of his cock a little kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
