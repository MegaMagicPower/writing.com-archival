            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The king\u2019s guards walked up the cleared way through the streets. The large red muscled dragons were dressed in silver armor with only leg guards covering their feet. Although it may seem like they were simply walking, one guard had his hand out with his palm facing up. In the center of his palm layed a small box with a small opening and a thin layers of curtains covering the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one looked closely they would see a tiny head peeking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human that sat inside the rather comfy box was named Colt, a fifteen year old who\u2019s life has changed significantly over the last month. Months prior, there had been a Scuffle between neighboring kingdoms. The human villages had been given a short notice to evacuate. However Colt\u2019s village had not received the message, and so a battle occurred outside the kingdom. Although The Dravol forces attempted to stay away from the villages, the fight was pushed to their location. Opposing forces marched through the Colt\u2019s village, stomping on houses. Including The one with Colt\u2019s parents inside. In the end the Dravol Kingdom won but at the cost of human lives. The messenger had been punished for not informing everyone and aid was given to the villages. Still, Colt was Orphaned and had no family left. However, while recovering dragon guards approached  Colt with a message. The king Drogan has been filled with guilt in not ensuring everyone was safe and apologized to Colt. But also he offered to become family to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so now Colt was being taken to the palace to become the second son of Drogon. He was very nervous as he had only seen paintings and heard reports of the king. Although he tried to suppress it, he couldn\u2019t  help but wonder if Drogan was sincere with his offer. He soon felt the movements of the guard holding him cease, he heard two clings against the outside of his box. Opening the curtains he was greeted by the face of a guard.\u201d We\u2019ve arrived at the palace, young prince\u201d, the guard said smiling at the last part causing Colt to blush, not being used to such a title.\u201d I would suggest you sit on Pol\u2019s palm the rest of the way\u201d. Nodding Colt climbed out of the box and on to Pol\u2019s soft palm. The dragon holding him lifted the box and pocketed it before giving Colt a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the palace, passing portraits of past rulers before coming to a pair of doors that kept the king waiting. The guards glanced at Colt, and Pol curled his fingers a bit to reassure him before opening the doors. On a red carpet that stretched forward laid a throne with a large figure sitting upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon was slightly bigger then the guards and was dressed in silk gold pants and beneath his large feet were a pair of bejeweled sandals. He was shirtless which put his scaled eight pack as well as two large pecs on display. Looking at the throne seat, one could see his large buttocks pushing the cushion down. His large biceps had leather straps wrapped beneath his shoulders. A long red cape draped off his shoulders and to the side, and on his left index finger laid one gold ring.The guards approached the king, bowing their heads as soon as they were in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColt\u2019s gaze met that of Drogan\u2019s, in the dragon\u2019s eyes Colt saw wisdom, strength, and kindness. All his worries began to melt away as the king smiled and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve returned with my child\u201d, Drogan\u2019s voice was deep and soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes your majesty\u201d, Pol replied as he brought the hand holding Colt closer to Drogan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrogan brought his hand forward and layed his fingers on top of Pol\u2019s, creating a makeshift bridge. Colt glanced up at Pol, who smiled and nodded. Standing up, Colt made his way over, as the ground went from red to purple Colt wished he was barefoot, so he could feel the soft warmth. Arriving and stopping in the center of Drogan\u2019s palm, he was brought up to the front of the king\u2019s snout watching his orange eyes gain a sorrowful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColt, I\u2019ve said this in my message and I wish to say it to you in person. I\u2019m terribly sorry for what has happened to you. I entrusted a messenger to give word when I should have informed everyone myself! I ask not for forgiveness, but for a chance to care for you and to be your family now.\u201d, Drogan finished placing a hand over his strong chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColt began to process everything in his head. The king wanted him to be his child and care for him. He began to shed tears as he looked into Drog- his father\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes! I\u2019d love for you to be my dad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as those words left Colt\u2019s mouth, Drogan smiled and laughed bringing his new son to his right pectoral gently in a hug. The purple scales covering Drogan\u2019s body were soft to the touch and Colt felt safe listening to the king\u2019s mighty heartbeat. After the tender moment, Drogan placed his son on his large shoulder, purring as Colt nuzzled into his neck. Standing up, Colt caught a glimpse of his father\u2019s large rear along with the deep imprint in the cushion but looked forward again as Drogan stepped down from his throne and faced his knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be going now. Colt and I will be on our way to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sat in your room, focused on the tv in front of you as you were coming to the end of a match in the new fighting game your friend Isaac had brought over. He sat next to you on the futon and next to him was Matt, who was waiting his turn. Behind the couch a ways was your bed where Travis lay, doing homework that wasn't due until two days after the weekend was over. Your \"room\" was actually the size of a small apartment as it was actually the top drawer of your dad's nightstand, he had modified it so you would be near him in case you needed something and he could reach you. Drilled in the back of the drawer was a hole that stepped out onto a plywood walkway that ran along the walls of the house so you could get anywhere without having to risk being stepped on by your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was the first time you'd ever had your friends over to your place, as their parents had never been to excited to let them leave the human block and go into dragon territory, especially with the recent disappearances. You had managed to convince them to let your friends come over by saying you'd lived with dragons since you were a toddler and you were still alive and thriving. Your father was indifferent about them being over as long they stayed to the walkways and out of his business. You thought that would be easy but your friends had an abnormal reverence towards your dad, and they wanted to meet him and see him up close. You didn't understand what the big deal was but apparently other humans rarely saw more than a passing dragon and dragons paid humans no attention really. When kids found out you lived with a dragon you became pretty popular, saying things like \"That kids dad is a god\" and such. You rolled your eyes at the thought, Ashfall wasn't a god, he drank, told dad jokes, and farted as you watched TV with him. He was no god, just dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a creak outside the nightstand and suddenly your friend's sprung up from their respective spots and ran to your tinted window built into the front of the drawer. You grunted, aggravated they ran off mid game and followed behind them just as Matt exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn Will he's enormous! How do you not think it's amazing and totally awesome to live with something like that!\" Matt said, pressing his face to the glass. You narrowed you eyes as you could see your dad at his dresser emptying his pockets before taking off his jacket. He then threw off his shirt and that's when you decided he had forgotten you had company over. His back rippled with muscle, his ash gray scaly hide reflecting the ceiling light which also caught the flecks of golden scales scattered around his body, the golden flecks earned him the joke name glitter fall among his friends. His Chest all the way to the tip of his tail was a pale gold color that complimented the gray very well. When he began to unfasten his belt you knew you and the guys were about to get a show so you reached over and dropped the shade inside the glass, cutting everyone's view. Isaac looked at you with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What the hell Will? We wanna see more of him, he's magnificent.\" He said reaching for the blind pull but you swatted his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're 16 Isaac, you got porn if you wanna see something like he was about to show us, but I'm not letting you guys have a peep show on my dad, that's weird.\". You said walking back to the futon, your friends grudgingly following and retaking their positions. They didn't stay silent forever however as they started asking some pretty strange questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen him naked Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a bunch, I share a room with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he hung?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he hu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you. but what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno I figured a guy that big has a big-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude stop he's my dad, I don't like to think about him like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a yes he's hung, he also had a big ass, has he sat on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah as pranks and being unaware and such now can we please drop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Yeah fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then night went on without much more incident but as midnight passed, your friends became restless and you noticed that they kept glancing at the window. Finally Travis asked. \"Is he not coming to bed?\". You sigh loudly. \"I don't know, I'm not his fucking keeper, he probably is asleep on the couch in the living room. If we go peek in on him, will you guys stop riding his dick so hard??\"<br>\r\nYou say glancing between your friends angrily. They don't seem to even notice your agitation as they spring up with excitement like you just offered them a million bucks. You groan as you stand up and grab a flashlight from you desk before leading your friends out of the back hole of the nightstand and up the plywood walkway. The path takes you around the room, over the bathroom door and through a small hole cut in the hall doors frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you walk down the path in the hallway, you can see light emanating from around the corner from the living room TV. The walkway takes you around the corner and right above the couch. You and your friends stare down at the titanic occupant of the sofa. Your father lay there in nothing but a pair of classic white cotton briefs, snoring loudly with a little drool coming from his maw. In the light of the tv, his scales had a milky blue white tint to it, also highlighting the beer cans sprawled around on the floor near him, pieces of popcorn sat on his chest and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Behold, my mighty and godly dad Ashfall, lord of slumber and god of beer.\" You say holding out a hand towards your father, your tone sarcastic. \"Get your fill? Come on let's go back to games.\". You say turning away and beginning the long trek back, you honestly preferred when your dad just carried you between rooms, because the walks were long. When no footsteps followed you turned back to see your friends still staring down at him, their faces of awe and happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yo Will, can we go down to him? I-I mean I really want to touch him, I've never touched a dragon before.\". Matt said biting his lower lip. You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let me go ahead and let you in on the experience, he feels like one giant worn leather coach, and is firm and some places and soft in others. Oh also he's an antique. Can we go now please?\" You say getting frustrated now, were these guys serious? Did they not realize how weird they were?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't know what we are feeling William, you've had a dragons attention and favor all your life, you're desensitized. We've only seen them from afar, never getting close and never getting recognition. We just want to touch him and then call it a night, but- He won't wake up if we do will he?\". Isaac said, making you consider their problem. To answer Isaacs concern you sigh again and notice your dad's phone on the coffee table nearby. You pull out your phone and call him, your ringtone echoing loudly near his head but the Drake doesn't move an inch, he just snores louder. You hang up and say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He isn't gonna stir, let's get this over with\". You say before taking an offshoot of the walkway that leads down to the top of the couch. Once you and the guys reach there you begin climbing down the loose threads of your family's old couch before finally felling your bare foot meeting the soft flesh of your dads stomach. You walk out a bit and stop near his navel and wait for your friends to make it down. Not having the experience of climbing huge furniture as you do it takes them a minute more. As you wait you try to ignore the giant hill that was your dad's bulge not to far off. Finally they get down and freeze when they make contact with your dad's belly all of them glancing at the Drakes head to make sure he doesn't react. You sigh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I told you, he won't wake, below this surface we stand on is a pack of beer, he isn't gonna be up and around til late tomorrow morning.\". You said jumping up and down, ripples traveling through the fat and muscle of Ashfall's belly, making your friends hesitate but finally decide you were right and walked out towards you. When they reach you, they each reach down and touch the leathery surface of your dad's stomach. As they did this you couldn't help but think that if you were in their place they'd think you were a freak, going over to their house and touching their drunk dads stomach as he slept on a couch, only their dad would only be slightly bigger than you, unlike your dad was to them. After a moment of them stroking his scaled flesh, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok anything else you wanna do while down here? Wanna pledge your servitude to his nipples or something? C'mon guys please see how weird this looks to me!\". You said getting tired of this and just wanting them to go home now honestly. Your friends however were now getting a little more comfortable and began jumping around and exploring a little further from you. Matt and Travis began bouncing around like a bunch of preschoolers giggling like your dad's stomach was a trampoline, jumping this way and that. When you tried to get them to come on back with you, you completely lost track of Isaac, and you were too late to find out where he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turned around and gasped before shouting. \"Isaac!!!\" and taking off towards your dad's crotch. Isaac was climbing up Ashfall's bulge and began lifting up the briefs fly front and crawling in, he was almost over the second layer of fabric underneath by the time you climbed up the cotton mound of dragon dong and grabbed his leg firmly. Isaac thrashed back and tried to kick you off, obviously taken by some form of dragon glamour, an effect that dragons had on humans passively but not purposefully that made humans want to worship and serve them, a magic that dated back to the first contact between dragon's and humans millennia ago . He kicked again at you but you held on as...</span></div></div>",

You dodge the kick and grapple his waist, but your forward momentum slides Isaac over the lip of the second fold in the briefs, making both of you tumble into the dark cavern of Ashfall's briefs. You and Isaac make contact with a spongy surface before rolling into a wedge and entering an even darker chamber, Isaac rolls a little ways away from you as you sit up and shake your head. You reach into your pocket and pull out the flashlight you grabbed from your room and shined it around the chamber, quickly deducing your location. You had tumbled underneath your dads dick and were on top of his scrotum, tucked away in a flesh pocket caused by the briefs pressing his cock down onto his balls. You groan loudly before turning the light on Isaac, your 'friend' blinking his eyes from the light, the milky fog behind them fading as he came back to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh? Will where are we? Why is this floor squishy and damp? Did your dad eat us or something?\" He said looking around at the gray, slightly wrinkled floor and walls around you. You clench your fists and grind you teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you dunce, we're under my dads dick on his balls, in his briefs. And he's passed out which means we won't be getting out anytime soon, but when he does find us I'll probably be grounded and you won't be allowed back, though I think that'd be for the best because you fell for his glamour way too easy.\" You say pacing away and settling down against a wall, wrapping your arms around your knees to avoid as little contact with your dads scrotum as possible. Isaac just blinked at you, his body still laying on the ground even though you told him what the ground was. He looked back at you and narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't fall for him, I meant to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull. Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, I wanted to end up between a dick and a balls place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you so much right now, and I have no idea what Matt and Travis are doing, it's all I need is for dad to wake up in a drunken stupor and eat them cuz he think's they're intruders. I can't believe you would do this Isaac, has your goal been to get here the entire time of us being friends since 6th grade, five years of friendship just to get in my dad's pants LITERALLY?\" You say throwing your hands up. Isaac sits there in silence for a moment before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dude I didn't even know your dad was a dragon til 9th grade last year, when he picked you up from my place, and he literally picked you up. I thought that was the coolest thing ever. There's like only one or two others at our school with a dragon as a parent, and that's all they talk about, but you not saying anything impressed me and the guys, and it added mystery to you. It didn't help your dad is hot.\" Isaac had you convinced until the last comment there. You scowled at him and finally submitted to laying down, checking your phone to see it was 2am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna sleep for a bit, and when I wake up you better still be here, if my dad finds you without me, I don't want to know what will happen to you, so it's best you stay with me so he finds you here WITH ME. Don't try to squeeze yourself through the wedges in these walls because I have no idea which way is which, one wrong guess and you'll find yourself sliding down dad's taint and trust me you don't wanna end up in this drakes ass.\" You said before settling down and propping your head up with your jacket. You left the flashlight on and stared at the leathery wrinkles on the 'ceiling' whish was actually the underbelly of Ashfall's cock. You frowned when you remembered that and rolled over, to stop looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't your first time in a situation like this is it?\" You frown and sit up slightly to still see Isaac looking at you, a hand propping up his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I said no I'd be lying, yes I've been in this exact situation before, a couple times actually. It happens more than you'd expect. My dad is oblivious sometimes.\" You say sighing a little, making an observation of how stale the air was in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the longest you've been stuck\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah how'd that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was on top of the nightstand and fell off into his underwear on the floor when his alarm went off, he sleeps nude often. He jumped out of bed and pulled on clothes because he had a presentation at work that day. Halfway through it I got desperate and bit his loose skin and he knew instantly it was me and went to a restroom to extract me. Bad part was he didn't have anywhere to keep me during the presentation so I actually had to go right back in and stay for the day. He treated me to a nice dinner after work and he still jokes about it with me and his friends.\" You say, finding yourself looking at the ceiling again, did that wrinkle look like a giraffe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that's hilarious, now whenever you are absent I'll tell teachers your stuck to your dads balls.\" Isaac laughs. You throw the flashlight at him and he ducks laughing, making it bounce off the wall behind him and hitting him in the back of the head. The impact on the flesh from the light caused the scrotum to twitch a bit, rocking you and Isaac a bit. This was gonna be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Matt, where did Will and Isaac go?\" Travis said looking around from his perch, just now realizing two of their friends were missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno, they went down towards Mr. Ashfall's crotch, you're just now noticing they're gone?\" Matt said not looking at Travis, taking a bite of a chunk of popcorn. the two of them sat on Ashfall's left pectoral watching the giant TV like a movie theater, some late night monster movie was playing. They had dragged a piece of popcorn nearby to their spot and were breaking pieces off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No I'm not, it's just Will seemed ready to go and now he's still not back, do you think they went back to his room?\" Travis replied nervously glancing at the distant cotton mound of the drakes bulge before glancing up the couch to the walkway above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dunno, Will was being a bit of a buzzkill though, his dad is way cooler right now.\" Matt said fist bumping the the giant muscle he sat on, a loud snore responded to the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dude, Mr. Ashfall doesn't even know your name, and if he woke up right now he'd probably kill us, that's not very cool to me.\" Travis said in a hushed tone. \"Let's go look for them.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt rolled his eyes but stood up and went with Travis down Ashfall's stomach and stopped at the waistband of the cotton briefs. Travis glanced around and said, \"This is strange.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I agree, I mean, who wears tighty whities anymore, it's 2058, wear boxer briefs or a more breathable brief style.\" Matt said looking at the waistband and bulge. Travis just turned and glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not that you idiot, I mean how one second they were here and the next they weren't, maybe they did go back to the room. Let's go.\". Travis turned and began climbing the couch, Matt followed, both unaware they were leaving their friends behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few hours pass and you find yourself in a dark, squishy chamber. Oh, right. You rub your eyes and look around, the flashlight must've died while you slept as your only senses giving you information was smell and hearing. Smell telling you all about dad musk, and your ears picking up Isaac snoring somewhere nearby. You pull out your phone and check the time, 9:17am. You turn the phone flashlight on and walk over to Isaac, kicking him in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wake up you moron, it's morning and-\". The walls around you contort slightly and the sound of scaly skin against fabric echos from somewhere below. Isaac scrambles about and looks around wildly. \"He's coming around\". You said, continuing. \"Lemme just send him a text so he can get us, be prepared for either a pissed off drake or a drake that laughs at our plight, it's a 50 50 chance there. but I'll take both options at this point.\". You begin typing a text explaining the situation when....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall squinted, sunlight attacking his eyes and punching the back of them with a vengeance, he pinched the bridge of his snout and grunted, looking around the room groggily. The TV was playing some Syfy shit that wasn't worth a damn, he turned it over to the morning news before stretching and checking his phone. 9:17am. Oh shit William better have gotten too...oh wait it was Saturday. The drake glanced down at himself and chuckled at his sloppiness, looked like he had poured some popcorn on himself at some point. Looking further down his bod, his eyes lingered on his prized junk before looking at his clawed toes, he flexed the digits a few times before shifting his weight to rest on his hefty ass to prepare himself to make some breakfast and coffee. As he sat up a tickle between his dick and balls made him falter but he paid it little mind as he hopped up and walked into the kitchen, his head throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just before you hit send  your world shifted sideways, causing you to yelp in surprise, and Isaac screamed like a girl. You crashed into your friend and found yourself being ping ponged back and forth between the soft surface of your fathers testicles and the firmer surface of his dicks underside. Isaac said something but you couldn't hear anything as you were pummeled by drake meat as your father went about his morning. Finally your dad stopped for a minute as he prepared coffee or something. You and Isaac settled in a wedge formed from the dick and balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Send the bloody message Will, I've learned my fucking lesson this isn't cool anymore.\" Isaac said with a slight sob in his voice. It would've been funny if your situation was as bad as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't Isaac, I dropped my phone and now it is lost to the wrinkles,\" You said in a serious tone, what a strange sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's his number?? I'll call him with mine.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call, it's 893-\" You didn't finish as he began to move again, launching you and Isaac around the cock cage again in a fruitless flight that would end badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall whistled the song tomorrow from little orphan Annie and danced around the kitchen, making french toast as the coffee brewed. He wasn't sure why, but his package was a little more weighted it seemed. He almost dropped the underwear right in the middle of the kitchen when suddenly movement on the walkway that came from the hallway caught his eye. At first he thought it was Will so he continued his strip but when another being caught his eye he stopped and looked up. Two baffled and nervous teenagers that Ashfall didn't recognize stood there watching him. He narrowed his eyes, raking his brain for who they were and why he shouldn't add him to the toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You two....must be Williams friends! Great to finally meet you! I'm his dad! Though you probably guessed that huh?\". Ashfall said putting on a smile to try to make them relax. One of them glanced down a bit and turned red. Ashfall looked down too and realized his thumb was still in his waistband and the base of his dick was visible. He chuckled nervously before sliding the waistband back in place and saying to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heh heh, sorry, I forget humans are a lot more modest than dragons. But you're lucky I at least have underwear on today. Sooooooooooooo do you guys want some french toast?\" He said smiling again at them. They just stared back dumbfounded. Teenagers....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your dads muffled voice echoed above, he was either on the phone or Travis and Matt had walked in on him making food. \"Damn it I'm not out there to shield them from his eccentric personality, this is your fault Isaac.\" You say elbowing your friends butt that was near your face. He replied frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can't help your dad hypnotized me, you should've just let me fall in and then explain to him what happened in the morning, I'm sure we could've sorted this out.\" Damn that was a good point. But still he had to have an solid attraction to Ashfall to begin with to be affected by his glamour. You had heard your dad's friends talking once about Dragon's who had human cults in their houses that essentially did what they were told by their master. Heck, that could be what was causing the disappearances. You wiggled a bit trying to get in a position to get your dad's attention but suddenly movement began again and once more you were thrown about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the two humans being as exciting as wet paint,  Ashfall felt it was his duty to entertain and/or get to know them, for Will's sake at least. He told them to take a seat at a dining table their size that doubled as a dragons salt and pepper shaker. The table was on top of a bar so when Will ate dinner he was near his dad. They made their way there and sat down. They watched him with an unbreaking stare as he danced around the kitchen braking eggs and frying bacon. Maybe he should put on clothes? Nah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Travis watched the Gray dragon move about with an unsettling amount of grace for a being his size. \"Dude, is this tripping you out as much as I am?\" Travis said whispering to Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know right? I'm getting Jack and the Beanstalk flashbacks here. But damn you gotta admit, Mr. Ashfall's ass is thicker than any oatmeal in this kitchen huh? You think I should let him know?\". Matt said, his eyes following the Drakes ass as it moved from station to station, his cheeks swallowing his briefs fabric and causing a deep wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Uh no? Are you serious? That would be the first thing you've ever said to him.\" Travis said scoffing at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon I hear no matter how dull or stupid the compliment, a dragon eats it up. Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait What NO-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr. Ashfall, no disrespect but your ass is thicker than any oatmeal you could serve here.\" Matt said with a smirk on his face. Travis slapped his hands to his face and began saying his final prayer. The dragon tensed and turned his head giving them a sideways glance. The room was dead still for a couple seconds and Travis was sure they were about to be killed. Suddenly the drake broke into an open mouth grin and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please, call me Ash. And thank you, I must say, it's one of my greatest ASSets!\" He said winking and flexing his cheeks causing them to do a wave like motion before bouncing a bit. Matt whistled and Mr. Ashfall went back to cooking. Travis just sat there, shocked that they just gambled their lives and won a dad joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will's right, he's no god, just a dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I smell bacon\". Isaac said his face pressed deep into ball flesh. You take a deep breath and only get the smell of crotch sweat. \"How do you smell anything but musk?\" You say looking in the darkness towards your friends voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno, I have a sixth sense for bacon.\" He said nonchalantly. You were about to say something about that sixth sense being his stupidity but a grating sound filled both of your ears. You didn't have time to react as the wedge beneath the two of you opened up, light and gravity meeting you. Dazed, you and Isaac tumbled down your dad's balls before being caught in another wedge, his nuts and the Cotton briefs supporting them. You unconsciously splayed your hands out to slow your descent and shouted at Isaac to do the same. The briefs pressed you into the flesh slightly, at least you could breath slightly now. Sizzling from a frying pan could be heard behind you through the fabric. Bacon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall rubbed his dick as he cooked, pulling at it through the fabric of his briefs, damn it was tingling today. He thought he felt something slide down his scrotum but before he could lean over and check some grease popped and his his stomach and thigh, causing him to yelp. After he cooked the bacon he cooped it up and brought it over to the bar to let Will's friends have some while he finished the french toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright guys, dig in, and don't leave any behind, that's the first and only rule in this house, never leave bacon behind.\" The drake said as he set the plate down near the dining table. Travis looked up at the plate and smiled, before letting his eyes wander upward and stare at Mr. Ashfall's large bulge, It was pretty defined, his dick was easily recognizable as it drooped down, resting on two large balls with....what are those? Travis squinted at bumps on either side of the drakes dick, slightly smaller than the dickhead, they were shaped eerily like....Travis gasped audibly, causing Matt to jump and Mr. Ashfall to lean back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's the matter kid? Don't like Bacon? If ya don't like it we are gonna have serious problems here. Like, I'm going to put you on my toast problems.\" The Drake said huffing, actually getting agitated at the thought that Travis hated bacon. Travis quickly looked up at the Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Th-that's not it sir, I just remembered I didn't save my rough draft for my project last night.\" Travis said quickly, looking away from the imprints of his friends behind the veil of cotton. The Dragon put his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wish Will had that problem, he never even makes a rough draft for those things, where is he by the way? And I thought there were three of you over last night.\" The dragon said walking back over to check the toaster oven. Travis watched as one of the imprints moved a little, so they were still alive, good, but did Mr. Ashfall know they were there? He did have his thumb in his waistband so maybe he put them there? The toast finished and Ash added the egg glaze to it and walked back over to the bar. He grabbed a stool and sat down in front of the Teens, casting them in his shadow. When he sat down he rocked his hips back and forth to get comfy. The action however....</span></div></div>",

Your feet eventually felt the hard surface of the chair through the cotton which made you panic slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Isaac, I think we may slide under his balls before he gets up, which means two things. We could suffocate and die, or we can be dragged even further and end up in or under his ass which at that point we will wish we had suffocated and died.\" You say towards where you thought Isaac was, the cotton still wrapped around you like a blanket pressing you into the soft flesh. Isaac responded, his voice coming from further down than where you assumed he was. Oh Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umm I'm like up to my chest underneath him, what am I supposed to do?\" He says with slight panic in his voice. You tell him to keep his head turned and try to flip himself onto his stomach whenever pressure is lifted. The briefs may stink of saturated musk but it was better to breath through that than suffocate in the loose skin of the scrotum. You yourself were now up to your waist underneath your dad, subtlety was out the window as you began to hit your dads nuts with as much power you could muster in the tight confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall scooted his butt a bit more and closed his thighs a bit, his balls were really sitting strange, and something was tickling them it seemed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Mr. Ashfall can you pass the syrup?\" Ashfall jumped and looked back down at the two humans on the counter. The one named Matt just asked him for the syrup while the one who called himself Travis was sitting there and not eating a thing, maybe he should add him to his toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure thing kid.\" He said grabbing the syrup container that was the size of a car to the human, he held his plate under a small spigot that was built into the container for human purposes and turned the nozzle, adding more than enough before settling back into his spot. Ashfall scooted the syrup away and went back to eating, eyeing Travis, who would look up, see Ashfall staring at him, and then look away quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So I gotta ask you guys, where is Will right now? Is he still in his room or did he and that other guy go somewhere. To be honest I forgot y'all were here last night. So tell me Travis do you know where they are?\". He said at the puny human while squinting his eyes. He knew something that Ashfall didn't about his son and that wasn't gonna fly. The kid jumped out of his skin and looked like he was about to bolt. Matt just watched his friend sweat while he chewed on some toast indifferently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-Uh He and Isaac went to the um...Ballsfield, I mean er...the ballfield, I think that's what they said they were gonna do in the morning. I haven't seen them since I woke up I don't think.\". Travis said not making eye contact. Ashfall narrowed his eyes, and was about to call him out when Matt beat him to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't remember them saying that, last we saw them was when we were admiring Mr. Ashfall here, you know when we were all standing on his stomach and then turned around and they were gone, and you said we should go look for them in Will's room, wasn't that what happened?\". Matt said leaning back in his chair, looking at his friend with utmost confidence. Travis looked like a dead man walking. Ashfall just looked back and forth between the two of them, not sure where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, let me get this straight here. You just lied to me Travis, and You two were standing on me last night? Why, might I ask?.\". Ashfall said, the only thing stopping him from eating or crushing them was due to the fact that it would be murder and he'd be tried in Human and Dragon court. He stood up to full height, annoyed at these inferior tiny teenagers that he didn't know that had molested him during the night, and that Will was with them while they did it. He was in BIG trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok Ok Ok! Yes we were on your body while you slept Mr. Ashfall, but you have to understand we had never seen a dragon up close before, I think we fell for your glamour a bit and strong armed Will into taking us to you, don't blame him for it.\" Travis said shrinking down into his chair, Matt barely reacted he just kept eating. Ashfall let out a deep sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So tell me, how pushy was this Isaac character, hmm?\" He said leaning over the counter a bit to put a bit more fear into them, Matt seemed to just now become aware they may be in trouble, as he put down his food and held still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He was the pushiest, he seemed entranced when he looked at you.\" Travis said holding his eyes shut. Ashfall felt another bout of tickling on the underside of his scrotum and he got the answer of where Will and this Isaac fellow was. He hooked a thumb under his waistband and pulled it way out, and lo and behold he saw two human heads sticking out from underneath his balls. They gasped at the fresh air as it circulated through the now open pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well well well looks like I got me some stowaways on board, tell me kids what was your destination?\" The dragon said with an Ice cold stare that locked onto his diminutive son's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umph- Dad we need help, I can't play a game with you right now, please just get us out, please!\". You said up to your father turned god Ashfall, now realizing how much you were at his mercy. He smiled slightly and you thought he was gonna help you when.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>SNAP</i> </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Motherfucker!\" You scream as your dad let's his waistband go, keeping you trapped inside his briefs. Before you could curse him again a force came up under you and grinded you into his scrotum encasing you in his soft flesh and causing his sweat to really condense on you now. You gag as all your senses are overwhelmed by nothing but your dad. After a moment he stopped the assault of what you assumed was his hand and let you drop back into the hammock of his briefs, somewhere nearby Isaac sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha-what the fuck? I thought he would help us! What is he doing?\" Isaac coughed and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Disciplining us, either to try to make us not do this again, or just to amuse himself at our expense, either way we are fucked man, he's gonna do this all day. Dragons have nothing but time!\". You yell, punching at the mammoth balls above you to show your meager revolt against your father, earning just a chuckle in response.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall dropped his hand from the underside of his bulge and looked at the horrified teens on his counter. \"Now I know we just met, but I gotta discipline you guys as well. Now, I recall you saying I'm thicker than oatmeal, is that right Matt? Would you like a private tour?\". He outstretched a hand toward the teens who immediately bolted, running in opposite directions. Smart move but running from a predator just excites them more. Matt took the walkway while Travis leaped down to the barstool and slid down its legs to the floor. Ashfall shook his head at their pointless flight. Will had tried every tactic possible to avoid Ashfall during the hide and seek days but he always still found him. He stepped over Travis, letting the teen crash into his heel, before turning around and placing his sole on top of the human and  pressing gently down, just to frighten him but not hurt him. Soon the only thing visible of Travis was his head sticking out between Ashfalls big toe and index toe. He grabbed his phone and snapped a picture of the sorry sight before grabbing the teen between his fingers and lifting him up and sliding him into his waistband slightly behind his hip. Next he eyed the small figure of Matt rounding the wall of the kitchen and into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt started panting as he rounded the corner and began running down the walkway in the hall, the last sight he saw was Mr. Ashfall stepping on Travis. Was Travis dead? Was he next? He didn't want to find out either question. He made it into the bedroom of Ashfall and quickly looked for a place to hide, as Will's bedroom would be too predictable. He noticed a string ladder that led to a tooth pick bridge that went onto Ashfalls dresser, maybe he could make his way into one of the drawers? He quickly made his way onto the dresser and slid into the first slightly opened drawer just as Ashfall stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall knew instantly where Matt was, as he saw him slide into his underwear drawer as he entered the room, but he decided to build suspense.<br>\r\n\"Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of a perverted horny teenager.\" He said trying his best not to smile. He put a thumb on Travis's head and pushed him down into his briefs against the side of his ass cheek, His son and his annoying friend still thrashed underneath his balls. He stomped around the room for a minute or two before getting bored and walking over and nonchalantly plucking Matt out of his gym jockstrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H-How'd you know???\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I've lived for 3200 years, call it intuition.\" Ashfall said as he collected his bounties from their places on him and laughed down at them in his palm. \"You all committed perversions against my person and now must be dealt with adequately!\". Ashfall said in a evil villain style voice before raising his hand above his head and opening his mouth wide, exposing his fangs and large tongue as well as his gaping throat. He began tilting his palm towards his open mouth causing you and your friends to panic and scramble for anything to hold onto, but you just sat there with your arms crossed as you slid down your father's palm. He'd been pulling the \"I will eat you\" bit since as long as you can remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall narrowed his eyes at the sight of his son going through this unfazed. Perhaps it was time to step up the discipline game... As the teens slid off his palm Ashfall closed his jaws around them and rolled them around on his tongue, deciding to go further with it by....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The large tongue of your father rolls you and your screaming friends around his mouth, wrapping around you and pressing you into the roof of his palette. Drool coated you but you bared through it, knowing any second he would spit you into his hand and tell you your grounded for a month or something and that you can't have friends over again. When his tongue arched and tossed you to the back of his throat, where the muscles grabbed you and the others and pulled you down was when you began to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"DAD, DAD NO-\". You shout before being engulfed in his throat muscles and pulled down to the depths of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall felt the lump of his son and his friends go down his throat with his fingers before it disappeared into his chest. Fascinating, when he got him out he'd have to ask Will all about spelunking in dads guts. The large drake adjusted his briefs waistband before walking back to the living room to watch the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You screamed as the muscular walls finally gave way to steamy air as you fell for a second or two before ending up in a disgusting mushy soup. Your friends fell into the chamber one after another, coughing and cursing as they stood up covered in the stuff. The smell made you gag and bile formed in your mouth as in the dim light you could make out what was the remains of french toast, popcorn, and beer surrounding you in the soupy substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will, I'm not gonna lie , but I'm now glad my dad isn't a dragon, he can't eat me.\" Isaac said slowly standing up. \"So you're the expert on this stuff, what happens next.\" he said wretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I- I don't know, he never eaten me before!\" You say, beginning to have a small panic attack when you realize you have been eaten. Your friends look at you in horror at the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Does that mean we're gonna die here? Just a snack for a big lizard?? I didn't do anything to deserve this!\" Travis said trudging over through the slop. You look around for any indication, any sign ttat you'll be out of here soon, but when all you get is a growl from the walls, you resign yourself and plop down into the soup, awaiting your dad to get you out, or for his next bowel movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfalls stomach growls as he walks into the living room carrying the rest of his breakfast that he didn't get to finish earlier. He sat his large rear down on the couch and set the plate on the coffee table. He sat and thought for a second before placing a hand to his belly and rubbing slightly. He decided he would finish this newscast before getting the boy's out of him. Until then he wasn't going to waste more bacon only to puke it up later. Ashfall slid into a slouched position as he watched the news cover more on human disappearances and something about humans wanting more facilities within dragon districts. \"Good way to get stepped on runts.\" Ashfall said to the TV. Humans made a lot of demands it seemed, and while most dragons were indifferent about the smaller species that shared the planet with them, some saw them as beneath them and that they should be thankful dragons had tolerated them for so long. After all, humans were always a step behind in technology, and two steps behind in culture, as Dragons were deeply integrated into theirs but the same couldn't be said vice versa. Ashfall personally only cared about Will, and he doubted he'd shed a tear if he accidentally digested Will's friends. But for his son's sake he'd get them out too. The news ended as he pondered this and decided they probably learned their lesson as he got up and went to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The heat was unbearable inside your dad's stomach, and everyone was obviously getting exhausted from it. \"Will, are we gonna become a dragon dump?\". Matt asked, laying in a large piece of mush that used to be toast. You just shook your head and listened to the chorus of your fathers insides around you. The sounds were way louder on the inside. Gurgles and groans could nearly deafen you. A squelching sound that you hadn't heard yet made you sit up and look up. The walls around you began to contort and scrunch up, and before you could say anything you were shot up your fathers throat and fell into frigid cold water, you swam to the surface and gasped for breath, nearby you could hear your friends doing the same. You rubbed your eyes as a shadow faded slightly from you, and you looked up to see your dad had regurgitated you into his toilet. Standing above you was your father getting to his feet and looking down at you way below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look at you turds bobbing around in the place I should make you call home.\" He said placing is hands on his hips, you decided it was best to keep your mouth shut. After letting you swim there for a couple more moments, your father turned around and for a quick moment you thought he was gonna pull down his briefs and take a dump but he just maneuvered his tail so the tip it was hanging right above the waters surface. You swam over and gripped it before he whisked you out and lowered his tail into the sink and letting you drop into it. He repeated the process three times more to retrieve your friends, before turning the sink on to a drizzle, acting as a shower for you and the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Clothes.\" Your dad said, lowering one large digit down between you and the others. You all look down at your damp clothing and notice its riddled with holes, you hadn't even been aware digestion had been setting in on you all. Shamefully you and the other guys took off your clothes and stood there awkwardly, not making eye contact with each other or Ashfall. You placed the clothes on his fingertip and he tossed them in the toilet before flushing it. You couldn't help but notice you and the others had red blotches around your softer regions, indicating the acid in your father's stomach tried to break you down. Scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Clean yourselves up and let me know when you're done. Your dad said, leaning up against the opposite wall. \"Dad, me and Isaacs phone are somewhere on your scrotum, can you get them?\" You ask meekly. Your dad stared at you with a flat lined mouth before sighing and dropping his underwear to the floor. You couldn't help look at his large junk sway side to side as he stepped out of the briefs, Isaac and Travis were watching too. While you cleaned yourselves up, your dad held his balls and ran a claw through their folds, eventually tracking down both black specks that were the phones. He walked out of the room for a second, probably putting them down on the night stand, before walking back in and reclaiming his spot on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, dad, you gonna put on clothes?\". You ask turning to him again. He met your eyes with a don't push any further look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, who said your ordeals are over?\" He said with a scowl. You swallowed and you heard someone let out a sob. He was definitely enjoying this secretly, more so with your friends than you, but he always liked making you uncomfortable. Dads. After finishing your wash you and your friends were scooped up and carried to....</span></div></div>",

The large drake reclaimed his spot on the couch, rotating his palm and letting you and the others tumble and fall to the cushion between his thighs. You all got to your knees only to realize your father's massive testicles and flaccid cock was mere feet from you. Matt had even rolled against the right ball while Isaac was next to his cock head. You were all cast in shadow as Ashfall picked up a plate of food that had been sitting on the coffee table and set it on his lap above his junk and You, blocking your view of your dads upper body and leaving you alone with his massive crotch. After a second he spoke overhead, sounding like distant thunder, like a god's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well what are you guys waiting for? Play around! Why aren't you  checking me out now since I'm awake huh?\" He said above, the clattering of silverware on ceramic beginning as he finally was eating his breakfast. Your stomach growled at the thought of food and you realized you hadn't eaten since dinner last night. Your friends crawled towards you, obviously no longer finding the notion of touching dragons pleasant anymore. Matt was the last one to move, however as soon as he stopped making contact with Ashfalls scrotum your father spoke up again with a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where you going? I insist boy's! I thought you liked my Drakeliness? Here let me help you out there.\". Before your friends got as far along as you, your dad sat up and shifted, creating a steep incline towards his body that you and your friend's began to tumble down. Your vision became a blur as you tumbled but as you rolled the area became lighter suddenly and the incline disappeared before a loud muffled slam could be heard. You were thrown into the air before crashing into the soft flesh of your dads dick before rolling down it and resting against his head. You sat up dazed as a shifting sound could be heard and your dads thighs were moving slightly, indicating he was rubbing his butt back and forth as if to get comfy. You looked around you, dizziness subsiding before the dread and horror dawned on you, where were the others??? Your dad spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now who's that little rascal that isn't enjoying me right now?\". You look up at the bottom of the plate overhead and yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's me dad!\". A surprised grunt could be heard and a second later your father's fingers came under the plate and gently grabbed you before rolling you into his palm and bringing you into the light and up to his face. A huge smile was placed on it and he spoke with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Man now isn't this great Will, talk about a bonding and learning experience!\". He said sifting his expression to a smug look. You look at him in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dad! What did you do with my friends! This isn't funny, You could hurt or kill them! You say, panicked. Your dad furrows his brow before shifting back and forth again slightly, before smiling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm one's definitely under my balls, ones pressed against my ass cheek, and...\". He made another face before laughing out loud. \"The last one is definitely up my crack!\". He said before coming back to you. You look at him in horror, you had never seen such a heartless side of him. Then again, you had never really seen him interact with humans for long periods of time either. The only one's being your doctors and such that came over to the house since Ashfall couldn't exactly fit in their facilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dad get them out this instant, please! Just send them home and ground me!\". You said with humility. Ashfall just stared down at his small nude son with a blank expression before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But what do they learn from that hmm? Nothing! I alone have the capability to dish out a punishment that will make sure nothing like this happens again. They strong armed you into doing something you knew would end poorly, they molested me and lied to me. And still you want to defend them? Would they do the same for you? Tell you what, I won't move until the end of this showing of two and a half drakes.\" he said gesturing towards the TV. \"You have that long to recover all your friends from their respective places. Fail to do so and you are all to be servants to me for the rest of the weekend. This will also be my last show of direct favoritism towards you Will, since you are keen on taking their side, so I won't treat you any different from them until the end of the weekend, after the weekend ends you'll be grounded for two months and they aren't welcome here again. If I do see them here I will treat it as a trespass and kill them.\" Ashfall said this all while you stood there pale faced. He wouldn't do all that....would he? You maintain your composure and look defiantly into your godly fathers eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Deal. And If I succeed they get to go home and I'll still accept the grounding.\". You said holding out a hand. Your dad stares at you slightly concerned but he smiles broadly, a touch of pride in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Spoken like a Dragon, maybe I have done something right by you. Now off you go son, your timer is running down.\". He said shaking your hand with a claw tip before placing you back underneath the dinner plate and against his dick. As your hands pressed into the flesh to catch yourself, you noticed it was firmer than before. The bastard was getting turned on by the idea of him winning this bet. You gave the head of the cock a solid punch, earning a chuckle from above, before you slipped around it and wiggled up under the giant balls of your father. You slid slowly underneath the clammy skin and shredded cushion as you felt around blindly for whoever was stuck underneath the scrotum. You called out, your only usable senses being touch and hearing, though barely. After a few minutes of sliding around under your dads babymakers a muffled cry could be heard off to your left. You quickly slid over to the sound and grasped a flailing hand, pulling it towards you and dodging the rabid movements of who you determined was Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Travis! Travis calm down its OK, I'm here.\" You say, trying to keep the loose flesh surrounding you from going into your mouth. You couldn't see him, but you knew Travis was an emotional mess right now, he spoke incoherently as he latched onto you and didn't let go, not even when you reemerged into the air underneath the plate between your fathers thighs. As you pulled Travis out you looked up to notice your dad was at full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh dad gross!\". You shouted. Ashfall flexed his erection, causing it to move upward and bump into the plate, lifting it up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? I can't help you felt amazing squirming underneath me like that. Two more to go son, you're lucky this channel has a TON of commercials.\" Your dad says as he takes a bite out of what sounds like bacon. You turn to slide back underneath the balls to reach your fathers taint but Travis grabs your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-Will don't leave me alone out here with him please!\" Travis said quietly, a sobbing mess. You push him away with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a hold on yourself man, I promise he won't touch you, but if you keep holding me up he's gonna have the rest of the weekend to do whatever he want's to us. So I suggest you wait here.\" You say before diving back underneath your dads balls, Travis beginning to freak out again at the thought you just gave him. You tried to stay straight as best you could and eventually the surface above you became more taut but still soft, indicating you had reached his taint. In the dim light a crevice began to form above before turning into a ravine overhead, signalling you were now under his ass crack, that and it also started smelling a little rank. You thought for a second and then cursed your dad again. he had said someone was under his ass cheek, but didn't indicate which cheek. It didn't help your dads ass was enormous. it had taken you a few minutes to find Travis, and Ashfalls ass covered a much greater area than his balls did. You stopped thinking and just dove off to the right, pressure increasing the further you got from his crack as his weight bore down from above. If this was a leather couch this wouldn't have been possible as everyone would have suffocated by now. The worn fabric of the couch however let oxygen seep through the cushion. You called out for Matt and Isaac, and after another five minutes with no results you began to panic a bit. You navigated back to your dads crack and slid past it as you entered the space underneath his left cheek. Just before a minute passed under the left cheek you got a response and crawled towards the voice of Isaac. You clasped his hand, and drug him back to the pocket underneath your dads crack. As you crawled back towards Ashfalls nuts with Isaac close behind your friend spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not gonna lie Will, I'm scared shitless but I also have the strangest boner right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shut the fuck up Isaac\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another minute passes and you emerge to the sight of Travis rocking himself back and forth, and your dad still hard as a rock. Isaac stares at the monolithic erection and begins to play with his own. You give him a look of disgust before diving back underneath for a final time to recover Matt. Your dad said he was in his crack but you doubted he was very deep as your dad only had sat on him, and hadn't been clenching to pull him deeper. You reached the pocket under his crack again and took a deep breath. You stood up and pushed the flabby leathery skin to the sides as you literally crawled up your dads ass. The skin was damp with sweat and musky, assaulting your nose and taste buds as you crawled around, trying not to go too much deeper but rather staying in the shallower depths, someone moving ahead could be heard and you reached out a hand to grab Matt's unseen ankle when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall held still in suspense while holding a piece of french toast an inch form his mouth, not at the show itself but the fact that the beginning of it's outro was beginning to play. At the same time,  two separate tinglings reached him from inside his cheeks as they became extremely close to one another. Right before they met however the first of the credits began to roll and Ashfall threw his hands up in the air hollering a victory cry.  He clenched his cheeks, freezing his son's progress and sending the message loud and clear with that one move. The other runt began to thrash at the pressure applied to him but Will held still, a sign of submission. It tugged Ashfall's heartstrings but he had to press forward to teach him a lesson. The movement and outcry caused the freed runts near his junk to bolt out from under the plate and look up in fear. Ashfall leaned forward and gave them a sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I win, you lose, bugs. Though you should still be thankful that you have a friend like Will, he could've escaped the fate that is about to fall on you but he decided to stick with you to the end. How he ended up choosing wimps like you as 'friends' is beyond me.\". He said sliding back up to full height and taking the plate out of his lap. Once he did that he stood up slowly and removed his son and the annoying friend from his globular cheeks. He placed them down on the coffee table and grabbed the ones still on the couch and did the same. After he had all their attention (Hard to lose it now), he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now that a brief show of dominance has been displayed, let me set the ground rules boy's. Will failed which means I won. This means you are now set to serve me until sunday evening, which is roughly thirty hours from now. You are to do what I say, when I say, and how I say. Failure to meet any of these fields will be met with punishment. Clear?\". The large dragon said looking over the group. They all stared at him dumbfounded like it wasn't pretty clear what was going on. Suddenly one them spoke up, Isaac, if the Drake remembered his useless name correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um no not clear, this is insane you can't to do this stuff to us it-\". He was cut off when Ashfall quickly plucked him up not-to-gently and promptly lifting up off the couch slightly and shoving the runt deep into his ass all the way against his tail hole. The human thrashed wildly against it as Ashfall retook his spot on the couch, the tip of his tail curling at the sensation that assaulted his asshole. He let out a content sigh and his crotch began to stir once again. He looked back down at Will and co. to be met with looks of terror, even from Will. To add insult, Ashfall let out an audible fart against the tiny human, who began to thrash even more at the assault only to get what felt like his leg stuck in Ashfall's anus. The drake clenched a few times and pulled the human up to his chest into his asshole and left him at that, feeling the runt claw at his leathery ring in attempt to pull himself out. Ashfall's expressions must of given the others an idea of what was happening to their friend. The pathetic one started to cry again and the dumb one just stared in disbelief, Will just kept his head bowed, taking full responsibility of the current situation. Ashfall grabbed them and reclined on the couch, taking up a position similar to how he woke up. Isaac thrashed more, his upper body being smothered by dragon cheek. He deposited the one's in his hand as he continued to watch TV, as he did almost every saturday. The boy's sat on his stomach, unsure what to do and obviously trying to ignore the huge erection towering overhead caused by Isaac. Ashfall jabs a thumb at his member, not taking his eyes off the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Take care of that would ya, it won't go away til I empty the load.\". Ashfall grunted while scratching his chest. Deciding what to do with them would be harder than he thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stared past the large pectorals at your dad's face, where he paid you, Travis and Matt no attention as he watched some action movie. He really wanted you to jerk him off? After a second of no movement, Ashfall's visible eye drifted from the TV to your group still standing on his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you need another demonstration? Get. TO. WORK!!!\". He said snapping his head towards you, steam billowing from his nostrils. Matt and Travis bolted down to your dad's crotch, fleeing for their life. You however just stood there, unable to believe this was the same Drake that you've been raised by since you were barely a year old. When you still didn't move he curled his lip exposing his fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will....last warning boy. Do as your told or face punishment.\". He said with fire boiling behind his eyes, you searched them for any show of compassion or love but you were only met with rage. You knew he still loved you, but he was doing a damn good job at keeping his promise of making you feel equal to your friends. You spent one second too long pondering that fact as familiar digits roughly grabbed you and lifted you upward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Damn this boy was testing his patience today as he lifted Will upward and snarled at him. As he did so the pleasurable feeling of small hands on the base of his cock picked up frantically as they watched Will, who they thought was gonna be safe from the dragon's wrath, take a full hit of it. Will kept looking deep into the drakes eyes, trying to read his old man. Sorry son, that doesn't work today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For not listening TWICE to me, your punishment is....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your friends all panicked but you remained chilled and unfazed by the situation. Dad wouldn't actually eat them, he'd be tried for that. So while your friends continued to beg and plead for their lives as saliva covered you all, you just waited for this bit to end. When it was over you'd be grounded, they'd be kicked out and life would resume. Or so you thought. As your dad opened his mouth and let light back in, you expected to carefully be deposited by his tongue into his waiting palm. Instead you and your friends shooting out of the dragon's mouth and landing with a slightly painful thud on his palm. You looked up and saw the angry eyes of your father looking down at all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall waited for the teens to regain themselves before addressing them. \"So you runts learn your lesson\", he asked with a scowl. The dragon watched with a sort of twisted glee as the teens including his son, got on their hands and knees and exclaimed yes as loud as they could. He held his glare on them for a bit, before he allowed his face to turn to an understanding look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good\", he said his voice dripping with mock relief. \"If it were any other dragon, you know where you would be headed, yes?\" They looked at each other and gulped hard. Will was about to respond when Ashfall interrupted. \"Then you boys should be happy to know that instead of eating you, I've decided that you'll just serve me.\" The drake watched as his son's face for the first time since their punishment began fell. The look of horror on the other teens faces were priceless. His once understanding features morphed into a cruel and sadistic smile.The dragon was going to in joy this. When his son tried to speak he closed his palm into a fist trapping them and putting a little extra fear in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad what are you talking about\", you asked both shocked and confused at this situation you now found yourself in. \"you can't just do this\", you shout up at him. A light squeeze enough to knock the wind out of you was his response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take that tone with me, Will\", your father warned. \"I was more then willing to put up with them and be polite and patient for your sake. But your friends and especially you have crossed a very fine line. Never fuck with dragons. Especially when their sleeping.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir we\", Travis tried to say something but a deep growl from you dad shut him up. Tears formed in his eyes as he just stared helplessly up at your father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, runt\", he said his voice low and threatening. \"Only speak when spoken to. That goes for the rest of you too. The only time your allowed to say anything is when I say you can, got it.\" Silence fell over you and your friends but another quick squeeze got an answer out of everyone. \"Got it\", you say in unison. Your dad allows a satisfied curl of the lip. \"Good now, we have a long weekend ahead of us and I'm sure I'm going to enjoy it. The rest of you, not so much.\" You watched as Ashfall carried all of you over to the table and carelessly tossed you on to it, before disappearing down the hall. When he was out of sight your friends turned towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Will\", Issac shouted at you. \"I don't want to be your Dad's slave all weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I do\", you retort. \"This is all on you guys, I told you to stay away from him but did you listen? No! You all just couldn't keep it in your pants. You just had to push you luck and now look where it's got you.\" Travis muttered something to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't want this, Will\", Matt shouted. \"We just wanted a closer look, we didn't know it would end up like this. What's he going to do to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis continued muttering to himself shaking a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever he wants\", you say grimly. \"Not like we can really stop him. He might even decide to return last night's favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's against the law\", Issac muttered in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that matters to him\", you ask. \"We violated him last night, anyway. And you want to try talking to him go right ahead. And Travis stop that already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis finally gets up slowly. \"What's gonna happen to us Will?\" He ask something off about his voice. You try to respond, but Travis continues his voice getting louder. \"Is he going to keep us? Is he going to eat us? Kill us? Use our bodies for something, what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis calm down\", you say not sure what's wrong with your friend. \"He's not going to keep us, or kill us. He cares about us.\" Not two seconds later Travis pounces on you and holds you down, his eyes wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Will\", he screams. \"He cares about you. He doesn't give a shit about the rest of us. He said so himself.\" Your friend  is freaking out. Dad would love this. He would love to see your friends at each others throats. Seeing them tear themselves apart with fright. Like Travis is doing. Well you won't give him the satisfaction. You take any meager victory you could at this point. You just had to calm Travis down. 'Travis listen to-\", your interrupted as Travis slugs you in the face. You yell in pain as you feel blood trickle down your face. \"Shut up, Will! Nothing you say will make me feel safe he's going to...\", Travis trails off as his eyes trail upwards. You follow his gaze and see your Dad angrier then he's ever been glaring down at your friend with murder in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall had been listening to their conversation the entire time. He took delight in the panic and fear Will and his friends were having over this. He was just about ready to make his silent entrance into their conversation when he heard his soon yell in pain. Ashfall rushed back out to the kitchen at breakneck speed. The dragon arrives just in time to see the blood trickle down his son's face. When Travis looked up to see him, he was already debating whether or not he should squish the runt. The drake had always been protective when it came to Will, especially around other dragons. He made it very clear that even his own friends were not allowed to tease his son if he wasn't around. So seeing this timid brat on top of his son made his blood boil. But Ashfall composed himself and decided against crushing the tiny human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get. Your. Hands. Off. My. Son\", Ashfall said very maliciously, murder and rage burning a hole into Travis. When the kid just stood there horrified. \"Now\", he added keeping his voice deep and threatening. The runt immediately realized what he had done and scrambled off of Will. He was about to apologize profusely, no doubt when he remembered The dragon's rule. Travis just sat their cowering in fear. While Will slowly got up holding a hand to his bloody nose. Ashfall didn't take his eyes off Travis until the brat was a safe distance away from Will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A shame', thought the dragon. He wanted more of an excuse to punish the little shit. But he pushed that thought out of his head and decided to see how his son was doing. \"Will\", Ashfall said his voice full of concern. \"Let me see. His Son reluctantly let him see his face. 'Just a bloody nose', thought the dragon. 'Nothing to worry about.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was about to say something when his father picked him up and set him on the floor. \"Go clean up\", said Ashfall. He could see his son about to argue but one look from the dragon told him that this was not debatable. He watched as Will began the long trek towards the bathroom. Before turning his gaze over to Travis and the other two. \"Now\", he said, leaning over the table glaring at Travis. \"What should I do to you?\" Travis felt like crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried to the bathroom not wanting to leave your friends alone with your now extremely pissed off dad. But it was a long walk. And you were out of breath a forth of the way to the bathroom. You needed to hurry back but there wasn't much you could do. But you hoped it wouldn't be to bad.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stared down the little brat, murder still fresh in your mind. Will wouldn't be back for awhile, at least. It was a long walk on human legs. The pathetic little bug had actually hit and hurt your son! This would not stand. You allow your gaze to drift over to the other two. The lying one and the horny, pushy one. Matt and Issac you think were their names. Not that it mattered of course, you could call them what ever you wanted and they wouldn't be able to stop you. But for the moment you realigned your gaze on Travis. Just as you were sure he was wondering what kind of fate awaited him you made your move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis watched as Mr. Ashfall glared at him. Just as he was wondering what would happen to him, the dragon slammed his hand down on top of him, pinning him but not hurting him. His upper body sticking out between the two digits. Just the the gray drake slid half of a talon under the human's shirt, blunt side of the claw feeling cold against his shirt. Then without any warning or resistance ripped Travis's shirt in half. Leaving the teen's skin exposed to the air. He could hear Ashfall chuckling before commenting. \"Damn, you really are a pathetic little runt, aren't you. No muscles or scars. Let's see if your other half is just as pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Travis could even blink he felt himself being flung in the air and landing with a slightly pained thud in Ashfall's palm. The human didn't even have time to regain his composure before the Dragon dug a talon into the boy's jeans and underwear and just as before ripped them away, leaving him exposed for the world to see. Finally the drake removed the teen's socks and placed a digit on his chest to keep him in place. He smirked. \"Yup\", the dragon said, \"absolutely pathetic.\" The human had never felt so humiliated, terrified, ashamed in all his life and tried to cover his dick with his hands, but Ashfall grabbed his arms and hoisted him upwards until Travis was staring directly into the drake's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of that now, runt!\" Teased Ashfall. \"Until Sunday evening I'm your master. I can look all I want. I can even touch.\" Travis felt the dragon's finger push up against his cock and balls. The human shuddered at the cold touch and immediately regretted that as the giant's eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying this are we\", Ashfall asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, why did you take my clothes\", Travis asked and got a hiss in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Master Ashfall to you, runt. And slaves don't need clothes unless their masters say they do. And that goes double for you bugs.\" The dragon glared down at Issac and Matt. \"Take'em off\", he commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to invoke their new master's wrath like their friend had done. The two humans immediately began disrobing. Travis saw the dragon turn his attention back to him and swallowed hard. He knew the drake could see his fear and that probably made it worse, but he couldn't help it. After what he did to Will, the human did not want to make his situation any worse. He'd do whatever Ashfall wanted, no matter what. But even he wasn't prepared for what was going to happen next. The teenager felt himself being thrown in the air again, and as if in slow motion watched Ashfall open his mouth and slam his fangs together just as Travis fell in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human didn't have time to get his bearings before the tongue he was on slammed him into the roof of the dragon's mouth. Knocking the wind out of him and hurting him a little. From that point on Ashfall's tongue became his worse nightmare. The muscle slammed him not enough to severely injure but defiantly bruise, into the dragon's fangs. Threw him towards his gums and felt his body being sucked on. Even wrapped itself around his dick and up his ass. But the drake made sure it hurt a little to negate any enjoyment. When Travis saw Ashfall open his mouth he tried to jump out, but the tongue caught him around the waist and pulled him back in. The muscle moved him to a safe part of his mouth before talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, is the little bug scared of the dark\", he teased in mock concern. \"Here let me help with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis didn't have  to figure out what Ashfall meant when he saw an orange light coming from the back of the dragon's throat. The human thought he couldn't be more afraid but he was wrong. He scrambled towards the drake's mouth. He may have forgotten about the tongue but it didn't forget about him. It pushed a pulled him this way and that as the light got brighter. The teenager screamed and begged and cried that he didn't want to die. But it seemed to fall on death ears as the flame crept it's way into Ashfall's mouth. Then right before it hit. The drake opened his mouth and the tongue shot Travis out. A gout of flame narrowly missing him. He landed with a thud back onto the dragon's palm. His hands covering his eyes and his body shaking uncontrollably. He began to cry in silence as the cruel monster above smiled sadistically at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou casually toss the runt back on to the table letting him roll a bit before coming to a stop. The bug's friends staring at Travis in disbelief and you in horror. You put prop your hand under your shin and rest your elbow on the counter as you admire your handy work. You give a sinister chuckle as you poke the runt's chest as he pulls himself tighter into a ball. Completely broken. Perfect. You turn towards the other two and clean your throat. They immediately snap to attention and look up terrified of you. You had their willingness now too. The last thing they wanted was to end up like their friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\", you start and all three even Travis looks up at you. \"I hope you runts have learned a valuable lesson. Never and I repeat never, touch my son. Because I promise you I have something planned for you two as well if you do.\" Then nod grimly. \"But don't relax just yet. After all I'm going to have so much fun with you all. Will included. Speaking of...\", you trail off and see your diminutive son hurrying over to you. Fear and worry on his face. \"Will so glad you could join us. I just finished punishing your little friend and am looking forward to playing with the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill stops just in front of you and looks up at you. You reach down and pick him up before placing him on the table with his friends. The instant your son sees Travis he rushes over to him and tries to help him up. The pathetic one looks a little relieved but just as he's about to take Will's hand, he turns to you, shrieks and backs away towards Issac and Matt who help him up. Your son looks dumbfounded and shocked before turning his eyes towards you, fire burning in them. Your son was a good kid and you were proud that he could stand up to bullies when need be. A shame that in this instance you had to crush that spark of his. He was about to let you have it when he remembered your rule. And gives you a pleading look, smirking triumphantly you respond. \"Yes, Will? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, what did you do to Travis?!\" He shouted up at you outraged. \"Why are Matt, Issac and him naked. Why are...\", he stops when you put up a finger and give him a look that says \"enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just showed the little bug what happens when he messes with my family\", you say honestly. Not a bit of concern or kindness in your voice. \"And as I've told them until Sunday I am their master. As I am yours. So as their master I decided they need clothes. And now that I think about it neither do you. Take them off.\" Will looks at you horrified. He looks like he's about to say something but you continue. \"I don't care what your about to say, Son. Until Sunday night you and your friends opinions don't matter. The only thing that does matter is my word. And that's all you will concern yourself with. Now take off your clothes or I'll rip them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad\", your son looks at you with pleading eyes. \"Please don't do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your friends molested me in my sleep. Despite knowing it was wrong and what I'm like. This is a lesson that you must learn and price that you must pay. When this is all over, you are grounded for three months. And if your friends ever come here again I'll kill them for trespassing. NOW, TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait to see what your son does. Will...</span></div></div>",

He takes off his shirt and pants but stops at his underwear hoping you'll leave him with at least a small shred of dignity. Your eyes meet him and he knows that that's not going to happen. Finally your son is just as naked as his friends. When your satisfied, extending a claw you take his clothes and chuck them on the floor. Then without a word you scoop all of them up and head to your bedroom. You casually throw them on to the bed before stripping down yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill watched in horror as his dad brought him and his friends back to his room. Then he and his friends sailed through the air and landed with a soft thud on his bed before him and his friends can regain themselves a shadow falls over them. Before any of them can look up, the teenagers feel the ground behind them fall inward and them fall backwards. Will and his friends hit something soft but wrinkly behind. And an overpowering scent of musk hits their nostrils threatening to knock them out by scent alone. Turning around the runts see a large wrinkly wall behind them and mountainous cock high and erect above them. Before the teens can move away, a large grey hand reaches down and pulls them up to Ashfall's smirking face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm\", you muse. \"Now where should I put you?\" You reach out and grab the horny one, Issac if you recall. Lifting him up to your face amusement and sadistic glee in your eyes. \"You and Will have already spent an ample amount of time near my cock and balls. How about I put you more down south?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't wait for his response. Instead using a free hand you shove the squirming little bug under your balls and as close to your crack as you can. Then you push him up against your pucker. \"That's as far as I'm willing to push you. You r going to pleasure my hole and you do want pleasure it, you add threateningly. 'Your going to have to do the work yourself.\" Use that useless tongue of yours and those pathetic sticks you call arms and work.\" You don't feel any hesitation as the horny one's tongue begins moving in slow circles around your ring. You can also feel the bug's pathetic arms trying to pry your pucker open. You clench your ass as a warning and feel him squirm a bit before going from prying to massaging. Satisfied you turn your attention to the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the pathetic one. His body limp in your grip and decide that he'll do anything you want him to do. \"All right runt\", you address him. \"Don't move a muscle. Don't struggle, don't kick or flail, or I promise you. I'll punish you.\" He sniffs and nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the pathetic one and your son down before your cock. \"Don't move\", you command. Then with the dumb one still in your palm. You roughly grip him and shove him against your balls. He struggles constantly but the only thing that does is arose you further. But you hold out and firmly push him between your two orbs. Then you retract your fingers and feel him struggle desperately to try and get out. He wouldn't suffocate but he couldn't leave either. Then you finally turn your attention towards your son and the pathetic one. An evil grin across your face. Travis cowers and your son looks up at you horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, son enjoying yourself\", you chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Dad\", he replies. \"This is sick and weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\", you say in mock disappointment. \"Well why don't we play a game then.\" You reach down and pick up Travis. He's still following your commands and hasn't moved an inch. Using a free hand you hold your dick steady and carefully slide the runt's body into your cock slit. You moan a little as you do that and you can see the bug's fear and horror on his face. You also see your son looking even more horrified then before. but you ignore that for now and just casually push the rest of the runt into you dick. If he wasn't already broken he would have struggled desperately and that would have ruined your fun. When he vanished from sight you turned to Will. \"Alright Son, make me erupt and save your friend. Otherwise he's headed straight for my balls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will looked disgusted. \"What eww, no dad just let him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No make me cum and save him. You even have your little friends helping you\", you reply smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's wrong. I'm your son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was fine for you and your friends to molest me last night\", you reply eyes cold. He tries to respond but you cut him off. \"No, Will you need to know how wrong this feels. You need to experience this first hand and understand that there are some boundaries you can't cross. And if I have to be the one to teach you something that should be obvious. Then so be it. Even if I have to cross those boundaries myself.\" Without another word you pick your son up and give his dick a slow deliberate lick to prove your point. He retches at the feel of it but can't get away. Then you set him down on the head of your cock. \"NOW, GET TO WORK\", you snarl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill realizes he's not getting out of this and at his father's command begins to massage and caress the head. 'This feels so wrong', he thinks. But he can't argue. He needs to get Travis out. He begins moving faster. Just wanting this whole experience to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purr with pleasure and some small ounce of mild disgust. Why didn't your son have more of a back bone? Why wasn't he the one to wake you last night? This whole issue could have been solved had Will been the one to put his foot down. Then all he'd have to do is watch his friends get what was coming to them. But no, he went along with them and indulged their little fantasies. This was why you didn't interact with humans. They were just so weird and demanding. Despite being in clear danger then never backed down and only regretted their actions when it was too late. You had hoped that if Will was raised by you, he wouldn't develop these annoying traits. But no he did and now he had to pay for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour anger subsides and thoughts fade away as you feel yourself getting close. You resist the urge to grab your cock and let the runts do their job. Then you cum. Hot jizz comes shooting out as both Will and Travis land in a lake of the stuff in front of you. Satisfied you free the dumb one from his prison as he gasp for air and toss him in the pool with the other two. Then you stand up release a massive fart and gas the horny one out of your rump and into the cum with the others. turning around you stare down at them and cross your arms wait for them to continue. When they don't know what to do you growl at them. When they still don't know what to do you decide to point out the obvious for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well\", you growl. \"Clean it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look startled and confused looking around for something to clean it up with. You make a show of rolling your eyes before addressing them again. \"With your mouths runts.\" Then stare at you jaws hanging open especially Will, like he can't believe what he's hearing. You allow your lips to curl into a huge evil smile. \"What did you expect? Your slaves, bugs. Your master's cum is all your getting for food. So get use to it.\" When they still don't do anything you growl at them again. \"Either you clean that up or I'll add roasted teens to my meal plan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got their attention.Travis, Matt, and Issac. Shoveled as much as they could into their mouths as possible only your  son refused to move. \"Will\", you say. \"Your really starting to try my patience.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You beam triumphantly as your son finally stops fighting back and accepts the way things are for now. You watch as Will tries his best not to puke or spit the cum back up. That kind of hurts. You really didn't want your son to do this but, for his sake and your relationship with him you had to push on. The teens ate as much as they could, the pathetic one especially did not want to risk your ire. The dumb one is also trying his best not to lose his lunch. It hurts to focus on your son for the moment so you focus on Issac. That's when you notice something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill and the others try to focus on their punishment and not at the cruel monster above them but when Ashfall spoke they all listened. \"Don't stop on my account boys. Finish your breakfast I just want to check something.\" The humans see a shadow fall over them. but they don't stop they don't falter until they hear Issac scream. The humans turn to see the drake roughly pick up their friend. Lifting him high in the air before he glares at the others who go back to what they were doing. Satisfied the dragon looks over the squirming runt in his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac is terrified beyond belief. What did he do wrong? Should he ask? But that would just be more trouble. Before he can decide what to do the dragon grabs his arms and lifts them over his head. Was there something about his body the drake wanted. He sees Ashfall staring at him intrigued before a toothy smile fills his face. His voice like thunder rolls over Issac's body as curiosity and a bit of anger drips from his words. Although the while he feels something hard and cold slide against his cock. \"Are you actually excited\", the drake asks like he can't believe that the teen was hard over his treatment. The human refuses to look the dragon in the eyes. Maybe he's still under the effects of glamour. At least he hopes that's it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it. You've terrified, mistreated, threatened, and abused these teens all morning and this little fucker is actually enjoying it.Well you'd fix that. You drop the runt back in the cum at a non lethal height and go into the bathroom. Grabbing a towel you come back and give a single command. \"MOVE!\" They scramble out of the way as you clean up their \"breakfast\", and toss it in the hamper before grabbing the lot of them and making your way to the couch. You toss the pathetic one and the dumb one on the couch. Another command \"STAY\", and with Will and the horny one still in your palm you make your way back to the bathroom grab a bucket of water mixed with scale cleaner and a wash cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back the two runts are still on the couch, good. You deposit Will and the horny one on the table. Setting the bucket on the floor you rip the wash cloth into small human sized pieces dunk it in the bucket, pick up the other two off the couch before plopping down on it yourself. Then you dump the other two brats on your chest hand them the wash cloths, and prepare to address your slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up runts\", your voice booms out over them. \"Because your little friend on the table seems to enjoy what I do to you, so you can thank him for this next task. I was originally going to use you as my sex toys, leave you so scarred and abused you'd be lucky if you ever thought of dragons as anything other then terrifying again. But because of your friend I've changed my mind.\" They and your son look relieved. \"Instead I'm just going to work you to the bone. It's going to be a long weekend for all of you.\" Their faces fell. You smirk. \"Just this once I'll allow you to comment  or question me. So any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dumb one goes first. \"This is inhuman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing I'm not human then. Next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pathetic one speaks quietly. \"You can't just do this to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not\", you ask. \"I'm bigger, stronger, and let's face it better then you'll ever be. true I can't kill you, but I can make your lives as miserable as possible. Next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horny one's turn. \"Fine, maybe you can do this to us. But why do it to Will, don't you love him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your gaze to the runt and give a piercing glare and malicious smile. You were going to enjoy his punishment. \"Yes I do love my son. More then any of you, even him could possibly imagine. There's nothing I wouldn't do to keep him safe, no one I wouldn't kill for him. But there are certain lessons I have to teach him. Consequences for his actions. Who knows maybe next time he'll fine better friends. Friends that actually respect his decisions and listen when he says no. Until then though, I have to do my best to ensure this is something that never happens again. That is all, next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looks at you. Trying to read you but stays silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more questions\", you ask. \"Good. Now the two runts on my chest are going to scrub my scales until they shine. Every scale, every inch of me. When that's done, there going to wait on me hand and feet massage my muscle, brush my teeth, maybe even feed me. They have a long hard day. And possibly night.\" The two stare up in shock at the ridiculous of their task. \"And if it tickles my fancy I may decide to play with one of them for a bit. Maybe put them somewhere enjoyable or like they used my body, I'll use theirs for something. Don't look forward to it.\" You grin they gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you two, your going to be doing something else. The winner gets to join their friends in their jobs. The loser however...\", you trail off. \"Well as much as I enjoy raw humans I have to wonder how you'd taste dipped in chocolate, cheese, salsa, pretty much what ever I can think of.\" Will and Issac look at you horrified. \"Oh no boys, I won't be eating you. You'll just be spending a lot of time in my mouth.\" They don't relax or look relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now some ground rules, Will and runt. No giving up, no half ass attempts it, give it your all. I'll know if you are. You'll stop when I say so. Oh and since Will wasn't here for this I'll let you all know now. Despite the fact that I'll no longer show Will any favoritism, he's still my son. If any of you cause him any harm. I'll tack on an additional penalty. Got it.\" The teens gulp and nod. \"Good now, the two bugs on my chest get to work.\" The pathetic one and dumb one immediately start polishing your scales. \"Will and what ever your name is...\", they wait distressed and scared of what they'll be doing. With the biggest smile you can muster pointed straight at Issac, you say, \"Fight for my amusement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An idea popped into Ashfall's head as he was swishing you and your friends around, tasting your small forms. You may have been aware of a dragon's unintentional glamour but they could also do it intentionally to. Only it was little less like lust and a lot more like brainwashing. It's something that dragon's usually considered taboo. It wasn't illegal or anything despite it''s powerful effects, but dragons rarely needed it to get humans to do what they wanted. They had size, strength and fear for that. But because you were unaware of this it became all the more confusing when your friends started to be spit out one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall glared down at the first human he had spit out. Issac he thought his name was. Not that mattered after all in a few seconds the drake could call or treat him however he wanted, and the runt would still worship the ground he walked on. The bug was saying something, probably pleas for mercy or something, but the dragon continued to just swish around the humans in his mouth as he began to focus. He closed his eyes for a brief second before opening them again as they glowed with a strange light. Issac all at once stopped talking and stared at Ashfall. Then a moment later the teen's eyes glazed over and he dropped to his hands and knees in a bowing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake looked a little disappointed. He expected just a bit of resistance but the runt just folded like nothing. Ashfall smirked, 'guess he was always a little slut', the dragon thought as he casually put the human on his bed. before moving on to the next human. The next one that came out was the dumb one, Matt, Ashfall thought. They were still his son's friend he should at least know their names. When the teen looked at Ashfall, he to succumbed to the glamour  and joined his frisky friend in bowing before the dragon. 'Well he wasn't that bright to begin with', thought Ashfall as he also put him on the bed. The drake tasted around a bit trying to discern where Will was, when he found him, he ignored his son and brought out Travis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scared one refused to look up at him. It was good that he was scared but Ashfall needed the bug to look at him for his glamour to take hold. He uttered a low growl that got the teen's attention, and that Will no doubt felt and heard. It worked the scared one lifted his head to look at the dragon and actually tried to fight against the glamour, but another growl from the drake and Travis was on his hands and knees with his friends. Satisfied he set the runt down with the other two before debating if he should do this to Will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second he decided against it, while having Will under his control would be nice, it would completely destroy their bond as father and son. Something Ashfall had no intention of doing or even trying. His friends however, would not be so lucky. The dragon would use and abuse them all weekend. By Sunday night, they would remember a thing, other then having a deep emotional and psychological fear of dragons. But for now it was time to decide Will's punishment, since he wouldn't be sharing his friends fate. And for that Ashfall had a great idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as light entered your father's mouth and one by one your friends were tossed out. When Travis was tossed out, you thought your eardrums would rupture when your dad growled. You were completely in the dark by what your dad was doing, but knowing him he was probably enjoying it. Then light once again shined through your prison, rather then being spat out you felt the familiar grip of your dad's fingers around your waist and lifting you out. You were still trying to recover from the bright light as the dragon placed you on his bed. When you did recover you saw your friends bowing before you and run up to ask them what's wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever just as you took a single step, your dad cleared his throat and you turned around and stared up at your god-like father who had an evil grin on his face. You didn't like that smile. \"And where do you think your going, son?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see my friends\", you say carefully eyeing your dad nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall nodded and gave an amused chuckle. \"You can't see them from here?\" he asked you in mock curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little confused. What was he doing, why wasn't he getting angry? Why wasn't he telling you off, punishing you? And what did he do to your friends. Suddenly your dad called your name and snapped you out of your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, I asked you a question\", his voice was calm and even. He talked as if he had all the answer in the world. \"Or maybe that question was too hard for you my little pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat set off some serious red flags for you. 'Pet', you thought thoroughly confused and a little afraid. \"P-pet\", you stammer. \"I'm not your pet, dad. I'm your son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall tilted his head a little and looked at you quizzically. \"My son\", the drake said as if tasting the word. \"No that can't be right. My son would know better then to help molest his own father.\" Though he said this calmly you saw his eyes burn with anger before turning back to looking amused. \"So you see, my pet, that's why you can't be my son. My son would never do anything so stupid and obviously dangerous. No, your just my little pet. \"Something to amuse me and something that I have to care for and baby, because you obviously can't do that yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked at this. So this is what you punishment would be like. Your dad had always just grounded you or took away something, never outright saying that your not his son anymore. And what's worst treating you like you were his pet. You were so shocked you didn't even notice your dad taking off his waistband and dropping it on the floor. You did however feel as he reached down and picked you up and began maneuvering himself in bed, nearly stepping on your friends who for some reason had not moved. The drake placed you on his chest as his balls and cock towered above the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, careful your going to hurt my friends\", when Ashfall looked at you puzzled again you knew you were not going to like what he was going to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friends, oh my did you hit your little head, my pet. Those aren't your friends. Their my slaves. Ashfall reached down a picked Issac up not so gently off the bed and put him in front of you. You rush up to him and begin trying to talk to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Issac are you okay\", you back away slowly when your friend sits up with a far off look in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man I'm fine\", his voice is hollow as though there's no feeling from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back towards you dad, who's still looking at you in mock concern. \"Dad, what did you do to him\", you demand. The dragon merely begins stroking your back, and talks to you like your a frightened child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there little one no reason to shout. What's gotten into today? As for my slave, I've done nothing to him. He and the rest just decided that after molesting me they wanted to serve me. Isn't that right, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Will\", Issac says with no emotion. \"Your master Ashfall's pet. You get to spend your life being doted on by our kind and caring master. While we get the honor of being used and played with. As well as serving such a majestic, handsome, sexy- okay stop!\" You shout. You turn to towards your dad and ask him directly. \"Dad, what did you do to them? No more games.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad goes from puzzlement to pouting, like you just ruined his fun. \"Since my normal punishment methods don't seem to be working\", he says dropping the facade. \"I've decided to step up my game. Your friends are under the effect of a deep glamour. They are mine to do with as I see fit. They are mine to use, abuse and anything else I may think of that doesn't involve killing them. They will continue to be that way till Sunday evening. They will not remember anything other then have a deep emotional and psychological fear of dragons. They will live and continue being your friend, but their fascination with me will stop. But if they ever show up here again, not only will i put them back under the glamour and they will spend the rest of their lives at my beck and call.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look terrified at this news. And are about to retort when your dad continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you Will. Until I can be sure you won't do this again you won't be treated as my son, but as my pet. You won't be harmed, but you also won't be taken seriously. To me you will just be some cute little animal, a form of amusement. I'll cuddle, kiss and pet you as much as I want, which is fine by me, but I'm sure you won't like it. Television, video games, friends and even school will be on hold until I feel like you won't repeat this behavior. But don't think you'll be here alone all day. I have some vacation days that I can use and if you don't learn your lesson by then I may have to just work from home, or bring you to work with me, neither option will be pleasant for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour still trying to process this, but when you try to retort your dad just shushes you. \"Now, now little one', he says putting the act back on. \"No more talking now. It's time for your master to have some fun. Now should I play with you a bit while I have my slaves give me a massage or something simple like that. Or should I put you away for now, so I can focus solely on them. Decisions, decisions...\"</span></div></div>",

You instantly rolled to your feet and put a bare foot on Isaac's chest, his eyes fogged over with obvious dragon glamour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac, you idiot I should've known you were infected the second we got to my room, you were hooked by the smell alone of my house, c'mon we need to get you back to my room and call your parents to come get you.\" You said sternly. Isaac shook his head, the fog fading but not completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Will I'm fine, now lemme up you're being a buzz kill.\" He said only to find your foot on him taking more of your weight on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it Isaac, there's another reason I don't wanna be down here for long, because sometime soon my-\" You stopped as the sound of keys in a lock were heard from the door in the kitchen, Matt and Travis ran down to you and Isaac, asking a million questions about who it was. The door opened and slammed shut, but you couldn't see the culprit yet. \"......Other dad will get home.\" All your friends turned and looked at you with faces of confusion, awe, and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you have two dragon dads Will?\" Travis said in shock, looking towards the doorway into the kitchen with a look of pure terror. Isaac squirmed under your foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us? All this time we thought when you said 'dad', you were referring to one, not one or the other. What the hell man!\" Isaac said, his dragon glamour gone for the minute. You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never really came up, I thought you  guys figured that sense I was adopted and there were two dressers in the master, and ya know, an extra large king bed. This one sometimes travels and is gone for a week every month or so. But nevermind it for now, lets get out of here! My dad Ashfall probably forgot about you all and didn't inform him I had friends over.\" You said making your way back to the worn fibers of the couch that made a ladder. However when you turned around Isaac hadn't gotten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac! Let's go! Please! Ashfall tolerates humans to an extent, but my dad Cinder hates them save for me. If he gets you and I'm not with you, there's no probably, he will kill you!\" You say frantically, which seemed to have little effect on your friend. He turned and faced you, his eyes in the light of the TV fogged over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wanna see him, I bet he is just as beautiful as this god...\" He said gesturing at Ashfall. You held your tongue for once, if he found Ashfall in his dad bodilyness beautiful, the sight of Cinder was gonna kill him alone. Where Ashfall went to bars and Wing places after work, Cinder hit the gym religiously. Some of your dad's mutual friends called Cinder the muscle head for good reason, because he put bodybuilders on the human scale to shame. Someone made the joke once in front of you that humans were his supplement, and it scared you a good bit, but your dad, or pops, as you called Cinder so you didn't confuse him and Ashfall when referring to them, comforted you saying that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad shit head, catch him on your way out the door-\" You begin to say but gasp and tackle Isaac to the soft belly of your dad. Travis and Matt followed your example and dropped prone as well as Cinder walked into the room, toting a gym bag with him. He was about the same height as Ashfall, but was wider and sported bulging muscles all over his body. His scaled hide was the color of bright orange and here and there speckles of black were seen. His chest and stomach were the color of snow, and it ran from under his chin to the tip of his long thick tail. Two polished black horns sprouted from the back of his head and a smaller black horn at the top end of his snout. He wore only a compression tank top and compression shorts that hugged his crotch and thick ass tightly, exposing every twitch and movement of his powerful muscles. Isaac let out a silent gasp and you slowly crawled back and whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in my dad's waistband, and lets pray they keep it PG 13 for now...\" Everyone actually listened for once and slid into the worn band of the tighty whities. Everyone was in just in time as Cinder dropped bag and turned to look at Ashfall. The Orange drake blew air out of his nose and peeled off his shirt, his chest taking in a breath of its own, the pectorals were swelled to the size of human blimps from the work out he must've come back from. Next he hooked a thumb in his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\" Isaac retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cinder slid his compression's off and dropped them on the gym bag, his colossal balls and cock swinging in the cool living room air as he made his way over to the sleeping Ashfall. You and the others hunkered a little deeper into the waistband, your elbows probably very uncomfortable to you host dad. Cinder threw a leg over Ashfalls waist and it was at this moment you realized you had chosen a poor hiding spot. The muscled drakes enormous rear, cloaked in shadow and ghost light from the Tv, hung over your position as Cinder reached down and kissed the sleeping gray drake on the parted lips. As he did, his rear slowly descended on your position, his taint's trajectory looking like the soft mid belly region, leaving his ass to land right on all of you. The others seemed to realize this too, and began to shuffle nervously. You looked about frantically, and only had two options, quickly run out and get your Pop's attention, and his anger. Or you could stay put and wait it out, hoping Ashfall doesn't reciprocate the passion for making love. You decide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Travis said something after you but you didn't catch it from your heart beating in your ears, blood pumping in a fight or flight response towards the possibility of getting caught between your dad's without them knowing you're even there. Ashfalls belly was like running on a trampoline, and you tripped and stumbled as the flesh rebounded as your feet left it's surface. You recovered with a practiced grace, getting up as the scaly landscape became darker and darker from Cinders slow approach, you notice his large balls were going to make contact first and it was going to be a close one as you ran underneath your Pop's taint.

As long as they stayed in the waistband, the tight cheeks won't pinch and drag them up into the mounds of Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...yeah sorry, I didn't see you there Squirt, I thought you would have been in bed by now, it's 2am now son.\" He said obviously annoyed but knowing he couldn't blame you for it. You had to find a way to be able to stay, and try to get Cinder to leave so you could extract your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh is it? I probably should go to my room...but I really wanna stay here pop's, dad is a pretty good substitute for a bed...\" You say, faking a yawn. Cinder's face twitched slightly. You were gonna play like you weren't aware of what Cinder was attempting to do with Ashfall, and maybe if you can pull it off he'd go to bed by himself. Cinder was always the softer dad and always had trouble telling you no unless it was something serious. But you had to hurry before his weight and voice woke Ashfall and the plan was foiled. Cinder loomed silently for a second, half his form cloaked in shadow and even with his kindhearted tendencies towards you the sight was imposing. After a minute he closed his eyes and sighed, the sign of surrender, you had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine, you can stay, go back to sleep Squirt, I'll see you in the morning.\" He patted your head with the tip of his claw and you feigned going back to sleep. In the corner of your eye you watched the massive form of your Pops slide off Ashfall, his junk swinging and his cock at half mast, deflating with defeat from you cock blocking, which made you feel a little guilty but it was for a just cause. He grabbed his stuff and headed down the hallway to the master bedroom, the distant sound of the bathroom door closing. You sprang up and let out a sigh, you had actually won, now to get your friends and get them back to the end table and then getting them out and home. You walk back across Ashfalls belly, the surface otter from its contact with a pumped up Cinder. As you passed the belly button however, you noticed something was wrong, no one was in the waistband. You sprinted the last bit of belly and lifted the band, looking into the darkness of Ashfalls crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac....Matt....Travis??\" You whisper yell into the abyss, only to get no response. That meant two things, one was they slipped out and managed to get away somewhere. The other was....that they were in Cinders cheeks, alone and without you to shield them, and it wouldn't surprise you if they were already dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" You yell, and Ashfall responded by letting out a Snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac I told you this was a bad idea!\" Travis whimpered as he and the others were crushed in between walls of fat and muscle, their heads feeling like they would pop any second. They were up Cinder's ass, the mountains of flesh grinding back and forth as the Drake walked, and Will wasn't with them. Isaac had crawled out of the waistband as Cinder had sat all the way down, the way he sat had spread his enormous cheeks to the extent that through a sliver of space between the large muscle groups his hole had been visible and Isaac could not resist. He was between the cheeks working his way towards it with the others following to stop him when the big Drake had stood up and the cheeks clamped shut like a bear trap, encasing the humans in their depths. Isaac sputtered out a retort but it was lost into the dense flesh around them. The pressure around them eased slightly and the sound of water hitting water could be heard slightly, letting everyone know this guy was taking a leak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"At least he doesn't need to shit, we'd be in that bowl right now.\" Matt said nonchalantly. The sound of a shower could be heard and they all knew they were about to be either washed out or found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You ran down the walkway towards the master bath, turning a corner and entering the bedroom. Cinder had shut the door but that hardly mattered, as you had your own small door that opened onto the counter inside the bathroom. You sprinted to it and caught your breath before entering, man you needed to start attending the gym with Pops. You walk in to see Cinder playing with his phone, probably looking for tunes to listen too as he showered. The shower was warming up as the Orange drake just stood by it in his naked glory. You tried to act casual as you approached the sink and not to look at him every second. You'd seen your father's naked almost every day, they weren't bothered by the same principals of being clothed most of the time like humans were, so they wouldn't kick you out of the bathroom just because they were naked in it, you were privy to most of their lives and the only thing they did without you seeing was when they got more intimate. You were almost to the sink when your movement caught his eye. He lowered his phone and raised an eyebrow at your sudden appearance in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will...\" He said slowly. \"You were JUST in the living room, did you sprint here? Is something wrong?\" He said in a caring tone, but with an underlying pitch of suspicion. You cleared your throat and tried to not sound out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No no, just never brushed my teeth.\" You said turning to your small sink installed in the splash back of the counter. You could feel his gold eyes still on you, so you tried to divert him, if there was one thing that worked, it was to get your slightly egotistical father to talk about himself. \"How have you been Pops, with my school and your work, I haven't seen much of you in the past month, you're not leaving again this weekend right? Maybe we could do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the mirror in front of you the Drake's posture relaxed a bit and he spoke. \"I've been fine, works fine, it seems you and Ash are fine so that makes everything perfect in my book. As for work this weekend you're right, I don't have any meetings or presentations so I can stay in town for a week, so I'll be here if you need me.\" He said reaching over and testing the water again and quickly muttering about fixing the damn water heater. But the way he talked told you he wasn't too keen on holding a conversation for long with his oddly acting son. You knew you could only manipulate him for so long before he caught on that you were making him miss something. You spun around and changed the topic on him directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You look great by the way, much more...bigger.\" You say nonchalantly. Cinder blinked and looked down at himself and said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks I'm trying a new routine.\" He said bouncing his chest once. Then his face turned stern and his eyes darted around before coming back to you. \"So whats going on, what do you want from me Will.\" You feigned ignorance but he had a good point. What did you want? You couldn't just ask him to let your friends out of his butt.(You actually could but the results would have after effects.) What you wanted was for him to not shower and to go to bed so you could rescue them, but he seemed quite alert and would most likely sleep the afternoon tomorrow away. So you went for a half truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I just wanna talk to you, but I don't know what to say, I never see you much and when you are here you're asleep or at the gym.\" You let your head sag slightly, realizing that was a little more than a half truth, you wanted him to notice you more and do more with you. That looked like it hit Cinder hard cause he sighed again and squatted down looking at you sorrowfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw Squirt, I'm sorry you feel that way, I'm so caught up all the time I fail to stop and really pay you any mind, lemme take this shower and we can talk then alright?\" He said with a warming smile, which made you smile too. Unbeknownst to you or Cinder however was that his cheeks had parted and a stowaway was in a predicament....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Matt!\" Isaac screamed, his arms and legs digging into the taut flesh of the cheeks surrounding him, Travis was wrapped around his waist, and Matt was hanging from his feet, dangling a hundred or so feet above a purple bathroom mat below. The Drake had squatted and his cheeks had opened up enough to cause them to begin to slip from their tight confines, Isaac had responded quickly, but Travis was making him slip, he glanced up to see a white sphincter way above him and many times larger than him wink at him, and the glamour effected him for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kick him off Travis, no need for us all to fall.\" He said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK YOU ISAAC, I HOPE YOU GET YOURSELF EATEN BY THIS GIANT LIZARD.\" Matt called back up, hate in his eyes along with tears.  Travis however, looked down and whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Matt, but that rug below looks like one of those Memory foam ones, please let go.\" Travis said solemnly. Matt gritted his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I survive all this I'm SO done with all of you.\" He said as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt took a deep breath and locked eyes with Isaac and let go, giving Isaac the double bird as he fell away from the giant ass that had imprisoned him. Air rushed in his ears and his heart went into his throat as he fell, the world of porcelain around him spinning as the purple mat approached at a terrifying rate. The impact against the mat was terrible and his whole body screamed from the landing but...he was alive. He took in a shaky breath, his eyes looking at the small specks in the colossal ass above him that were his 'friends'. He had escaped, now to get off the floor and to Wills room to grab his stuff. He tried to sit up but his body seemed to be in some form of shock still, so he just sat and looked up at the Orange and White rump of Will's godly dad, and watched as the dragon stood back up and swallowed up Isaac and Travis, good riddance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watched your father stand back up and walk over to the shower, testing it again and muttering some more. It wasn't until you looked at his large butt that you remembered what was going on and slightly panic again. You didn't really think before you yelled. \"I think I'll join you!\". Cinder turned back to you and pursed his lips but said nothing and shrugged. There wasn't a human shower in the house so you kind of took showers with your dads on the soap dish. Cinder's first reaction was probably due to your persistence tonight rather than the request, you'd shower'd with him countless times so one more wasn't unusual, but one after interrupting his advance on Ashfall and then following him into the bathroom after claiming you were gonna sleep was slightly strange. You stripped down and left the clothes on the counter. After another minute, Cinder seemed satisfied with the temperature and plucked you off the counter and set you on the waist high soap dish. You waited for Cinder to lumber in and when he did the mist cascading from his body as water hit it provided you with an equivalent to a human shower. You half assed washed and waited for your opening, and soon it came. Cinder put his head in the stream with his face directly in it, his eyes closed as he reached for the soap bar near you. You took a deep breath and jumped onto the bar just as Cinder's hand wrapped around it and began to drag it across his body, taking you along all his muscle groups, you waited until he was doing his lower back and squeezed off the bar between his lathered fingers, and landed on the base of his strong tail. You walked to one side of it, careful to avoid being washed away by the rivers and waterfalls that were descending his back like some world wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Will, don't fuck this up.\" You amp yourself up and leap, falling with a vertical dive towards the wedge that was where his tail met the top of his left ass cheek. You angled it perfectly and with your soaped up nudity you slid right under the tail and into his ass crack. Unlike your friends, you had been caught up in here on a few occasions so you expected the pressure, but apparently his ass had gotten a little bigger and thus a little tighter deeper in. Through the muffled darkness you crawled and called out to your friends. Suddenly you heard a muffled call in front of you and before you know it you had bumped into Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, oh my God, is that really you? I- Why are you so slick and why do you feel naked.\" Travis felt you up a bit in the darkness and retreated slightly but continued. \"You have to get me out man, Isaac has gone crazy, he left me and I have no idea where he is.\" He said sounding frantic and fearful, You said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, I'm gonna get us out, where's Matt?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-He fell when your Pops squatted down, I dunno if he's alive.\" He said solemnly. You paled, this wasn't good, this could lead to lawsuits from Matt's parents. And of course Cinder doesn't even know he just killed a human by simply getting a better angle to talk to his adopted son. This was your fault. Then you suddenly remembered something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there a purple floor mat below you?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" He said. You let out a breath you didn't know you held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's most likely alive then, mat's like those are designed for that sole reason, too catch humans falling from places in a dragon building. Almost all the counters in this house have them on the floor in case I take a tumble off one, even the carpets are extra dense for me, I kinda have very considerate parents.\" You say. \"Anyway I think our ride's coming, I'll have to think of a way to get Isaac out of here later.\" Travis made a confused sound, but it was overridden by a wet sliding sound and suddenly both of you were hit by the soap bar. You wrapped an arm around Travis and endured about ten seconds of crushing pressure as the soap explored most of Cinders rear. You heard a surprised yelp at some point and knew it to be Isaac being run over by the bar and took a strange satisfaction from it. After a couple more seconds the bar withdrew and was held under the stream for a second, Cinders hand protecting you from the worst of the torrent, before he set the bar back on the dish and began to wash the suds off of him. You slid off the bar and looked back at Travis, his clothes soaked through as he wobbled to his feet on and looked at you before averting his gaze quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you're in your birthday suit.\" He says like it wasn't obvious. You scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't have time to change into a swim suit to rescue you. Now we have to-\" The shower cut off and without hesitation you reached up and pushed Travis so he fell between the Soap and the Wall, hopefully fully out of sight. You turn around to see Cinder blinking some water from his eyes and looking at you questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya say somethin' Squirt?\" He said grabbing a towel from a rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" He continued. \"Coulda swore I heard a full conversation, maybe I need a drink.\" He plucked you up again and dried you off and put you back on the counter next to your clothes. He on the other hand seemed content with his birthday suit as he tossed the towel into a hamper when he was done drying himself. While he did this you glanced off the edge and didn't see any corpse on the mat below so that told you Matt was alive and somewhere in the house, Isaac was still deep in Pops ass unless he was washed out, and Travis was on the soap dish. You weren't sure things were better or worse now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac coughed up suds and wiggled his way deeper into the ravine of this god. Will was insane, these beings need a humans undivided attention, and Isaac was going to submit himself. He had seen it twice now, the sphincter of this divine being required his attendance, but he couldn't find the damn thing in this maze of muscle. He had been suspended over a drop, run over by soap, almost washed out by streams of water, and nearly dragged out by what felt like a towel. He had survived the trials, he deserved this. A voice in the back of his head told him this wasn't right, and that he was in a enchanted state, but that was just paranoia, this WAS right, and he was gonna see it to the end. He continued his slow ascent into Cinder's Abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis watched the hulking form of Cinder take Will away, leaving him shivering on the soap dish. He looked over the edge and saw the tub was mostly lined with that same mat Will had told him was for catching humans, but if he jumped, he'd just be stuck down there rather than right here. It was probably just better to wait for Will where he left him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt trudged through the field of cotton fibers, getting annoyed as it looked like he had only made it five dragon feet away from the bathroom door, the End Table was like a distant tower, its ebony finish gleaming in the room like a beacon to the weary. If he could just get to it- The door swung open from the bathroom and the hulking form of the Orange Drake filled the space of the frame. He was speaking to his palm for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...guess you could say that Squirt.\" He finished saying as he took a step directly towards Matt. His footfall, despite landing on plush carpet, sending a shockwave through the floor, the other foot lifted, and the toes of it swept right for Matt, who yelped and tried to move but the fibers caught him. He only had a second to see the Big toe and long toe coming right at him, the black claws on the end looking like they could impale him easy. Somehow the toes slid him between them however and carried him along towards the door and away from the End Table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder placed you on the Kitchen counter as he began to make something from a bunch of ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it healthy to eat at this hour?\" You say, kind of annoyed you roped yourself into now being tied to your Pops due to him feeling guilty about not spending much time with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it healthy to question a Dragon?\" He said without looking at you but wearing a genuine smile. You didn't reply. \"That was rhetorical, good answer.\" He said again. You nod and begin to ease into the act of falling asleep while sitting there, hoping to send signs you're about to retire, but planned to search for Matt. After a minute Cinder did indeed notice and scoffed. \"Now you're tired again, make up your mind kid!\". You smile wearily at him apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry pops, I guess I just had a burst of energy after you woke me up trying to screw dad.\" You say slyly, you probably should've kept that you knew that up your sleeve, but the reaction was worth it. Cinder straightened and turned red in the face and looked at you from the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you knew what I was doing...Um, sorry to catch you up in that son....\" He said while hurrying to get back to cooking. You hoped that comment would keep him from trying again tonight while Isaac was still up in his cheeks. You walked over and patted his hand that was on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night Pops, Love ya.\" He returned the gesture with a nod, still red, and as soon as you turned the corner you set off for Matt...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a quick thought you remembered the closest floor access was actually in the kitchen. The only problem was you wanted to keep Cinder thinking that you were in bed, so you would have to make it basically around the kitchen via counter top to get to the ladder. You huffed and rounded the corner back into the kitchen and dove behind the knife stand that was near the walkway. Upon looking around the stand you had to stifle back a laugh as Cinder had donned an apron you had ordered your dads for fathers day. It was a simple white one with bold black words that read 'Hi Hungry, I'm Dad.\" And the sight of this colossal dragon dancing around the kitchen in it was too surreal. You saw the fruit bowl nearby and were about to dart towards it when suddenly Ashfall came stumbling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shit!\" you cursed and slid back from view as Cinder looked up at his hungover spouse with raised eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sunshine, as in 3 in the morning, I figured you wouldn't stir til late afternoon tomorrow.\" Cinder said, tossing some red meat in a pan and starting the counter top stove, that'd be an obstacle for you soon. Ashfall grumbled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smell of food has a powerful effect on me, besides I know I need another, stronger drink for the weekend ahead.\" He said, stumbling to the freezer and pulling a bottle of whiskey from it. Cinder frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" He said crossing his arms. Ashfall pressed the cold bottle to his temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will has friends over this weekend, he was quite adamant about it, I couldn't dissuade him to keep them out, so I drink instead, and you don't drink so good luck, I know you don't like any human that isn't our little 'Squirt'\". Ashfall said wincing as he rolled the bottle on his head. Cinder huffed and Jets of flame flew from his nostrils, and threw his hands into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish someone would inform me when vermin are let loose in my house, you should have told me and I would've told him a big flat <i>no</i>\". He said, though his intimidation factor was largely diminished by the apron. Ashfall chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, he's always steamrolls you when he asks for something that I said no to.\" Ashfall said popping the top of the bottle and taking a swig. Cinder growled but then paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he has friends over....why was he asleep on your chest when I got home?\" Cinder said, going back to the stove and shaking the pan. Ashfall furrowed his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he? I don't remember him joining me on the sofa...huh, I'm assuming you woke him?\" Ashfall said, turning and digging in the fridge. Cinder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was about to get frisky with you..was kind of on top of you when he hollered at me and scared the shit outta me -\" Ashfall cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not, you were on top of me.\" Ash chortled. Cinder got frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha, Will made the same joke, You're both NOT funny...man he's becoming a human you. Anyway after that I retired to the shower and he was suddenly there too and wanted to join me, so i dunno what's going on.\" Cinder finished, this wasn't looking good, they were onto you. Ashfall continued the debate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like our lil' boy is just affectionate these days.\" Ashfall said bringing the bottle to his lips again but pausing. \"...Unless he's hiding something like friends over from you, and they were up to something.\" Ashfall said a little suspicious, and Cinder reacted to the tone with more temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If that's the case and they were up to something, he's grounded for a month, One for lying to me, and two for just having humans here without my consent.\" Cinder growled, you didn't expect him to hate the idea of you having friends here so much. Ashfall laughed and you took the chance to make it to the fruit bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So direct Cinder, but I know you'd soften after two days, I'm the stern dad remember? And you're the pushover, the muscles are just stuffed with sunshine and cuddles.\" Ashfall laughed again, and Cinder looked like he was about to choke slam him. Needless to say, you were able to dart from the fruit to a bread box on the counter, as much as you hated them bickering, you were making progress from it. Cinder growled through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about to change if Will thinks he can one up me with this Cats in the Cradle bullshit, 'I'm rarely around', Yeah Will because I've made enough to make sure you get a PHD four times over and your inheritance at age 30 will be enough to live off interest alone.\" Cinder said shaking his pan viciously. You blinked, did he really put that much away for you? You felt a wave of shame hit you, Ashfall came to the rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill big guy, he doesn't see what you're doing for him, so don't hold it against him, he's still a kid, and I know he loves you like a true father, the 'Cats in the Cradle' thing wasn't a fake act I think, he probably does want to be with you, you're quite the inspirational figure.\" Ashfall said walking over and tapping the muscled drake on the ass, sending it jiggling for a second. Cinder took a deep breath and nodded as Ashfall continued. \" I'm taking a bath and then going to bed, if you still are frustrated by then, then pound it out on my ass.\" Ashfall said smacking his own rear, you gagged as Cinder gave him a mischievous smile, gross. You were about to dart for a spatula canister, but froze in thought, did dad say Bath? Oh. Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sat suspended between the big and long toe of Cinder, his hands and feet pressed into the calloused flesh to prevent sinking between the digits. The Goliath was stuck in conversation above, but Matt was too worried about himself to worry about the words above. However, whatever the conversation was seemed to aggravate the large lizard and Cinder stomped, sending Matt tumbling into the air while Cinder continued walking forward a bit. Matt closed his eyes and accepted that this time he wouldn't survive the fall. However the rustle of cloth brought him back as he was enveloped in canvas darkness and hit a soft but firm bottom of what felt like a hammock, where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis shivered in his damp clothes, worried he would get hypothermia if something didn't change soon. It felt like ages since Will had come to his aid, and Travis couldn't help to think that instead of saving him, Will had doomed him to freeze in this desert of a bathtub. Footsteps sounded and Travis perked up. Did Will tell Cinder about him and they were coming to save him? Travis stood up only to see Ashfall stumble in, and not with Will in his hand but a whiskey bottle. The Drake introduced himself with a belch and came to the tub, but not before Travis hid himself as the Drake leaned in and plugged the stopper and started the water, muttering something about fixing that water heater. Travis held completely still, afraid he'd just end up eaten by these inhuman monsters. He peaked over the soap bar he used as cover to see the Gray Drake slip out of his Tightey Whities, exposing his junk to the small room before almost falling into the counter in his stupor, preparing for a bath, god Will, hurry up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was shaken up by a quiver earlier and ever since then Cinders was becoming more aware of his presence... which led to Isaac being shifted and squeezed by the powerful muscle groups surrounding him. Whatever, he was close to reaching this god's sphincter, and when he reached it he would cause such pleasure that Cinder would keep him forever, maybe even replace Will for him, a WILLING servant, not bound by modern societies requirements. Isaac squirmed, fighting the contortions of Cinders ass, and wiggled even further, his destination near...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Cinder scratched at his rear, Isaac obviously was getting deep in there and sooner or later a hand would investigate. You weren't worried, if Isaac was extracted you would intervene but for right now Matt was on the top of your list. You were about to stop watching your Pops when suddenly he turned back towards you and you noticed a lump in the pocket that hung on front of the Apron, was it a lump of lint or....then it started moving like a human form. Again, Oh Shit. How the hell did Matt end up there? What was worse was you knew there just happened to be a tear in the pocket, so Cinder's dick could share the space with Matt in any moment. Great. Taking a deep breath you decided how to board S.S. Cinder....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You got into a sprinters crouch, ready to rush for the Drake as soon as he leaned over the counter for something in the cupboards above. You got lucky as pretty much right after you got ready, he walked over and opened the cupboard, reaching for a measuring cup. You sprinted across the marble counter and jumped, aiming for the pouch that was slightly open on his Apron. You made impact slightly above the lip, but it was taut against Cinder so you also hit his stomach, causing him to grunt and you to bounce off the muscled abdomen. You threw out a hand and managed to still grab the lip of the pouch, but your heart was definitely in your chest, Sure there was the mat below the counter, but also a pair of unaware Dragon feet stomping around. Cinder brushed a hand where you had hit him without looking down, smoothing out the sensation the contact probably left him as he turned back to whatever he was working on. You pulled yourself up and over the lip and slid down into the dim canvas pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt\" You said in a quiet shout, on your descent you passed the tear in the canvas and got a good peek at Cinder's family jewels, though as you slid you noticed the tear itself was pretty clean. You hoped that didn't mean your dads made it for naughty reasons, you didn't get them this for those kind of cakes. A reply below and to your left answered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Will? Dude is that really you?\" He said surprised and relieved. you made it to the bottom and walked precariously towards his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah its me, how the Hell did you end up in here?\" You said. \"Like I was about to go on the floor only to see your outline in Cinders Apron.\" Matt made a confused sign as he came into sight between the canvas walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in an apron right now? What kind of fairy tale shit is that? Getting Jack and the Beanstalk vibes here. How do we get out?\" He said. You opened your mouth to answer but actually thought the plan all the way through, oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I actually haven't gotten that far yet, but here's the run down. We are in a pocket that's like, right in front of his junk, and its pretty much painted on him. As far as I know Isaac is still up Pops Ass crack. And Travis may be discovered soon by my dad who is about to take a bath where I left Travis on the soap dish.\" You said shrugging. \"I think the only solution is to give up and surrender, better save all of you and take a lifetime grounding then end up with three corpses.\" You said honestly, this was out of your league and you knew it, it was a good go though. Matt and you worked more to the center of the pouch and he replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's okay, I'm sorry Will that Isaac caused all this, fuck that guy\" You nodded in agreement, but paused as a sliding sound right above you two came closer. You ready yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he heard or felt us and he's reaching in, be re-\" Instead of finger tips, Cinders snake of a cock had slithered its way through the tear, its winking slit angled right for you, a worst case scenario. You dive out of the way, taking strings and lint into your mouth as you fell. You sputtered and turned to see The flacid member withdraw a bit, and with Matts kicking feet hanging from the slit. The stimulation caused Cinder to grow a little, the cock head emerging more from the foreskin as the Drake clenched, the motions pulling Matt deeper into slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO\" You downright shout just as Cinder conveniently turns on a blender outside, grumbling about 'scratchy aprons'. You stand up and grab onto Matts legs and pull him out a little. Coming out is apparently more irritating than going in for a Drake as Cinders hand came up behind you through the apron and smashed you into his junk, your vision nothing but loose skin and canvas as you lose your grip on Matt, and finally you drop back into the pocket next to the white phallus, Matt no longer a set of dangling legs but a lump moving up the dicks underbelly towards Cinder's body. Pops let out a content sigh, unaware he just ate a human with his penis. You had heard rumors Drakes were capable anatomically of this feat, but seeing it occur, and to a friend, just made you absolutely terrified of the unconscious power of your parents. Cinder shuffled and extracted his cock from the pocket, leaving you alone. You stood up and threw your hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY POPS, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN NEXT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis lay completely still as the drunken Drake eased himself into the tub, grumbling under his breath: \"The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon...\". Travis wasn't sure when but the Dragon had added bubble bath formula and sudsy mountains shook as this Goliath slid between them. When he got in place Ashfall took another swig from the bottle he still had with him. The drake grunted and the sound of bubbles could be heard from where is ass was in the tub, gross. Travis peeked over the soap to see the Dragon had his eyes closed as he soaked. Should he try to get his attention? And if so how? He couldn't wait on Will, he had to do something for himself, and if Will doesn't talk to him after this that's fine, this friendship was golden but not worth dying for, he was sure Will would see where he came from on this. The Drakes current posture was his head resting against the tile wall, arms propped on the tub lip, and his tail emerged from the water near his feet and its tip hung over the tub lip as well. The drake suddenly continued his slurred song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...When you coming home dad? I don't know when...\" He said followed by a snore. Travis had two options, climb the Drakes exposed chest and contact him, or use the tail tip to climb out of the tub, both required quite the swim. With deep breath Travis dove off the soapdish to the hot water below. Ashfall continued his solo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you coming home, son? I don't know when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac survived a series of more violent clenches, mainly because they seemed to be directed at something else and not his presence, but it didn't matter what, Isaac had reached what he had sought. In the inky blackness, heat radiated from a puckered orifice larger than Isaac, and the teen sent a questing hand over the folds and ridges of the soft flesh of Cinders anus. The cooler hands caused the hot skin and muscle to twitch and shy away from his touch, but unconsciously and not to the complete awareness of the orange Drake. His glamour was flaring, Isaac wanted nothing but to wriggle into the dragon and be with him forever, giving his fleeting life so that this being should have some small pleasure from it. But a small part of him still screamed that this was wrong, and that he needed to get away from here as fast as possible. Hands probed the sphincter and eventually found its center, Isaac slipped his hands into it with ease, but as his arms started going and opening the entry slightly the entirety of Cinder quivered in response and with a violent clench Isaac was sucked into the anus with such force he didn't get a chance to make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt whimpered as he slid through a narrow tube, having no idea what was going on. The air was thin and here and he was having trouble telling when he was conscious and when he wasn't. After a minute of slow squelching, his head emerged in a opening, and soon his hands joined him, he felt around blindly, but it felt like he was being suspended over some empty space, was it Cinder's stomach? His legs weren't far behind and he was sent tumbling threw the air before landing in a hot gooey substance with a wet splat. He sputtered and felt around, slowly sinking in the material, as he tried to right himself some got in his mouth, and it tasted extremely salty. Matt froze for just one second before going ballistic, thrashing about trying to find some way to get out, he didn't care how. Anybody that experienced what Matt just did could deduce the probability that they were in a dragons testicle, and Matt didn't take it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder had been rubbing at his junk, trying to get the thread or whatever that was lodged in his piss slit free and just as he thought he had it, it felt like his asshole was being poked by something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the he-\" he managed before a weight in his left nut appeared, bringing pain and pure ecstasy, making the large drake to gasp and drop to his hands in knees. His subconscious response caused him to clench with all his might and that caused whatever had been poking his anus to be pulled into it, leading to more pleasure, his member was hard in less than ten seconds as he just gasped on the floor. He broke into a sweat that no workout could manage on him, what the hell was all this??? His balls moved on their own as something was inside them, an otherworldly feeling, and though he couldn't see them due to the apron, he knew the movements of whatever it was could be seen through the skin slightly. He stammered to his feet, causing the walls of his rectum to alert him to a foreign entity their as well, what the fuck was going on!? Grunting in pain and pleasure as he limped to the bedroom and then the master bath where Ashfall slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tossed around the apron pouch as your father dropped to his knees, obviously feeling Matts abduction now, and by the panting it was quite an exhausting assault on his body. He got up and began walking somewhere in a hurried state, and suddenly the apron was ripped off and thrown somewhere, taking you with it. It landed after a short flight and you crawled out to see you were on your parents bed. Through the bathroom door you could see Cinder shaking Ashfall, who was passed out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up you bum!\" Cinder said frantically, cupping himself with his free hand. After a second more Cinder cursed and wobbled back into the Master, but you had moved and taken a bridge to the End table/ your room. You stood there like you'd been there since he came in. Cinder didn't see you and slid onto the bed, his head propped up on the backboard as his hands cupped is balls. He slid his legs up so his knees were in the air. You..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cinder moaned and groaned like he was about to give birth, he rubbed at his large ball sack carefully and lovingly. \"Don't worry Will, I'll get you out soon ...\" He said in a hushed tone. You walked up the bridge that connected the End table to the master bed and stopped at the side of Cinder before speaking with an oblivious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me out from where, Pops?\" The Drake let out a garbled mess of curses as he flinched away from your voice, he seemed to think he had captured you. He blinked and his eyes went through a series of motions, Fear, relief, confusion, and then anger. He sat up gingerly and picked you up in a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have friends over Squirt? What is up with you tonight?\". He said, a growl slipping under his words and you couldn't help but worry that you may be in trouble big time no matter how all this went down. But for some reason your teenage mind refused to divulge the truth. So you shrugged and did real well hiding the panic and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had friends over, yeah and then they left. As for whats with me I thought I told you, I've missed you and its goo d that you'll be home a while.\" You said, it wasn't a complete lie, you had friends over, and now they were all over. Cinder didn't seem to accept that but tackled it differently, waving his other free hand at his mammoth privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The who the fuck is in my balls, Will? And why do I have a literal gut feeling that someone is in my ass.\" He said not hiding a growl anymore, pure rage building. You genuinely shied away from him, squatting down and turning your shoulder a bit in a submissive gesture. When Pops got mad, he got mad. You thought for a second, and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're not imagining things Pops? I mean you have been stressed from work recently and I kind of cock blocked you with Dad, maybe its your body wanting a release.\" You say meekly, Cinder cooling off quickly when he saw he was genuinely scaring you. He sighed, letting his head fall against the backboard of the bed, and his hand settled back on the bed, you didn't move yet though, you weren't dismissed from this scolding, running would criminalize you now so you stayed in his beefy palm. His other hand rubbed his lower stomach absently as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...Maybe, I haven't felt any thrashing for awhile, and a human takes days to digest in a scrotum..\" He winced and looked at you who had gone green. \"er sorry, too much detail, I look at you as a Dragon and not a human Will, but it doesn't excuse me from showing little care in the value of your kind. I'm sorry. All in all I think I may need a release so...if you don't mind Will could you gimme 10?\" He said not looking at you, and you turned red in the face. You knew your parents screwed and jerked it, but their draconic bluntness left little to be imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah sure uh...I'll be in my room, just knock when you're done..\" You say turning to go but the hand closed on you and reopened for you to be face to face with CInder, his hot breath ruffling your hair and clothes as his lips bunched and gave you a full body kiss, it was a dry kiss and you smiled but had to keep up the rebellious teen look. \"Ugh Pops gross.\" You said but patted his upper lip gently before he set you down on the end table and winked at you. You nodded and went back in your bedroom and immediately grabbed your phone and called Matt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had tired himself out, the gooey semen was like wet concrete, and thrashing around had only coated him in it and made his muscles scream in pain. So he had fallen over, drifting on top of the pool and not sure really if he was awake or not in the inky darkness. The darkness lasted until a vibratin sound could be heard and his pocket lit up, blinding him for a second as he just looked at it dumbfounded, he had his phone on him the whole time??He fished it from his damp pocket and stared at the caller ID, it was Will! He wiped some goop off his ear and answered. \"W-Will?.\" Will let out a sigh on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thank god you're alive Matt, I thought you had been digested, are you ok? Can you breath?\" Will said frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can, am I really in your old man's nut sack Will? Is this actually a thing that's happening to me?\" He said, panic setting in on the edge of his words. Will replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah you are, I knew it was possible for this to happen, but you never hear about it because it's like super taboo in today's society, Dragons don't want humans to know they can consume people in that kind of manner, it just adds to the fear factor. Ya know, on top of being like as big as a skyscraper and breathing fire and all that. But it never dawned on me my father's could do it too, I always held them apart from other Dragons, I'm sorry Matt I should've been more direct with Isaac.\" He said and paused, then continued. \"But right now I need you to remain calm, my Pops is about to Jerk it and I think you'll come right on out, so hold in there you'll hopefully be out in a couple minutes.\" Will said and hung up. Matt pulled the phone from his ear and looked at it, a few strands of gunk coming from him and dripping off it. Yeah that's well and good Will, but he wasn't going off a 'hopefully get out'. Matt was gonna get some EMT's to come up in here and slice him out of this Dragons nuts. He began to dial 911 but he was suddenly thrown around, his phone slipping from his hand and sinking into the pool of sperm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Matt shouted, trying to dive for it but the thrashing and bouncing of the testicles became more intense throwing him back and forth across the small pocket...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder bit his lower lip as he beat his meat with intensity. Perhaps Will was right and he just needed a release, but if some human comes dribbling out of his cock it wouldn't surprise him. It had been centuries but back in the day Cinder had devoured a fair few humans with his dick, Ashfall too, and he knew the sensation of one in his balls, but maybe it was just a ghost of the past. He clenched his cheeks as he neared climax, lightly bucking his hips in the process....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was miserable. He had thought he would experience pleasure and be rewarded for his efforts, not be squeezed by searing hot walls that didn't smell the best and tried to break his bones with their completely random convulsions. He hadn't gotten far inside, so he was certain if he survived until Cinder fell asleep, he could slip back out and just stick to the outside of the Dragon. Another clench locked his arms to his side and Isaac groaned, this was not as great as the glamour had told him it would be, ignoring the fact he had kind of creamed his pants anyway already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis treaded water, the snore of Ashfall like a foghorn within the drifting soap bergs. He had known where he was going, but Cinder had shown up and Travis had dived to avoid being seen, when he had resurfaced, he had gotten turned around, his arms were starting to ache but he continued when suddenly the water rippled as Ashfall stirred from his slumber, waves washed Travis in a direction and suddenly a soft surface rose beneath him and he dropped prone to keep from tumbling off as the waters surface disappeared from sight. Travis blinked and looked around only to realize out of all places he could have ended up he was on the base of Ashfalls dick, the member swaying as the Drake slipped from the bath and halfheartedly dried himself off, the booze still heavy in his blood. He proceeded to walk to the bedroom, unaware of is passenger, but stopped in the doorway. Travis looked up to see what he watched, and couldn't help to take interest as well. Will's Pops was going to town on his cock, his eyes closed in concentration and all his muscles tensing in erotic poses. Travis got pretty turned on ,and so did Ashfall, as the gray drakes golden cock grew to the size of a human bus. Travis just shook his head in disbelief, how did such giants exist. A moan brought his attention back to Cinder, who had finished and shot ropes out of his cock that arched across the room, painting the bed and even the dresser on the far wall. Damn....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rocketed back up the length of Cinder, his face in a wordless scream as cool air met him outside the cock head as he flew, the wind ripping in his ears and burning his eyes. From what he could see, he was heading towards a dresser, and figured he was about to add a red finish to the varnish, but rather he was angled just perfect enough to slip into a slightly ajar drawer on the top, and he landed with a soft thud in what seemed to be an underwear drawer. He sat up and realized he was in a pair of bikini briefs, and the waistband had the words 'Cinder Blackclaw' Scribbled in sharpie. With a name like William Ashfall Blackclaw, Matt wondered how they ever thought Will had human parents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had dialed both Travis and Isaac after you got off with Matt, but Travis's phone rang on the futon, and Isaac didn't pick up. You couldn't tell if Cinder was done yet, as when they made your End Table, they had lined its interior with acoustic paneling, so you didn't wake them when 'you play video games', being older now you knew it was so they didn't wake you when they were having a good time. You walked out and climbed to the top of the table, just as Cinder climaxed and you winced, you didn't need to see him do that. You saw something dark shoot from his cock though and fly across the room to the dresser, it was hard to tell from the distance, but he seemed to fall into Cinders underwear drawer. At least he was away from you father's for now. You were about to set off for the dresser when you noticed dad in the bathroom doorway at full mast, and as if on cue he worked his way towards Cinder, who was still panting on the bed. You rolled your eyes until something at the base of Ashfalls cock caught your attention, was that...Travis? Oh hell... </span></div></div>",

You leaped over wrinkles in the bed sheet and scaled Cinders side with a well practiced stride, using the divets and small bumps in his thick hide as hand holds. In less than 20 seconds you were digging your heels into his right pectoral that was rising and falling as he took in deep breaths while his afterglow faded. You sat down on the large muscle, steam radiating from the hot flesh and reminded you of sitting in a sauna. You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get that out of your system...literally?\" You say with a small smile. Your Pops inclined his head and opened his dull eyes, fixing their golden gaze on you, and he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you were right squirt, I guess I needed the release more than I had assumed.\" He said, his gaze shifting to look past you and you turned to see Ashfall staring at you frowning. The Gray drake slid onto the foot of the bed as he began to sober and go soft, the speck of Travis still clung to the base of his shaft. He blinked and scoffed, standing back up and going to the dresser where Matt had gone. He stuck a hand in the dresser and whipped out a light blue bikini brief and tossed it, causing it to land on Cinders exposed groin and the orange drake to scoff at him. Ashfall then walked to his dresser and pulled out a pair of red boxer briefs and slid into them, you watch in distress as Travis disappeared into the cotton/spandex of them, and Ashfall spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinder need I remind you to keep some decency around our son, he doesn't need to see your dong to know you're a dude and that you're 'alpha' around here, though I contest that.\" Ashfall said. Then he turned and locked onto you on his lovers chest, his eyes turned cold, and you knew he was engaging his parenting mode...\"As for you Will, answer me truthfully, you'll have one shot at this. If I find out you lie <i>I'm</i> going to ground you, the sentence of grounding will vary depending on the gravity of the offense. Now spill the beans. What is going on.\" He said without breaking eye contact. You held completely still, as did Cinder, the rise and fall of his chest had come to a standstill and you felt his stare, though it was warmer, on your back. You looked visibly confused for a second, causing Cinder to twitch his tail that ran alongside him, but Ashfall had a stronger mental game, if he was wavering he didn't show. He did play a lot of poker after all. You open your mouth...</span></div></div>",

Ashfall inclined his chin and tilted his head a little. Cinder didn't say anything, but his breath picked up again, indicating he wanted to say something but not wanting to interrupt Ashfall. Ashfall spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where are they now?\" He said slowly. You told them to the best of your ability, and that seemed to finally break the mold. Cinder of course tensed up, and stopped breathing. You turned and looked back at him to see him staring at the wall, his eyes wide and his lips pursed. You turned to see Ashfall had crossed his arms and with a surprised look, glancing at his bulge in the front of his boxer briefs, he looked back up slowly at you with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see, and you didn't tell us right away because...?\" You didn't reply and he continued. \"...because you were afraid you wouldn't be granted the chance to have friends over again.

Cinder just nodded, not saying anything and just letting all his muscles relax. You put your head in your hands, this was gonna be so bad of a punishment, but at least the plight of your friends was coming to an end. Ashfall slipped his hand into the boxers and stuck his tongue out of the side of his mouth, it would've been funny if given a different scenario, and he withdrew a scared shitless Travis between his thumb and forefinger. He sighed and let his boxer briefs close before walking to the End table, dropping Travis carefully on its top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go inside, get your things, and wait for us to retrieve you, DO. NOT. LEAVE.\" Ashfall said, Travis let out a squeal and ran into the End Table. You got up to go in there but a finger came out of nowhere and smooshed you into Cinder's chest. You look up from your pinned state to see the most anger in Ashfall you had ever seen, even Cinder seemed to lean away from the menacing aura he emitted. Ashfall spoke through clenched fangs. \"You stay right where you are William Ashfall-Blackclaw, you've done enough, now wait your turn.\" He said, sliding you into the deep groove between Cinders pectoral groups, your Pops breath flew down the groove, blasting you with hot air. Ashfall stood straight and began digging in Cinders underwear drawer, and as he did Cinder moved a hand to the bunched up brief that was covering his junk. He picked it up and shook it, and a seed covered Matt fell from it, strands still bridging between him and it as he tumbled and landed on Cinders thigh with a wet sounding plop, sending ra ripple through the large leg muscle. Cinder just stared in disbelief and then looked at you with the look of betrayal and embarrassment, and out of everything that had occurred, that look hurt you the most. Ashfall turned to around and saw Cinders face, then let his vision drift to the dark spot on his husbands thigh before grunting and coming over and plucking up the human, only to reel and drop him back to where he picked him up. Ashfall looked closer at Matt, who shivered and tried to get as small as he could, not wanting to accept the warmth from Cinder but doing so just to warm up. Ashfall gave you a look that told you punishment was gonna be even worse now. he spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And here I thought this Isaac fellow was in the worst predicament, but you didn't tell me or Cinder when this Matt guy was eaten? Do you realize how he could've been dissolved to fuel sperm production? There would be no indication of his existence Will, if he had spent a couple of hours in Cinder, he'd surely be gone. And if by some sliver it did get routed back to Cinder that he had  consumed Matt that way, Cinder would be tried for murder and innumerable other things, you were in big trouble, now you're in a whole new level of punishment. I'm gonna clean him up, you two stay put.\" Ashfall said scooping up Matt gingerly and going into the bathroom, turning on the sink. You sat in silence, as did Cinder, but only for a few seconds as Cinder started to chuckle, which got a lare from Ashfall in the bathroom, Cinder spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'm sorry, this is just funny, like some kind of bad movie. Ah Squirt, I'm disappointed but also a little proud of you. You beguiled me fairly well, and did well for the past hour keeping your friends safe. It was reckless and stupid, but in your own way you acted like a dragon, with all the stubbornness and boorishness of me and Ash, sure I could've ended up a murderer, or at least commiting involuntary manslaughter,  but I didn't. While we wait, why don't you give me the full rundown of EVERYTHING that happened and maybe if it makes sense I'll make Ash see that.\" He said looking down at you between his pecs. Your heart skipped a beat and did just that, starting with how Isaac insisted and how you tried to keep them in check, only for how everything went wrong. Cinder listened without saying anything, and in the end came to your conclusion about Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dragon glamour is a hell of a thing, you've been exposed since you were a toddler, so you are immune and may even be able to emit your own, but very, VERY, subtly. Isaac is of course the problem here. I agree with Ashfall, no friends allowed over anymore, and we will have a long talk with this Isaac guy once we get him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't ya...you know, push him out?\" You say wincing. Cinder chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could, but my contractions may turn him into a paste, so better to stay relaxed and let Ashfall fish him out of me. You'll probably have to watch as a lesson, I dunno how Ashfall thinks and I've been with him for two hundred years.\" He said and looked back towards the bathroom at Ashfall who came back and said the same thing to Matt as he put him on the end table. Matt nodded, doing well for what he had gone through, and walked to the back bridge that led inside the table. Ashfall rose his brows at the human in an approving way and as soon as Matt was inside, Ashfall spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If anyone is ever allowed back, that will one will be the one, he's strong. That is if HE wants to come back.\" Ashfall said as he plucked you off Cinders chest and told the orange drake to flip over. The beefy drake obliged and Ashfall settled on the bed between the legs of Cinder. You couldn't help but stare at the mountains that were Cinders ass cheeks, the prison in which Isaac was in. You expected to be put to the side but your dad just held you in front of him, towards Cinders relaxed rump, his tail draped off the side of the bed. After a moment you shuffled uncomfortably in Ashfalls palm and looked up at him, where he was staring down with an unimpressed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...are you gonna get him out?\" You say getting tired of the waiting game. Ashfall chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh Will, no, I'm not getting him out.\" He lifted his other palm to be level with the one holding you, and in it was dragon dental floss and a human headlamp. \"You're going in to get him.\" He said sliding you into that palm. You just stared at him dumbfounded, Cinder looked back at the two of you and laughed a hearty laugh, obviously the twist was funny to him. You didn't move and Ashfall continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C'mon Will its obvious, it'd be very tricky not to crush Isaac in my fingertips if I try to pull him out. You however can slip right in there and grab hold of him. We'll tie some floss around you and pull you out once you give it a tug five times. Don't worry I imagine its pretty roomy in there, it can support me after all.\" He said winking at Cinder who let out another chuckle, you just retched a bit. With shaky legs you walked over and tied some floss through your Jean belt loops and put the head lamp on before nodding up at Ashfall. He pulled some more floss out until he had about a foot or two and tore it off, he tested it by lifting you with it and held you suspended for a few seconds before slipping the other end between his lips to free his hands up, leaving you hanging over a giant orange dragon ass. Ashfall pressed his hands into the cheeks and pried them apart, tons of flesh separated and eventually exposed your fathers white relaxed hole, as you were lowered towards it Cinder let out another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon Voyage, Squirt!\" And flexed his hole like it was blowing a kiss. Ashfall chuckled between his pressed lips, and soon your outstretched palms and feet made contact with the hot squishy flesh. You settled your full weight on it and looked back up at your dad with his body looming over you, he let the floss slip from his mouth and it draped itself on the bed spread and lead up to your location. He looked down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish what you started.\" He said, and you hung your head and placed a hand into the center of the sphincter and sank in with no resistance. You could only imagine the willpower Cinder was exerting not to clench on you, but you didn't want to trust he could hold back so you quickly wriggled your way into him, entering a dark, narrow passage way that didn't smell too nice....With a gag, you flipped on your head lamp and crawled past the slime drenched walls in search of your 'friend'...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You crawled across the hot floor, the walls ripple and undulate around you, and you swore any second they would swell and smash you to bits. You were pretty sure the amount of willpower Cinder was exerting to not squeeze you was an enormous amount. Your thoughts were interrupted when your head lamp caught something white ahead in its beam, it looked like a sock. You crawled a little further and sure enough Isaac was laying prone, his arms gliding absently across the floor and mumbling something to himself. His skin looked reddish from heat and his clothes were dampened with the slimy lubricant that seemed to ooze from the walls. He showed no indication that he knew you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac!\" You shouted with a bit of frustration, your voice sounded muffled but still echoed up your fathers colon. Isaac slid up and looked at you, his look was primal and his eyes had a golden glint in the light. He was full blown drunk on glamour, and he wasn't about to share this space with you. With no response he leaped into the air towards you. Oh Fuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cinder drummed his fingers on the pillow, and rested his chin in his palm, still in the prone position on his belly on the bed. Ashfall had gotten up and was organizing Cinders clothes drawers, obviously trying to divert his rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Cinder said cautiously. \"You lied to Will about the whole digestion thing, you know that right?\" Cinder said, absently focusing on the feeling of his kid in his bum. Ashfall sniffled and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and it sure as fuck scared him. I know it takes around two weeks in reality to dissolve a human in a dragons nuts, so even if that kid was in there for the night he'd get out with some blisters and that would be it. I think I'm gonna need to pull some dragon charm out of my ass and alter their memories a bit.\" He said, closing up the drawer and laying down on the bed next Cinder on his back, looking at the ceiling. Cinder chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we're gonna have to Men in Black them alright. I still love that you are making Will get Isaac, I'm gonna tease him about this for the rest of his life.\" Cinder said, lightly shaking his hips and shifting his glutes. Ashfall smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its not gonna stop there, Wills punishment is gonna last for months, and before you say it no, I won't let up. Your little 'squirt' is gonna probably forsake these guys due to the humiliation ahead of him.\" Ashfall gloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty harsh , Ash, I-\" Cinder was about to retort, but a sudden jab in his rectum wall nearly made him clench up and he had to turn all attention to his reflexes so he didn't smother Will to death. Ashfall rose a brow at Cinder and he bit his lip before answering the questioning expression. \"....I think he found the Isaac guy, and I'm pretty sure they're wrestling....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dodged the rabid human you knew as Isaac and he smashed into the rectum wall, causing the walls to stiffen and a groan reverberated throughout Cinder. Isaac recovered and reeled on you, but you kept the Headlamp light in his eyes. When he dove for you again you pulled the floss up that was still around your waist and crouched, and then wrapped your arms around his waist and used his momentum to pick him up and slam him to the ground. He thrashed wildly and cursed as you quickly used the floss to tie him up. You panted heavily, not recuperating well in the stale air of Cinders ass, and tugged on the floss five times and waited. Sure enough you and Isaac began to be pulled back through the pitch blackness, back towards the rear end of your Pops. Isaac spoke suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Will! Why didn't you leave me! I deserve to be here! I NEED to be here! This god needs me! He deserves me, not someone who looks at him like a regular dad like you do! He needs to be worshiped, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the Fuck up Isaac\" You say and take the headlamp, striking it across the back of his head and effectively knocking him out. Sweet relief. After a minute you were pulled against the winking orifice that was the inside of the anus and Isaac's limp form slid out with a quiet pop first. You began to climb through your Pops hole and winced in the living room light and air, you hanging out by your waist. You took in the sight of Ashfall pinching the unconcious Isaac between his fingers and cutting the floss between you and him. Cinder seemed to be using his hands to keep his cheeks open, as Ashfall had both hands free, turning Isaac in them and then glancing at you with a look of questioning. You tried to wriggle out of the sphincter but you felt it tense and hold you there, keeping you only halfway out. You frowned, thinking Pops was fucking with you, until Ashfall began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to knock him out? Is he that far into glamour?\" Ashfall said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only expected, I do have a mesmerizing ass. Good job putting that little shit in his place Will.\" Cinder said, his voice distant. You tried again to pull yourself out but Cinder wasn't relenting, okay then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he jumped me, I dunno what to do about that though.\" You said, digging your hands into the soft flesh around the anus and pushing, but the sphincter clenched even more and even pulled you back in up to your chest and that made you let out a gasp. Cinder shuddered and you punched at the puffy hide around you, leading to him chuckling. Ashfall looked down at you somberly, watching you struggle in his mates hole before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take it from here Will, you start on your punishment.\" He said and you paled as his index finger came into view and patted your head before pressing you back into Cinder, you scream in terror as the squishy walls enclose around you and caress you back into you Pops bowels, sloshing you back and forth as Cinder toyed with you. You pushed back in defiance, but Cinder had unfathomable control of his rectal walls and countered your resistance. You soon gave up and let him move you around, experiencing humiliation on a level you never thought existed. No longer feeling you fight back, Cinder tapered off a bit, but the occasional bowel shift would occur as if he was making sure you were still there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww...he's done fighting me already.\" Cinder said somberly. Ashfall tried not to laugh but his anger broke and he let out a hearty chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think you were against the idea of doing this to him and then getting sad he stopped fighting back. Once again, hes a smart kid, he knows he can't beat you.\" Ashfall said as he walked over to Cinders dresser and pulled out a pair of sweatpants and a tank top and threw it on the bed next to the orange drake who was still chuckling to himself and lightly clenching his cheeks antagonizing Will. He looked at the clothes and looked at Ashfall strangely. Ashfall rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n\"We're gonna wipe this night outta the kids heads and take them home. You obviously need to have clothes on dumbass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder scoffed. \"Yeah yeah, whatever. I'm down with getting these pests out soon as possible. Should I get Will out?\" Ashfall thought and then shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah leave him in ya for now, we'll get him out when we get home. Then his month of grounding begins.\" The gray drake said, slipping on a t-shirt and some basketball shorts that were a little tight on his own ass. Cinder slid off the bed, rubbing at his rear before grabbing the blue bikini brief from before and slipping into it before donning the clothes quickly. Ashfall collected the unconcious Isaac and knocked on the End Table... </span></div></div>",

Ashfall sat on the edge of the bed, his tail wrapping around him and draping across his lap. Cinder just stood there, his arms crossed and scowling, trying to keep up the badass 'hates humans' act. Travis got even smaller and hid more behind Matt when he noticed the orange drake in such a fashion, making Ashfall smile, but he quickly dropped it. He spoke to the teenagers in a parental tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this night is totally FUBAR for you guys, so me and Cinder here have decided to send you back home, I'm sure you understand why.\" Ashfall said, Matt nodded to him and Travis didn't reply, just staring at the Gray drake like he was a monster that'd eat him any second. Ashfall continued. \"To avoid you all from developing a form of PTSD, I'm gonna alter your memories in a fashion, so that you remember all this as a simple sleepover and you never encountered me or Cinder here throughout the night, then you're gonna go to sleep and head home in the morning, which is soon. I'm sure you know about the human subway that runs through the curb outside our house, you'll take that back to your district.\" Ashfall said, setting unconscious Isaac on the table near them. Travis gasped and shied away from his friend, and Matt looked at Isaac with a form of grim satisfaction. \"Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up, but didn't meet Ashfalls eyes directly, Smart, and spoke. \"What did you do with Will?\" He said. Cinder shuffled slightly and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your concern, just know he has to face punishment for failing to keep you all in check. He's not hurt, only his pride is going to take damage.\" Cinder said. Matt looked at him, then back at Ashfall, still not meeting their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't want to forget, despite all I've been through, I don't wanna forget what me and the others have sentenced Will to, whatever that may be. I won't tell anyone what happened to me and the others. I also don't won't to forget the fantastic creatures that are you two are.\" He said somberly and defeated, knowing his response would most likely not change the outcome. Cinder glanced at Ashfall with his brows raised and Ashfall winked at him. In the end they did want Will to have A friend, and this Matt fellow would be allowed over when all of this was over. Ashfall answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately we can't afford the risk Matt, I hope you understand. Take comfort though that me and Cinder are pleased with the flattery and acknowledgement that Wills punishment stems from your actions. When all the smoke clears, though you won't remember, we will welcome you back here.\" Ashfall said then nodded at Cinder, who returned the gesture and walked up to the table. Travis stumbled back while Matt stood firm. Cinder growled at the cowardly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still vermin, or I will turn you into a source of protein\" He said. The human did, shaking like a leaf as Cinder put the tip of his Index finger on top of his head and his other index on Matts head gently. The Drake closed his eyes and a faint glow radiated between his fingertip and the humans, and after a second they collapsed gently, Cinder moving his fingers gracefully they draped over the digits rather than hitting the ground. He opened the drawer, pulling Wills room into the open and settled Matt on the Futon and Travis on a recliner, then closed the drawer gingerly. He turned to Ashfall, looking like the manual use of his glamour had drained him considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said we were taking them home like, now.\" He said sounding out of breath. Ashfall smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I remembered we haven't enchanted a human in like 50 years, all the way back at that party where he had been stuck up in an orgy and traded so many orifices that he was just a drooling mess. Me and you are gonna need a little rest as well.\" He said turning to the unconscious Isaac, Ashfall would only do him because the teen was highly afflicted by both his and Cinders glamour, and he'd have to remove the build up and then alter his memories. Cinder snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember YOU fixing him, I was completely content to let him slowly drown in drool and spunk. How are you the hardest and softest in this relationship?\" He said laughing at his spouse. Ashfall narrowed his gaze at the big drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you in the middle of cooking something when I last saw you?\" Ashfall said smugly. Cinder went to answer, then clamped his mouth shut and ran out of the room cursing. Ashfall just shook his head and began working on Isaac, a long and arduous process...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still being absently moved around by your Pops bowels, he was subconsciously taking pleasure from this, and in your jeans you were as well, much to your dismay. You just hope they just isolate you to your room besides dinner and school for a month or something, and this would be the worst.  The walls tightened and shifted, rolling you around in a not to comfortable fashion as you assumed Cinder moved somewhere quickly, this would be long rest of the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall finished, panting slightly from how much he had to alter, and not sure if the teen would be completely the same when he woke up. He opened the drawer and deposited the human on Wills bed before closing it up. He reached around back and locked the door on the back of the table, and then took a shirt from Cinders gym bag and draped it over the front so if they woke up they wouldn't be able to look out the window. Cinder came back in and, both exhausted, the Drakes turned in, leaving their son where he was for the next couple hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they awoke about 8:30 in the morning and Ashfall dug a elbow into Cinders chest. \"Hey, wake up and take a shower mate, and fish Will out, I know you can manage to get him out without my help.\" He said groggily. Cinder groaned and rolled out of the bed, speaking as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know the whole 'we'd squish him'  thing was a joke, we're way more dexterous than we let on. Alright lemme get him out.\" He said, stripping and walking into the bathroom. He turned on the shower, and stood there waiting for it to warm up, he really needed to fix that water heater...After a minute he climbed and a few more minute later he relaxed and loosened enough to fish out Will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been woken up by the walls suddenly stiffening and moving again. Cinder was awake again and on the move. The walls became aggressive suddenly, and squeezed you around them as if they were a bunch of dudes throwing a ball around. A pressure build around your head and upper body and suddenly you felt yourself being squeezed downward, with a wet squelching sound you emerged easily from Cinders enormous ass and fell a short distance to a palm waiting on you. You blinked in the bright light to see the cheeks above you close up, then your view began to move past the monolithic balls and cock of Cinder and soon you were face to face with Pops smiling at you with the most stupid grin you'd ever seen and knew this moment would haunt you a long time. He laughed and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats, its a healthy boy!\" He said, letting you sit up. You glare at him and apparently any defiance was not on the menu, not even with Pops, as he returned the look with bared fangs and a scowl. \"Don't look at me like that Boy, now strip those clothes off and lemme clean you up quick, you got a mission to carry out\" He said with authority. You drop your shirt and were about to pull off your jeans when you froze, you were hard as hell, oh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hold up? C'mon chop chop, I want you to get these humans outta here.\" Cinder said tapping his foot on the bath tub floor. You wince and pull down your wet jeans and boxers, and as soon as Cinder saw your predicament, he turned red and looked away. \"Oh...thats the hold up, you...enjoyed it in there, even if you didn't want to.\" He said, and after a second he began to laugh and looked back at you. \"Oh we're gonna have quite the time, the three of us.\" He said before gently adding soap to the palm and letting you clean yourself, embarrassed didn't begin to describe what you felt. When you were done Cinder turned off the shower and stepped out of the shower, placing you on the counter where you hurried over to where human towels were kept and dried off. As you did, Cinder was toweling off at well but he kept thrusting a hip in your direction and letting his butt graze the counter, teasing you with it. He looked over his shoulder and eased his ass on the counter, the orange globes sliding towards you and he spoke. \"Thank you for riding Cinder Asslines, you're welcome back anytime.\" He said winking at you, you knew that was an actual invitation, and the tug in the front of your towel wrap told you that you may try it again sometime, damn urges. He stopped teasing you and plucked you up and walked out, setting you down on the End table where a dressed Ashfall in a tshirt and gym shorts stood nearby, you were still in just a towel. He spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Will, go get dressed and take your friends out of here and to the subway station. Me and Cinder will be waiting in the living room, come straight there when you get back home. We've wiped their memories, so don't talk about anything that occurred last night. Now go on son.\" He said and you turned and walked down to the entrance and unlocked it, going inside...</span></div></div>",

Travis turned and then laughed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Will really? Put some clothes on dude!\" He said and Isaac laughed at you, you ignored them and just dropped your towel when you got near the dresser and they cursed, looking away from your lack of modesty, but you didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got some chores to do today and they're gonna take all day, so if you guys don't mind going on home...\" You say getting dressed.

The couch was cluttered with a mass of Gray and Orange Hide and Muscle as your fathers relaxed on the couch watching the morning news. Cinder was wearing the blue briefs and Ashfall was still in his red boxer briefs. They were both on separate ends of the couch with their feet and tails tangled together. You stood on the top of the couch waiting to be acknowledged. After about five minutes, Ashfall spoke and Cinder turned towards you with his famous smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are we done with friends being over now?\" Ashfall said still not looking at you, you glance at Cinder and then speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they're gone, happy? Lets just get this over with...I'm not gonna get my way anytime soon in anything..\" You say grumbling. Ashfall turned and blinked at you before breaking into a smile and looking at Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Cinder I didn't know we still had a toddler as a son, with his whining and whatnot.\" He said before leaning in and talking to you in a baby voice. \"Is the Willy boy upset? Is he?\" He said blinking his eyes fast and cracking into a bigger smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off Dad, you've won. Stop rubbing it in.\" You back up from him scowling. Ashfall snapped his head back and got a wicked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, someones angry, I think he's hungry Cinder, why don't you feed him for a bit.\" Ashfall said turning to the Orange and White Drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love too Ash!\" He said joyfully and grabbed you in his fingers. You blinked, surprised and not at all expecting this course of events. Cinder pulled you in and soon you realized what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait! NO NO N-\" You began to protest before Cinders thumb smashed you into his right pectoral, centered on his nipple. He held you there, your face pressed into the rubbery digit. You rotated your face back and forth, trying to keep your face from being directly in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get some tape Ash!\" Cinder said, and as your dad left he looked down at you. \"Why are't you sucking boy? You sure were running your mouth, now put something in it!\" You looked up at him with a glare and his soft expression suddenly mirrored yours. \"I'm not playing anymore, don't look to me as an ally in this, I gotta support Ash, and you're gonna learn why you don't fuck with Dragons. Now suck kid.\" He said as Ashfall reentered and put a piece of tape across your back, effectively suspending you against the large nipple. You groaned and took it into your mouth, instantly you were it with the taste of salt and a deeper earthy flavor, it actually wasn't too bad, if not completely humiliating. Ashfall and Cinder let out a hearty laugh, and you swore you heard Ashfall take a picture with his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thats gonna be his new contact photo!\" Ashfall beamed. Cinder let out a content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well squirt, looks like you're getting that bonding time you wanted with me this weekend. Not the way you imagined but I'm sure loving ya right now.\" He said, in the corner of your vision you saw him rub at the bulge in his briefs. You shuddered, wondering if they would go so far as make you experience what Matt went through. Given the track record of your fathers, more than likely you would end up inside them, and more than once and more than one way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel you sucking.\" Cinder said again and you resumed your humiliation, and stayed like that for some time as the day progressed into late morning. Cinder and Ashfall made small talk about work, friends, sports, and planning a family trip to the coast in the near future. You were mostly ignored, except for the occasional gentle stroke you got from Cinder, him letting you know he still cared and wanted to protect you, but not peeling you off as punishment. Ashfall once got a little excited and began making out with Cinder, squishing you between their beefy chests as they teetered on becoming more passionate. Ashfall played the long game however, and the look he gave you while returning to his resting place on the couch told you that sex wouldn't be far. The morning news devolved into talk shows and Ashfall turned it in a Live Police broadcast. One arrest was a human who kept mouthing off at a Dragon cop and the cop just turned around and sat on the human who was on the hood of his cruiser, effectively shutting the human up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That's one way to do it!\" Ashfall said, then looked at you. \"Careful what you say from here on out Will, we're taking notes.\" You just sucked harder despite your facial muscles crying out. Cinder relaxed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Ash we shoulda tried breast feeding him ages ago, it feels amazing.\" He said laughing. \"You wanna try him out?\" Ashfall shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I'll feed him dinner, besides let him take a break, we're not slave drivers. \" Ashfall said. Cinder grunted and peeled the tape off you and dropped you down on his swoll stomach, you gasped for breath and swallowed. When you looked up you saw both of your fathers looking back at the TV, obviously giving you time to recuperate and relax before your next trial. You walked over to Cinders navel, and laid down in it like it was some kind of moon chair. The live PD shows never interested you so besides watching that you practiced trying to read your fathers faces, which was tricky as hell ad you gave up rather quickly. After about 15 minutes...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stomach beneath you shuddered and you glanced up as Cinder let out a content sigh and his lazy gaze drifted down to you and he smiled. You gave him a nervous smile back, but didn't like the tension building around you, the smile your Pops wore was that of a predator, and you were most definitely prey. His hand slid down his belly and the fingers ran over you gently before settling over you and began to rub you into his gut, your rear going a little deeper into his navel as he massaged you with his thick fingers. After a moment the fingers receded back and you looked at him nervously to see his face was agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those jeans and jacket are chaffing me Squirt, take them off.\" He said softly but firmly, and Ashfall glanced at him with a brow raised. You knew you wouldn't win fighting him, so you complied, throwing them onto his nearby fingers until you were  laying in his navel in just a pair of green boxer briefs. Already the cold apartment air Dragons preferred nipped at you and you balled up and slid into his navel as far as you could as he chuckled.<br>\r\n\"That's much better, your smooth skin is a lot more soothing than denim...Now go warm up.\" Cinders fingers slid back over you and pinched you between it and his stomach, dragging you towards the waistband of his bikini briefs. You tried to fight it, digging your fingers into his skin, but his hide on his belly was like smooth leather and you found no purchase as he slipped you into it a ways and left you at the base of his dick. You grab at the fingers as they retreated but you were too slow and the waist band closed, causing the thin material to squish you into the soft pubic flesh of your father. You held extremely still, as if his cock was a living snake that would strike and eat you at the first movement you make. It was much warmer in here however and after a moment you realized you weren't in immediate danger and rather your Pops was probably just putting you away until he was ready to play around with you again. You sigh and flip yourself around only to remember you were tight at the base of his dick, the white member more than twice your height in width alone. You narrowed your eyes, the name of this game was for them to punish you with humiliating you with their power and manliness. So what if you took the initiative and went on as if you enjoyed it? In all honesty, deep down you were enjoying this, and you knew there was going to be an eventual point where they would realize this was not working as punishment. With a huff you crawled towards the dick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder relaxed on the sofa, his son tucked away in his briefs as he began speaking to Ashfall. \"I feel like a kangaroo or something right now, my lil joey is all safe and warm.\" He said, his hands absently rubbed at his inner thighs and his fingers slipped into the briefs that hugged his rear. Ashfall looked over at the motion and then at Will's outline in the briefs right above the massive bulge that was his mate's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...Cinder maybe I should take him for a bit, you seem to be getting a little ...charged, don't you think?\" Ashfall said, reaching for Cinders privates to extract Will. Cinder however shifted away from him and let out a growl that was half warning, half play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight me for him, he's mine now Ash.\" He said giving the Gray Drake a wicked smile and Ashfall huffed and held his hands up in submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I will, just be careful with him you thick headed brute. He may be in trouble but he's still your son, don't recede back into your old ways and go overboard. If you do, all that muscle won't count for shit because you know what I'm capable of.\" Ashfall said in a non aggressive tone but Cinder waned a little and grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, man you are not fun anymore, I-\" Cinder began but furrowed his brow and looked down at his junk, Ashfall followed his gaze to see Will at the base of Cinder's bulge, moving slightly, the tip of Cinders dick twitched and the Orange Drake turned red. \"Um, he's rubbing me off right now, what do I do?\" Cinder said looking up at Ashfall, who only began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man he got you over the barrel already, he figured out how to beat this punishment, oh man he's a smart kid. As for you, well you might as well enjoy it, or you could give him what his friend experienced and maybe that'll scare him straight enough to stay in his lane. Your call.\" Ashfall said standing up. \"I'm gonna make some brunch. You and Will should have a bonding moment alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed at the member, the flesh responding way easier than you anticipated as it stiffened beneath your touch. The muffled voices of your fathers could be heard around you but you were too focused on your current task to take notice. You worked your way around the base until in the dim light you could see his balls drooping from their position, the way they were situated due to the prone incline your Pops was in on the couch. His Scrotum was plump and massive, probably each ball the size of a human SUV, and the raphe was just a seam running deeply between the orbs. You slid yourself under his cock and landed on the orbs, sending a shudder throughout Cinder. You dug your feet into the balls and your hands rubbed at the cock above as you used your limbs to give your Pops a deep tissue massage from between his dick and nuts. A moan could be heard and you knew you were winning, however a tent in the front of your own boxer briefs told you it wasn't just a show. His cock was reaching its true size and the bikini briefs were peeling away from Cinders inner thighs as he began tenting them with his erection and after a moment they were peeled off and once again the cool air assaulted you sensitive skin. A gasp escaped from your Pops and fingers found you and pulled you from your spot, whisking you up to Cinders face at breakneck speeds. His face was expressing labored will and pleasure as he growled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you to do that?\" He said, his hot breath washing over you. You squinted and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not you, I took it as an initiative to please you, since it seems my punishment is to be your body slave.\" You say honestly. \"Put me back and let me finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one told you to do that Will, you were supposed to be scared and stay put.\" He said more gently this time, his golden eyes looking at you with exasperation, before they drifted past you and looked at his towering member before he smiled maliciously. \"Now lets see how you handle this!\" He said as you were taken back to his cock and lowered towards its slit, which winked and clenched hungrily. Terror actually washed over you for a second but you knew this would have to be done to drive home your determination, so you feigned terror as your feet were suddenly swallowed and sucked up by Cinders cock, the muscle throbbing as if it were truly alive. When it swallowed your waist and the undulating motion of the members interior squeezed your own cock, you felt a wet tinge and winced at the fact that your father made you cream. You faked panic as your chest and head were fully consumed, and Cinder actually looked pleased with himself as he ate his son. You knew it was more so for the fact that his plan was 'working', but that kind of made you sick. You were rubbed down the dragon dong and after a minute of suffocation and darkness you plopped into one of your dads balls with a hearty splash. Apparently you had really cranked up his sperm production with your antics. With a sputter you surfaced, wiping away the spunk from your air passages and felt your way to the smooth walls of the testicle, time for phase two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder purred as he felt the weight of Will fall into his left nut. He instantly stopped rubbing his cock, for he planned to leave the squirt in there for awhile to fully figure out how bad he's in for it. Satisfied with the results he flexed his chest and arms, diverting blood flow and after a couple seconds his erection receded and he was able to pull his brief back on and carefully make his way into the kitchen where Ashfall was making some omelets. Cinder came up behind him and wrapped his lover in an embrace, letting his crotch press between the Gray Drakes cheeks, Ashfall spoke without turning to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you chose to eat him huh? Honestly I would have done the same, he's already left you little choice on enforcing our will about his choices.\" Ashfall observed as he flipped an omelette over. Cinder held the embrace, watching Ashfall cook with his head coming over the Drakes shoulder, when he began to feel a sensation he hadn't felt before emitting from his balls, and he knew Will had him in a Vice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Ash, he meant for me to do that I think, he's now just rubbing me from the inside...\" Ashfall felt what was going on before Cinder had finished speaking, as the Orange Drake's member was tenting the briefs inbetween his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, he's played you like a fiddle huh? Well we will respond in turn by...\"</span></div></div>",

Cinder leaned into it as well, the embrace getting more and more heated when suddenly Ashfalls phone began to ring from the living room. The gray and gold drake cursed and broke off the passionate kiss, running into the living room and leaving Cinder standing there with a tent in his briefs. He followed his husband to see him on the phone with an annoyed expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Uh-huh...Uh-huh, yeah I-...Ok I'll be out in ten.\". Ashfall said hanging up and cursing some more. Cinder didn't need to say anything to know Ashfall was being called in to the police station for a shift. Being married to a cop and Cinder being a COO of a security company led to a lot of cock blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Bluefire case?\" Cinder asked. Ashfall nodded and began to walk to the bedroom while Cinder followed, Will sloshing around in his left nut and keeping his erection at full mast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"An undercover found a store in the back of a Dry cleaners that was selling humans trademarked by the Bluefire Syndicate, they need as many hands as they can get as they plan to raid it tonight, apparently from the report its almost half of the missing humans in one spot, so we gotta move on it now.\" The Gray drake said sliding on his well fitting uniform, the pants hugging his ass and outlining his package. Ashfall may have a dad bod but he wore it well, Cinder thought. He dropped his briefs again and threw them back on his dresser as he watched his mate but on his belt and holster his gun, casually rubbing his still throbbing member. Ashfall noticed the action and sighed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No I'm never gonna fuck you in this, Cinder. Stains are hard to get out. Anyway I'll probably not be back until late tonight, so you're in charge of our squirt, I don't want you lightening up on him just because I'm not here ok?\" Ashfall said waving his baton in Cinders direction before holstering that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry when I give birth to him I'll be a stern and hard parent, I'll keep up the game.\" Cinder said, sliding a hand underneath his sack and jostling it a good bit, sending Will bouncing around the chamber he was in. \"He may even just stay in there for the day, I don't think he's ready to come out.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashfall chuckled at that, and walked to his muscled companion, giving the balls a gentle rub and watching the tiny indentions of Wills fist beat against the walls of the scrotum. Cinder purred at the two actions and Ashfalls own pants began to tent at the sight, but he shook his head and looked at Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just take him out in a bit to feed him dude, and let him get some air, I don't want him going crazy in the dark down there as well so turn on some of your bio-luminescence.\" Ashfall said as he walked past Cinder to leave.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Oh fuck I forgot we can do that...err how do I activate it in a certain area?\" Cinder asked like a confused kid. Ashfall turned back and rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know for someone who spends a lot of time on his body, you sure don't know a whole lot about it huh? Observe.\" Ashfall said as he took in a deep breath and held it for a second. At first nothing happened but then the spaces between muscle groups began to emit a soft glow of goldish-white along his arms. It concentrated in his palms and the underside of his arms. His face wasn't affected as much, except for a few bright lines that ran down his nose and cheeks and the light seemed to pool behind his eyes. The uniform seemed to give off a slight glow, indicating it was his whole body that was active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it looked like you were about to breath fire-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but instead of exhaling you divert the energy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Yeah when you feel that click in your throat.\" Cinder finished and tried it for himself, taking in a deep breath into his large chest and as warmth built in his lower throat he swallowed and flexed his throat, feeling the energy built up spread warmly through his body. His chest was the first to light up, a river of light that was the color of cream orange ran down between his pecs and began to worm its way through his muscled gut, tiny streams forming symmetrical patterns throughout it as it made its way to his groin, doing the same small streams down his member and pooling in his cock head. His balls didn't really pool the light, but they gave out a balanced glow like some lantern. In the light they emitted, he could barely make out the silhouette of Will within them, though his shadow lacked definition it was very clearly him, as the figure was moving around wildly in reaction to his surroundings probably glowing. Cinder chuckled as the light finally spread to the end of his limbs, pooling in his palms and the soles of his feet. He thrashed his thick tail, sending off a light show as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is awesome, why don't we ever do this!\" Cinder said looking at Ashfall like a little kid at an amusement park. Ashfall snorted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There isn't a real use for it in today's society, this form boosts glamour output at the cost of breathing fire. We cop's use it to pacify unruly humans that are absolutely hysterical or mad. In fact, the raid we're doing tonight is against this green drake that does nothing but this all day, enamoring his captives so they don't resist him. For drakes like you though, it never really comes up to use, the fact that you forgot we can do it proves that. I only suggested it now so that our kid wasn't splashing around in darkness, at least he can see now. Any way I'm heading to work, if you need to turn the glow off, try to breath fire and hold for a few seconds, it should dissipate.\" Ashfall said as he turned and left, his husband lighting up the bedroom like a glowstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite your efforts, your caressing and massaging, Pops seemed to be chatting with Dad about something and they were paying you no mind, that didn't bode well. Your senses had adjusted in the dark, and your ears were fine tuned to compensate for your lack of vision, although they weren't good enough to make out the conversations. After another minute of no reactions, you gave up and drifted back in the spunk of Cinder, listening to it slop against the walls at every movement he made. A sudden push from below sent you sloshing around the room and gasping for the breath you didn't get to take. When the balls settled you waded up to the wall and began punching with all your might, the walls however seemed to absorb the impacts rather well, as if they were meant to take a hit from the inside. That made sense, since humans were the typical occupants within a dragon scrotum. You sigh and slide back again, listening to the distorted rumbles that were your parents talking about something. You were about to return to your rubbing when suddenly the room began to glow. softly at first, almost unnoticeable, but it amplified quickly, blinding you almost as you thrashed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the Hell?\" You let out as you continue to panic, was this the beginning of digestion? Were you about to become apart of the pool you swam in? A chuckle above told you that wasn't the case and you calmed down and squinted at the walls as your eyes caught up. An light orange glow came from all directions including below, turning the pool translucent to the point where you could see your feet at the bottom. Looking around you made a grim observation, the walls weren't smooth or as thin as what you imagined the inside of a scrotum looked like. A dragons scrotum seemed to lack the organs humans had, and instead the \"left nut\" seemed to more resemble a stomach cavity, with veiny muscle quivering and oozing the sperm from glands, Your stomach twisted a good bit, multiple questions being answered just like that. All dragon males were infertile, and it seemed the only way for them to become so temporarily was to digest a human within their scrotum. That explained why in the last two centuries Dragon eggs had basically fallen to zero, Drakes were no longer allowed to ingest humans to become fertile except when the population called for it, which was seldom as Dragons could live indefinitely unless disease or something else took their life. Despite the discovery, the glowing walls pulsed and soothed you, calming your emotions and telling you to relax. You knew it was glamour and were able to stave most of it off, but the fact still remained. You were essentially in a stomach that digested nothing but your kind, and you let yourself end up there. Of course you knew digestion was possible within a dragons balls, but the idea that it was a necessity to continue their race seemed barbaric to you. You were too caught up in thought that you failed to realize the walls beginning to convulse as... </span></div></div>",

You cursed your father, the Testosterone horn dog that he was, and braced yourself to be shot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cinder lay in bed in a similar position that he had last night when he unknowingly rocketed that human Matt across the room. This time however he knew he was getting out someone and had a sock ready to catch Will with. Damn it he should be shooting Will up Ashfalls rear not into a sock, damn law and order. He bit his lip and watched the light show as he stimulated his skin along his member and sent a kaleidoscope of light dancing up and down its length. His girthy balls bounced against his beefy inner thighs and lightly smacked against his taint, Wills small weight quite noticeable as he was thrown about inside. With a final stroke he let out a grunt and quickly pulled the sock over his cock head as he emptied his spunk cargo, a satisfying pressure and pain slid up his member and dropped into the sock, the poor piece of footwear filled up halfway before the splurge subsided. Cinder huffed and pulled the sock off his softening cock and rolled off the bed and once again entered the bathroom, he turned the sink on to dribble hot water and dumped the socks contents gently into. A hefty amount of Jizz poured into the sink along with a exhausted looking Squirt, he came out with the deluge and swirled around the sink with it before being left behind as it went down the drain. He coughed and sputtered as he slowly stood up, still only in his boxers as he glance up at Cinder. The big drake let a big smile cross his face as he spoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Congrats me, its a healthy baby boy again.\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How many times are you gonna make that joke?\" Will retorted and seemed to be squinting at Cinder, just now realizing that the Drake was glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Every time you exit my body bud, so be prepared to hear that alot this month.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Plundered Pub down the way sounds pretty good to me, the food anyway that is.\" Cinder said as he turned the faucet on to let you rinse off, the water was freezing, especially since you just came out of a furnace inside your Pops. The spunk dribbled away under the current and after a second you realized Cinder was waiting for your agreement for you to go there. You look at the muscle bound drake and scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you toy with me all you want, but i get choice in lunch plans? Why do you make no since Pops? Yeah sure that's fine, whatever. You're walking us there and paying, dunno why my choice matters at this point.\" You say scrubbing your hair and finally ripping your soaked boxers off, letting them go down the drain. Cinder huffed and you knew he was wanting to argue but there was really no point so he just waltzed over to the toilet and took a piss before walking back and grabbing you when you signaled you were done. He deposited you on the nightstand and you watched his nude form lumber over to the bed and look at the briefs he had been wearing earlier before shrugging and throwing them back in his dresser. He grabbed a pair of gray sweatpants and slid them on, the thin material outlining his bulge, ass, and thighs and leaving little to imagination. He threw on a blue tank top that showed off his enormous arms before turning and seeing you still on the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will...go get dressed! I'm starving! You can't go out naked like that last I checked.\" Cinder said crossing his arms and tapping his foot. You blink out of your trance of admiring him and climbed down into the nightstand. You didn't bother putting on underwear either because you knew you were probably going back into Cinder somehow and you had already ruined two pairs of boxers. You threw on gym shorts and a tshirt and thought it was good enough. You doubted you were gonna see any humans anyway as the Plundered Pub was down the road a bit, but way deeper in the dragon district to a human. The place had human seating, but rarely any customers of that stature. Dragons were so mysterious to mankind because they were still too afraid to spend any personal time around them, and you recently discovered where that old fear comes from. You sigh and grab your phone and wallet before walking out onto the nightstand and Cinders fingers plucked you up and dangled you in front of him. You squirmed and glared at Cinder, who just feigned innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously kiddo if you had taken any longer I think i'd wither away, listen to this!\" He lifted up the tank top and pressed you to his belly, you unconsciously put your hands against the muscled gut but quickly gave up fighting and just pressed your head to it, though you didn't need too as the sound of thunder erupted from beyond the white scaly wall. He absently rubs his gut, taking you along with his hand. Most humans would think he was just being oblivious, but you knew what he was doing was important. He was rubbing you against him to cover your clothes and skin in his scent, marking you as his, if you and him were to somehow get separated. You were mad at him, and you had just spent like an hour in his balls so you weren't sure this was necessary, but you kept quiet and just slid across his smooth belly, letting him finish marking you, since if you did get separated, this could even save your life. He finished by bringing you towards his crotch. You thought he was doing it because the scent was stronger there, but he lifted the waistband of his sweats and slid you in up to your chest before letting them press you into his soft lower belly. You blink and look up at him and he just shrugs. \"Sorry kid, no shoulder rides today, you take the humility seat today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if i slip all the way in?\" You ask innocently,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at how tight these things fit me, if my junk doesn't catch you, you'll just get pinned between the material and my upper thigh, check it.\" He said pinching some material of the sweats and pulling it away before letting it go, it snapped back to his leg quickly, proving it was really taut. You groan as you were kangaroo'd by your father, him walking out the door and locking it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the human door locked, Will?\" Cinder said returning the keys to his tight pocket on his hip.Your vision was luckily and unluckily unobscured, as his tanktop was a little short, exposing a sliver of flesh between it and the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I locked it when I let my friends out.\" You say, or rather scream now that you were outside and the sound of the city was in competition with your voice, why wouldn't he just put you on his shoulder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" He asked. \"I'd hate to kill someone.\" He said nonchalantly, though you knew he was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" You say, not so sure now. Cinder grunts and walks out onto the sidewalk, you along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac hopped off the train, annoyed he had to come all the way back to Will's place by himself. Will had rushed them out so fast that Isaac had left his game and phone. As he stepped out of the sidewalk station an Enormous Orange and White drakes bare foot crashed in front of Isaac as he walked by, and he was amazing! Isaac stared at the enormous muscled dragon, his knees going weak as he watched his back and butt and legs shift with gigantic and powerful muscles. Isaac shook his head and cleared it. He was sure he had never seen that Dragon before, but he seemed familiar. He looked both ways before crossing the sidewalk and reaching the small yard in front of Will's townhouse. He ascended the huge staircase leading up to the human entrance and ran the door bell. The sound of what was like a cathedral belltower rang out inside and Isaac waited. After a few minutes it was obvious Will would take forever to reach the door and Isaac groaned and absently tried the door knob, which twisted for him. He blinked and looked around, and with no one in sight he opened the door slowly and looked in at the quiet and dark house. He looked around outside again before slipping inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You cupped your head in your hands as Cinder strode down the street. <br>\r\nHe obviously enjoyed all the looks he got, from both sexes. Smaller females stared at his hulking form with a kind of lust you could feel in the air, many of them let their gazes drift to his shifting junk in his sweats. You did get a slight kick however from watching their faces go from sly and mischievous expressions to obvious surprise and confusion when they noticed the human sticking out above the Drakes crotch. No one stopped and questioned Cinder about you though and he eventually walked into the Plundered Pub, deftly pulling you from your spot and taking a seat at the bar. He placed you on the counter and pulled out his phone to check his work, placing his elbows on the counter and holding it with both his hands. This made him lean over the counter and you, leaving you in the shade under your Pops enormous chest. You rolled your eyes as he was clearly sheltering you from the rest of the patrons. He may not have said much about it but the human abductions seem to have him worried about your safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pops you don't have to protect me I-\" You begin to say but suddenly the Server and owner, a Pudgy Blue and Black Drake, comes up to you and Cinder. Cinder sat up and suddenly you did feel a little exposed, but you quickly adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Cinder, see you brought Will today, what'll ya take? The usual? Same for you Will?\" He said taking out a notepad and pen. Cinder smiled at the Blue Drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah the usual Coldbreath, thanks.\" Cinder said and Coldbreath walked off. Your Pops returned to his phone and overshadowing you. You weren't sure what it was, but the air here seemed tense, like there was something everyone was thinking, but no one was bringing it up. The sound of a stool next to Cinder being pulled back startled you and suddenly a skinny Black and Green Drake was sitting and staring at Cinder with an all too large grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cinder! Buddy! I haven't seen you in forever! Business keeping you Busy? Hopefully you and Ashfall are still getting along?\" The smaller Drake said leaning in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck off Vilebite, I'm not in the mood to deal with your drug peddling, or whatever you're doing now. And no I'm never going to sit on your face.\" Cinder said casually without looking away from his phone but the air got considerably warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I asked one time about that! And I promise drugs are behind me, I just wanted to say hi to one of my-\" The Drake trailed off as his green eyes lock on you and your blood ran cold, as it was an obviously predatory stare. The Drake broke into a false smile \"Now who is this with you Cinder? I thought you hated humans, that was our thing! Hey lil' dude I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't talk to him and don't touch him if you value your fingers, now get the fuck away from me you <i>vermin</i>.\" Cinder turned and hissed at the Black Drake, who instantly threw his hands up in surrender and walked out of the pub. Cinder went back to his phone like nothing happened. You had so many questions but Cinder still radiated heat so it was probably best to keep quiet. Coldbreath came back and put a plate in front of Cinder and pulled a table and chair from his apron and placed them near you before lowering his finger where a human plate of food waited, you picked it up and went to your seat and began eating...</span></div></div>",

A text from Matt said Isaac left his phone and was heading back to get it, and that had been sent about 45 minutes ago, shit. Nature suddenly called to you and you glanced to see a human access at the end of the bar, which potentially led to human restrooms. You decided not to bother Cinder and got up to reach it by yourself, failing to inform your father you were leaving. You almost made it to the door when suddenly everything went black as you were encompassed by someones hand. You assumed it was Cinder retrieving you roughly to send a message, but after a second you felt no pressure ease up. Suddenly the palm opened and the Black dragon from earlier was revealed to be your captor. He deftly twisted you around in his hand, inspecting you with a critical eye for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No maiming or deformities, which is a surprise since you were in the company of that big dumbass. You should fetch a fine enough price with the Syndicate, they like the young humans, longevity and such you know?\" The drake casually said as he closed a fist around you, leaving only your head exposed. He continued. \"You reek of him though, what are you his young intern or something?\"You wince past the pain from his careless grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm his s-\" You began but the grip tightened and Vilebite began to walk. opening the back door of the pub and stepping into the alleyway...</span></div></div>",

Vilebite sputtered and you gasped as his grip tightened on you, you look up at the sight of Cinder, steam billowing from his nostrils and his tanktop ripped at the neck from his chest swelling, his eyes were bloodshot with rage. Vilebite forgot about you and opened his hands, you tumbled a short way but Cinders other hand caught and quickly placed you on a dumpster next to the drakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I recall...saying don't touch him if you value your fingers...\" Cinder said smoothly.

Cinder smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you'd be right, the only one I don't hate is my son.\" Cinder said reinforcing his grapple by pushing Vilebite against the wall easily with one hand still. Vilebite's eyes got wide with fear as he glanced at you on the dumpster nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Son?...Are you fucki-\" He didn't finish as Cinders fist went into his mouth and out again, a good number of teeth followed the fist back out and clattered onto the ground. Vilebite recovered extremely well despite his jaw and teeth breaking, delivering a slug across Cinders face, splitting his lip along the side of his snout, which grew a snarl and Cinder continued his assault on the smaller male. Punching him in the gut before catching a fist from the other hand and breaking its fingers. Vilebite let out a choked sound, still being held against the wall by his throat as Cinder followed with another hit to the ribs, definitely shattering a few of them before throwing the black drake across the alley into another dumpster where he dropped to the ground coughing. Cinder spat on him, some blood coming from his cut lip before walking back over and picking you up gently, turning you over the same way Vilebite had except with way more care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will are you hurt? Talk to me bud? Do we need to get you to a hospital?\" He said in an almost frantic tone, not at all the same Drake that left the one behind him bleeding and broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um yeah I'm fine Pops what about you, you're bleeding from your lip and it looks like a bunch of cuts on your hand from his teeth.\" You say trying to divert his overbearing papa bear persona. He blinked and lifted a finger to his split lip and winced, and his speech was beginning to slur a little as it swelled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooh yeah, lets get home so I can ice this.\" He said before looking down and seeing his tank top was ripped down his chest. \"Damnit I liked this shirt, why'd I have to go hulk mode?\" He huffed and you laughed at him. He placed you on his shoulder and began the walk home. You didn't begin to process what almost happened to you until you were on your street almost to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh god, I was almost kidapped wasn't I? What was he gonna do with me? should we call the police?\" You began to hyperventilate and Cinder pulled you off his shoulder and pressed you to his exposed chest, a drake walking by stared at the strange sight of a ravaged looking dragon holding a human to his chest, and Cinder gave him a lopsided smile with his swollen face before looking down and consoling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Easy bud, I was aware of what happened the second I saw movement at the end of the bar, and I texted Ashfall that there was trash that need collecting at the Pub. He's gonna be put away for a good while.\" Cinder said holding you to his chest still as he opened the door. Usually you'd be embarrassed being held in such a humiliating way, but after watching Cinder kick that guys ass, you felt pretty cool to call him your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you told dad he tried to kidnap me?\" You ask as Cinder closed the door and walked into the living room, putting you on the couch. Cinder winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um no, I told him it was just a human kidnapping, I didn't want Ashfall to finish the guy off after all, I barely held myself from doing it.\" He said taking off his shirt and throwing it over the nearby recliner. He rubbed his chest and stomach, wincing some more. \"All that moving with a full gut doesn't sit well with me though, I'm gonna go use the restroom then clean up, and then we can put on a movie or something, I think you deserve a break today squirt.\" He smiled and walked off. You smiled as he went, when your phone buzzed and you looked down and gasped. Isaac had just texted you, 'Hey sorry your door was unlocked and I let myself in, I'm leaving now, sorry if I intruded.'. You look around frantically before scaling the couch and climbing up to the walkway before sprinting you round the corner into the hallway just as Cinders tail is slipping into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No, No!\" You say frantically. Isaac doesn't remember what happened last night, but Cinder sure as hell does, and after what you saw he wouldn't hesitate to kill Isaac, his testosterone was probably sky high. You ran down the walkway going into the master bedroom to see...</span></div></div>",

You can see Isaac however in the distance on the walkway, climbing the incline to go over the bathroom door, he seemed hurried. You quickly realize that he must have seen Cinder walk in shirtless and it was causing a relapse in the glamour that had inflicted him. You ran towards him, climbing the incline on your side of the door and running towards Isaac who was about to go through the human door that was above the dragon door that entered the restroom. He turned surprised as you came sprinting up to him, and he turned red and looked away, stammering out something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-oh hey Will, sorry that I kind of snuck in, the door was locked but I didn't realize you weren't home, I was just gonna use the restroom before I head out.\" He said reaching for the door, you smack his hand away and scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cut the shit, you know damn well there's a restroom in my room at the nightstand.

What you're feeling right now is glamour that he is exuding, but despite this he'll just smash you or eat you.

You grind your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what...You don't remember anything because they wiped your memory of it, you violated them Isaac, my dads. And I'm grounded for a month because of what you did, but its better than the alternative, you could've been killed Isaac, many times.\" You say, but he was furrowing his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making shit up Will, I don't remember any of that shit, you should here yourself. I- \" As he was speaking the bathroom door beneath the walkway opened and Cinder strode out, playing on his phone and stopping right beneath the two of you. His wide orange back carved like canyons, leading down to the gray sweats he still wore, his tail draped over the waistband and his butt looking like large gray mountains beneath the fabric. You look at Isaac and choke as he is standing on the railing, his eyes looking down and completely gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac, No!\" You shout and grab at him, but he leaped, falling what must've been 200 feet for him, his tiny form in the distance grabbed the waistband and slammed into the sloped muscle of your pops left cheek, sending a ripple through the muscle and fat. Cinder grunts but just adjusts the waistband at the disturbance. Isaac gripping the waistband and holding on as Cinder turns and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are, I thought I heard someone yell. You ready for a movie or something, bud?\" He says smiling up at you, such a nice expression for the soon-to-be murderer of your 'friend'. His hand reaches up and gently plucks you off the walkway. He pulls you in close, rolling you into his palm, before walking back into the living room. You know you have tell him, if you do now the punishment will be bad for you since you can't control your friends, but Isaac may yet live.

Beyond the large muscle, the deep throat pulsed and quivered, large enough for a human highway to run through. rather than being dark within, an amber light radiated down the throat, showing Isaac the journey all the way to this behemoths stomach, as a glowing pool seemed to await him. In the distance he heard Will screaming, but he was still fixated on the sight below him. The fingers let go of him, and Isaac tumbled, too fearful to scream as the abyss below him came closer and closer. As he passed the jaws, they clamped shut and suddenly the tongue flew up and smashed Isaac into the roof of the dragons mouth, before the head seemed to return to its resting position. Isaac was tossed around the mouth, rolling across the pink surface of the tongue as it absorbed his flavor, as it did, Isaac's head began to clear, as if whatever magics the dragon put on him were taken away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were on your knees as you watched Isaac tumble towards Cinders jaws, unable to fathom that your father would outright kill a human, your friend no less, in such a manner in front of you. The jaws snapped shut and you waited to see the lump appear in the throat, but nothing came. Cinder seemed to be playing with Isaac in his mouth, and while he did this he shimmied out of his sweatpants, once again returning to his birthday suit as he scooped you up before sitting down on the couch. You stare at him in disbelief but he smiled at you before lifting his other hand and spitting into it. Laying in a pool of drool was a dazed Isaac, you let out a breath you had been holding the whole time. Isaac, stands up wearily and looks around before seeing that Cinder was looking at him and he sat back down, making himself small as possible. Cinder smiled at that and then turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I would expect that by now you'd realize that I talk big but won't follow through on killing your friends Will, even as tempting as it is to feel this one squirming inside me, you've marked him and I'll respect that. I sucked all the glamour out of him, but he might still have urges, so I'm going to remedy these urges and send him on his way.\" Cinder said before bringing Isaac closer, close enough to blow hot air on him. \"So listen close worm, you live only because of my son, and I'm going to allow you the day to please me, this should fix you and give you some resilience to glamour, but I won't allow you to come here anymore. Understood?\" Isaac blinked before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, <i>Master</i>\" Cinder corrected. Isaac nodded and before you knew it, Cinder shoved him into his erect manhood that he had gotten from the domination. You had been down the same shaft and seen Matt eaten by it while it was semi hard, But watching your father guide the lump down with little effort, it disappearing before the right nut tugged and wobbled as Isaac made it within. Cinder sighed satisfied, before returning his gaze to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say Will, you humans feel good in there, and no he won't get digested, but if he comes over again after today I'm not so sure. Anyway, we can still watch that movie, or maybe you yourself wanna have some quality time with me. I won't force ya or anything, I'll give you free reign of me, your Pops is a little horny again.\" He says sliding into a slouched position, absently stroking his shaft. You turn red, but you had never had the option of this, and you were unsure if you'd ever get the proposition again...You look at him and say...</span></div></div>",

Very well I\u2019ll put on some b rated slasher films. I\u2019m staying nude though so tough shit for you.\u201d He said smirking at you as he grabbed the remote and turned on the tv, swapping over to a streaming service and putting on the film. He laid down on the couch, his hands resting on his stomach and leaving you to find a comfy viewing position on his person. You climbed up his right pectoral and laid down, sinking into the leathery surface as if it was made of memory foam. You both made idle comments about the poor choices made by the characters, and laughed whenever someone died in a cheesy way. As you were watching however Cinder threw one hand onto the back of the couch, and you glanced to see that he had gone flaccid. You got worried for a moment and had to ask about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPops you didn\u2019t digest Isaac did you?\u201d You say in a concerned voice.

Oh no, he was going wild in there 15 minutes ago, but now he\u2019s kinda just drifting around in there occasionally stroking my walls, but I think he tired himself out in fervent worship. I\u2019ll get him out sooner or later, if I remember.\u201d He said letting out a yawn. You were tired too, having spent your night in you Pops ass and all, you couldn\u2019t tell when you had been asleep or just in the humid darkness of his rectum. That and top of almost ending up in the human trafficking business that was rampant in the city. After another 30 minutes of b rated predictability Cinder was snoring and you weren\u2019t far off. You however wanted to pay Isaac a visit before turning in. You walked down the firm expanse of Cinders taut muscle gut. Marking how the flesh beneath gave less to your weight than if it were Ashfalls more fatty stomach. You reach the base of his flaccid shaft and stroke it softly as you pass, careful not to stir it up. You got on your belly to slide out onto the fat balls of Cinder as to not dig your knees or hands in to irritate or cause your father pain. When you were a good ways onto his right but you cupped you\u2019re hands on your mouth and Hollered downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsaac, can you hear me?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You sigh and were about to begin your crawl back up Cinders body when the kitchen door opened and closed, Ashfall coming around the corner from the kitchen in his police uniform. He smiled upon seeing his passed out mate, but the smile faded slightly when he spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So much for him keeping you inside his nuts for the day. I knew he'd go soft on ya the moment I left.\" He said as he plucked you off the plump scrotum. He walked into the master bedroom and dropped you on the bed as he undid his utility belt, then took off his uniform and hung it in the walk in closet. He stood before you in the red boxerbriefs that he had been wearing the night before, his large bulge, almost identical in size to Cinder, looming near you. Ashfall hooked his fingers into the waistband and shimmied out of them, letting his cock breath as he tossed the underwear into the hamper nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you seem to get out of Cinders cell so quickly, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon in mine, and you're only coming out at dinner time.\" The gray and gold drake said. You sigh and strip out of your clothes, Ashfall stroking his member to prepare for his meal. When you gave him the signal, he picked you up and used his other hand to press his cock to his stomach, letting its head point directly up, exposing its full length as well as the bulbous balls that awaited their captive. He lowered you down his soft belly, the winking slit below you actually opening up to receive you, the amount of control dragons had of their body astounded you. Your feet slipped in with little issue as the cock head swelled up and began to suck you down with rhythmic motions. As you got up to your waist you look back up at Ashfall only to see he had his head tilted back, enjoying the consumption of his son. You sigh, and with another clench the phallic walls swallowed you up, pulling you down the length of your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall watched the lump that was Will travel down his length, he had forgotten how good it felt to eat a human this way. It had probably been 500 years since the last human entered his sack, though that one never left it. Dragons need to digest humans in their testicles to be fertile, but back in the day, alot of Drakes did it just to do it. The amount of power and pleasure it makes you feel is insurmountable, and Ashfall was getting a taste for something he had not had in so long, damn human-dragon society laws. The dragon population was in decline, the only way for a new dragon to be born is for a human that knows about what is required for a dragon to be made willingly gives themselves up for it, and usually those were only the elderly and the seriously ill. A tug in his balls made him moan and he realized Will had dropped into his left ball finally. Ashfall jostled his nuts, rolling the bulbous sack in his hand before letting it drop again and sending the foreign weight within bouncing with it, giving him pure pleasure. He strode into the bathroom and started a shower, remembering that he needed to fix that damn water heater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall into the ballsack of your other dad, a larger pool waiting on your arrival as he hadn't released himself the night before. You thrashed and rose to the surface, barely able to keep your head above the hot spunk. Just as you get to the surface however, the whole room shifted and you found yourself sloshing around within, banging into the strange walls of the nut, a distant moan called out as you did so. After a minute, the room began to glow with an golden light, letting you see the similar sight you saw in Cinders scrotum, walls that looked more like that of a stomach rather than a testicle. You sigh and float on your back so you don't tire yourself out, and begin to doze in and out of conciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder groans and sits up slowly, looking around the living room. He checked his body for Will, but saw none of him. Was it just a dream he ate that guy? With a grunt He lumbered into the kitchen, and grabbed a bagel, munching down on it before walking into the master bedroom, the door to the bathroom was shut, and the sound of a shower was coming from within, telling him Ashfall was home. Cinder yawned and tossed himself on the bed, landing on his stomach. He let out a moan as his balls alerted him to the presence of someone in his balls, but he paid it little attention, Snoring in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was suddenly thrown about in the darkness, smacking into the walls as the scrotum made impact with something, he sputtered through the dark, and wasn't enjoying this as much as he thought he would. He got to his feet and began banging on the walls, but loud snores told him he was going to be in here awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall took in a breath as his bioluminescence kicked in. He wasn't gonna let his son be in the dark, Will probably already figured out the secret of dragon reproduction anyway. When Ashfall gets him out tonight, he's probably gonna talk with Will and Cinder about making him into a Dragonkin, a human that is a little more sturdy and immune to glamour. The only reason they hadn't made him one yet was because they age more slowly, living some 500 years, but he'd look like a sixteen year old for another 10 years. Dragonkin were another guarded secret of the dragons, it was originally a gift to the most loyal servants. In Ashfalls long 4000 something years, hes only made two, as the process takes a little bit of time and requires two dragons, luckily, he had both. Will would look the same, except his eyes would turn into the colors of the eyes of his dragon dads, and his hair may adopt the dull color of either gray, gold, orange, or white, the colors of his dads scales. People would notice, but would think its just something that happens when living with dragons. Ashfall finally was satisfied with the water temperature, and stepped into it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower, Ashfall came out of the bathroom to find Cinder passed out on the Bed. A smile creeps across Ashfalls face as he..</span></div></div>",

With a yawn of his own, Ashfall slid onto the bed and closed his eyes, tossing an arm over the form of Cinder as well as a knee. Ashfalls junk pressed up against his mates hip as he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls around you still glowed, but after settling at an odd angle movement had stopped completely. You sigh, knowing Ashfall had drifted into a slumber. Deciding there was no alternative, you join them in that regard, falling asleep drifting on top of the pool of spunk that had gathered within Ashfall. The gentle sloshing of the pool from Ashfalls small movements providing enough ambiance to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or three Ashfall stirred, pulling himself off Cinder which in turn woke up the large brute, who yawned and stretched, letting a fart slip as he did so, causing them to both to laugh in their groggy state. Cinder blinked and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wheres Squirt?\" He said sliding up into a prone position, resting on his elbows and lower belly. Ashfall rolled onto his back and rubbed his balls, his son being sloshed about within, sending ripples of light and pleasure throughout Ashfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safe, secure, and pleasant in his current spot, but I've been thinking Cinder. I think its time to make him into a dragonkin.\" Ashfall said opening his thighs and letting his scrotum lull into the new gap, feeling them lightly bounce with the added weight of Will. Cinder furrowed his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were waiting for him to turn 18, just so he was out of High School before we change him.\" Cinder said worried. Ashfall waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were fledgling parents at the time, worried he wouldn't reach maturity. I think we'll be fine, I'll ask him at dinner here in a bit, but the question comes to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Who's going to bear him during the process.\" Cinder finished. \"I'm not gonna like sitting around so much, and you're on call so being basically pregnant isn't the best for you. However I can just tell Goldgleam the situation and I'm sure he's fine with giving me a month or so, hes a very understanding CEO. I'll bear Will and sculpt him into our child, making him more than just an adopted son, but a biological one in a way. I'd love too be the one to reshape him!\" Cinder stated with a smile, looking off into the distance as if he was about to set out on a great quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that now but I know in three days you will be complaining and wondering why you did this. Your balls will swell to three times their size and be swollen and extremely sensitive, and the rest of your body will become feverish for most of the time as it redirects how your glamour and power flows. Moving will be uncomfortable, and you'll curse the parasite within you. Theres a reason this was considered the greatest gift a dragon could give a human, as dragons take on a semblance of human pregnancy. Its painful, humiliating, and frustrating, and you'll see that you wouldn't do this for anyone unless you truly loved or owed them an immeasurable amount. I myself only have done it twice, once in ignorance, and another for a human doctor that crawled inside a battle wound I received and sewed it from inside me, its this scar on my abdomen here.\" Ashfall said pointing at a discolored stretch of scales that were more white than gray. He continued. \"Pretty sure he's still alive today, a healthy 723 in his old age. Older than any dragonkin I've heard of.\" Ashfall finished and saw Cinder was giving him a look of disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes two dragons to forge a dragonkin, so who were the other drakes that helped you on those occasions?\" Cinder said with annoyance. Ashfall just smiled, leaning in and kissing Cinder on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ones I'd entrust our son to, thats who. Now if we do this you're gonna have to enter a form of Fertility, not one where you simply digest a human, but one where you sustain one. Will is going to be in you for a month or even two. In that time you're gonna want to to continue working out at the home gym we have and eat twice the calories otherwise you're gonna loose that hard earned mass you've built up. The reason for the calories is due to the nutrient rich fluid that your testicles are going to create, they're going to fill up with it, replacing your usual enzyme spunk with it and keeping Will suspended in it. He's able to breath and stay conscious the whole time as the fluid soaks into him. Like I said, maintaining this fluid taxes you physically and mentally. I have the easy part, I bestow a bit of my essence, which leaves me drained for about a day before its restored, but you'll continue on until you feel a change, an urge that Will is ready to be born from you and you'll deliver him. You've made so many birthing jokes with him, only natural that you actually do it. Now lets get you ready, you can be building up the fluid now so when we talk to Will, you can receive him shortly after.\" Ashfall said sitting up. Cinder was about to but a beating inside his nut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah about that. Wills friend Isaac returned and I kind of...swallowed him with my cock.\" Cinder said giving an innocent smile. Ashfall froze and instantly became angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? We wiped his memory, how did he come back?\" Ashfall said as Cinder rolled over onto his back, tiny bumps popping up as something wailed at his walls, creating divets from the impact. Cinder was erect from it. Ashfall twisted into a cold smile. \"Well we might as well enjoy each other before you become cranky and pregnant.\" Ashfall said as he...</span></div></div>",

His own balls, carrying Will, settled on Cinders gut as his member mirrored its mate and became erect. Cinder reached up and put his hands on Ashfalls hips before sliding the hands more forward and gripping the large gray cheeks of the drake and peeling them apart. Ashfall sat up as he did this, reaching around and guiding Cinders cockhead until it poked his exposed tailhole. With an experienced grace, he eased himself onto it and moaned, taking Cinder in slowly, his cock twitching in response as his hole was stretched to compensate for the Orange drakes size. After a moment Ashfall began to pull back up before coming back down, doing it consecutively, each time a little faster. Dull slaps could be heard as Ashfalls balls slapped Cinders lower belly, and his cheeks clapped together over the cock. He picked up tempo, leading to both parties moaning as climax became ever so closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You went from being sloshed around slightly to full blown whirlpool as you were thrown about the chamber, catching spunk in your mouth and eyes. From what little you could see, the light within the walls danced brilliantly like a kaleidoscope in response to the blunt movements. You would go air born only to slam into the bottom of the ball, before shooting back up into the air. The walls contracted and became firmer as this went on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt the world begin to quiver, and he was jostled about. He didn't think the Master was moving, but rather something was moving the master. He was bounced around and with each bounce the walls seemed to get firmer and firmer. Suddenly pressure built and Isaac was sucked upward back into the tight tube above, shooting up the tight passage and shooting into a world of gold light, plastering to a wall as it tensed and pinned him, Isaac looked down and not far below, the White cock head of Wills Pops was winking at him, yellowish in the golden light of the undulating walls. Isaac blinked, where the hell was he now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshfall felt Cinder release in him and he followed suit, his scrotum drawing up as he shot his seed all over his mates stomach and chest. He winced as a pressure slid up his length and a nude Will was shot all the way to the cleft of Cinders pectorals, landing in between them with perfect accuracy. Cinder let out a breathless laugh at the sight and followed it with a satiated sigh. Both he and Ashfall basked in the afterglow of their climaxes. Will sputtered and sat up, wiggling out from between the mountainous pecs before dropping onto Cinders upper stomach, looking up at his dad with an annoyed expression, before gaining a look of shock as it dawned on him that he had just been apart of his dads having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputter and cough, wiping spunk from your eyes as you look at the towering form of Ashfall. They just had sex and you were among them in their passion drunk states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Will, care to help us make some dinner?\" Cinder said from behind you. Ashfall smiled and slid off his mate, a wet pop sounding and Cinders dick drooping back to its position as it was pulled from Ashfalls ass, a strand of jizz, still connecting the tip of it with the bulbous rear before snapping. You gag as Ashfall walked to the restroom, yellow light still pouring from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why is he glowing like that? You were doing the same not to long ago.\" You ask Cinder who was reaching for a sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its our bio luminescence, it lights us up inside and out. We both did it so you weren't spending your time in us in the dark.\" He said scrubbing his flacid cock. That mention reminded you of what you discovered inside both cinder and Ashfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have stomachs in your scrotum, don't you? Specialized for human prey.\"  You say looking at Cinders groin. Cinder stopped cleaning for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah we do I guess, a live human is the key to a dragon reproducing, thats why our numbers have plateaued in the last century. Dragon society and the top heads of human society made a treaty about it, though the stupid humans didn't really have a say in the matter and its by our good graces that-\" He looked at your face and cut himself off before continuing. \"Er sorry Will, but yes that is the cold truth of dragons, but we can do some good with those stomachs for humans as well.\" He says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, please tell me, because in my experience I've had nothing but anguish and fear from them.\" You say bitterly. Cinder gave you an apologetic face before it quickly shifted into a stern one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Will, it can't be all bad, you still have an erection.\" He says, causing you to look down and remember your naked. You cover your groin which causes Cinder to laugh. \"Anyway we dragons can also turn your kind into something we call a dragonkin, and me and Ash want to make you one.\" He says proudly. You look at him questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that? I've never heard of it.\" You ask honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the grandest gift a dragon can bestow on a human, longevity. We keep it secret so we don't have to deal with all of the human powers demanding they be made into venerable dictators.\" Ashfall said coming back out of the restroom, the shower being on behind him. You glance at him and then back at Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok that doesn't sound bad, put me back in and lets do it!\" You say smiling. Cinder winced and Ashfall continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more complicated than that Will, Cinder or me have to prepare for it, which only takes a couple hours. The hard part will follow for both you and your dad that takes you in. You'll be suspended in a fluid for a long time, similar to a human mother carrying her child, though no umbilical or anything. This process could take only three weeks, but I know of some cases where it took a dragon a year.\" Both you and Cinder gawk at Ashfall. Before you could continue Cinder spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A YEAR? I'll do it but-but that's a long time Ash, and not to mention Will has school and-and he might not come out sane, being in there so long!\" Cinder said sitting up a bit, causing you to roll through drying spunk on his stomach. You glared at him as Ashfall answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were rare cases, my guess is it'll take two months for us. Will its completely up to you, Cinder will be your carrier, and I'm supplying my essence.\"<br>\r\nHe said grabbing a towel from the closet before looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Essence?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically my glamour, my magic. You're going to be in a container of sorts absorbing nutrients that are only produced in a dragon, if a dragon attempted this by himself and tried to shape a human, he'd create an abomination or kill the human with extreme cell reproduction, Cancer everywhere. But my essence enters Cinder and acts as a sort of protection, a schematic, guiding the nutrients and distributing them in doses and evenly. I don't understand the magics of it, but basically my magic and Cinders body enhances you, extending your cell life. You'll change slightly, your hair will become the color of one of our scale colors. And usually your eyes will become our colors, so one gold and one blue. Other than that there isn't much else. So what do you want to do?\" Ashfall asks crossing his arms.</span></div></div>",

Cinder laughed and caused you to fall over as his chest rose and fell rapidly. Ashfall smiled and picked you up, bringing you with him into the bathroom with him. He glanced over his shoulder and beckoned Cinder to follow as well, who grumbled and slid off the bed. Ashfall stepped into the shower and set you on the soapdish before turning and washing his rear, getting in there to clean out Cinders love juice. Cinder lumbered in and got in the shower as well, mist cascading off the monolithic titans that you called fathers. As Ashfall was washing himself, he paused and made a face before smiling and pulling his hand from his large rear, turning instead to face Cinder where he began to scrub his husbands chest and stomach....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac wiggled within the spunk covered walls of this glowing rectum, light still pulsing throughout it as it undulated from its owners movements on the outside. Suddenly a squelching sound could be heard and two clawed digits sweeped around inside the space with Isaac. He didn't even have time to react as they darted in and out of the anus, taking strands of the Masters spunk with them on each trip. Finally the fingers glazed over Isaac, but instead of being whisked out with them, one just patted his head before retreating. Isaac groaned as the walls tensed up and began to toy with him, pulling him deep into the bowels of the dragon only to push him back down, his feet even slipping through the wrinkled orifice of the drakes sphincter, only to be sucked back up in and the process repeats itself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cinder you need to begin preparing to host Will, focus your energy, and direct it to your groin, it'll know what to do from there. You don't have to maintain it once Will gets inside, your body will make it an autonomic function, just be prepared to stuff your face as your stomach will burn food extremely fast. If you ate a human in this state, they'd last less than five minutes in you. Anyway I'm gonna give you my essence already.\" Ashfall said coming up and planting his lips on Cinders, the two drakes pulling in close in a passionate kiss. Their tails found each other and began wrapping up, forming a scaly helix. You watched as their groins slapped together, and before you eyes, from what you could see between their beefy thighs, Cinders scrotum begin to grow slowly. The skin of it stretched and became taut, but continued to expand, what had already been the size of softballs between is legs, looked more like cantaloupes.Cinder repositioned his stance to compensate for his growing girth, and after about five minutes Ashfall, still locked in the embrace, reached down and lifted the scrotum before letting it drop, an audible sloshing ringing out over the roar of the shower. Cinder moaned, the feeling of it pleasurable and painful at the same time. Ashfall on the other hand began to pulse, his bioluminescence becoming bright before it began to retreat like a receding river, draining from his toes before reaching all the way up his body and shining brightly between his lips. He opened his mouth, as did Cinder, as a ball of what looked to be pure light drifted between the lips of the drakes before Cinder reengaged the kiss, pulling the light into himself. A shockwave of light erupted throughout Cinder before fading and leaving the room darker it seemed. They held their embrace a little longer before breaking away and staring at each other fondly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was an experience....why haven't we done something like this before!\" Cinder said happily. Ashfall smiled before slumping against the wall , his scales seemed to have dulled and his eyes were darker. Cinder reached out to balance his mate bur his huge thigh slapped his engorged nuts and he yelped, causing Ashfall to let out a genuine laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we get like this afterwards, dummy.\" He said before looking down at you and smiling with genuine love. \"He's ready to take you in Will, when you come out you'll be in a way a true child of ours, though for what its worth, you will always be a true child of us.\" He said picking you up and planting a kiss on you, flecks of light floating out of his lips as he did so. Cinder came behind and kissed you as well, smooshing you between to dragons lips as they reengaged in a passionate kiss. Cinder however decided he wanted you to himself and slurped you between his teeth, his tongue folding over you, giving you a literal tongue bath before it snaked back through the lips and deposited you back in the palm of Ashfall. You sputtered and looked at the retreating face of Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too much old man.\" You say standing up. He laughed before reaching down and hefting his sack and  letting it bounce, moaning again as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get used to this Ash, look how big my boys are!\" He said wobbling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll get old real fast trust me. Are you ready Will?\" Ashfall said, exhausted. You nod and he bends down, using the tub lip as a brace. You look on at the mammoth sack you were about to spend months within. Either excitement or training caused Cinder to begin to become erect as Ashfall gripped the cock and gingerly placed your feet into the slit, you were aggresively sucked in, catching you and your fathers off guard as the groin of Cinder had been waiting eagerly to begin its care of its guest. You slid down the urethra, wet noises all around before being tossed into a clear liquid. A dull bio light, an orangish gold, glowed within, allowing you to be able to see all the way to the bottom, a container that was some thirty feet deep. You turn around to return to the surface to breath, but the way you came had sealed up. You panicked and began to bang on the roof of the vessel, causing the walls of your pops to shudder in response. You let your breath out, you hadn't even been inside for a minute and you were already drowning. The liquid poured into your lungs, and you began to sink, your chest felt as if you were going to explode as....you could breath normally. You blink and look around, your chest going from pain to ache in a few seconds, before becoming a pleasant feel, what was more was how energetic you felt. You swam around and approached a wall, stretching out a hand and rubbing it, it twitched in response and appeared smooth compared to the walls you had previously seen within cinder....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder groaned as he stepped out of the shower, placing a hand to the top of his engorged sack. \"He thrashing already Ash, I think he's panicking should I get him out?\" He said turning to his exhausted mate, who shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once a human goes in, they can't come out until delivery. He probably thinks hes drowning, in my stupidity I didn't tell him he could breath the fluid within. I feel terrible as he is probably thinking hes about to die, but he won't. I should have told him.\" Ashfall said sitting down on the toiled to rest, the stepping over the tub lip at already taken the energy out of him. Cinder braced against a wall and rubbed at his sack, feeling sorry for Will. The thrashing subsided and Cinder couldn't help but think Will had drowned, despite what Ashfall had said. A soft pleasant feeling emanating from the middle of his right nut told him his son was alive, and he let out a sigh. Cinder continued to lovingly rub his balls, before asking Ashfall another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's in righty, why is lefty filled up as well?\" He said. Ashfall stood up slowly and continued to walk like an old human man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The liquid is constantly circulating, and your other testicle acts as a sort of kidney, cleansing the liquid as well as revitalizing it, also at random times that dragons don't even understand, the human is transferred through a passage near the top of your scrotum and pulled into the other one, and the roles reverse. I'm gonna warn you there Cinder, the feeling puts alot of pressure on your prostate, and you may shoot some excess liquid out, making it seem like you wet yourself, there's no way to tell its coming, so just stay home as much as possible. Anyway lets get something to eat....</span></div></div>",

Ash followed behind him, hobbling and using the walls to support his weight, the couple looking like a bunch of humans in their twilight years. Ash collapsed into a chair at the dining table as Cinder once again donned his apron and nothing else, making his way slowly around the kitchen and beginning to pan cook some steaks, as well as prepare mashed potatoes and several other side dishes. He licked his lips as he threw three steaks on for himself, and Ash noted it from his position slumped in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn, thats alot of meat.\" The grey and gold Drake murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's alot of me.\" Cinder replied. \"Besides there's two mouths to feed now over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True\" Ash said, seeming to forget everything they had covered, his dull scales occasionally flickering like a dead lightbulb as his body attempts to reboot his light. Cinder finished the meals and walked over to the table and served the dish to Ashfall, who began eating in a fashion that said he wasn't in a hurry. Cinder however was done with everything in a heartbeat. Ashfall eyed the clean plate. \"You are gonna be a fatass when this is all done, I hope you know that.\" Ashfall stated. Cinder chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nonsense, I may have to adjust my workout plan, but it shouldn't be hard to continue staying this sexy.\" He said with a smile. Ashfall smiled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let me hear you say that in the morning.\" The grey drake sighed and peeked under the table, where the Cinder's apron had ridden up and sitting on the chair between his thighs was his bulbous balls that wobbled with every movement the large Drake made. \"In all my years, I've never been more excited for a human than now, though I feel bad he has to be carried around by a baffoon like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Speaking of carrying humans around, what about that Isaac guy I shot up your ass.\" Cinder said picking his teeth with his claws, the fangs faintly glowing as light shined from the Drakes gums. Ashfall groaned and clenched his rear, feeling a squirming sensation as he did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still up there, probably glamour free again, You did suck it all out of me, and he WAS inside of me, so hell you probably ate his soul too Cinder.\" Ashfall said and Cinder laughed, but when he saw Ashfall didn't join him he trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...We can do that? Why can we do that, what do we gain?\" Cinder said, clueless as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, we can, if thats the case, your body won't be taxed as much to shape Will, it also has the juice of a human soul powering it. We can consume souls on top of flesh, it feeds out light, gives us more oomph to our glamour. Remember those cult followings in the Dark Ages? Those dragons who had humans worship and pay tribute were able to influence and pull in travelers who didn't even know the Dragons were in the area. Humans called it the Dark Ages because of other tribulations, we called it the Dark Ages because we were taking the Humans light.\" Ashfall said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So in the end we did kill that Isaac guy.\"  Cinder said curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No the human soul is different from ours, Our soul and our Body are the same. Human souls grow separate of their physicality, from experiences and relationships, what we essentially did was make Isaac into a hollow vessel, hes back to square one and will have to forge bonds and make experiences if he wants to be what defines a human again. He has his memories, but they aren't worth anything to him anymore.\" Ashfall said grunting and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perfect, he has no sentiments for us, lets kick him out now.\" Cinder said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, thats a bad thing now, if we let him leave, telling others about what has happened to him here and whatever he heard about Will gives him no remorse. There's no emotional restraint that tells him he'd lose his relation with Will and by extent us if he does that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...So we what, babysit him and give him fond memories of us so he doesn't tattle?\" Cinder said collecting dishes and standing up, his balls bouncing as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Precisely.\" Ash grumbled. \"So in a sense, we gotta adopt him too for a time, until he has enough of himself to go off and not tell on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True, but he would have no reason or fondness to go back to his family, they're meaningless to him now, he wouldn't wanna leave.\" Cinder said washing the dishes. Ash went to reply but stopped, Cinder was right. Fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well two options then Cinder, we either throw him out now and cross our fingers, or we get another son.\" Ashfall said putting his head in his hands. Cinder looked at his mate with a pouting lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's gonna sound weird for it to come from me but I say we take him in, if he becomes Dragonkin you're gonna carry him though.\" Cinder said laughing, Ash didn't join him, he instead reached up his rear and dug a finger in, grunting at the discomfort it caused with no water or lubrication. CInder turned and rose an eyebrow at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ash would you mind keeping that in the bedroom, this is where we EAT.\" Ashfall ignored him as he felt Isaac crawling a little deeper in him to evade capture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac kicked at the clawed digit that had come to get him, he remembered where he was but he didn't know why he was here? What had compelled him to risk life to end up in a dragons ass? There was no emotion that went with the memory, no ambition or urge. And now the dragon had come for him and all that filled Isaac was fear. He scrambled up the walls of the tight fleshy cavern, the walls taut as the dragon tried to keep from clenching up, as that would make retrieving Isaac impossible. A claw nicked him and he hollered in pain, something began to trickle down his calf and fight or flight was in full effect. The wound he just earned would get infected in no time within the rectal walls of a dragon no doubt, so if he didn't let the dragon get him, he'd just die a slow death in here...or come out with the next bowel movement. Isaac curled into a ball and let the digit press him down and drag him back down the smooth surface and with a pop cold air met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I think I scrapped him- Ah shit I did get him, get me the peroxide and some Q-tips Cinder.\" Isaac unfurled himself and looked up at the Great Grey Drake that stared at him. Having a being that immense focus completely on you was humbling. Booming foot falls could be heard and a sight out of a fairytale came into view, a Dragon in an Apron. The sight was so queer that Isaac almost laughed. The Drake that Isaac recalled as Cinder yawned and placed the things the Grey Drake requested down, what was his name? Ashfall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go, damn you did get him real good.\" Cinder said leaning in to look at Isaac, his warm breath washed over him and made him shudder, the enormous lips of the Orange drake parted and showed countless fangs the size of a large man gleaming under the kitchen light. Isaac shuddered as he recalled the enormous gullet that awaited past those teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Isaac, bud, I'm gonna need you to stretch that leg out, this is gonna burn ALOT.\" Isaac knew that and stretched the leg as a Q-tip with a strong antiseptic scent bumped into the wound, causing Isaac to cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just great, first thing he experiences out of you is fear and pain, father of the year ladies and gents.\" Cinder said acting like hes holding a mic in one hand and his other outstretched towards Ashfall, who hissed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go be pregnant and annoying somewhere else Cinder, I'm working here.\" The grey drake grumbled. Cinder shrugged and took off the apron, and right away Isaac felt a tug in his pants as he remembered why he risked it. Cinder was extremely fit, with enormous pecs and a powerlifters gut. But something was different. His uncut cock sat atop his humongous balls, balls that were now the size of a small melon. And Ashfall had said he was pregnant....but he was a guy? As Cinder turned away and showed his gigantic ass, Isaac finally spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean he's pregnant?\" Cinder turned around and looked Ashfall with pressed lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice Ash, real nice.\" He said with a slow clap and walked out of the kitchen. Ashfall said nothing for a minute, he was too busy cleaning the wound he had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's pregnant with Will, Isaac.\" Ash said setting down the Q-tip and picking up a bandage that was as big as Isaacs arm, carefully and expertly wrapping Isaacs leg with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How is that possible? Will is already born, and Cinder is a dude, dudes don't give birth.\" Isaac said admiring the bandaging. Ash rubbed his temples obviously exhausted by the ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll explain it all later. You've got school tomorrow, so you need to get some rest. You can use Wills room, and you're the same clothes size as him. Text your parents that you're spending another night at Will's. I'll give you a run down of everything in the morning but I need rest, I'm sorry for not being clear...\" Ashfall said gingerly picking up Isaac and taking him to the bedroom. He opened up the nightstand before setting Isaac down in it. Isaac looked up but the drawer had deftly been pushed in, leaving him alone in a dim room...</span></div></div>",

Your underbelly is dark purple, silver eyes, large wings and red spade tip at the end of your tail. Your attire was fairly modest, a dark blue longcoat with holes for your wings, blue jeans, wrist band on your left wrist and red sash around your waist, and of course the necklace you wore as a lucky charm. Truth be told, your necklace doubled up as a way to carry a human should the desire ever come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a late night and you were up late working on a case. Humans had been disappearing all over the city. And not just in the dragon distract. Sure many of your kin didn't care but you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your eyes tiredly as you read through all the known cases. Every report detailed a different human and where they were last seen. Past that there was usually not much to go off of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard movement near your feet and looked down. A smile formed on your face as you saw your boyfriend trying to climb onto your foot. \"Need a hand, Lukas?\" You ask as you watched him struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas smirked. \"No, no, I got this.\" He responds as he finally manages to pull himself onto your big toe. He sits there catching his breath for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and leaning over, taking him in your claw and setting him on your chest. He looks at the case files sprawled out across the coffee table and looks at you. \"More cases?\" He asks, to which you nod. Lukas was worried every day, fearing he might be next. And you worried to. That was why you had to solve the disappearances. You felt Lukas snuggle into your chest. \"What if I'm next?\" He whimpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't happen. I'll protect you.\" You said softly. You casually look down at him and smile. \"Get some sleep Lukas, no need for you to be up all night with me.\" You say as you gently picked up your boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was clad in his light blue t shirt, and his shorts. Everything was blue. His eyes were like sapphires and even his hair was dark blue. He yawns as you tuck him into his sleeping spot for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, gently rocking your snoozing boyfriend to sleep within your bellybutton. With a sip from your coffee you go back to reading the reports and case files. There was no pattern that you could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the humans had anything in common. And none were in the same places when they vanished. You shook your head and decided to get some rest before your shift in six hours. It was going to be a boring patrol day but it meant you could think about the missing persons cases.</span></div></div>",

Lukas had joined you, both of you knowing no one would notice he was there. He sat in the \"charm\" hanging from your necklace and looked about, enjoying your time together. You knew the real reason was he didn't want to be alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your patrol, you found yourself stopping at a diner where one of the missing humans had disappeared. Lukas winced at the thought of going inside but you assured him it'd be fine. As you entered, you grabbed a menu and gave it a look over. You weren't actually hungry but were more wondering if by chance human was on the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wouldn't just announce it. It'd be one of those Special menus.\" Lukas says, knowing where your mind was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and set the menu down but still took a seat at the counter. A waitress, pink dragon, stayed up to you and smiled. \"Hello good looking, what can we get for your today?\" She asks with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plain coffee, please.\" You respond as you pick up the newspaper from the counter. She skates off and soon returns with the coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a hunch something wasn't right as you took subtle glances about the diner. It wasn't crowded. And the food smelled horrible but the few patrons present seemed like they couldn't get enough of the meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress skates up to again. \"Anything else for ya today, Sugar?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk. You had an idea but it might be frighten Lukas a little. He'd forgive you, you reasoned before turning to the pink dragoness. \"Now somewhere where a guy might be able to...\" you pause and whisper the last bit to her. \"get a freshly caught human cooked up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas begins struggling hard in the little cage. Either he's picked up on your plan and is playing along, or he's fearing for his life. The waitress gives you a dark smirk as she leans in close. \"I'm sure Cooky could make just the thing.\" She says with a wink before skating off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly send a text to your partner on the force who was only a block away. Requesting his presence immediately to the diner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress soon returns as hands you a small slip of paper. It had a handful of dishes that were prepared with human as the main ingredient. You took your time eyeing the menu, trying to stall for your partner to arrive. Just as you were about to be forced into a choice, you hear the dragon you were waiting for enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, he's made his arrests and turns his attention to you. \"Just patrolling, eh Morgan?\" He asks. His scales are dark green and his uniform is a standard issued police uniform. He laughs slightly before pointing at your necklace. \"Think you might need to tell Lukas something.\" He laughs before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance down and your eyes widen at the sight. Lukas had blanked out from fear and worry. \"Lukas!\" You call down before sliding the little guy into your hand. He seems to be coming around from your voice. With a sigh of relief you explain that it was just a ruse. He yells at you for a bit and you just stand there and take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, you head over to the agency you worked for and checked in with your higher ups. Stowed away in the kitchen were a handful of the missing humans. But several more were still missing. </span></div></div>",

You made dinner and left some on a human sized plate for your boyfriend. You sat in your chair, staring blankly at the plate for awhile. You picked at your food but weren't overly hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late and you still just sat in your chair. You were beginning to nod off when you were startles awake. \"So, if you ever decided to eat me, how would you do it?\" Lukas asked as he walked over. His tone suggested something else was on his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly jumped from his sudden question. \"What?! Where's this coming from?! I told you it was just a ruse to get intel.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas indicated the notes you had taken. \"They said only a handful of missing persons were recovered. There's several still missing. If you're going to crack this case, you're going to have to think more like other dragons.\" He says as he climbs the chair and sits on your lap, directly above your bulge. \"So let's get thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your chin and close your eyes trying to think in a mindset many of kin thought in. \"Most dragons see humans as bugs, insignificant things. I doubt eating is the only thing they'd do.\" You murmur as you ponder things. You wince slightly as you felt Lukas reposition. Glancing down, you saw he had managed to unzip your jeans and get under your boxers. You pull your boxers down and stare at him. \"Lukas, what're you---\" you're cut off by the human pressing his hand against your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, Morgan. You're a big powerful dragon, no regard for human safety. And I'm a tiny human that you snatched from the streets. What would you do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light bulb finally went off in your head.

And so far it was looking like a bust. That was until you saw a crimson dragon walking around. He carried a cage in his right hand, and there was no mistaking it, it was full of humans. You took a few pictures to have evidence. Before you could get the jump on him, you saw the most startling bit to the case's development. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner, the green dragon walked up to the crimson dragon. You couldn't hear what was being said but you made certain to take a couple of pictures for evidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed in, and easily managed to beat down both suspects before taking them into custody. Your boss at the agency looked over the evidence the moment you were back at the agency. He handled all the paperwork and told you to take some time to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to your house, you saw the door was kicked in.

As you darted to the next room over, you were hit hard over the head and fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan Ebonscald, is it?\" you heard someone ask. Your vision was fading in and out as was your hearing. \"Let me make this abundantly clear, you try anything, you make a move on my business, you try anything to my boys, and I'll make sure your put through such a hell, that you'll wish you were dead.\" A large midnight purple dragon said. He towered over you and kicked you a few times in the stomach before slamming your face against the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely heard Lukas scream, and tried to get up. A kick to your cheek sent you to the ground and three more kicks to your stomach and face, left you barely able to stay conscious. You soon blanked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nWhen you awoke hours later, you were alone. You dragged yourself to your phone that had fallen out of your pocket during everything. The screen was badly damaged but it still worked. You managed to call for help but the damage was done.

If they went after you like that, you were close. You were getting close. But with five weeks of nothing on investigating, it meant you were probably back to square one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking the empty streets, everything felt much lonelier nowadays.

You're a big powerful dragon, no regard for human safety. And I'm a tiny human that you snatched from the streets. What would you do?\" He had added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused in your tracks and thought for a bit. That wasn't too far off from how you two started.

A side of yourself you ignored existed. But it was also the side of you that you needed if you were going to make up for five weeks of no investigation.

As long as you got Lukas back, you could justify whatever you were going to do. You went back home and changed into something more befitting of the route you were going.

He was a stray human who was running from another dragon when he ran into you that fateful night. You were deep undercover as you were handling a case regarding drugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, snapping you out of your daydream. As you walked the streets of Sector 09, you paused as you came upon a series of old warehouses. The memories started playing. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nYou had been undercover for about two months and it was finally paying off. This was your chance to apprehend Drake Willow, the drug lord who had a strong hold on the city. His drugs were simple but effective. They made dragons behave irrationally, aggressive but gave them quite the pleasuring sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilson should be here any minute now.\" One of Drake's lackies said as he kept look out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night blurred for a bit until the human ended up running right into your foot. You glared down at the pathetic creature as he tried to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that? A human. Wonder what this little morsle is doing here.\" The same lackie stated as he pinched the human between his nails and lifted him up. He snickered slightly as he looked the human up and down. \"I'm gonna eat him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned, slamming your tail into him and snatching the humam for yourself. \"He ran into me, he's mine.\" You growled as you held the human tightly in your claw. No sooner had the words left your mouth did you toss the human in and proceed to toy with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shi---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentledragons, welcome.\" Drake Willow stated as he walked up. He was shorter than you expected. He looked at you and paused. \"Give the tiny morsle some dignity, either chew him up and be done or swallow him. Its rude to play with your food.\" He said beforr continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed and apologized for the distraction. More of the night blurred until dozens of SWAT and police were storming the sight and the gunfire rang out. You apprehended Drake but had taken a gunshot to you chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your line of work this was normal. At some point you had thrown up and collapsed from blood loss. The human from earlier rushed over to you and inspected the gunshot. He called out for help before climbing into the wound. \"OK bigguy, this is going to hurt a bit.\" He said as he managed to start pushing the bullet out. You roared in pain and bit back a snarl. Soon though, the bullet clattered to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you saw the human using himself to block anymore blood from seeping out. \"Why...?\" You began before loosing consciousness from blood loss. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nSnapping out of the memories, you walked about the warehouses. You came to a stop when a familiar scent entered your nose. Drake Willow. The very same drug lord from all those years ago. Quickly you took cover and snuck about trying to get a better view on things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the cobalt dragon was there. He looked the exact same as he had that night. You had no back up and were very close to the most dangerous drug lord that ever walked the city streets. Another familiar wafted up your nostrils. Lukas. Your eyes went wide as you started putting pieces together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake was in league with whoever was behind the missing humans. Why had he wanted Lukas though? Before you had a chance to think too much, you felt a sting in your tail and glanced over. Some sort of dart was sticking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew some swine would come sniffing around.\" You knew that voice. Wilson, Drake's righthand man. Wilson was a very fit lavaskin dragon and he took pride in his physique. He grabbed you and dragged you over to where Drake was. \"Hey Boss, I got one for the cage match. He's already drugged and ---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake smirked seeing you. \"Been a long time Morgan. You're all I thought about while I was behind bars.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked. \"I'm flattered, perhaps we should just get this tension out.\" You joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake only chuckled as he looked you over. \"There will be time for that later. My buyer wants to see what my new blend does. Sure it takes a little longer to kick in but it packs more than ten times the punch. Wilson, get him in the ring. We've a demonstration to read for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like your head was splitting as you dumped into a caged ring. Your senses were blurred and felt waves of aggression running through you. As you looked over, you saw them dump another dragon into the ring. Then they dropped a human in at the center. The human was tied up, with no chance of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely remembered this from the old days. They'd pit two dragons affected by the drugs against one another and use a human as treat for the winner. Every time, it ended in a dragon death and a human death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentledragons, I give you tonight's demonstration. This match up is between Calvin and my old associate, Morgan.\" Drake said from above the ring. He signaled for the fight to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin was easily twice your size and very fit. But he didn't seem as aggressive as you felt. He had a tinge of green in his eyes, same drug from those years ago. He lunged forward, wanting the human morsle as opposed to you. You on the other hand, riled up with whatever new drug this was, wanted to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged and knocked Calvin to the ground, easily overpowering him. The two of you fought, claw to claw and some biting. There were occasional fire breaths used as you and the other dragon fought. It didn't take too long before Calvin was on the ground in a pool of his own blood. You snarled as you approached. It wasn't good enough for this savage a primal side of you. He was still breathing. You stopped repeatedly on your foe until the breathing stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied roar you now turned your attention to the morsle tied down in the center of the ring. His scent was familiar but in the crazed state you were in, it didn't matter. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nLukas stared in horror at you. He knew had been aggressive about keeping him safe. But this was a whole new side. He had managed to get the gag off and tried to call out to you. \"Morgan! Morgan, stop! It's me!\" He tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou towered over him, your eyes filled with some sort of malice he'd never seen before. You growl deeply as you pin him under your clawed hand. Above Drake and his colleagues watched and made notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake said something to his investors about the effectiveness of the drug. And how it clouded all rational parts of the mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou by this point had siezed Lukas in your jaws. He screamed and flailed as best he could. \"Morgan! Morgan, please don't do this!\" He screams in panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rational mind was trying hard to stop your primal instincts or at least stall out til things worse off. </span></div></div>",

Many were buying the stuff by the dozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake nodded to Wilson, who in turn went to deal with you. You were after all the guy who ended their reign years ago. As you saw the lavaskin dragon approach, you swallowed Lukas, cursing at yourself silently for putting the little guy in the hell that was awaiting him. A hard slap knocked you out and left you on the ground. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nYou awoke many hours later with no recollection of the events from the night. You looked around and found yourself at the park, sleeping on a bench. Slowly you sat up and rubbed your head. As you did so, you felt something moving in your stomach. While it wasn't uncomfortable, it did worry you about what were up to the previous night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back to your house was uneventful and as you entered, you flicked on the news. You grabbed an ice pack from the freezer and held it against your rgaing headache and winced slightly. Sitting on the recliner, you again felt the movement in your stomach. This time causing some discomfort as you winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to ignore it and focus on the news. Another series of disappearences. The news folk saying that the police was doing nothing to stop such. There was brief interview with the captain and most of his answers lead to people and dragons lashing out in anger. The sensation had finally subsided but you felt an added weight in your intestines. It wasn't much but it was noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to stay home and rest as you no memories from the night and assumed you had no new leads. As you were showering you felt and itch in your rear and knew something was off. You scratched for a bit then turned to let the water wash in between your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard someone coughing and gagging from your ass and paled slightly. What the hell had you done during the night?! You pushes slightly forcing your stowaway out a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan...\" it was very weak and tired, but you knew that voice anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought your claw around and pushed harder until you felt someone land in your claw. Bringing your claw around, you saw Lukas laying curled up in your claw. \"Lukas?!\" You beamed as you cleaned him up. He weakly smiles at you before passing out. From what you could gauge, he had a broken rib, fractured arm and lots of bruises. You sank to your knees wondering if you had done that to him. Even if done unintentional, it was still your fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you took him to a doctor in this condition, you'd be tried as a human abuser. Or worse. Looking down, you felt Lukas begin to stir. \"Lukas!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan...?\" He slowly opens his eyes and looks up at you. He smiles slightly seeing your concerned silver eyes. \"Don't worry, none of these were your fault.\" He says softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Who did this to you? And how did you end up inside of me?\" You ask, concern in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas slowly sits up, leaning back your fingers. You set him on the bathroom counter and do what you can to treat his wounds while he explains what he'd been through the past five weeks. His was kidnapped, beaten and sold to the highest bidder. From there he was used in many disgraceful ways before managing to runaway. It wasn't long after that that Drake Willow had caught him. He was thrown repeatedly into the ring while two drug happy dragons fought but he had always managed to escape due to lack of restraints on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was last night. He told you about the cage match and how you ate him. He had spent the entire night in your stomach and was unharmed. That was good to know. \"I don't know if you swallowed because I tasted good and you thought I was food. Or if you had snapped back and swallowed as to not lose me. Seeing you as you are now, I'd wager the second.\" He comments as you finish tending to his wounds. Lukas chuckles softly. \"You know, I was always mortified about ending up in your stomach, fearing it was some unimaginable hell and death trap. But it wasn't so bad in there. And thats twice now that you've eaten me.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou werent sure how to react so you just kissed him. You were going to wait til morning, let him rest but he had valuable information to the case. If anyone suspected he was alive, he would targeted. \"Hey Morgan,\" you glance down. \"Can I sleep somewhere in you? Probably safer that way.\" He explains, clearly he'd come to the same conclusion as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sleep anywhere you want.\" You say softly as you pick him up and walk to the bedroom. \"Tomorrow, we'll need to go to the agency and get a statement from ya. But for tonight, you can rest where you want.\" You said as you laid down on the king sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas sheepishly smiles. \"I was thinking, maybe I could sleep in your...\" he paused unable to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas blushes and points to your...</span></div></div>",

He does show kindness to those he deems loyal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBael Zardis <br>\r\n- A yellow European dragon with a horn on the top of his snout.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The choice was a no brainer in your mind. You knew that you had gotten a high score on your servant aptitude test, but still you had to pinch yourself to make sure you weren\u2019t dreaming when Corbus Draken\u2019s name came up on the list. The eponymous dragon of the Draken Empire, who could pass up the opportunity to be in his presence, even if just by being his servant? Without any more thought on the matter, you ticked the box to the left of the emperor's name. You knew you made the right decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a week, you found yourself being transported to the Imperial Palace of the Draken Empire, and the official residence of Corbus and his family. To your surprise, you were not going to be moving off world for your new place in life; the Palace had been moved onto Earth. Apparently, the Dragons, and the Draken family especially, found humanity so interesting and engaging with all it\u2019s flaws and curiosity, that they made Earth the new capital planet. It had to be placed somewhere far away from civilization on barren land however, due to the massiveness of a structure that houses 200 feet dragons with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had spent the better half of the last week inside a box, small enough for a dragon that it could fit in their palm and big enough for you that it doubled as a studio apartment. Despite the fact that the Draken Empire was a space faring civilization that was almost entirely comprised of fantastic creatures, it still had the infamous slog of bureaucracy. Your box had been shifted around from one place to the next, changing dragon hands whilst taking care not to disturb the delicate cargo inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finally arrived at the Imperial Palace, you poked your head out of your little box window to see it in person. The great sight was comprised of six thick, square towers that dwarfed everything below them, connected by enormous, heavy walls made of brilliant white. Elaborate, stained glass windows were placed across the walls geometric patterns, along with holes and sniper\u2019s nests for artillery<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon who was carrying your box, passed through the massive metal doors and entered the building proper. The whole interior was decorated with remnants of past victorious battles, from broken swords and shields to rusting energy rifles and shock grenades. After filling in a short security form, you were once gain exchanged to another dragon\u2019s hands and carried to the great throne room. Magnificent braziers attached to one side of each of the six ivory columns light up every part of the throne hall and bathe the hall in a dancing glow of orange. The gems of the many artworks on the embowed ceiling dance in the flickering light while marble icons and statuettes look down upon the grey wood floor of the majestic hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon walked his bare feet across the cobalt rug that ran from the throne. You held your breath, excitement and a twinge of nervousness coming up on you in an instant. You didn\u2019t realize that you were feeling this anxious; of what is to come in your new duties or for you to start the, you did not know. Finally, the collapsible ceiling of your little box was opened, and you allowed yourself to be gently picked up in between the courier dragon\u2019s two fingers. You were hoisted up into the air, and the first sight you saw...was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting atop his majestic throne of obsidian in front of a lavish gate of gilden wood, was Corbus Draken, his dazzling ruby red eyes piercing right into your soul. You failed to suppress a gasp as you took the sight of him in. He was...breathtaking. His muscular, defined body sank comfortably into the plush, cobalt pillows that adorned the throne. He only wore polished, gilden leg guards, leaving the rest of his body bare to your eyes. The great emperor gave an amused chuckle as he noticed your reaction, and brought forwards his open hands. Before you realized it, you had been placed inside his grip, and the courier was motioned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just you and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, my little human.\u201d Corbus greeted you in a thick, heavy voice that boomed in your ears and shook your body. \u201cI assume you already know who I am?\u201d He gave you a prideful grin, clearly knowing of your flustered emotions caused by his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-yes!\u201d You stuttered out a response, finding it disturbingly difficult to force the words out of your throat. \u201cY-your Corbus Draken, the Emperor of the Draken Empire, and...and your amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorbus\u2019s smile grew even larger, his heart swelling further up with pride and adoration for his little servant. \u201cHmmm, I can\u2019t seem to argue with you on that! And you...do you know who you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...I am your servant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy servant?\u201d Corbus echoed, almost tasting the words coming off of his lips. \u201cIs that all, my wittle human? Is that all you are, my personal slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY...yes.\u201d You respond after a couple seconds of hesitation. \u201cThat\u2019s all I am, and it\u2019s all i want to be!\u201d You didn\u2019t mean for you to say that last remark with such enthusiasm. It just came out...naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorbus let out a sigh of sheer contentment and brought you up to his draconian muzzle. You found yourself being nuzzled by the great emperor's red scales. They were hard as diamonds and soft as cotton at the same time, emanating a great warmth that made you at ease. You did your best to reciprocate the gesture, spreading your limbs out as far as they went and hugged as much as your new master\u2019s flesh as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou certainly are the eager one, my little human\u201d Corbus purred, delighting in his new servant\u2019s antics. \u201cI was going to give you a day to prepare before I asked you to do anything...but I don\u2019t think that will be necessary.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Corbus have you do first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Your test score came back in the low 90's, Meaning you weren't high enough to serve the royal family, but high enough to serve someone of high authority in the palace. \"Good enough!\" you exclaim as you send your response back and begin preparing for your new life serving your leaders. Your parents weren't sure what to think of the lifestyle you were choosing as the mortality rate in the royal palace servants was pretty high. You assured them that was caused by the prince who you probably wouldn't even react with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Finally the day came where a white dragon with a box that looked like a human house with a handle on it came to take you to the palace. As you climbed into the box and were whisked away from home you began to wonder who you were serving under. Bael Zardis the Head Advisor? Golmur Virin the leader of the Kings Armada? You couldn't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After two days of travel you found yourself entering the palace and exchanging innumerable hands, seeing more dragons in an hour than you had in your entire life. Finally you were passed off to some juvenile page that scurried into a dark room and set you on a table next to an enormous bed. Before you could ask the page dragon who this room belonged to he scurried out of the room and closed the door. You sighed and examined the dim room closer. All the furniture seemed to be made of obsidian and dark woods, with the edges of them laced in silver.  You squinted at the door and noticed an armor stand next to it, excitement swelled in you. Was this a Kings Guard room? Or maybe the generals? Though you didn't make it high enough to serve the king, if your new master takes you with him there is a high possibility of meeting the king!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  While you were daydreaming and hanging out your window, the doorknob twisted and light from the hallway poured into the dim room. You were momentarily blinded and covered your eyes from the blinding source. Once you regained your sight you looked on with reverence at your master but almost died on the spot form terror when you realized who it was. Arthur Darbel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The enormous drake scanned the empty room with silver eyes, picking up the slightest hint that something was off about his room. He turned to his right, presumably speaking to a guard posted outside his door. \"Foryn, who entered my room without my consent, the air is stirred a bit.\" He said this biting off every end of the words he spoke, his voice smooth but as sharp as the ornamental blade on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The guard hesitated, \"A purple page my Lord, he had a delivery for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Arthur snorted and nodded, striding a little ways into the room and then closed the door and locked it, then flicked on the light, letting you see the enormous chamber better. The walls were black marble with hints of white in it and the ceiling was lined with carvings of battle scenes, a silver figure stood out in all the portraits, presumably Arthur and all his feats he had done in battle. Your vision drifted back to Arthur only for you to gasp and turn red with embarrassment. Arthur Had already taken off his chest and arm guards and was in the process of taking off his leg guards and the pats underneath them. A second later the large drake stood there naked as if to let you admire his physique. His enormous thick legs rippled every time he shifted, his thighs were wider around than your parents house and his huge rear could crush your parents house with one cheek. His tail was stocky and muscular at the base of his lower back and his upper back contorted in a majestic way as he polished his breast plate. Looking back on his rear you could see the inside of his glutes were white and so was the underside of his tail. As you observed this he turned around and looked towards his bed, his already tight gaze narrowing as he finally noticed the box house on his nightstand. The drake turned around completely and began to slowly make his way towards your box, you were too enamored by his body to panic or move, the white scales covered his enormous pectorals and ran down his belly, which wasn't a six pack but a muscle gut like you had seen on strong men. below his gut swung an enormous package many many times bigger than you, his dick at least 20 feet flaccid and balls the size of a dump truck. When said junk bumped into the night stand and cast you in shadow was when you realized this could be your end. Before you could react Arthur didn't open, but ripped your roof off, exposing your small form to this god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What the hell are you doing in here?! I didn't request a servant! Much less a bug. You got five seconds before i eat you or worse...\" Arthur said, his chin resting on his chest as his silver eyes burned you with their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm sorry my Lord! there was an opening to serve in the palace and I took it! Maybe I've been delivered to the wrong room?\" You say from a fetal position and not making eye contact. Arthur huffed, steam billowing from his snout through his nose and slightly bared teeth. His eyes drifted form you to something to the left of your now dilapidated house. He grabbed what sounded like piece of paper and read what was on it under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"To my good friend Arthur....To help with stress....tend to you....Emperor Drakon.\" Arthur furrowed his brow. \"You aren't in the wrong room runt, the Emperor got me you to be my personal servant, be it body servant or whatever i deem needed at the moment. I typically tend myself so this must be a ruse to make me like bugs more since apparently we are staying on this planet and not wiping you out or turning you into cattle.\" Arthur crumbled up the paper and dropped it inside your box. As you moved out of the way of the falling paper boulder, two enormous digits squeezed the life out of you and lifted you out of the box a little to fast, a gasp escaped you and suddenly you found yourself freefalling. You scream as you fall, and think back on all your parents said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm sorry Mom.\" you think to yourself between screams only to his something extremely soft. You pull your self out of a small crater you made in what appears to be Arthurs bed sheets. You sit up and look around to see Arthur lifing up your box and carrying it over to the door and setting it down next to the wall. Even being terrified of him beyond belief you still couldn't help but to stare at his enormous ass as it rippled and jiggled slightly as he leaned down. standing up again he opened the door and requested the guard and requested supper to be brought to his room. You remember reading that nudity is completely accepted and actually preferred among dragons so the guard not reacting to his nude Lord was understandable. Arthur closed the door and made his way back to the bed. Upon locating you among the sheets he sneered at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't get comfy now, I'm still deciding if i even want you around or not. So I'll give you a chance, dinner will be here for me in thirty minutes, you have that long to impress me or I'm thanking my Emperor for the snack.\" You scurry out of the way as Arthur climbs on the bed and lays down sideways, propping his head up with his arm and looking down at you with a smile that told you he saw this as a fight and he intended to win it. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Remembering you still carried the scale brush in the bag you had strapped to your waist, you studied Arthurs face then his chest and shoulders for a second. Scars crossed between Scales and some even were wide enough that if the wound was still open you could easily slip inside. But what you were focused on was the gleam of his scales, and while Arthurs scales shone pretty well, you knew from the classes you took that they could be much brighter than they were. Dragons were all about pride and image, and if you could make this godly beast shine in such a way that his skin might as well be his treasure, then that could be your ticket to breath another day. You had to handle this gently however, Arthur could take great offense from you cleaning him despite him stating he takes care of that himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have you roll onto your stomach and let me clean your face my Lord? It seems a long days work guarding our Emperor has cast it with a film of dust.\" You say in the most humble voice you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur all but hissed at you and bared his fangs. \"In the face of death, you not only command me, but insult me as well? The only reason you aren't a smear on my foot is because I promised you 30 minutes. Think of it as a probationary period, never ask of me for anything! My comfort will never be compromised for your convenience.\"<br>\r\n  Arthur said this as he brought his snout down to you, baring his teeth, hot breath spilling out and damping your clothes. Despite literally being about to shit yourself, you take this opportunity to quickly dash forward and leap upwards towards Arthurs snout, your feet landing on his curled lip and using it as a makeshift trampoline to propel yourself into the air and grabbing onto the soft skin above his upper lip. Tiny pockets and crevices that dragons can barely see in their scaly skin act as handholds as you quickly climb up the few feet and lift yourself onto Arthurs snout. Classes in becoming a Dragon Servant were heavily focused on acrobatics and gymnastics, as keeping your grip on the shoulder of a 200 foot dragon is life or death. You look up to lock eyes with the Goliath Drake, who's eyes meet you with a surprised and astonished expression. They quickly narrow and silver fire broils behind his eyes.<br>\r\n  \"You just outwitted me and used my own arrogance to accomplish a goal, small of a goal it may be....\" Arthur shifted himself on the bed so he was now lying on his back in bed. \"You have my attention and an ounce of respect from me human, and also 28 minutes left, show me what you can do.\"<br>\r\n  You nod and instantly use the brush to begin cleaning his snout in an accurate and professional manner, quickly finding out Arthurs scale pattern, and cleaning it in the most efficient way possible. within no time you had already polished up his snout and were rubbing between his eyes. On your test and in training this went much faster because the models and dragons you trained on were normal sized, Arthur had Fifty feet on a normal sized dragon, and he wasn't covered in the curriculum because everyone assumed he wasn't ever going to be a possible master. You pondered this as you cleaned the top of his head and the base of his Ivory horns. Arthur worked with you as you began work on the sides of his face, rotating his head a good bit so you worked on an incline rather than a cliff. Arthur was silent the whole time, but his eye tracked you the whole time, you ignored it for the most part, but the few times you locked with them, they were filled with amusement and interest.<br>\r\n  Cleaning became a little harder and slower as you worked down his neck and began working on his chest, as the flesh gave under your pushing and made you spend twice as much time working on each plate. Arthurs gaze still followed you as you wiggled your way into the cleft between his pectorals, this is where you started to find a little neglect on his part. The soft scales within here must be hard to properly clean for a giant like himself, as there was a bit of dryness to the skin in here. Struggling for a second to move your arm behind you in the tight confines of Arthurs cleft you retrieve a bottle of moisturizer from your bag an begin to apply it as you scrub. As you guessed the skin soaked it right up, you kept applying it as you went until you finally squeezed out at the bottom of his pecs and were met with the large expanse that was Arthurs mighty belly. The round muscles of it rising and falling as the Titan breathed slowly, a good sign that you had relaxed him. Breaking from your trance, you turned back to begin work on top of his pectorals. Quickly scaling on top of the left one, you set to work to make the white scales to shine like pearls and marble. You couldn't help but compliment yourself at a job well done so far as a quick glance at Arthurs face and shoulders confirmed that you had made a substantial difference, the black scales shining brighter than the walls of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Your pride deflated fast when the door of the room opened and in walked two red dragon servants hauling a serving table of assorted dishes. They walked to the middle of the room and stopped before turning with their hands clasped in front of them and waited to be commanded by the nude warrior on the bed. One of the dragons spotted you on Arthurs Chest and raised both of his brows and made a strange expression but he didn't say anything. You turned and looked at Arthur, and waited for him to judge you and condemn you to his stomach or bottom of his foot. When you looked at him however he had his head back and eyes closed, a relaxed expression on his face. At you stopping at your work however he opened his eyes and narrowed them at you before turning to do the same at the servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Just leave the food there Gentledrakes, I'll serve myself after my servant finishes up.\" Arthur says as he waves them off with a lazy hand before closing his eyes again. The servants bow and turn to leave, the one who noticed you before turned as he walked out, wearing a sorrowful expression for you. When the door closed you turned and looked at Arthurs face again, and after a moment he opened his eyes again and narrowed them at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What? Why have you stopped?\" He says in a dissatisfied tone.You hesitate before saying.<br>\r\n  \"Well...dinner is here and that's how long I had, aren't you going to judge me? Eat me? Something along the lines of that?\" You say in a guarded tone. The Drake sneered and sat up a little more, obviously agitated now.<br>\r\n  \"If you're expecting me to say I was wrong or that I lost don't hold your breath, I've just decided to postpone judgement on you. Continue to do well and I'll consider keeping you around. For now continue what you were doing, I'll comply with your commands as long as they are completely for the benefit of me.\" As Arthur says this your heart skips a beat, not only are you not going to die, but you might be the first human servant to ever serve Arthur Darbel, head of the Emperor Guard and Royal Executioner. You happily continue cleaning, having no problems as you finish his chest, work down his mighty belly, then ask him to flip over and do the ebony expanse of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After cleaning his back however, the tricky part of his lower body comes into play, Your first spot to venture into would be</span></div></div>",

Cleaning in a drakes rump was always tricky as its hard to see in there of course but also if a drake moves or flexes his ass too much he can hurt or even kill you, not to mention Arthur was a good deal bigger than any dragon you've ever worked on so you were gonna be in there longer. You're scared to clean in there as well because most dragons are hesitant about having a human between their cheeks but once they get a cleaning in there it's their favorite part of the grooming.You turn around and look back at the head of the battle worn Alphadrake, he had his arms crossed underneath his chin, to keep his head propped up but you were sure his eyes closed. You take a breath and trek up his back again, your reflection seen in his now mirrored scaled skin. You work barefoot as it doesn't scuff up your work and you can feel the tension in the flesh beneath you which indicates things like pleasure and pain from the drake as you work. As you were halfway up his back his head turned and his eye slowly opened, it locked onto you and had a questioning light in it. You clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Next spot would be your rump my Lord, I need your permission to...get in there as its a bit of a sensitive spot, and I'll go ahead and ask for permission to clean your privates in general.\" You say all this in the most dignified voice you could muster. The Drake gains a bit of a quizzically concerned expression before answering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm, do as you need to Human, I have no qualms with the front side of me but be careful in the back, that's a bit of a foreign concept to me.\" He says while staring at his large butt. You nod and ask him to shift his tail to the side and he comply's, sliding the muscular limb off of his ass and draping it off the bed. You walk back down to his ass, and decide to start on his right cheek, the soft scaly flesh giving a bit as you pressed down with your cleaning. As you worked up and down the large fatty muscle Arthur actually helped you by rotating his hips depending on your position, it wasn't much but you appreciated it as when you worked close to his crack the incline could make you slip into it and you weren't ready to work in there at this second. When you finally finished cleaning the hill of fat and muscle on his right side you decide to take a shortcut and try to leap over his crack to get to the left cheek.

Darkness envelopes you and the white scales of the Drakes inner cheeks appear dark grey in the near pitch black darkness. Your descent slows as the cheeks come closer together and Arthur clenches slightly at the sudden intrusion you caused. You take handfuls of the flesh around you and try to pull yourself up but find trouble making any progress. A grumble runs throughout your new cushiony prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cHuman do you require any assistance?

Using the now solid flesh as leverage, you wiggled your way up through the darkness until your head emerged into the silvery light of the ebony room. Your shoulders however weren\u2019t so cooperative and stayed wedge as the fleshy mounds encasing you gyrated slightly as Arthur propped himself on one elbow and turned his upper body to gaze at your predicament. A clawed hand rested itself on the right ass cheek as Arthur showed you his very first toothy smile, his butt still not relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c I must say Human you look rather at home down there, I wasn\u2019t too fond of the idea of a bug going around my asshole but I can see the benefits now.

You stammer out a plea for reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c My lord I beg of you, let me at least finish my work and then I\u2019ll happy to experiment with you in anyway you desire, while your scales are always flawless, you must admit the skin I\u2019ve treated is looking like borderline perfection, and I\u2019d hate to see you walk around with a lopsided cleaning.\u201d You finish this hoping your attempted persuasion isn\u2019t taken as an insult. Arthur\u2019s face goes from enjoyment to scrutinizing as he looks at his cheek his hand rested on to his left cheek which you hadn\u2019t treated yet. After a moment he grunted, sliding his right hand down the interior of his cheek and digging into the flesh around you to pinch your shoulders and pull you out, dropping you on the left cheek before rotating and returning to his prone state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe nights still young, there will be time later for games. Finish up my ass cheek, get inside my crack, clean my thighs and calves, then treat my cock and balls, human, I can see more potential in our relationship now, and will discuss with my fellow royal guards on all the capabilities of their servants but you\u2019ll be my only one. Be honored human.\u201d Arthur says all this as he was breathing into a pillow, making you strain to catch it all. Good news, you weren\u2019t going to die, not on purpose at least. Bad news, you were completely in charge of the largest drakes hygiene, with no releif coming. Worst news, you were his candidate part time sex toy. You hang your head and concentrate on the cheek that almost popped your head off a moment ago and get back to work, using your hands and knees to scrub off dead skin and flakes of dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After 20 minutes you found yourself sliding down the underside of the cheek and found yourself gripping at the loose skin of Arthur\u2019s taint, his bulbous balls resting on the sheets, like a enormous bean bag ready to catch you if you fall off. As your hands dug into Arthur\u2019s skin, he responded to your approach to his crack by spreading his legs apart slowly, loosening up his cheeks so you can maneuver inside more easily. Before entering however you went ahead and treated and cleaned up and down his taint to avoid having to back track later. After getting so low to the point you were cleaning his balls you decided it was time to go back inside the canyon of his ass. Before ascending however a muffled voice came from what you swore was coming from underneath you inside Arthur\u2019s Sack. You stop for a second but hear nothing else and return to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When you reach the top of his taint, you are met with the meeting walls of his ass again, taking a deep breath before plunging back into the fleshy depths...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your simple robes found themselves becoming covered in the skin moisturizer as you worked, as the confines were pretty tight. As you worked you contemplated ways to appease this titan some more, and while the title as the Royal Commander's sole servant seemed appealing and you were sure you'd be rewarded generously for your commitment and sacrifice, you still would like at least two other assistants to help. All of the Royal guard had a half dozen or more servants to keep them satisfied, and here you were, fresh out of the academy serving the largest Drake on the planet alone. You shook your head as you scrubbed at the musky skin encompassing you. You were so distracted in thought that you almost planted a foot into Arthur's large fissure that was his anus. The only thing that had stopped you was a slight tension that ran through the walls as Arthur prepared for your contact with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That could've ended poorly.\" You mutter to yourself. At training, one person had stepped into a Drakes ring and found himself sucked in like quicksand,  the dragon had to push him back out after the session was done and he spent a week in the infirmary, more from shock than anything, as the dragon had humans in him before so he knew how to deal with it. But Arthur was unaccustomed to Humans entering his hole and you could end up with broken bones or even crushed to death, not a way you wanted to go. So instead you settled to bend down and pull out a cloth and apply the moisturizer to it before rubbing the rim of the anus, causing it to twitch in response. Tension around you eased up but you couldn't help but feel disappointment radiate from your new lord. Obviously he had been hoping you would step into it, you shivered at the unconscious cruelty Arthur held and continued your work, climbing over the anus before continuing up the crack. After another few minutes you emerged into the cleft that was under Arthur's large tail. Upon feeling your emergence, Arthur grabbed you and carried you over to the dinner trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I wait any longer on you to finish this dinner will be frozen.\" The dragon grumbled, setting you down near a large spoon as he opened up a plate cover, exposing a steamed carcass of some giant bird from another planet. You recoiled at the sight but Arthur inhaled deeply before sighing, grabbing a chair near his dresser and pulling it up to the table. He sat down with a large thump and began to consume the bird with a ravenous intent. You stood there awkwardly, avoiding the grease drops and crumbs that fell, cringing as the juices dribbled down the jaws you had just cleaned. You sigh before turning only to see another set of dinner covers on a table of your size next to a basket of huge bread. You blink before stepping up to it and find a note with your name on it. You open it and gasp lightly as you read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'To the newest member of our Royal Family, I do sincerely apologize for the predicament you've been caught up in, but after reviewing your scores and dependency I decided no other candidate could meet Arthurs standard's without being killed. I hope you make him understand the usefulness and joy that humans can employ to our species by waiting on the big brute. Know that I considered you for myself but decided you would do better to be an ambassador of your kind for Arthur. I hope to meet you soon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmperor Corbus Draken. (penned by scribe Alexander Pollock.)\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You smile to yourself, to think you actually were considered by the Emperor himself and for him to also still pay you mind after employment. You set the letter to the side and began to eat the well prepared meal. After finishing you stood up and walked back to the edge of the table to find Arthur still eating, grease having splattered all over his chest and belly leaving slight smudges to the recently cleaned skin. You groan before saying rather loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My Lord!\". Arthur stops mid bite into a bird leg and glances down at you with a look of surprise. \"How can you expect to remain clean if you just make a mess all over yourself? Certainly table manners are taught on your home world? If I may sugges-\". You can't finish as a hand slams down, missing you purposefully as you stood between the large index and middle finger of the hand. You suck in a breath before looking up at eyes that broiled with silver anger. The dragon ripped off a huge chunk of the leg without breaking eye contact before lowering his head down to you, a guttural growl deep in his throat. He stopped inches from your face, his lips curled exposing the fangs as large as you before he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll say this one more time runt, you are here for the benefit of me solely, I don't care if the Emperor commends you on your 'bravery' about being with me, brave men die all the same due to bravado. You insult me at my own table again and I don't care how useful you are, I'll make your bones into toothpicks.\" The Black and White dragon said before lifting his head back up and biting the leg bone he held, snapping it between his fangs and sucking out the marrow and tossing aside. His message sent, Arthur broke eye contact and went back to eating, the breaking of the gaze allowing you to breath again. Berated, you hang your head and wait for the Beast to finish sating his obviously large appetite. After a half hour passed, an enormous belch nearly ruptured your eardrums, signaling the drake was done. He grabbed a napking and wiped down his body, showing the stains came out without leaving much marks. You grimace at that, that alone proved you were more ignorant than you thought. Arthur yawned before standing up, his dick coming up suddenly and almost knocking you off the table as he turned and walked to his door. He opened it and told the guard he was done with dinner and wished the trays taken away before he retired for the night. With that he closed the door and walked back over to you and looked down. You lowered your head and didn't make eye contact, a tear welled up in one of your eyes as you wondered what would last longer, your career or your life. The drake looming over you snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is why I hate your kind, your soft. A little force and you bend the knee with no questions asked. Yet somehow you have hopes despite being conquered by an unstoppable force. I don't like that one bit, and no doubt an insurrection will come of it eventually, though I doubt it will accomplish anything but piss my kind off. Get over it runt, and finish my cleaning, that's your job isn't it? Or is it to judge me and my habits?\" He said standing in front of you. You look up with a scowl and he meets your eyes with a blank stare, but you knew he was waiting for you to slip up and make a retort. When you didn't reply he smiled coldly before offering you his palm and walking back over to the bed and laying down, depositing you on his upper pubic region, his flaccid cock sitting there as if being the end of an insult to what you now were. Sighing you stood up and pulled out your tools and began scrubbing at the base of the fleshy appendage. Arthur closed his eyes and had a resting smile on is lips as you worked. The skin beneath you stiffening as the dragon slowly became erect at your stimulation. His member reached full mast, standing a good fifty feet above you. For a second you forgot you were mad at the Drake and had to compliment his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Truly you are a work of art my Lord, every part of you continues to amaze me.\" You only got a slight nod and bigger smile as a reply before you got back to work, scrubbing at the loose folds of the dragons balls and cleaning away a lot of dead skin. As you worked a pumping sound could be heard and you turned around to be faced with an new dilemma. Arthur was pumping his hand slowly up and down his cock, his eyes still closed as he did so. Training didn't cover the instance of a dragon jerking himself as you cleaned him, but you decided to just continue and hope for the best. As you scrubbed the loose skin of Arthurs sack however, the dragon...</span></div></div>",

You blush seeing the pucker again and tried to pull away, only for the dragon to start jamming you in.

You hear him beating off faster as you are pulled further into the dragon's bowels. As you are pulled in further, you push up hard against the dragon's prostate, causing him to roar out and cover himself in his own jizz. You would hope he would wake up to get you as the smell in the dragon's rear was starting to get unpleasant.

As you start moving from his taint towards the opening between his two bulbous mounds of fat and muscle, Arthur feels your movement and relaxes his cheeks so that you may do your work easier without interference. You arrive at the base of the crack and climb inside, holding back your gags caused the potent musk of your ruler's backside and begin cleaning. It was a tight fit, mainly because the drake's cheeks were fairly large and fatty, but you expected this after falling in and experiencing it firsthand not long before. But before long, you got fairly used to the slight pressure caused by the mounds of skin and fat that hugged you tightly, almost lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You began finishing up your job when you felt a slight... disturbance coming from below you. A small gurgle could be heard coming from somewhere inside the drake's lower stomach, but it seemed fairly close to where you were standing.  \"wha-\" was all you managed to say before a blast of hot gas came shooting up at you, with an audible \"Pfffft\" bellowing out of the tail hole you were standing on. The blasting fart from the powerful drake was strong enough to actually shoot you into the air a bit, maybe 3-4 feet for you. As you came back down, the rotten smell of Arthur's past meals mixed with shit hit your senses, but you dare not react to them for fear of your life. Your momentum picked up, and instead of landing \"safely\" back onto the anus of the dragon, you instead slipped right past the hole. With an audible \"plop\", the puckering tail hole closed around you and winced as a reaction, enjoying it's most recent meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The walls of your new surroundings were slimy and rugged. It smelt terrible, and there was not much room to move around in. You didn't want to panic, as not to show your new captor any signs of weakness, so instead you calmly stayed put and awaited a response from the enormous drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          All of this occurred in a matter of about 3 seconds, so Arthur was very much caught off guard by everything that had transpired. As soon as he felt you enter his sphincter and into his rectum his head shot up off the pillow. He slowly turned his head and looked at his anus to confirm his suspicions of what happened, and sure enough you were gone. \"Oh wow, I did not expect that powerful of a blast to come out, I only meant to startle the slave\", Arthur thinks to himself aloud. \"Human, did my little outburst cause you to slide into my rectum?\". From where you were situated, his voice was muffled, but you could still make out what he was trying to say. \"Yes my lord, it appears that I have fallen someplace that was not exactly the intended... location\" trying to phrase it the best you could without Arthur becoming furious or offended. There was a short period of silence, but it was eventually broken by a faint sound of laughter and chuckling coming from above. \"My lord, if I may ask, what is so funny?\" you question hesitantly. \"Oh my, never has this ever happened to me in my hundreds of years of working as a guard for the emperor. This is quite the ridiculous plight\" he says to himself, laughing at both his own manifestation and his new servant's predicament. \"I will say human, you feel rather cozy back there up my ass, perhaps I shall leave you in there for the time being and you can serve me from the inside. I believe a massage would be satisfactory?\" He asks in a very domineering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You are suddenly taken aback by this statement, obviously not wanting to spend any more time in this rank prison. \"Please my lord, allow me to finish cleaning you; perhaps your frontside may need some attention?\" You offer in desperation, since anything would be better than this. \"Quite slave! You will be lucky if I decide to take you out at all! Now carry out my order and begin with the massage, I have other business to attend to now.\" With that response, you feel your chamber suddenly shift and jostle you around. You can only assume that Arthur has now gotten tired of your cleaning work and is getting up to put his clothes back on and go back on duty. With that realization, you sigh in defeat and begin rubbing the walls of your new and hopefully temporary home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Arthur got up from his bed and began putting his clothes and armor back on rather angrily, disgusted at the fact that his slave dare talk back to him. He grabbed his undergarments and pulled them up his legs until they hugged his globular cheeks snug in place. They were rather tight, and it formed a fairly large bulge in the front. As Arthur looked down at his package, he put his left hand over it to cup his hefty balls lovingly. \"Looks like I caught you a friend\", he says underneath his breath, and after staring at his bulge for a few seconds he continues putting on his clothes and heads out of his room.</span></div></div>",

The front counter of the store was positioned so when you rounded the aisle you only could see the backside of your new owner. He was leaned over the counter with his elbows resting on it, his wide back rippling underneath a tank top that was a little to short as with him being leaned over it rode up exposing his lower back. He also wore a pair of light gray sweatpants that hugged his rather large rear and thighs. His tail was draped over his right cheek as if to show off his backside to anyone who walked by. His tail and lower back gave away to you he was a red dragon, an uncommon color but not rare among dragonkind, the underside of his tail was a creamy white color, which you knew ran from the tip of his tail, up underneath him, and up the front of his belly and chest and ending under his jaw. All of this observation was made in the three seconds it took the shop owner to round the counter and then you saw his face, making you a little nervous as the Dragons expression at a fierce expression to it as he looked at something on his phone. As the shop owner stood in front of him, The red dragon put his phone down and stood up to his full height, towering at least a foot over the dragon holding you. You shrank a little as this put you in his large shadow. The shop owner deposited you on the counter a few inches from the counter ledge the Red dragon stood over. A noticeable bulge was present in the front of his sweatpants hinting his muscles weren't the only thing large about him. The red dragon looked down at you, his huge pecs letting out a sigh as he looked down at your tiny form. He dropped to one knee, putting you now about chest level with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the human you keep telling me about almost every time we hang out huh Torin? I guess he's cute enough...\" The Red dragon said with a booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Torin the shop owner smiled and nodded. \"He's basically a lot like you, he doesn't talk much with his kind and likes to be by himself often. I feel like you two will get along very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon stood back up and put his hand down on the counter with his palm open, you take a second to climb up into it and sit in the center of it. Once you settle, the red dragon lifts you up to snout level. \"So what do I call you little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jason\" You stammer looking into his gold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Vulcan.\" He says shortly as he lowers his hand back down to waist level, making you feel insignificant. Torin furrows his brow as his years working with humans lets him instantly pick up on your discomfort but he doesn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorin looks back at Vulcan. \"So we have the papers filled out, all thats left is housing. Do you plan on getting him a housing unit or are you just going to let him free roam your house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulcan shrugged. \"I'll just let him do his own thing really around my place, if he wants to stay close with me cool, if he wants to spend it off exploring, cool. But I promise Torin I'll take care of him ok? You said you think this bond will do both of us good.\" He said this as he pressed the side of the palm you sat on into his waist, as if displaying a form of protection. Torin still looked a little worried but didn't say anything but wished you well as Vulcan carried you out of the store. Once outside he brought you back to chest level. \"Ok Jason time to head home, you'll be riding...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You waved one last goodbye to Torin as you left the shelter, while he gave a concerned yet reassuring smile back. Your new owner continued his pace in silence as you gave a blank expression to the ground beneath you, in awe and fright at the view from this height. You gripped onto the lizard\u2019s shoulder fabric like you were trying to rip a carrot from the ground, it felt like you would easily slide off at any moment. You were startled by a giant clawed hand firmly placing itself on your body, \u201cYou alright little buddy?\u201d your owner asked likely noticing your discomfort. \u201cJust thought you\u2019d want some fresh air is all, I can put you in my pocket if that makes you feel better.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d You responded. \u201c\u2026Are you sure, looks like you\u2019re having some trouble ther-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cI said I\u2019m fine, thanks!\u201d you exclaimed. Vulcan mistook you for shy because he seemed a bit surprised by your outburst, he didn\u2019t want to argue with you so he let you do as you want. You didn\u2019t really want this dragon thinking you were some push over that he could have his way with, although admittedly the sight of his enormous head was enough to make you wary. For now, you were focusing on keeping your balance on his stiff shoulder, trying to get comfortable while your wrists got sore from maintaining your grip. Torrin hadn\u2019t brought you out since you were much younger; which may\u2019ve not been that long for him since dragons live twice as long as humans; and that combined with the fact you were in the care of a complete stranger meant you were a bit tense all things considered. But your tenseness slowly built into excitement as the path he was following led to a familiar place.  You were getting giddy; even if Torrin neglected to bring you outside for a while, you knew this place well because it got you out of sitting in a pen all day with the other annoying humans. It allowed you to have your own adventures away from everyone else; Vulcan must\u2019ve noticed your restlessness because he chuckled and said \u201cWell, someone\u2019s excited.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you said.\u201d you responded. \u201cJust needed some fresh air.\u201d<br>\r\nAnything really was better than being in that cage all day with the only company being a dragon as the only person who liked you. As he followed the sidewalk he approached the park; boring to anyone else but a field trip for you! You bounced your legs in glee as you saw a bunch of younger and older dragons enjoying the sunshine; they were massive of course, but none really matching the height and size of your owner. You saw a pair of middle aged dragons playing Frisbee together, a yellow dragon in his twenties playing guitar and singing with his human resting human on his snout, and an elderly dragon playing chess with a young human male on one of the public park checkerboard tables, among other things. But you were much more focused on the playground; which was thankfully completely empty for once; and the sight of the forests that compared to your height, were infinite labyrinths of nature and discovery. You missed the energy of the park goers, even if you preferred to stay far away from them. But really you just missed the serenity of it all, just being an animal in his habitat and forgetting your place in the world as pets for ungodly serpents on legs and just enjoying your freedom. Your eagerness was cut short as your owner took the fork in the path that steered cleared from the park. \u201cHey! Where are we going? The park is right there!\u201d you pleaded to the dragon as you hammered on his cream coloured neck. \u201cThe park is dangerous for you, squirt. You\u2019re a lot smaller for a human your age, don\u2019t you think?\u201c He said. But he was right, you were much smaller than the average 18 year old, but you didn\u2019t want to end your trip to the park this early. \u201cI got you to protect me, don\u2019t I?\u201d you said. \u201cYeah, and if you get lost in the grass and I accidently step or sit on you? What after?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t do either of those and we\u2019re golden.\u201d You retorted.<br>\r\n\u201cIf it were that easy then I wouldn\u2019t care, but it\u2019s not, and Torin asked me to take care of you, so I\u2019m not.\u201d You both drifted farther and farther away from the park, now you were getting agitated. \u201cJust this one time and I won\u2019t ask you again! Please do it for me!\u201d you said. \u201cNo is no, Torrin would never forgive me if you got hurt.\u201d The park was now completely out of sight, you got so pissed off by this dragon\u2019s stubbornness and the fact that he insists on treating you like a child that you couldn\u2019t help but shout \u201cAt least Torrin has bigger balls than you! He wouldn\u2019t be such a little pushover!\u201d Vulcan\u2019s naturally angry wrinkles looked even more wrinkled now; the lizard\u2019s jaw was clenched and he puffed out smoke from his nostrils. \u201cLook you shitty brat, I was acting nice since you\u2019re still a kid, but it looks like that ain\u2019t gonna fly. You\u2019re NEVER going to that park or ANY park as long as you\u2019re with me!\u201d he roared. Your place in this world couldn\u2019t have been made clearer. You egged this dragon on despite him being a walking talking building, and now you pissed him off. It caught you completely off-guard since he was seemingly patient with you until now; you finally got a glimpse of those steak knife fangs and crimson red gums as they aligned in front of the abyss that was his throat. This was an animal, you finally realized, and he had full control over your life. His outburst brought back some long repressed memories you had of his kind; you weren\u2019t just intimidated now, you were genuinely afraid. You saw the familiar clawed hand approach you from behind, \u201cYou\u2019re going in my pocket now, kid. It\u2019s time you learn some respect.\u201d Those words rang in your head, those words were just as painful and vivid now as they were before. You couldn\u2019t differentiate them now, all you saw was the same giant angry lizard that was going to punish you, hurt you, and suffocate you in his hand until you begged forgiveness. You were yet another small rodent registering the situation at your most primitive; in retrospect, your owner probably should\u2019ve realized the power he held over your and just how terrifying he could be. Your eyes were so wide they were about to pop out of your skull, you shook your head in plight and crawled backwards, you wanted so desperately to be out of this situation that that you failed to notice the drop below you. You yelped a pathetic squeal, before you knew it, you were tumbling down the dragon as you made your descent to the cement below. Your owner gasped and tried his best to catch you, just barely missing and stopping your momentum as you impacted his hand and were flipped backwards and landed onto his scaly barefoot. You were disoriented and had the wind knocked out of you, you rested on his clawed barefoot; as dragons never wore shoes because they liked the feeling of soil between their toes. As far as you know you\u2019d just been threatened and attacked by a dragon, and needed to get out of here. You snapped out your dizzy state and caught your breath, you slid off his foot and began a dash into the grass. \u201cWait, why\u2019re running? Jason, get back here! It ain\u2019t safe!\u201d your captor shouted as he threw his body to the grass trying to catch you, like a cat chasing his prey. You were scared shitless of how agile this muscle bound serpent was, you pushed your legs so far ahead that you felt like you were going to rip your leg muscles apart. \u201cShit, shit, shit! Not good, not good! Jason?!\u201d your owner huffed as he desperately spanned his arms out and looked for you in the grass, his heart about to come out of his chest, terrified at the thought of you being squished or taken. Now in the cover of a field of green, you could see the backside of the dragon perched over and searching for you in the other side of the grass. You snuck as far away as you could. After a while, you couldn\u2019t see him anymore. You found yourself back in the park, from a perspective that made you realize how big everything was. No doubt your captor would come looking for you, so you decided to take your chances finding a place to hide, hoping you wouldn\u2019t end up on the bottom of an unsuspecting dragon\u2019s foot. You headed for\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wearing a black unbuttoned cargo shirt, a pair of denim stonewashed blue jeans and a red sash around his waist, you also noticed his orange and gray headphones that were resting around his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, buddy?\" You notice it wasn't the dragon who spoke but rather a human who appeared to be in his mid twenties. The human was sitting on the dragon's snout and waves at you in a friendly manner. \"Set him up here with me.\" The human said to the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise the dragon listened and placed you on his snout next to the pther human. \"Sorry about that. Marc can be a little careless at times. I'm Laslow, and this big guy is Marc.\" Laslow introduced as Marc continued about his walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou introduced yourself and sat back enjoying the sunshine from the safe spot. Ludlow had told you that he and Marc were out for their daily stroll and thought the park would be the best place. You smiled and enjoyed conversing with Laslow as he was very friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this Vulcan fellow? Did you want to get back to him?\" Laslow asked as the two of you leaned back on Marc's snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think he meant well... but he...\" you flinch hearing Marc let out a low rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow chuckles. \"Marc's just clearing his throat. He doesn't usually talk much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let out a low sigh as he squinted at the two of you. \"Wanna stay with us?\" He asked, his voice was rather shy sounding despite his impressive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow chuckled. \"Marc's not the one you gotta worry about in the household. Its his dad that's the worrying one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only cuz dad wants me to inherit the family business.\" Marc states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Family business?\" You ask slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc let's out another sigh. \"My dad sells,\" he paused thinking over his words. \"a steroid for dragons. Helps them with physical activity. But he's not to keen on humans. Laslow here was actually a human that was living in the walls of the house until dad caught him and nearly ate him. Instead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead Daddy Drake decided to let Marc keep me as a pet.\" Laslow cut in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just tell dad that you're another pet I picked up. He'll leave it at that.\" Marc said as he sat on a park bench. \"Or we can help you find Vulcan.\" He adds.</span></div></div>",

He stops at this small hole in the wall type place and goes inside. The moment you enter, you are greeted with dozens of smells of burgers, fries and other foods. Marc picks a booth near a window, facing the park. He sets you and Laslow down gently on the table then proceeds to look over a menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow chuckles. \"Unfortunately this place doesn't do human sized plates, so we'll just grab some from Marc's plate. Don't worry, we got a system down.\" He assures you as he takes a seat on the ceramic sugar holder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long from when Marc orders that food is brought out. Marc turns to you and Laslow and smiles. \"Dig in.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow wastes no time and rips some burger off and begins eating. You join him in doing such but constantly keeping one eye on Marc. \"Marc usually waits til I'm done and sitting where he can see me before he starts eating.\" Laslow explained as he grabbed a chunk of fries and ate it. You nod and continue ripping handfuls of food and eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chime of the diner bell is heard as another patron enters. You and Laslow paid it no mind as you ate. Marc's stomach finally growled a bit. And he reached for the burger. He took a bite then another and another. Unfortunately for you and Laslow, the two of you had gotten stuck to the delicious meal from the gooey cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marc!

You grip onto Laslow tightly, fear dominating your mind. Laslow rolls and tumbles to the sides, pulling you with him as he dodges the mashed up burger bits. \"Oh no...\" he says as you both feel everything tip and begin to tumble down into the dragon's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's tight, it's humid and it's very hot. The entire time, you can't believe how calm Laslow is. After a while, you both enter the massive belly belonging to Marc. \"You alright, Jason?\" Laslow asks as he makes his way over to where you'd landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in his stomach! He ate us! How can you be so calm?!\" You were hysterical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow merely shrugged. \"I'd be lying if I said this was the first time I ended up in Marc's stomach.\" He said calmly. He pulls you out of goopy mess of burger and fries and sits on one the folds in the stomach. \"We'll be fine. It's hard to believe and strangd when you think about it. But I know we'll be fine. Truth is, I've been in here at least a dozen times. Yeah, its scary at times, but I always make it out alive.\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow this reassures you and you just sit next to Laslow. \"So what happens now?\" You ask somewhat calmed down but still very scared of the current situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow flashes you a gentle smile as he lays back. \"We wait. Marc will figure out he accidentally ate us and get us out. Its just a matter of if we get out the front door or the back door.\" He explains before making himself comfortable. \"My track record, its usually out the back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've never been digested by his stomach?\" You ask now curious about how this crazy man has survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow lazily yawns. \"Marc once explained it as his stomach can somehow tell between living beings and food. Thus his stomach acids when produced don't affect living beings. So long as we avoid getting directly mixed in with lunch before the acids start, we'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still very confused but trusted your new friend. After all, you were both in the dragon's stomach. He had no reason to lie to you. \"And Marc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He usually goes about his day. Or if he notices and is in a good mood, let's me out through the front door.\" Laslow replies as he closes his eyes. \"Don't worry my friend, we'll be fine, as scary as this is. I've been inside Marc enough times to know how his body works, probably better than he does. Heck this one time, when he was hiding me from his dad, he dropped me down the front of his pants and I ended up getting accidentally swallowed by his dick.\" Laslow says with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but laugh a little at your new friend's story. He continued with the details, noticing it calmed you down. \"I'd be happy to introduce you to that side of him, if you'd like.\" Laslow joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, no! That's another guy's junk.\" You reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you eventually fell asleep in Marc's stomach. The soft gurgles his stomach made and steady rhythmic beating of his heart, lulled both of you to snooze.</span></div></div>",

Both of you awoke to the constant pushing and crushing sensation as you worked through Marc's rectum. Soon you both dropped out and landed with a splash in the massive toilet bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc sighs briefly before his tail reaches down and picks both of you up. \"Are you both alright?\" He asks, concern in his voice as he sets you both on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow laughs as he looks up at the blue dragon. \"We're fine, Marc.

Laslow smiles as you look around. \"It may not be much, but its a nice place in the current world.\" He said as he sat down on his makeshift couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Laslow. \"Seems a little dusty. You don't spend much time in here do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaslow sighs. \"I usually only come here when I need some alone time. But hey, my place is your place too now.\" You arch an eyebrow. \"OK, you got me, I usually spend most my time with the big guy. And I'll admit, I usually sleep close by him.\" He pauses as he changes to sleepwear right in front of you. \"Its getting late. You can sleep here, bed's on the other side of that wall.\" He paused to point. \"Or you can sleep with the big guy. Don't worry, he doesn't move much once he falls asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hope you don't mind.\" Said Vulcan. <br>\r\nYou weren't really too fond if the idea but he was your 'owner' now and you didn't want to start things off with a rocky start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure that's fine. Where are we going? I've never really had a chance to leave the store so I'm curious as to where we're headed.\" <br>\r\n\"I'll tell you once were on our way. So let's go ahead and get you situated.\" Said Vulcan<br>\r\nThe large dragon lowered both of his hands down to his waist. Using the hand you that you was not in he grabbed you pinching you between two if his fingers, a bit roughly. Using his free hand he pulls open his pants just slightly. As soon as he does a whole colorful of musk wafts out, not noticeable to him, but to you it was quite potent! Slowly he moves you towards his waistline \"Make sure you hold on to the top of the pants.\" Said Vulcan.<br>\r\nAs you was lifted over the small gap you could see a small sliver of his humongous package you couldn't believe the size of it compared to you. Finally snapping out of it you realized Vulcan has been waiting on you to grab his pants so you grab on tightly as he releases. You smack into his stomach with a bit of force the pressure from the sweatpants is somewhat uncomfortable but bearable. Vulcan makes sure you secure before he lowers his tank top back down, you can still see somewhat but you're hidden from the outside for the most part. As Vulcan starts to walk he answers your question from earlier. \"I decided to walk here because it's such a nice day! We're gonna go...</span></div></div>",

If you feel like you need to breath or something is wrong, slap at my stomach, i'm sure ill feel ya down there.\" Vulcan began his walk , his pace slightly dragging you back and forth across his slick leathery belly, Each step causing a puff of intoxicating musk to blow up from under you. You weren't exactly sure what kind of relation you wanted with this dragon, but your future was starting to look up suddenly. Your observation about Vulcans tank top being too short was correct as it didn't quite cover his stomach completely, leaving your top half exposed to the world, and the world exposed to you. You watched a spectrum of colored dragons go about their lives. A white dragon jogging past with no shirt on, An orange dragon walking out of a store with his arms carrying groceries, a cyan dragon with his arm around a smaller green female. Your world had been the pet shop and occasionally Torins home, but now you hoped to see it in full if Vulcan allowed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With the dragons you watched you also saw a spectrum of dragon owner types. A black dragon walked by having a casual conversation with a human girl on his shoulder. Another Yellow dragon wore a necklace that had a cushioned cage with a man inside. In one instance you watched a large Silver dragon smirk as he slid his hand with a human in it into his slacks, cupped himself, and withdrew the hand with no human in it then, all while he talked with another dragon who didn't bat an eye at the action. The worst thing you saw though was probably on a restaurant sign, advertising live human cuisine, and a good bit of dragons were loitering around the restaurant. You shuddered, and you think Vulcan felt you tense up at the sight as he began to walk a little faster to get past the restaurant quicker. That one sight made you forget most of what you had just seen over the past few minutes and it brought one cold truth to mind, your kind was prey, slaves, and pets to this all around superior species, and the only way out was death. You shook your head, no, you were gonna make the best of this, Vulcan was making out to be an indifferent owner who will let you do as you wish for the most part, and that was all you needed for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vulcan slowed, jolting you out of thinking as he had...</span></div></div>",

There existed giant guardians who helped defend humanity against the unholy abominations called frights, that wished to wipe out the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese guardians were Soul Dragons. A human was born with a connection to a dragon and was treated as a master. There existed multiple dragons across the world, most servicing rulers and generals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frights were soon sealed away and peace was stowed opun the earth. This didn't last long, as those with a Soul Dragon began using them for selfish reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLands were conquered, fields were burned, and resistance was crushed beneath a scaled sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the dragons abandoned the humans refusing to be used for such selfish acts. Within centuries the dragons became a simple fable to teach children about the corruption of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the 22nd century the frights would awaken from their seal and wreak havoc again.

After the continental war in 2043, the borders of countries transformed and new regions formed. China and Mongolia have fused together under one republic, Manchuria has become an independent country, and new cities have been built in previous uninhabited areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the forests not yet explored were home to one young man, who despite the harsh environment was able to survive with some BIG help<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAng\u00fao was a seventeen year old living in the forest. At first it would seem a mystery on how he survived with his small and lean form. But one would know once they attack him and are covered in the shadow of a giant foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was the last human who had the ability to summon a Soul Dragon. He was in fact the youngest, having summoned his dragon when he was only a baby. Ang\u00fao had been left in the forest as an infant, and gained his giant protector who took to raising him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was the name of his dragon. A blue dragon with white fur and whiskers, who wore a dark blue and black hanfu. He rose above the trees, with them only reaching his shin. The dragon had appeared when Ang\u00fao was a baby in a basket flooding in the river and despite being shocked at the age of his master, he still was able to gently scoop him into his palm. From that day Fang took to raising him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough normally the dragon acted calm and kind when with Ang\u00fao, he could be rather terrifying if the boy was ever threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time when playing with a rabbit, a hunter had demanded Ang\u00fao hand it over. Refusing, the hunter grabbed Ang\u00fao and began to drag him away, all while readying his gun. He stopped when a large THOOM shook the ground and knocked him down. He looked shocked as Fang stood over him with a angered look. After scooping up both Ang\u00fao and the rabbit, the dragon lifted his scaled sole over the hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-please have mercy! I wasn\u2019t goi-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSILENCE HUMAN! I can sense the dark aura around you. You were going to harm this child! The only thing you deserve is to decorate my sole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Fang stomped down, shaking the forest and reducing the man to paste. As he walked away, he left footprints filled with red splatters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang spent his days protecting Ang\u00fao, he dealt with intruders in different ways. If they were simple travelers he\u2019d scare them off. But if they did intend to harm Ang\u00fao, they find themselves being crushed or eaten.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe sun rose over the forest, Fang opened his orange eyes gazing down at Ang\u00fao curled up in his palm. Smiling, the dragon stood up from his crossed leg sitting as he prepared to start his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day started off with.......</span></div></div>",
