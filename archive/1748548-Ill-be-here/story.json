            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are an honest to god animal lover. But, not any animal would fit you; you were a special animal rescuer. Only taking in animals that were given up on and had little time to live. You tried to give them a life they couldn't have had before until the moment their eyes close as you held them. It was your duty, you felt. You didn't call yourself a hero, but you knew what you were doing was right. Your only policy was that you only rescued once until their time came. You wanted to give your full attention to them and no other. A freak in the eyes of society but you ask those people how high your karma must be by now. They can never give you an answer. It was also how you kept company and had fun. Your novels allowed you to retire early so you had your life to spend with the animals you loved. Your cat Dem died last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the rescue center not even needing to say anything to the clerk as he showed you to the serious case room. You never wanted him to tell you their conditions, they weren't merchandise and besides that you knew. Many of the animals knew you and jumped, or at least tried their best to, to get your attention. As you looked through the group there was a collie that caught your eye, less than a year you could tell. But there was one that made your heart stop in sorrow at the mid-end of the row. A small puppy that could fit in your hand was nestled in the back of a cage. He shivered and could not open his eyes as he smelled your hand over him. He tried to lick your hand but fell back struggling to sit. \"Less then a month, two weeks tops,\" the clerk said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take him, how old is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was just born three days ago, we named him Cody after his dad. Hid dad died little less than a week ago. And his mother abandoned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was never breast fed...\" you just nodded to him as he opened the cage. You carefully held him after picking him up with the blanket you brought. He was a tiny black mixed dog, you could tell he had a lot of blood mixed. You couldn't go back in your car, the bumpy roads would kill him. You'd have to come back for it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody can you hear me?\" you softly spoke to him as you walked through your front door. He twitched, not sure what was happening, \"this is your new home.\" He scurried in your arms trying to look around and trying to force his eyes open. \"Stop it, don't force yourself.\" In response he tried to climb up to your face, whining as he did. He was trying to show his affection, but it wasn't helping his health. You tilted your head down to make him stop, he sniffed you and pressed his muzzle to your face. He was cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought him to your couch and set him down on a cushion and let him scurry around in his blanket. It was too sad, all he wanted to do was play. But, even if his heart were to beat just a little too fats it would be too much. You made sure he was tightly bundled so he wouldn't move. You began your relationship by giving him his first meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days Cody was finally able to stand on his own, but he still couldn't see. You clapped to help him find you and gave him small pets along with a little treat when he got to you. You felt the same way you did when you were with a pet, but it was always renewed, the joy, love, and finally the sorrow in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more days, you knew it was almost time. You always cried when they left, but you also made sure they were happy. Cody was finally able to open his eyes and make small barks. You gave him as much love as you could when he gave you his. He was even able to lick your face on his own now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night you had nestled Cody in a basket next to your bed. You didn't even hear him as light of a sleeper as you were. It wasn't until you woke up the next day that you found him. Cody was sprawled on the floor laying on his side, not breathing. It must have been late at night, he tried to climb into bed with you...then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't...you didn't want to think at the moment, but you still let yourself cry. You couldn't allow your self not to cry, \"It's alright...Cody, you can get into...into...\" you raised his little body up to your chest lightly kissing him as you took him downstairs. You set him on your couch and grabbed your keys. You had to go get what you needed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated this as much as you loved it, the reason why you took in animals that were already given up on. Was so you couldn't feel lonely anymore. And when one died you realized just how alone you were. That's why you were able to smile when you took in the next one. You hated yourself more than you hated burying each animal in your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got back you took the things you got and were about to open the door. You always hesitated, because you'll find exactly what you left. But you still opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was odd when you stepped inside though. You didn't feel the sad and encroaching feeling you did when you left. Something was on your couch that wasn't Cody, \"who's there?\" A black figure was laying on your couch. You dropped your things and walked to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did the figure stood up, it's back facing you. It was covered in black fur and had ears coming off the top of its head, \"is this come kind of joke!\" The ears folded down as its face turned to you. \"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the same colored eyes as Cody's on the creatures face. It stood up and began wobbling towards you, \"master, I finally learned how to walk...you said you were proud of me...didn't you?\" You couldn't speak as he walked up to you. Tears flowing down both of your faces. \"...did Cody do something bad...did Cody make...make master sad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the figure pull at your shirt, \"please...don't be sad...Cody no mean make sad...didn't mean fall off bed...\" shock ran down your spine. He cried furiously as he tugged on your shirt. \"...only wanted...want to cuddle...cuddle with master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even notice that you were holding him until you spoke, \"it-it's okay, Cody I know...I know you just wanted to climb in bed...with me...It's alright...but please, don't...don't leave me like that again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an amazing person you know that,\" a voice came from Cody's mouth that wasn't his. You looked down and saw Cody's grey eyes turn violet as his fur turned white. Wings sprouting from his back. You only watched as Cody rose into the air. \"You don't even know just how good of a person you are. You've sent so many of my children back to me with warmth in their hearts. And for that I give you this reward. Cody will be my vessel as I am reborn into this world. He will never leave you even after death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...I don't actually have a name. But, for now just call me...Cody...I promise that'll you'll never feel lonely again.\" After he said this the wings and white fur faded as Cody dropped from the air unconscious. You caught him before he hit the floor, but what were you going to do now. Never lonely again you thought...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked at his face in your arms as you held him. His body was warm and his heart beat steadily, you could feel it. He was alive and right here with you...thump thump...thump thump...that sound used to be nonuniform, but now it was soft and beating like a birds wings. You didn't know the tears had come until you saw them drip down to Cody's face. And looking at him, you managed to say, \"Cody.\" In your mind and in your heart too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly dug your face into his soft fur to hear it louder. Sitting down on your couch, it was like hearing a drum. Or hearing a single sentence created by the first thump, the reprieve and the second thump 'I'm Alive'. Before you could listen more you noticed him stir in your arms. Then you felt something wet and warm against your face, it tickled badly and you couldn't stop yourself from laughing. \"C-Cody\" you tried to say between your gasps. He stopped licking your face and both of you looked at each other smiling. \"Master...not mad at Cody anymore..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody, I could never be mad at you for something like that. But please...\"you held him tightly but not too tight, \"please don't leave me again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't...I promise master...'We promise'...\" the last bit of those words came from the other voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently pulled back, \"We?\" Cody looked at you quizzically. You figured it must have been the 'other' Cody. You shook your head, \"never mind Cody. I'm just glad you're alright.\" You got up setting him down gently on the couch looking at him as he looked sweetly at you. \"Let me make sure you're completely okay though, is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It okay master.\" He said as he began panting with anticipation. You smiled as you knelt down to examine him. His body was a halfway point between a person and a puppy. He still had black scruffy fur that was short in some spots from his malnutrition before you took him in. His eyes were still gray and could react well to the light, they curled in delight as you looked in them. You felt his arms and legs, still weak and bony. He could walk, like you saw before, but he probably would still tip over if not careful. His breathing was alright, and you already knew his heart beat was steady. The inside of his mouth was well built and looked slightly more human as well, but his teeth were still weak and probably couldn't handle some foods yet. The largest difference in his new structure were his legs and arms. His legs did not have a bend and was shaped just like a human's as were his arms. His arms even had hands instead of paws. But his feet still looked like paws. All in all when you stood up and looked at him he was still the same little puppy, just a bit healthier and able to live fully. He just needed a little more help and he'd be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will Cody be okay master?\" He looked up to you hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back down and gently kneaded and scratched his head as he growled contently, \"You'll be just fine Cody, you're much healthier. All you need is a little more rest and lots of good food and you'll be completely okay...gah!\" Cody swiftly wrapped his arms around your waist and was nuzzling your chest lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody really, really happy! Master say Cody okay! Cody be okay!\" then he suddenly stopped nuzzling you and looked up to your face, \"but master say Cody need to eat good food. And master say Cody needed exercise before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember what I said before you changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody remember, Cody remember a lot. Cody need get healthy, healthy so master be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody I'm already happy, I'm happy you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master...\" Cody's smile widened to the point that he closed his eyes and just lay his head in your arms. Then he said softly to you, \"Cody love master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled yourself over him and held each other, \"I love you too Cody...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you examined him and talked with him you thought it was about time to feed Cody. Especially when he got embarrassed about his stomach growling. You knew he wanted to learn to walk badly but he still wobbled from his weak legs, instead of carrying him you decided to help lead him. You held his hand and carefully led him to the kitchen. You sat him at the table and filled his bowl with chewy dog food, he still wasn't able to chew hard dog food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was now more human you felt fine letting him sit at the table and eat from his dish as well as drink from another bowl. But when he saw you use a cup to drink from he wanted to try too. He softly asked if you would show him and you did. He was a fast learner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you both ate you decided to do one of two things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You quietly carried Cody in your arms as you walked towards your bed. The day may have just started, but you were completely exhausted from everything that had happened. You had believed Cody was gone for good, but now, here he was in your arms again. And after everything that had happened, you didn't know if he was still the same. The arms and legs were obviously new, and he was able to talk now... The thought of it filled your mind with concern as you looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated as you arrived before placing him gently onto your bed. There was no way that he would fit on his old bed now, and there simply wasn't any better place to put him. You got a decent look at him as he laid upon it. Though his body was clearly different, he still had the same features somehow. His fur was still ragged, and his limbs were thin and worn. He still looked like the tired puppy that you were familiar with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed quietly as you wiped your eyes before moving into the bed after him. You gently pulled him into your arms as you closed your eyes. It wasn't completely clear what was going on, but perhaps the next day would bring you some new answer. \"Of... of course... You can be here... with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell asleep almost immediately as you held him, careful not to squeeze too tight as he rests. You had kept him on your lap in the past, and even like this, having him against you felt warm and comforting. You carefully pulled the blanket over him before closing your eyes and drifting of. <br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a small yelp as you finally woke, your face wet as your eyes snapped open. You quickly saw Cody's face right in font of yours, happily licking across your cheek. He smiled as he saw you wake, eagerly nuzzling against your cheek. \"Good morning, master!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good-good morning.\" You hesitate a little, half-convinced that you were dreaming as you looked at the clock. It was already late afternoon, but Cody was gently sitting up next to you, his tail wagging slowly. He smiled as he slowly crept off, a little unsteady, but managing to get to the ground safely. \"Are you feeling okay, Cody?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded as he sat next to the bed, looking at you as you slowly pulled the blanket off. \"I slept well! How's master doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing okay, too.\" You smile to him, carefully moving off of the bed. \"You shouldn't push yourself too much, though... You're still pretty weak right now.\" You carefully move, walking close before lifting him up in your arms. He still felt light in your grip, and you were more than a little concerned as you held him. However, he only curled up a little bit in your arms, licking softly against your chest. You couldn't help but chuckle softly as his head gently brushed up against your shirt. \"Come on, let's get you some food.\" You could feel his tail wagging harder as you held him, clearly eager at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into your kitchen, carefully letting him down on the counter top. Although he had gotten used to the spot, it felt odd placing him there now. However, he cheerfully slipped, sitting up normally against the counter. \"Thanks, master!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you gently put your hand against his head, scritching it softly. He gave a contented growl, relaxing as he shakes his head around against your fingers. \"What do you feel like for breakfast? Do you think you can try eating something solid?\" You turned towards the floor, moving to pick his bowl up for him. It laid on the ground, having little use in the past few weeks. Most times, you had to feed him yourself, and he wasn't capable of using it. You had gotten the bowl just in case, and it had mostly been used for water on the rare occasions that he was capable of reaching it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get it!\" He smiled eagerly as he glanced towards his bowl, his eyes flashing a little somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really know what to expect, but jumped when you saw it give a twitch. It slowly hovered up off the ground, before moving towards him. He happily picked it up, holding it in his lap as he looked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-cody?\" You stutter a bit, paused in the middle of walking towards him. He saw your expression, and his ears turned down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? Did Cody do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... Surprised me. I mean, you're a bit different now, but I didn't know that it meant you could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody is still Cody...\" He gave a soft whine, his eyes softly looking at you, a little depressed. It only took you a moment to realize it, before you moved forwards, gently hugging him in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean that, Cody... You just look different, that's all. I know you're still the same sweet puppy...\" You smile and gently kiss his cheek. He quickly perks up, his tail wagging against the counter top. \"Right now, though, you're really something special... I just didn't know you could do something like that!\" You slowly release him, turning just to grab something for him. \"How did you do that, anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's smile was back as he looked at you, happily speaking as if there wasn't anything odd going on. </span></div></div>",

Cody just know he special!\" You couldn't help but pat his his head as he smiled. He gave a contented growl as he wiggled under your hand. You let him relax and flop back onto the counter, careful to make sure he had enough room before you took his bowl and filled it up with water for him, before handing it back to him. He did his best to bury hold it up and push his muzzle in it, splashing water everywhere as he tried to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only laughed as he made a bit of a mess everywhere. \"Alright, Cody. I'll just get you something easy to eat for now. You don't want to push yourself too much, okay?\" He just gave a firm nod, his muzzle still buried in his bowl and splashing about. If Cody had no idea what happened, then you wouldn't push him. It was better to just let him learn on his own, and to just take care of him the best you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put his food down onto the ground, and gently helped him down as well. You weren't quite sure if it was okay for him to try to eat at the table with you, but he seemed much more comfortable acting like a puppy than trying to eat like a human. You could only smile as you watched him dig in, before just getting a bit for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through your meal, you could feel Cody manage to move next to you. He was still unsteady as he walked, so you quickly put your hand out, catching him and helping to keep him still. \"Can Cody sit on master's lap?\" He wagged eagerly as he leaned a little against your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful, okay? I don't want you to slip or something?\" You tried to move for him, smiling as he just tried to wiggle in. It was a little trickier for you to continue eating with him sitting against you, nuzzling in, but you simply took your time with it. He looked comfortable as he rested against you, and there was no way that you would interrupt him. You couldn't help but chuckle a little as he licked a little at your plate when you finished, nibbling down some of the scraps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's okay for you to try to eat, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody happily nodded as he gave another lick, before turning to give you a firm lick as well. \"Cody feeling lot better today!\" You just smiled and hugged him firmly before standing up and carefully letting him back onto the ground. You started to put the dishes away, but were a little surprised when you saw the plates moving on their own. You just turned to Cody, seeing him concentrating and trying to focus. You let him put them into the sink before speaking. \"You okay when you do that, Cody? Doesn't strain you or something, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Cody feel fine! Cody glad can help master!\" He just eagerly wagged, and you smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've still got a full day ahead of us... Do you think you can get back on your feet and start walking a little?\" You smiled, as you gently helped him up, holding him steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Cody always feel better after!\" He just smiled, eagerly moving forward. You did your best to keep him steady as you helped him move to the next room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his body was a bit different now, he still needed a lot of help moving. He was doing a lot better, and he could keep active for a few minutes, but you still didn't want to strain him too much. You kept things simple, playing with him, helping him walk around, and he always seemed happy at even the smallest complement. Whenever he wanted to rest, you would just hold him in, and on occasion, he would just play with a small ball you had gotten him, sometimes batting around at it, other times trying to use his powers to control it. It seemed that it was slippery and tough for him to get a good grip on. It was amazing to see him in good spirits, and after the day was through, it was becoming clear that...</span></div></div>",

By the end of the day, he was able to walk around the house on his own, both on two legs and on all fours. Although you still didn't let him wander on his own, or keep active for too long, it was clear that he was able to better take care of himself now. Even during dinner, you were willing to risk giving him solid food, and while you made sure he took it slow, he didn't seem to have a problem with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked the part, too. Though he wasn't in the best condition, he was certainly looking better than before. His body was filling out a bit, and no longer looked malnourished. His fur was growing out well, and his heartbeat was a little more steady. His development seemed a little bit fast, but you were quite relieved. You thought that the spirit was watching over Cody, but you were more than glad to accept the assistance. It meant that Cody would develop well as he grew up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't really given the entire thing much thought. The relief of having Cody in good condition had been in the front of your mind, but the way things were, you didn't quite know how to deal with them. He was developing a healthy appetite, and he obviously couldn't sleep in the same basket anymore. You obviously had to be careful if other people were around, since there was no way that he would avoid attention. There were a lot of things that you had to consider now, and you were starting to get a little worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? Is master okay?\" Cody's voice shook you out of your thoughts. You didn't know how long you had been sitting down on the couch, just letting him lay in your lap. However, it seemed as though he had noticed your worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay, Cody. Just working out some things in my head.\" You smiled as you gave his neck a gentle rub, but he whined softly as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you, and despite the smile that you had managed to keep on your face, he still seemed a little concerned. It seemed as though he was good at reading you, and there was little you could do about it. \"Master seems sad... Did Cody...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody, you didn't do anything wrong.\" You shifted him a little, holding his back as you tried to sit him up in your lap. You let his head move level with yours before speaking again. \"I just need to think of how things might change now, that's all. I promise, it's nothing troublesome, and I don't want you to worry over it, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stared at you for a moment before giving a slow nod. You just pulled him tight in your arms, rubbing gently. \"Okay, Master... Cody no worry with you... But let Cody try help, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled softly, not exactly sure how he would be able to help. Still, he seemed eager to try, and you certainly weren't going to stop him. \"That's fine, Cody. Just don't push yourself, okay? Focus on getting better first.\" You gently stood up, carefully lifting and carrying him in your arms. He gave a small bark as he wiggled around, and you shifted to make sure you had a good grip. \"How about we get some sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody nodded, eagerly wagging as you brought him to your bed. You were just thankful that your bed was large enough to comfortably fit the two of you, and as you laid him down, you saw his blanket float up before laying over his body. You helped to tuck him in before laying down nearby, giving a relaxed sigh. You watched him wiggle around under the sheets before you felt your eyes drift closed as well. <br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days had gone by, and you had finally gotten used to how things had changed. Feeding Cody became less of a problem when it became clearer that human food was okay for him now. He had even tried to get up before you to get you breakfast, and while he could only just get out cold foods at the moment, it always brought a smile to your face whenever you saw him trying to help with the little things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had improved enough that you no longer had to worry too much about him. You still did whenever he was walking around the house, or trying to do something on his own. However, he always took it slow like you had asked, and he seemed to keep out of trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you were glad that Cody was doing well, his development had presented a new problem...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good morning, master!\" You shook yourself awake as you felt Cody eagerly licking your face. He had turned from his part of the bed to yours, and was eagerly snuggling in against you. You could only laugh as you felt him licking eagerly, and did your best to pick him up off of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm up, I'm up!\" You smiled as you barely managed it, shifting a little bit and just holding him against your lap. He happily wagged in your lap, looking down at you as you reached up a bit to scritch his head. He happily sat against you for a moment before slipping onto the ground, walking out the room, bending his head down as he left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you saw him carefully moving through. He had grown a surprising amount over the last few days, and it was becoming difficult to keep up with him. It was odd waking up with him next to you, seeing him a few inches taller each night. You were a little bit worried that it was dangerous for him to be growing that much, but thankfully, it didn't seem to be straining his body or his health. It did give you a few new problems. The first time he was tall enough, he hit his head on your door frame, and you spent a good deal of time checking up to make sure he wasn't injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also meant the spots he had found comfortable before were starting to get cramped. He still fit on your bed, but he had to curl up, or else his legs would hang off of the edge. It was difficult for you to try to reach around and hug him tightly, and if he ever sat on your lap, you would have to crank your neck up to look at his face. He couldn't easily bury his face in your chest when he was against you, though he happily did it when he was on all fours. It took some getting used to, and every day, by the time you had gotten used to handling it, he seemed to shoot up another few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same today, though you did your best not to show anything. He had to crouch a bit to make it through the doorway, and it looked like he was close to having his shoulders brush against the sides of it. At the rate things were going, you would have no choice but to keep him in a larger space, and the thought of that worried you a little bit. Whatever happened, you wanted to be close to him when he was sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, his face cheered you up when you made it to the kitchen. It seemed he had managed to prepare breakfast for you again. However, this time, he was giddy. It seemed like he had managed to get the toaster to work, and he was excited at the prospect of being able to use man-made devices now. He had made a rather large amount, but you knew his appetite was developing as well. You were just grateful that it seemed to be growing slower than his physical growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Cody eagerly ran into the next room. He was more energetic now, and it seemed tough for him to hold still. You did your best to keep up with him, but you simply didn't have the energy to play every time he wanted to. Thankfully, he was able to entertain himself. However, it made you a little guilty. You always did your best to take care of your pets, and this time, Cody was getting to be more than you could handle. By now, you were even a little nervous about what you'd do if he kept growing. Although he tried to be cautious, he was still a little careless, and some pieces of furniture had some bumps on them when he got overzealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it brought a smile to your face when you saw him running around. First and foremost, you were glad that he was able to run around by now. Even with all of the changes, you still couldn't complain. As he grew, his body developed and recovered from all of the problems that he seemed to have. He could easily move around now, his sight seemed to be okay, and keep active without too much strain. His powers seemed to be developing as well. He surprised you once when you found him hanging in mid-air, and he was happy to lift you up whenever you had trouble reaching something. He seemed to prefer to practice those in private, and he was always eager to surprise you when he had a chance. When he was with you, he just enjoyed being physically active, running around you, bouncing onto his ball, and anything else he could think of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Cody, just calm down for now, alright? We need to get you cleaned up.\" You heard him whine a little bit, but you shook your head as he walked up to you, dragging his legs and doing his best to give you puppy-dog eyes. You smiled softly and shook your head. You had been near animals all of your life, and while you found them absolutely adorable, there was no way he was going to convince you like that. \"Now, Cody. You've been running around all the time, and you're a bit of a mess. You have to stay cleaned up, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a soft whine, but followed you as you went to the bathtub. You were just grateful that he would come of his own accord. If he didn't cooperate, you knew you'd have a hard time getting him into the room, much less  giving him a bath. Though he didn't seem too fond of the bathtub, he did his best to hold still for you when you washed him. You did your best to make it quick and painless, but there was a lot of him to cover. You made sure to be thorough, and though he blushed and whined the entire time, he did his best to make sure you could reach. It seemed a little odd that he was embarrassed to have you bathing him, despite you taking care of him all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really think about it too much. It was enough of an effort to make sure he was completely clean. It took a while, but after, you helped him out of the tub. Before you had a chance to grab a towel, you had to gasp, water spraying everywhere as he tried to shake himself dry. You couldn't help but laugh as you saw his fur spread everywhere, trying to wipe yourself dry as he stood there, still dripping water onto the floor. He just whined a little bit, awkwardly trying to hold still before you helped him dry off completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long to finish up. He had managed to get most of the water off of him, and he was able to hold still much better now that he was out of the tub. \"Cody?\" You just smiled as you worked, the towel caught over his face as you worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master?\" He managed to grab the towel, doing his best to finish on his own. He was a little awkward when he tried to reach at the back of his neck, but he seemed more focused on your words than on getting himself clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smiled and hugged him tight. \"Thanks. I know you don't really like this, but thanks for not arguing or anything. I mean, you probably could make a really big mess if you wanted to, so... I'm really lucky to have someone like you here.\" He blushed a little bit, but comfortably let his arms move over your shoulders, hugging back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody never do that... Cody is the lucky one.\" You couldn't help but wipe your eyes a little bit, holding him as tight as you could. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You're going away, master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for the night. I have to take care of some business. Do you think you can take care of yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You know where the food is, and you can entertain yourself, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Cody just no like being alone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... Come here.\" You couldn't help but smile as you pulled him in tight. He gave a soft whine, but seemed to relax under your grip. You were just grateful that his growth seemed to have settled down. It had been a couple of weeks, and thankfully, Cody's growth seemed to have peaked. He still had trouble getting through doorways, but you were just grateful that he could stay inside. He was still a handful, but he did his best to take care of himself as well. You could trust him alone, and since you had to go out a fair ways for some business, there really wasn't anything else you really could do. You doubted it would be safe for other people to see him, and as much as you hated the idea of leaving him alone, you knew you couldn't always keep your eyes on him. \"Promise me you'll stay out of trouble, okay? If you do, I'll make sure to bring you back something as well. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody promise.\" He sad it a little sadly, but he seemed to know. You gave him a firm pat on his head before heading out. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed quietly as you laid back in your motel room. The day had gone back quickly enough, and you couldn't help but think of Cody along the way. You had made sure to get him a new toy and some food for him, but you never felt comfortable driving during the night. Things always distracted you during the night, and having Cody certainly didn't change that. You always just stayed at a cheap place and woke up early the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that Cody was already asleep. He liked to stay up later than he should, and most times, he would only head to sleep when you did. While he was alone, it meant he might stay up all night or something. It did make you worry a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to chuckle to yourself. Here you were, worrying about Cody sleeping enough, when you knew his health had been in good condition. If you had to compare him to any normal dog, he would be just as healthy, if not better. Maybe you had just gotten too used to worrying about your pets. You just couldn't shake any of your old worries. You had spent a good deal of time making sure that Cody could be okay. You even went into the trouble of trying to teach him how to use your house phone, in case he needed to call you. It had been awkward for him to try to dial the few times, and before he had started using his powers to do so, you had a few random calls you had to handle. You hadn't heard from him yet, and since you told him not to answer, you couldn't just call to check up on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really wasn't anything you could do about it. You just shifted around in the bed, closing your eyes as you tried to rest. You could hear Cody's voice as you thought of him, imagining him greeting you eagerly upon your return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! Here you are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but chuckle as you heard him. You quietly muttered to yourself. \"It's only been a little while, Cody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody didn't want to bother Master... Cody felt lonely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... I'm sorry, Cody. You know that I'd never want to leave you alone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted a little bit. Something felt off, though you couldn't tell what. Sure, your imagination was good, but it was never that vivid. Still, as your eyes opened back up, you knew that something was going on as you heard his voice again. \"Cody understand... Cody just glad to talk with master now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped wide awake as you realized...</span></div></div>",

He was sitting on the ground in front of your bed, but his face was close to yours as you felt him trying to shift onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCody tried staying at home... Cody even got to explore the house a little bit! But... It still lonely...\u201d He turned and shifted, his muzzle lightly pressing to your chest. You let your arm around him as he spoke, and he seemed to cheer up a little. \u201cSo Cody came out after you! Cody could follow Master's scent really easily!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you followed me? Cody, don't be...\u201d You stammer out, having trouble finding the right words. You just sigh and shake your head a bit before pulling him in tight. \u201cCody, please... You know you shouldn't take any risks, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCody understand! That's why Cody make sure it okay before he left! Cody was careful to lock door before he leave... Good weather, and short distance, so Cody could run it! \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-cody, you <i>ran</i> here? You shouldn't be... I know you've been doing a lot better, but you shouldn't be pushing...\u201d You sigh quietly, just shaking your head a little. \u201cNever mind... You're here now, right... Please don't overdo it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCody is fine, see?\u201d He just sits in front of you, happily wagging and pushing at you and licking at your cheek. \u201cCody is careful!\u201d You took a quick glance over his body, quietly noticing that although he certainly look like he had just come from a long run, he was still in good condition and his heartbeat and breathing were still steady. It was difficult to believe, but he seemed okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad... Really, though... I'm glad that you're okay... I mean, you could've been seen... It would've been bad if someone else spotted you, and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody shook his head vigorously, almost lifting you up as he did. \u201cNo, no... Cody make sure nobody see him like this...\u201d He pulled back for a moment as he heard the concern in your voice. \u201cCody was really careful to hide on his way...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hide? You sure? I'm not sure how you could...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody nodded eagerly. \u201cCody figured it out while you were gone! Cody know that it would be trouble if he got seen... So Cody figure how to avoid problems! Cody can show you, if you like!\u201d He just smiled gently as he climbed off the bed, still on all fours as he looked at you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure...\u201d You try to stand up, just keeping your eyes on Cody. You take care not to blink or close your eyes, making sure that you understood what he's doing. However, before you could even realize it, Cody seemed to shift from your field of vision. There wasn't enough time for you to even properly react, before you noticed that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are suddenly gripped by a sensation of light-headedness before you collapse back onto the bed in total shock as you vision blurs and spins. Above the sound of ringing in your ears, you can hear Cody yelp out in alarmed concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is nothing but darkness and silence.<br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken to find yourself still lying on your back in the bed of your motel room, except now you are also in Cody's tight embrace as he runs his muzzle over your face, licking you in an attempt to get some form of response out of you, as the sound of Cody's desperate, terrified sobs fill your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! Oh Master, please, please, please wake up! Cody's sorry, Master! Please wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cody? Cody? I'm alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sobs abruptly stop and Cody pulls back, allowing you to see that his eyes are wet and glistening with fresh tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! Oh, Master!\" Cody joyfully exclaims before leaping to his feet, yanking you up with him as he lavishes his adoration upon you.   You are gripped by an odd feeling of the floor falling out from under you as Cody pulls you up so that you are face to face, leaving your legs dangling at least a foot and a half above the floor. Before you can even vocalize your surprise at being lifted so high and so easily by a dog who only just a month ago was barely had enough strength to live, Cody speaks again, pulling you into a massive embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, Cody so glad that you're okay! Cody was so scared!\" He suddenly stopped and pulled back, silent, eyes wide and ears folded flat against his head. \"Di-Did Cody do something wrong?\" He whispered, so softly and so full of distress, it actually hurt to witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Cody, no! Not at all, you did nothing wrong!\" You immediately tell him, almost unable to stand the pain in his eyes. \"I was just taken off-guard by... well, by that. Cody, you just turned invisible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's tail begins to wag rapidly. \"Cody sure did Master! That was what Cody did to hide from other people and get in here to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at that point that you realize a few things, now that your thoughts are in a clear, logical order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, Cody? Can you put me down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody let out a quiet whine of embarrassment and quickly but gently lowered you to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head far back in order to look all the way up into Cody's gray eyes, which stare back at you intently. Even with having just been picked up by him, it really hits you again as to just how much Cody has grown over the past three weeks, going from a tiny, dying puppy who could fit in your hand, no more than 7 inches from nose to tail, to a huge, towering dog, who on two legs was at least 7 foot and 6 inches from the base of his paws to the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep sigh and try to focus your thoughts so that you can get started on asking some important questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long was I unconscious for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, only for about twenty seconds Master. But it was so, so scary because Cody was so afraid that something bad had happened to you, and when you started swaying Cody got a shock and then you fell unconscious and wouldn't wake up and oh Master, Master, it was awful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a tug at your heartstrings and immediately leaped up to embrace Cody, wrapping your arms around the middle of his abdomen. \"Aw, Cody. Don't worry, everything's alright. I know it must have been scary but you don't have to worry now. I'm okay! And I'd never abandon you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Cody sniff above you, clearly struggling to hold back a flood of emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Cody manages to choke out without breaking down into hysterical sobs. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing, the pure, raw emotion in that statement, you can't help but smile, as it's times like this that you remember the real, tangible good that you do for the animals you care for. That is what makes this line of work worth it, even with the sorrow and loss that comes with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs beautiful and heart-warming as this moment is, however, you feel that you should probably get back to asking those questions before the both of you get lost in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Cody? Before you told me that you... you ran here, you said that you locked the door behind you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes Master! Cody was very careful when leaving the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's good Cody, that's very good. Now, I take it you have the key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody does have the keys, Cody put them on the bedside table with the room key!\" Cody affirmed, pointing to said bedside table. Your gaze followed his outstretched arm and sure enough, on the bedside table, laid your house key, along with your car key, your motel room key, and another key that you deduced must have been the key that Cody used to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that explained a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody, where did you get the key you used to get in?\" You asked, suddenly concerned that someone might notice a missing key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody borrowed it from reception, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat presented a problem. Fortunately, in about five seconds you had a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Cody, I want you to do something for me. I want you to go and put that key back exactly where you put it, and then come back here and knock, and I'll let you in and you can spend the night with me. In the morning, well, we'll figure that out when the time comes. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's tail began to wag and he beamed, \"Cody understands, Master!\" With that, he stepped forward, grabbed the key and pulled the door open, turning to give a final goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Master. I'll be just a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Cody simply disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, as you now knew, seemed to disappear. The door closed and you were left alone in your motel room. You laid back down on the bed and stared at the ceiling as your mind wandered off with the thoughts of how incredible your current situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your thoughts were abruptly interrupted by a knocking at your door. You shot up and rushed over to the door and pulled it open to see an empty hallway. You moved back to the end of the little passage, past the door into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stopped moving, the door closed and Cody materialized in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again,\" Cody said in a voice that was not his own. The voice is so striking that you immediately recognize it as the voice of the being who spoke to you three weeks ago when Cody first began to develop his new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything in response, Cody's eyes shift from gray to violet and his fur shifts from black to white as a pair of wings sprout from his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" You manage to mumble out, unsure of what else you could say, to which Cody laughs in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid, I just want to talk. I'm interested in hearing how you are coping with your new situation directly from you in your own words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never imagined that my actions would lead to this. I'm taking care of a dog who has powers that until three weeks ago, were exclusive to fiction and it's all thanks to you. Who are you anyway? And I don't mean what is your name and what do I call you, you answered that already; I call you Cody. I mean who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody smiled and said, \"Well, I think you know the answer to that already but I'll happily clarify for you. I am a God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the air leave your lungs in a gasp of not-quite-surprise. It was something that you had suspected since the beginning but it was still quite a shock to have it confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stepped over to you and placed a hand on your shoulder, looking down into your eyes. \"Are you alright? I understand that this is quite a shock for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm okay.\" You assure him. You had never been a religious person but you had always kept an open mind as to the possibility of the existence of a divine being or divine beings. Now that that had been confirmed, it opened up so many lines of questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Cody's muzzle lifted in a warm smile. \"If you say so. I know this is a lot to take in so I'll leave you and Cody for the time being. I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Cody removed his hand from your shoulder, as his fur returned to its usual color and his wings seemed to fade away. Cody's eyes closed and when they opened he suddenly looked incredibly tired. You were just relieved that he hadn't fallen unconscious like last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's jaws parted in a huge yawn. \"Master? Can I sleep with you tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and wrapped your arms around him in a hug. \"Of course, Cody. Let's go to bed.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's still an experience waking up with Cody every morning. Though the changes should've been small, you always wake up with the dog strewn over your sheets, the change always visible whenever you wake. Even in your unfamiliar surroundings, you can spot the shift in his posture as he awakens. By now, his form was comparable to that of a runner, a healthy sheen to his fur and yet another inch of height clear even as he curls up to your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you shift up off the bed, he jumps to attention, his tongue over your face in moments. \"Master! You're up! Is it time to head out now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle as your hand moves over his muzzle, rubbing at him for a few moments before you manage to nudge his weight off of your body. \"Alright, alright. Just calm down, there. I was going to stop by breakfast, but I suppose we should just head home instead.\" Your eyes pass up and down over his body for a few moments, searching for any hint of stress. Though you had no idea what to expect, Cody had still run for miles to follow you, and then done <i>something</i> to turn himself invisible. It would be best to keep an eye on his health, just in case his new abilities had other consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, so no food yet?\" Cody whines as he scootches to the side of the bed, sliding off but placing his paws at the edge, eyes begging for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can take you out for meals yet, Cody. You can turn invisible, but it's still going to look odd if food starts to disappear off my plate, or if someone bumps into you. Let's just get home first, alright? If you can be invisible, I think you can ride in the car.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The dog jumps back on, the bed creaking as his mass slams back onto you. \"Yay! Cody doesn't think he's gotten to ride yet,\" He laughs as he scrambles over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! Just let me get my things and check out from here, and we can get going!\" You laugh as he bounces against your body, muzzle pushing about before he jumps off, pacing at the base of the bed. He paces more and more laps through the small room, bounding off the bed, peeking in the closet, and dipping his head into the bathroom as you throw everything into your luggage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're out the door, he's vanished from sight. It only takes a few minutes for you to check out, and when you get to your car, you can hear his paws padding against the ground, impatient to climb in. You step over to your small vehicle, opening the back door for him. \"You'd better get in here - I don't know if I have enough room for you up front.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Master!\" Though you can't see his form, it's weird to watch the car seat shift around, seat belt shifting under and creases showing as Cody slides into place. An indent shows he's in, the slight whapping of his tail visible as it nudges against the back. You chuckle as you reach forward, giving his lap a pat. \"Do you need any help with the seat belt? Are you going to be able to sit still for that long?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try, Master,\" He murmurs, the belt shifting as he grabs at the buckle. The metal thing swings and shifts all about, and you watch the indent shift before it clicks into place. \"Like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough,\" You chuckle as you get into your seat. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">__________</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're finally home!\" You hear the click of the seat belt releasing, and the air shifts as Cody bounds out the open window. His paws trod all over the lawn and across the pavement before you hear the shuffling settle in at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but chuckle as you picture him scampering around - even invisible, it's far too easy for you to picture him fumbling on all fours, padding through your yard, dashing around the house before settling in. It's a miracle that he was able to sit still for an hour and a half of driving. It had helped when you let him stick his head out the window or when you took a rest stop just so he could stretch out, but the long drive must've done a number to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, there,\" You laugh as you unlock and open the door, Cody's form visible as he scrambles in, skidding into the couch. \"I take it you don't like driving too much?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay, but running's better,\" The dog responds, already spread out, his body laying across the full length of those cushions. \"Wind felt nice on Cody's face! It's just a shame it was kind of slow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow? But we were on the highway the entire time, right? I mean, we're going faster than...\" Your mind pauses for a few moments as you try to process things. Sure, the distance was runnable, but you assumed that he took most of a day to find you. If he was calling the car slow, then... \"Um... Cody? How long did it take you to run to where I was staying?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Um... Cody didn't look at the time,\" He murmurs, turning to face you. \"But the time... The sun was going down when Cody left. Does that help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause as you process it. Did he leave after sunset? You thought he had taken all day to run to you, but it sounds like he had managed it in less than an hour! Was that even possible? You had been worried about his health, but there's no way around it by now - Cody was doing things far beyond what he should be capable of. New powers aside, the thought of him running faster than a car was... alarming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... And you definitely feel okay, right? Heart's steady and all? No pain or anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Master! Cody knows to tell Master if anything feels wrong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. If this was really the new 'normal' for Cody, you couldn't keep treating him like the same sickly pup he was. But... Just what would that entail? Curiosity and concern both swirl through your thoughts, and you steel yourself to ask for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, then, Cody. If... If that's the case, maybe we should see about letting you exercise a little more. It sounds like you're already running fast. Um... Then, what about other parts of your health? Do you know how strong you are?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How strong?\" The dog scritches at his chin for a few moments, tilting his head. \"Um...\" He shifts off from the couch, before sliding his paw under. He holds his breath, his body shuddering for a moment, his arm at work, holding in place for a few moments. For a moment, you step forward, ready to tell him not to push himself. But as he continues, his arm subtly shifts, its shaking stopping, replaced by a smooth motion. With a steady lift, he hauls the entire couch up in one arm, hoisting it over his head. \"This strong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape at the sight. Sure, Cody was a lot bigger - even toned enough that you'd compare him to a runner. However, even a strength-focused athlete would be impressed by what Cody's doing. Picking up a massive piece of furniture in one arm, and holding it like it's nothing? That was beyond just 'strong'. You stare at him for a couple of moments, eyes passing over his arm, processing the image as you try to confirm you're not dreaming. His firm arm still holds in place, even shifting and tensing as he continues. \"Um... M-master? Is something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, just... Just... Can you put the couch down? Gently?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couch is brought back to the floor, crooked but in place. Cody's smiling when he finishes, but when he turns back to you, his own expression drops. Cody's staring back at you, head tilted, a whine escaping his lips. \"Did Cody... Was Cody bad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you weren't!\" You wave your arms for a few moments, before you rush over to Cody, arms wrapped around to comfort him. \"Y-you just...\" You murmur, fingers patting over his back. \"It's great that you're big and strong and healthy,\" You hurry and say. \"I was just worried that you were pushing yourself or something, or that you'd hurt yourself trying something like that! As long as you're healthy, there's no problem with being big and strong,\" You continue. \"Honestly, it's probably a good thing,\" You mutter. \"You just... You keep surprising me, you know,\" You mutter. \"B-but it's fine. After all, it's a good thing if I'm surprised by a healthy dog every morning!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Cody stammers out, his breathing easier when he catches your words. \"Cody understands! Cody will do his best for Master!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't ask for more,\" You murmur. You manage to smile, even as your mind continues working, still struggling to process just what you're dealing with. The rest of the day goes by in a blur as you care for Cody, the rest of your energy gone as you try to keep up with the energetic dog. You know that you had prepared food for him, taken him to the backyard for play, given him a bath, and done everything else you could think of, but your actions never really register in mind. It's all you can do to try to handle the fact that Cody was possessed by a god, or sharing a body with one, or something equally unique. You knew he was special, but you hadn't expected the consequences to be this extreme. By the time the evening comes, your mind and body are both completely exhausted. It's all you can do to tuck in, hoping a night of sleep will give you a fresher perspective on things. You don't even notice when Cody shuffles into his usual spot on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may have thought about a lot of things, but in your conscious mind, you never thought about what Cody was up to now. You had no idea just how much Cody had taken your words to heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat becomes clear the next morning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a quiet, contented moan as you slowly wake up, blearily opening your eyes to the sight of your room, as the warmth of the covers and Cody's form suffuse through your body, leaving you all cozy and snug. A smile tugs at your lips. It'd be nice to stay like this, but you have things to do, and with all the changes Cody's been going through recently, you can't waste time in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a breath as you think back to the events of yesterday. You still struggled to wrap your head around it all, Cody was sharing his body with a god, or something like that, whatever it was, it was almost impossible to believe and if you hadn't seen Cody change like that and develop all these new powers you probably wouldn't have believed it at all. With what you'd seen, however? It was undeniable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran through your body as the implications struck you again. If he was... if he was a god, then... was he able to do anything? Could he warp time and space without even the slightest bit of effort? Could he change the laws of physics on a whim? You shudder as the questions race through your mind. The thought of a being so powerful as to be able to completely defy or change the very laws of reality... you couldn't deny it, it was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat scared you, even more, was the question of what would happen to Cody? Since he was being possessed by this god... or however it worked, would he start developing power on that scale too? He was already so much bigger and stronger than the vast majority of humans and he could outrun cars with ease without seeming the least bit winded. The thought worried you, would Cody be able to handle all that power? He was such a sweet, pure-hearted soul, the thought of him achieving literal godhood was more than a bit concerning. As fast as he was learning, you doubted he'd be ready for such power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least Cody would undoubtedly be a benevolent god if that were ever the case. Thinking about it, you had to concede that the god who was inhabiting Cody's body certainly seemed like a genuinely good soul too. He had praised you for your care of so many of his 'children' as he had said, and he had been nothing but polite and supportive throughout the few conversations you had had. You let out a sigh, shaking your head. This was all a bit too much for so early in the day. You hadn't even gotten out of bed yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you haul yourself up, pulling the covers off, Cody immediately jumps up, fully awake. \"Master! You're awake!\" He beams, leaning over and eagerly lapping at your face, drawing a chuckle from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm up, I'm up.\" You smiled, gently guiding his muzzle away from your face, grinning as his tongue lapped over your palm for a few licks before he stopped. \"You have a good night?\" You asked as you gently nudged Cody's weight off you. You couldn't help but note that it seemed that he was quite a bit heavier than last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Master! Cody had a wonderful night! Cody has a big surprise to show you!\" He exclaimed excitedly, backing up off the bed so that you could get a proper view of his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze at the sight, your eyes going wide as you saw exactly what it was that Cody was so eager to show you. He was bigger. A lot bigger. As he stood to his full height, it struck you just how massive he was now, utterly dwarfing even his previous height. He had to have been well past eight feet tall now, probably going on nine, judging by the fact that his head was close to the ceiling. Stunned, you look over Cody's towering frame. He's massive, there's simply no other way to describe him. That fact alone boggles your mind. It's still hard to comprehend the fact that he's so huge when he was so small and vulnerable when you first met him. Just yesterday you had compared his form to that of a runner - slender with sleek, powerful muscle. Now, however, he was built more like a bodybuilder. His chest and abdomen were packed with thick, solid and surprisingly well-defined muscles and his limbs had filled out quite substantially - his biceps were impressively large even when relaxed, as where his calves and quadriceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you took in the stunning visage of Cody's new, bigger stature, you could only blurt out the obvious. \"Cody! You're... you're huge!\" You yelped, grimacing inwardly. It was hardly insightful, but with the shock, it was the only thing you could think of to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's face lit up with joy as his tail began to whip around behind him. \"Yes, Master! Cody's all big and strong now! Just like you want!\" He beamed proudly. You started as you were struck by the realisation that Cody had considered what you had told him yesterday, while you were comforting him, and he had taken it to heart, and taken it much further than you could have ever expected!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I... I see. Right, uh...\" You stammered out, to which Cody tilted his head to the side, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? Is something wrong?\" He asked anxiously. \"Cody... Cody thought getting bigger and stronger was a good thing?\" He whimpered, which served to snap you into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, it is! It absolutely is Cody, I'm just surprised, that's all! I wasn't expecting you to grow so big so quickly... But, you're totally right, it's good that you're getting bigger and stronger, it means you're healthy! And I want you to be as healthy and as happy as you can be!\" You smiled warmly, your mind flashing back to when you first met him. A tiny, shivering little thing who was so weak his body could barely sustain itself. It was such a far cry from the tall, muscular humanoid dog standing in front of you, the very picture of health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your reassuring words drew a smile from Cody, you couldn't help but find it sweet that Cody had done this simply in an attempt to make you happy, that still didn't explain what was perhaps the most important question of all. As you began to come to terms with the fact that Cody was now so much bigger, that question came to the forefront of your thoughts, and your lips. \"Cody... how exactly did you grow so much?\" You asked although you suspected you knew the answer already. So much growth in such a short time span simply couldn't be natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dog brought a paw up to scratch at his chin for a moment as he tilts his head, brow furrowed slightly as he thinks. \"Well, Cody's not sure how, but... Cody wanted to be bigger and stronger for Master, so Cody got bigger and stronger!\" He explained, smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confirmed it. You let out a breath, trying to figure out what your next course of action should be. After a moment of thought, you decided it was for the best to simply carry on as normal, although you were going to get a full checkup done soon. Well, as full a checkup as you could, given what you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to refocus your thoughts, you look up at Cody, smiling softly at how eager he looks. \"Heh, that's really sweet of you Cody. You're really growing up into a big, strong dog, aren't you?\" You ask rhetorically, prompting a happy whine from Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go get breakfast!\" You smile, unable to resist chuckling as Cody enthusiastically heads for the kitchen, ducking to allow his enormous frame to pass under the doorframe as he steps through at an angle, allowing his broad shoulders to fit through without difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast thankfully passed fairly uneventfully. It was somewhat disorienting to be in the kitchen with Cody now that his immense frame took up so much more space, but you made it work. Cody, for his part, was as eager as ever. Using his power, he had levitated everything he had needed and prepared himself a massive bowl of cereal, proudly demonstrating his capability to you. You had to admit, it was truly fantastic to see him like this, especially when compared to the condition he had been in at the beginning. It was a wonderful change compared to the all-too-common sorrow.<br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n\"Uh, Cody?\" You asked, drawing his attention away from his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master?\" He replied instantly, his ears perked and his eyes focused, giving you his full, undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, uh, just wanted to check, you're okay? No pain in your joints or anything like that?\" You inquired, unable to keep the concern out of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Master, Cody's fine! You don't need to worry Master, Cody would tell you if something was wrong or if Cody was in pain!\" He reassured you. Nodding slowly, you relaxed, letting out a heaving breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good, good. I just want to make sure you're okay, that's all. After, well...\" You trailed off, shaking your head. \"You've gone through some really big changes since then!\" You mused, to which Cody nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, uh, Cody?\" You asked suddenly, as you came to a realisation. \"You, er... You're a lot... bigger than yesterday, so, you must be a lot stronger now then.\" You noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody frowned for a moment before nodding again. \"Yes, Cody does feel a lot stronger now!\" He smiled proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding as you look back down at your now slightly cold toast, you press your lips together. \"Cody... could we... could we check how strong you are after breakfast?\" You asked. You had to know, things were bizarre enough already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Master!\" He beamed, drawing a slight smile from you. As sweet and innocent as always, even if he looked like a professional athlete. You picked up your toast and began to eat. The quicker you were done with breakfast, the faster you could test Cody's new strength.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't even taste your breakfast with your mind so preoccupied. It was too distracting watching Cody nibbles through his cereal, and though he does his best with a spoon, he's unable to resist digging his muzzle into the bowl and chomping down everything within. Even bent over, his shoulders and back still rise over your gaze, a testament to his new height and mass. His crunches echo through the kitchen, the dog munching through it all. It only takes a matter of minutes before he's done, and you realize your own meal is gone, the toast already chewed through without even realizing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog shifts up against you, muzzle brushing against the top of your head. \"All done, Master?\" He asks, voice rumbling out when he nuzzles in against you. You shudder as your balance is pushed, the nuzzle alone enough to make your body stumble. \"So, how should Cody test his strength?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah, yeah, I'm set,\" You say, holding your breath as you look over the dog. \"Well, um... We should probably just find something for you to lift, right? I don't think we can really go to a gym, though. What do you think you're capable of lifting?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Probably a lot!\" The dog shrugs as one hand moves to the chair, his grip shifting before he casually lifts it up, hoisting it up to his waist. It didn't look like he was taking any effort to bring that high enough that it could nudge into the ceiling. \"This is light,\" He murmurs, before you hear the scratch of wood against the ceiling. \"A-ah,\" The dog murmurs, fumbling with the chair for an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's okay,\" You say, doing your best to reassure the dog even as your heart pounds harder and harder. \"Let's just do this outside, alright? You'll have a bit more room to move there,\" You murmur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" A few eager wags preface the dog's eager wags, and in an instant, he's dashing off to the front door, wagging loud enough that you can hear his thumps from the kitchen. You swallow and peek outside first, already wondering whether it would be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the car, Cody. We should find a better place for that. I think my neighbors might panic a little if they saw you lifting everything nearby,\" You murmur. The padding of paws shifts, heavy footsteps now moving to the garage instead. You swallow as you follow, the dog following behind the moment you go through, even sprawling into the back seat when you open it for him. As much as he's able to, at least - the dog needs to curl and shift just to fit inside, all of his mass squeezing in as he settles in, it impossible for him to sit normally in the seat anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car starts up, though its movements are a bit more sluggish than you're used to. Your mind goes over places where Cody could run free for a while - up in the mountains and into the hiking trails, perhaps? It would be a bit less busy, at the least. With your mind as numb as it is, you simply go on your first impulse and start driving along that trail. Cody is out of sight by the time the car takes off, though from your view, it's impossible to ignore the massive crease that the dog makes in the seat, or the thump of his tail against whatever it's impacting on its most recent swing. The minutes pass by with his eager pants sounding out, mixing with the rumble of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost an hour before you arrive, but your mind's so busy that you barely even realize the time ticking by. The parking lot and the start of the trail only had a few cards parked nearby, and it didn't look like anybody was in sight. You swallow as you step out, before you open the back door for the dog. His paws hit the ground, the sound of four firm limbs touching the ground sounding out. You hold your breath for a moment, before nodding down towards the door. \"Okay, if... If you don't smell anybody still here, you can appear for a little,\" You murmur, holding your breath. \"This should mostly be wilderness and there are only a few hikers, so we can probably find a few rocks or something for you to lift,\" You mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you weren't expecting it, you would've jumped when Cody suddenly flashes back into your sight, a thick chest pushing right into your vision. The dog blinks a little and tilts his head. \"Rocks? But... Won't they be too light, Master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too... light?\" You blink at those words, mind trying to process just what he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" The dog responds, before he bends down. \"Rocks aren't any heavier than your car, right?\" He asks. One hand brushes along the metal frame, trying to find purchase underneath. Before you have a chance to respond, his hand find a good grip and the car goes up, a simple and smooth motion hoisting it upwards, that arm alone lifting and keeping it right above his head. \"See? The car's really light, so rocks are probably just like it,\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-cody... Could you please put my car down now? Gently, please,\" You say, your voice almost cracking at the sight. You knew Cody looked strong, but this was beyond what his size should allow. He was strong, but even he should struggle a little bit. Instead, you could barely see the tension in that arm, the pump of his chest - any sign that he was even trying! He didn't even look like he was flexing that arm, the bulge of it still similar to the other hanging at his side. \"They... Cars can break if you're too rough with them,\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog's muzzle goes up and down, his smile never leaving his face. \"Ah, got it!\" The car lowers down, inch by inch, the dog careful to let it touch the ground slowly. \"See? No problem!\" So, Cody will need something heavier than that to test his strength!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-got it,\" You say, doing your best to keep your tone even. Maybe you were getting used to Cody's changes - if you had known he could lift cars a couple of days ago, you'd probably already be blabbering again. But after the last few days, after worrying him so often, you don't want to make the dog drop his smile so soon. Without a moment's pause, you say the first thing that comes to mind. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMaybe you can try moving a tree?\u201d you looked around as a shiver in the winds rustled the pine along the trail. A chill ran down your back as the breeze went past you, and before you realized it Cody had wrapped his arms around you and his warmth stopped the chill. You tilted your head up and smiled nervously into his face, rosy cheeked as he said with a child's smile, \u201csure thing master.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited to let go until the breeze passed then slowly slipped from you. He left behind a soft aroma, lilac maybe? His eyebrow fur furrowed slightly, but he still kept a smile. Your anxieties of his changes were building over the course of the past few days. He was keeping quiet about it this time when he clearly saw your look and would have said something. He didn\u2019t ask this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis powerful form walked to a nearby pine on the trail. You saw one of his paws stop half between a step then looked up to him turning back at you with a somewhat worried look, \u201cOh, master? Cody don\u2019t want to hurt the tree. Cody put back after lifting. That okay?\u201d He spoke shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, y\u2026yeah,\u201d the shine of his collar\u2019s gold tag twinkled in the sun as he turned to keep walking. You could barely believe the red band that held it could still fit across the thick muscle of his neck. His voice was a little deeper than before he had this last growth too. His muzzle was slightly longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went behind the thick trunk of this 60-70 foot pine. You knew he could probably do it, no he definitely could. You tried not to clench. A fear was washing over your body as the wind died down. You couldn\u2019t hide it behind a chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were creaking noises, then the sounds of the roots. You watched, but you weren\u2019t looking. His strength, his powers, his growth, and how the world may react, and the feelings in you gathered as Cody slowly and effortlessly pulled up the roots of this probably 4 ton tree. You\u2019d lived alone for a while and taking in sweet small creatures with few chances at proper lives. Things were different now with Cody. The time with him has been wonderful beyond dreams at times, but they were escalating. The situation was leaving your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few roots let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if someone found out about him? What were this god\u2019s intentions? He was and still is just a sweet little puppy. \u201cMaster?\u201d It\u2019s been almost four weeks and he\u2019s changed so much what were you to him? What was your relationship? \u201cMa-ster..?\u201d And when he was strong enough will he get bored of you? Do you matter? \u201c*sniff*.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen in place hyperventilating. Then you caught his eyes as something shined and fell down into the grass from his face. Then more came. He looked at you while holding the tree aloft with dirt floating beneath it. His eyes had the most pain you\u2019d seen in them. He sniveled as tears streamed down his face. One stream came from a grey eye, the other stream from a violet one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn both his own sweet childlike voice and the other he spoke softly between his sniffling, \u201cof course you matter.\u201d He slowly let the tree back down as the roots furled back into the pockets of dirt. It was like he had never lifted it besides the leaves that were no longer around its base. Cody slowly crumpled to the ground and turned his back to the tree as his fur faded to white. Wings sprouted from behind the trunk and wrapped around him. He muttered again, \u201cyou matter\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the chill passed you were shaking nearly uncontrollably. You must have looked like someone standing in front of a train bearing down on them. You were snapped out of it by Cody\u2019s pain and rushed to him, hesitating at first. Your care for him drove that fear away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went around the tree and found a large ball of white feathers and fur sobbing softly. Only his feet and tail showed, shifting as you drew close. You began to cry as well as you hesitantly reached out your hands. You clasped both wings and gently pulled each one back. The wings draped onto the grass and flowers under the tree. None of the flowers were harmed. He goes out of his way to be so gentle, not a petal pressed or stem bent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneeled in front of him. He had dug his muzzle into his lap and covered the front of his face with his hands. You reached out softly petting his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Cody.\u201d You could barely believe that the deity could feel this way. It was your third meeting, and the first time you\u2019ve seen him so sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have read your thoughts,\u201d he finally said as you pat his hair. \u201cThe little one was so sad at your face that he curled into a ball inside. He didn\u2019t want to pry, but he also wanted to know why you were so hurt.\u201d Cody slowly lifted his head as both his violet eyes stared into you, dripping tears into his clenched, down turned, mouth. His eyebrow fur bent upward. \u201cI looked into your heart and heard those last thoughts\u2026you do matter. You matter so much to me, but I understand your fears too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a moment to find the words, \u201cyou were such a small sweetie and over the course of the past few weeks I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve...ever, been this happy, but I should have admitted and been honest the anxieties have flared. I took it slow, and lied sometimes when I said things were okay.\u201d You kept a hand to Cody\u2019s cheek, rubbing him softly and wiping away tears. \u201cI take care of the little ones who might not see a good long life, but then one day I get to a god because I\u2019m somehow kind. And at first when it was going by slowly, I could take it. Then I thought about the future, and the work I put into your kids and Cody. You fixed yourself, became strong by yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou became strong by yourself. And because of that I don\u2019t think I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not it at all!\u201d He had a pleading look as more tears ran down. His hands reached out and held my shoulders firmly. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. My power is your care. My strength <i>is</i> your love. My powers are your compassion. I am not growing stronger by myself. I should have said this sooner, but I was still coming to realize it in me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was growing because of your care? \u201cYou said you were a god, but what does that mean? How are animals your children?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed a hand softly over your heart. Now that you heard his voice for longer, it was that of a young man. He had a strong-willed, soft, but loving voice. \u201cThere are a few others out there like you. I was born in your hearts somewhat recently. I am the spirit of animals, a god with no name,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cI could watch, listen, and feel the pains and joys of all my children but I had no power. Now with a world more aware of my children\u2019s pains I came into being because of you. Even gods need a source to their power. Mine is your love for them, for me.\u201d He sobbed. Around you both some animals had gathered; chipmunks, squirrels, a beaver, rabbits, and some gophers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and the very few like you that heard us cry alone, wishing someone would look our way. \u201cCan we take him in? I know\u2026he doesn\u2019t look healthy, but he needs a home too. He needs someone to love him or her\u201d And I found one in your heart...please don\u2019t be afraid of me. It\u2019s just me, Cody. And you mean the world to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrapped each other in the warmest hug you\u2019d ever given each other after he grew. You felt and rubbed his body. You knew the places he left being rubbed and pet the most. That spot right under his left arm. He pulled you back into him, licking your cheek and nuzzling you as the breeze came again. The smell on him was lilac. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my little sweetheart Cody. I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody\u2019s voice came out of his deity form\u2019s mouth, \u201cCody love you too master.\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent what seemed like an hour lying in Cody\u2019s lap and resting your head against his chest. It was heaven lying in his fur. The soft muscles beneath you rose and fell in a rhythm that relaxed you nearly to sleep. \u201cThe little one is happy. Thank you,\u201d he said, \u201cthough I should assuage your other fears too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said there were others helping your growth. What do you intend to do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAround the world, about two or three dozen people are in the same situation as you. I am being born inside of my children they\u2019ve loved and poured their care into: a sweet young man in Zimbabwe with his little retriever, an old woman in Tibet with her blind blue bear, and a Chilean boy and his earless bunny. You all are giving me a voice and power. I\u2019m growing and learning. And one day I want to give back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven with all the bad things people can do to your children,\u201d you looked up at him concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he smiled, \u201cthis feeling outweighs so much pain. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll give back this love to you and the world, but I intend to once I am fully born. For now, I\u2019ll try to make life easier for you and keep your fears away. I will age a little quicker, but not past a young man. I'm not invincible, but one day. I will gain powers that will hide myself from people and not hurt or destroy. Soon I\u2019ll gain the power to go through objects and not weigh more than a person no matter my size, but still keep my strength. I\u2019ll also be able to change my size at will soon, up to this big right now and bigger as you love me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed. These powers inside of this gentle hearted god and child with the objective of loving the world brought so many possibilities to your mind. \u201cI should take Cody out more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do, he loves having you to himself. He wants to stretch his legs though too. Give people some happiness. Be taught right and wrong\u2026make sure you feel like you make a difference.\u201d He nuzzled you, \u201cI\u2019ve taken away too much time from the little one. He\u2019ll be exhausted when I change back. But before I go, tell me. What power do you want me to gain first?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You made an exit from your car and headed toward your apartment. You were planning on going inside and watching some horror films, maybe pulling an all nighter, possibly drunk texting your ex at dark-thirty in the morning. Your life wasn't that exciting, what with the pay you got from your job. Your pay rate was at the middle ground; you never had any extra money leftover after paying for your home, and you had small amounts of morsels in your refridgerator. Not that your metabolism was very high, anyway, so it wasn't a problem to spare time away from lunch.. or breakfast.. or just not eat at all. Taxes have reportedly eased a bit lately, though, so you'll soon be given a little elbow room and if it stays like that you may be able to afford a better home in a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from money and food, your walk up the stairs to the second story follow a very peculiar sight resting at your front door. You see what looks like a wolf pup, covered in black fur with no other color to speak of. \"Aww..\" You find it adorable yet frightening and agitating that if you make a sound too loud or open the door you could get your face torn off in seconds. But soon you realize the pup is not well. \"Hey, little guy.. you alright?\" You kneel down to grab his haunches, when you realize they aren't haunches; they're human shoulders. \"GuAaaaa..\" You're almost nauseous as you kneel back down and study the canine further. \"It's.. almost shaped exactly like a human..\" You remember it's wound and realize it's not good for any creature to be naked and cut unconscious anywhere, really. \"Don't worry, little guy, I'll help you.. gnh..\" You pick up its relatively small body and realize it's about the size of a small child. \"Wonder how he got all the way over here..\" You open the door, walk in, and lay him down on the couch. \"You're gonna be okay, little guy.\" Besides his worryable condition, you feel loving towards him, like he were one of your own.. a child of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, what am I thinking? He's not human, he's...\" You stare at him, and realize you won't be able to send him out again without him getting hurt again, or more likely dying. But why should you care about that? He's an anthro.. but.. you did bring him inside for a reason, right? It wouldn't be right to just pick him up and lay him outside. That's just weird. You figure, though, that he needs help with those wounds, so you open the closet next to your front door and pick up a first aid kit. \"Not what he might need, but close enough..\" you say quietly as you shut the door. You get some rubbing alcohol and start on the first wound, opening it, cleaning it, and then bandaging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat the process over and over all over his body. You find that his left side is injured much more than the right side is, as though something attacked him on that side. It almost looks like glass lacerated it, but there are no visible shards anywhere. \"He's still breathing, so that's good..\" You check his pulse, and it feels weak, but he is sleeping after all, and there's not much you can do for him heart-wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all of his wounds are disinfected and cleaned, but you figure you could do something about his nudity. \"Hmm..\" You remember you had your favorite shirt as a child in a keepsake box in your closet. You kept it there because you didn't want any risky insurance crisis to happen when your apartment burned down or flooded, so you dropped it last week, allowing you to buy a little more food for yourself and pay your rent on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the box, and brush away all kinds of things you remember from your childhood. Back then, humans and anthros were so much closer to eachother.. You had a best friend who was an anthro. You realize that they looked like the small wolf currently on your couch, and may be why you felt so close to him. But your friend was drafted to the military not long after his 18th birthday, and you never saw him again. You were 16 at the time and struggling in academics, so you weren't sure if he was killed or if he just had a long time to spend there. But when you moved after college, you saw the world was a very different place from back then..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush off the thought as you fish out your folded blue polo, made for someone about the size of the wolf on your couch. You search for a couple more minutes and discover a pair of tan khakis that you almost never changed when you were little, and you smiled at the thought of those days when you were a small child like him. You place the shirt and shorts next to the dark wolf, and then replace your keepsake chest into its place in the closet. You take a seat in the chair next to the couch, guessing you may become injured by your guest if you're too close when they wake up in someone's apartment. You switch on the television, watching sports for a couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you hear a groan coming from the couch, and guessing the wolf was near awake, you shut the television off. The sudden drop in volume caused the wolf to turn over to see what happened, and discovered very different surroundings. He yelped and stood up on the couch, before seemingly collapsing. You realize he's hurt his legs more than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please settle down, you're very hurt!\" The wolf looks you in the eye, unsure whether or not to trust you. \"Please, you need to settle down.\" You make sure to gesture and slow down your voice to signify what you're trying to say in any way. You weren't sure if he was able to speak or not, so you tried your best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf glares at you for a second more before slowly adjusting themselves into a dog sitting position on your couch. \"Can you speak?\" You ask moderately slowly. \"Can you tell me your name?\" The wolf..</span></div></div>",

You and nine others had just gone to the desert to go on an all-out air soft war. You lay in your bed as you had lost pretty much all of your energy. You roommate John walked into the room and told you \"why don't you take a shower and I'll get dinner ready. You looked at him and told him \"ok, but did you already shower since you were dustier than me.\" He looked at me and told me \"yeah dinner will be ready in two hours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're roommate leaves and you walk into the bathroom and shower getting out all of the dust from your body. You get out of the shower and Dry off; you put on new clothes and lay in your bead and fall asleep trying to regain energy. You let the cool air of your room soothe you as you drift off into a dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------2hrs later--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are awoken to a knock on your bedroom door, and you're roommate was standing there \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dinners ready hope you like steak!\" You look at him and get up following him to the dining room/kitchen and sit at one end while he sits at the other. You both dig into you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dinner and about twenty minutes later you finish your dinner and throw it in the trash. You notice that the trash needs to go out so you decide right now would be a good time. You walk outside and throw away the garbage in the black trash can. You were on your away back inside when you heard a feint \"h~help\" You look around the court yard and found nothing. You unlock the gate and walk out into the drive way and in the middle of it you saw what looked like a teenaged German shepherd anthro. You mutter a \"shit\" as you approach the anthro. You didn't know about anthro's much since you never really met one besides one of your friends but he was a Wolf anthro, and he was at the air soft war today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pick him up and feel that he is really light and is bleeding. You run inside and yell \"John! Get my med bag from the second cabinet now!\" You hear a crash and John appears in the front entry way with a large medical bag slung over his shoulder. He ran right beside me and opened it up all of the way. You looked over the Shepherds body and looked in horror. Bruises, cuts, and even a few burns littered the poor teenaged anthro's body. You immediately began to pull out roll after roll of gauze out of the bag. You wrapped the biggest wound on his stomach first. It almost immediately bled through the first layer while you were working through the second layer. You moved onto the second wound and managed to close it pretty easily. The hardest part was the burns, for when you were about to put the cream on the anthro regained consciousness. He looked up at you with his sapphire blue eyes in pain as you rubbed the burn cream on his singed fur and rubbed it so it could reach his skin. You knew the burns were third degree since it was the last thing you learned before you went on spring break from collage. You got all of the burns and pulled out something you never expected to use an I.V. You looked down at the unconscious Shepherd and told John \"before I start the I.V. let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move him to my room.\" He looked at you before the both of you pick him up lightly and moved him into your room where you proceeded to start the I.V. you walk around him checking for more wounds but found that you got all of the severe one's; you sigh in relief and sat in the chair in front of your computer I began to think about the nature of the injury's when John returned with three bottles of water. One was placed on the night stand and the other was given to me while the last one he drank. You drank mine and turned to the computer and turned it on. You pulled up a blank incident report to fill out for the police and worked on that for five minutes. You turned to the still unconscious Shepherd teen and began to think of people that would do this. None came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 you sat there just staring at the anthro on my bed and felt bad. You turned back and put on your headphones and did some other things before just letting the music play and lay back on the chair and decompressed on what just happened. You laid you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feet up on the side of the bed and began to drift off. You were a light sleeper so you would notice if the German shepherd would wake up. You woke up and it was morning and John was standing at the door with a police officer behind him. You stood up and printed the incident report. You walked out to the living room with them grabbing the report and sat with them over a cup of coffee. You explained what happened and that you properly bandaged him. He looked at me and told you 'well he is a citizen but since he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak since he is unconscious he will stay with you two\" Both you and john looked at each other before responding with an \"ok.\" The both of you let the officer go and returned to your room. You cleaned up quietly a bit and worked on a paper on your computer for the rest of the day. About noon two of your friends met the two of you for a study session, but first the two of you showed him the unconscious anthro and Derek you're human friend looked discussed, and Jacob you're usually happy go lucky anthro wolf friend looked angry. You all walked into the living room and talked for two hours. Before they had to go to dinner they invited the two of you but we couldn't so you told John \"you go and have some fun I will stay, but don't stay too late like usual.\" He looked at you and smiled for the first time today and told you \"ok and I will bring something back for you\" You nodded before returning to your room to go and study fire science. It was a coincidence that the four of you all wanted to become fire fighters. And so every weekend you would meet for a study session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were in the middle of the chapter in the book when you felt the bed shift. You looked over and saw that the Shepherd anthro was beginning to stir. You put the book down and picked up the med bag and slowly approached the awakening shepherd anthro. You set the bag down gently and put your hand on his head to check the temperature. He was fine, and the shepherd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes slowly opened and for the second time you saw the crystal clear sapphire blue eyes. He tried to sit up but you stopped him and whispered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit up you are badly injured, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any wounds to open up.\" He looked at you and nodded and you pulled over the chair and sat next to him and began to ask him a question \"what is your name\" you whispered. \"S~Shane\" he whispered and coughed. You looked at the bottle of water on the Night stand and put it in one paw while taking out the I.V. I looked at him and asked \"what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you're age?\" he responded clearly \"I'm eighteen.\" you look over at him and noticed that the both of you and John were the same age. You asked a few more minor questions and found that you both had the same birthday. You looked over at him and asked him a serious question \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are you ready to talk about what happened to you or would you like to wait?\" He looked at me and said \"ok I'll tell you, but first can you take this wretched collar off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You looked at his neck and saw the collar and it was wrapped tight around his neck. I unbuckled the black collar and looked at it for a moment and saw it looked expensive and you turned to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was a pet to a Girl the same age we grew up together she used to be nice to me she even treated me like I was her brother, but one summer when she was ten she went to summer camp. She returned with a friend, and he was a boy She began to abuse me. She would hit me, burn me, and once or twice even cut me. I tried to get out before but then she would torture me. I found out the boy taught her how to torture and abuse me. It lasted eight more years until I built up enough courage to escape. I failed once a month ago and she starved me. I was cut and burned yesterday after finally being let out. I fond an opening and bolted out the open door. I ran and ran, but I did not know where I was going so I walked for a good ten minutes until I saw your car. I knew you would help since you had a Fire department sticker and a search and rescue sticker. That's when you saw me as I called for help.\" You looked at him and all you could do is hug him for a solid minute as he began to cry in your arms. You laid him back down and brought some light foods for him to eat. You looked at him and whispered \"how about you have some trust and stay with us and I can call you my brother?\" He dropped the piece of bread from his muzzle and looked at me and said \"really you would do that for me a random anthro that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know?\" you look at him and tell him \"yep all you have to do is tell me the name of the person who did this. You can sleep in my room for the time being too.\" He looked up at you and teared up and said \"thank you this means a lot to me, and by the way the name of the person who did this to me was Carla, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know her last name\" You cringed at the name, for she was in one of your classes and you knew she was a witch but not this bad! You looked at him and responded \"Her name is Carla Johnson her family is filthy rich and she is known to be a witch but I never thought she would stoop this low?!\" you looked at him and hugged him again and whispered into his ear \"I will never let anything happen to you again that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my promise!\" He looked at you and hugged you. The two of you were interrupted by a knock on the door it was....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You forgot the goddamned dinner set at the store. You'd already paid for the one box and were rushing everything else down the conveyer belt, but you were already out the door of your local <i>Fred's</i> in order to beat the rain before you could remember why your shopping cart felt peculiarly empty - which, as it turns out, was an unnecessary decision, seeing as your windshield was only peppered with water here and there. And now you were out sixty dollars worth of crockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You let out a pained groan of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pulling into the attached carport of your home, you slam the driver side door shut and you tighten your lips, your face screwing up a little as you stare out onto the driveway, watching as the rain starts to come down just as you'd anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess I'm lucky it waited for me,\" you grumble sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You open the door to your home, carrying four plastic bags in one hand. You rush to the kitchen counter and set them down before either you or the plastic breaks under the weight of your groceries, and you take a brief moment to catch your breath before returning out to the car. Peering your head in, you fail to spy any more groceries and figure you'll go back to get the box either after everything's put away, or the weather starts to clear up a little. You're not about to add a car accident to the list of shit today; you imagine that if not for those reasons, you should wait until you at least calm down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wishing that were the only thing you had to keep you home, you begin unbagging the colder items and placing them in the appropriate spots in your refrigerator and freezer, and you move on to a few cans and other things while organizing those into your pantry cabinet. With a huff, you shut it and stream past the counter edge, scooping up the plastic bags as you make a beeline to the trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That's when you see it. A strange blur while you're moving down to put the bags in the garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You knit your brows as you glance up, still in the position of throwing them away, and stare out the window next to the breakfast table.

You can't even hear yourself clear your throat anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer out from the open door, now a bit closer and not having any wet glass to block the scene from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe click that occurs in your brain is palpable as you realize the shape is humanoid in nature. You stop being able to hear the rain for a moment, the watery world plunged into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's someone laying there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You try to shout over the weather around you, but it feels like the water is absorbing half of what you say.

You would never pin something like that on somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You bite your lip and run your hand through your already damp hair. You've got to get them someplace warmer, if at least to see if they're alive and not just neglect a body on your suburban property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Turning around and dashing back through the laundry area, carport, and back into the house in a few brisk strides, you go right through the kitchen and into the hallway, opening up the linen closet and pulling out the biggest, thickest comforter blanket you own. You unfold it about halfway, and you carry it right back through the kitchen and jog to the back door you left open. Holding a large blanket in your arms and bracing yourself unsteadily, you try and plan out exactly how you're going to manage to run to the shed without slipping, wrap up a limp body, and rush it back inside without getting too wet or hurting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh. You can't really eliminate those risks, but you can't risk someone else who may be alive to catch hypothermia - not in good conscience, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next minute is a blur as all you can remember is rushing over through the rain and immediately having to stop to wipe your eyes. You continue, seemingly already panting in triumph as you succeed in not slipping on the last concrete step, and you drop the blanket on the stranger before you're even quite standing over them. You huff and tighten your lips as you do your best to swaddle them in (mostly) pretty dry bedding, before you slip your arms under them and exert yourself the most you have today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grunt as you pick them up bridal style, wishing you had taught yourself how to do a fireman carry long ago. You wince as you nearly slip and bust your head on the ground while steadying yourself down the slick steps, before sighing in relief and jogging a little more quickly as you make it onto the wet grass. From there, you rush under the cover of your home, guarding the two of you from most of the rain in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You kick the back door shut and do likewise with the one in the carport, and you turn 90 degrees to continue your way through the door into the house. You walk quickly through part of the kitchen before walking through the very wide archway into the oversized living area, and you groan as you lean down to lay your rescued guest horizontally onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shit,\" you exclaim as you realize that you've not closed the kitchen door once for each of the times you've rushed in and out of it. You sigh and shut it, the house now quiet. You wipe your forehead, glancing around as the sounds of mother nature seem to have been sealed outside of windows and walls once again. Glancing at one of the windows, you nearly smile when you see that the rain seems to be coming down even more strongly. Today may have been stressful, but you're fairly certain that unless a natural disaster strikes, it's probably uphill from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>'Gnn.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn around at the sound of a soft groan, and you look just in time to see the bundle of blankets shift a little. Your brain lights up with a noticeable delight as definite signs of life seem to be coming from the figure. You breathe a silent sigh of relief, inwardly thanking whatever higher power may have ensured his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A sudden thought reminds you that his health probably isn't in mint condition if the only dry, safe place he could find to stay was the outside of someone's backyard shed.

I'm not an asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He looks at you for a long while. You move your hand up to his shoulder and pat it reassuringly, smiling likewise. \"Please. I'll go fix you something to eat. You think on it for me, 'kay?\" You get up from the couch, making your way around the coffee table and heading in the direction of the kitchen area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The house is pretty rectangular, so subsequently the living and kitchen areas are, too.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were invited to a male stripper club by a new friend of yours, Derek. As far as you can tell; he's obnoxious, goofy, wants people to suffer, and doesn't care for anything but himself. Thus the only reason you are letting him take you too this place that doesn't fit your wants is because he has a very sly tongue. You may have made the unfortunate mistake of kissing it when he got you drunk one night. You know he sees you as a follower, just someone to call on when he wanted you. Which is why you had the full intention of telling him you don't want to see him anymore and that you were much better off dead than being with him. You weren't going to be treated like a fool by someone not worth your time and it was about time you let him know that. You planned it on the car ride, you'd tell him during the party so it would be ruined. Making an example of him in front of the other useless and drunk idiots he's going to fondle tonight while your stuck at a table alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the car stopped you were in an alleyway in front of a large neon sign in pink and blue. It read 'CrystaL Spike', which amused Derek and his friends. The letters designed a cat anthro holding and licking a blue spike which was actually the letter 'L' in the name. You hid your disgust and before you knew it you were inside sitting in a chair watching them get drunk. While you stared up at a cheetah on the pole and runway. Everyone knew this was more than a dance club, it was a male whore house. The owner was known to kidnap anthro children and force them to work here. But the police could never get evidence. You were beyond sorry for anthros being exploited like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing you did have to give them props for though, the place was high class. Blue velvet interior with a curved bar near the front doors, two glass sheets on either side of the runway. And a large embedded seating area in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, drink something! Your glass is empty! Hey, another beer!\" Derek broke your silence with his usual loud mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't want to drink, remember I need to drive you all home tonight,\" you were the only designated driver. Not like any of them could drive well plastered or sober.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fu...that's right, guess I'll just drink it then,\" he took your newly filled glass and washed it down. \"Hey I got a little surprise for ya.\" The others started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little night special, we know you'll like it,\" one of them burst out banging on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, shoot man you know what we're talking about. I saw you looking at those pictures of those little furry bastards on your computer. You like em young don'tcha!\" They were all laughing except you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ready to leave, your plan was falling apart because you didn't want to spend another second in this place with them or any of the other pieces of shit you were around. You weren't looking at porn of young anthros. It was pictures of children being taken captive while their parents were beaten and held back. Although anthros were a legitimate part of society they had only appeared within the last twenty or thirty years. The high demand for them made them get tracked down by fanatics who took it to an extreme. You were watching what you wanted to stop, oppression of furred and scaled people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get so quiet man he'll be here soon! Hey waiter, we ordered this guy a special now where the fuck is his furry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we're having a shortage since it's a busy day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that! Get our friend some service or we're going to your boss! How ya like that Bitch!!\" If it weren't so embarrassing you'd have already left, but you were glued to your seat by the stupidity and discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were finally able to form a sentence you almost gave them a piece of your mind they wouldn't soon forget. But, just before you could the waiter brought in a tied and bound figure. He was thin and small with white fur and shoulder length white hair. His ears were pointed back and a thin white tail with a single black ring in its fur. They had dressed him in a bondage outfit of a few black leather straps connected to a silver ring on his back. He had a red ball mouth gag and a white cloth blindfold. His hands were tied back as he was led to your table, wobbling by the motions of the waiter who jerked him like a toy. Which you knew was exactly what they thought of him and every other furry in the place, 'Toys'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too stunned to move as the cat was placed in front of you and forced to kneel down in front of your chair. He had bruises, burns, and cuts under some parts of the leather that were barely hidden. When he kneeled in front of you the waiter untied the rope and took off the blindfold. He had huge beautiful blue eyes that shimmered like the ocean, and seemed like they could cry enough to fill it. There was a large bruise over one of them and the other had just finished releasing tears before he was brought in. He cringed and trembled as he forced a smile behind the gag which was removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is this! We talked over the phone that there was one ready for him, and don't tell me this is him! This is Shit!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir, the one you ordered yesterday was diagnosed with an STD last night from one of our customers and had to be removed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this was the best you got!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard this a hatred welled deep inside you. And a fear of just how much blood you were ready to spread on the floor when you were done. You are an expert in three martial arts and had a calm demeanor, but this was the one piece of life that sickened you to the point of rage. Forced prostitution. And as you clenched your fists and closed your eyes in your seat you were about to stand up until you heard a voice from between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-twen-ty p-per hour,\" he began feeling up your leg with his small trembling hands, \"n-no re-f-funds unless mer-me-merchan-dise is unsat-satisfactory.\" He began to unbutton and unzip your pants and reaching inside. This was his first time...this was one of the newest children taken from their home and he had just been finished being beaten until he did what he was told. He caressed you and was about to put his face in your pants. He didn't even know what he was doing, he wasn't told that he was already paid for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter and Derek had just finished arguing, \"I'm terribly sorry sir. I will have half of the payment sent back to you by your account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, you had better...hey I think he likes you...where the fuck you going!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving,\" you said as you got up and were about to turn and leave. But as you did you felt something tug on your leg, it was him. He was crying and kept trying to reach up to your pants zipper. You couldn't look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't get so worked up it's his first time give him a chance. I bet he's still a virgin too man! That would be sweet! AAAAGH!!!\" You elbowed Derek in the neck sending him flying across the room and slamming into the table across from you. After seeing him twitch on the floor you turned to look at the boy who was still on the ground petrified, staring at Derek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore someone could charge you and take you out you picked him up and ran to the bathroom taking a chair with you and blocking the door with it. The cat boy was still in your arms as bouncers banged on the door. The windows at the back of the bathroom weren't blocked by bars, you took the advantage and left through the window and closed it to make them think you were still in one of the stalls. You knew the reason you took him, but weren't sure of what to do. You just ran thinking sensibly 'Where's the best place to go?'</span></div></div>",

You only told him your cell which was a pay by card phone given to you by your aunt. This was what led you to realizing that your home was the best option to go to. What you would do there with this boy was up to him and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the best course of action in the alleyway, they'd obviously take the alley  roads. The main road was the easiest to follow. They were more at risk if police saw them and you pass. You came out the parking end onto the sidewalk, the boy hadn't squirmed or struggled. He seemed both scared and overjoyed. But the strain of keeping consciousness after his obvious and recent beatings was unbearable for him and he blacked out in your arms as you fled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main road was mostly clear. You were talked to once by an older man passing by. You simply told him in as happy a voice you could, \"haha, he had one too many!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had the audacity to say back to you, \"are you sure you didn't have some yourself?\" before walking around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to your apartment\u2019s lower door to ring the buzzer for your house and speak through the voice box. You'd managed to teach your dog how to press the electric lock after acknowledging your voice. You knew it was a bit odd of all the preparation you've done throughout your life. Never trusting of anyone truly with all the hate and pain in the world. Eventually it led you to a cold and hard demeanor; well aware that you hated people who caused that pain but knowing that you can't just ignore people. At one point you wanted to rid the world of that evil by becoming an officer of the law. But corruption prevented you from doing so. There was the good and the bad, and you wouldn't let the boy in your arms be tainted by the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked inside your dog, Marle, greeted you with his silent stare. Being a shiba he barely barked when he was little. Now he didn\u2019t bark at all unless there was danger. \u201cGood boy Marle,\u201d you said down to him as you nudged your door closed. He stared up to the small boy in your arms. \u201cListen, we have a \u2018guest\u2019 and he\u2019s \u2018injured\u2019.\u201d The two words you spoke out with more meaning then the rest alerted Marle to the situation. He briskly walked into the kitchen at the back of your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay the boy down onto your couch and placed the blanket at it\u2019s edge under him as you tilted him up to do so. Marle brought back a case for first aid. \u201cSorry about this,\u201d you quietly said before taking off his clothes, what little there were. You left his underwear, a thin black thong to be exact, on. His humility and needs came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully examined him. His latest beating must have been tremendously brutal. His right arm was bent nearly out of its socket and his right leg was sprained. The were bruises everywhere. But the worst thing you found of all was on the right side of the lower part of his back. Etched in burned white fur was the letter \u2018H\u2019. \u201c\u2026Harrison\u2026\u201d you cursed out the bastards name like a demon\u2019s summoning rite. Harrison is the owner of \u2018Crystal Spike\u2019 as well as several of its branches. Never found at any of them as he\u2019s usually out poaching and kidnapping in third world countries where the law can\u2019t fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when it occurred to you, that burned in brand\u2026 This boy was not just one of the new anthros that was kidnapped. He was the newest one for Harrison himself\u2026 This boy was to be Harrison\u2019s personal toy when he returned from his next venture into finding his prostitutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clenched the bandages you had clean the boy with and grit your teeth and a dark frown that developed into a grim smile. \u201cSo\u2026I went and caught the young toy of Mr. Harrison himself\u2026hah\u2026hahaha.\u201d You bent back smiling. \u201cOkay then Mr. Harrison, I know you and your men will want this one back. He\u2019s the greatest proof in the world against you. But I\u2019ll prove that he and all the others you\u2019ve made a bricked Hell for\u2026are more than you can dream of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back down to him and saw his face. His sleeping face, as innocent as a new blossom in a cold Winter. You would not let that face wilt in the coming snow. And as you watched him his face trembled and his eyes slowly opened. Those big blue eyes\u2026they held his gaze directly into your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth and struggled to speak\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cold was blistering and night had not yet come. Your pain only made it freeze more; to the bone, to your heart. The blood stopped a while ago. The long and battered cloth that wrapped around your skin feeling rough as old leather was your only source of warmth. \"They...did not wield anima...not anthros...\" 'Why' was the word ringing in your head the most as you trudged on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came before dawn as night was ending. You awoke to the sun rise earlier then expected. But when your eyes fixed you saw the that the stars were still out and a black smog rose to them. Dawn was not coming, a fire had broken out. And what made you rise suddenly was the cries of people outside. Their wails made you jump from your bed quickly grabbing your spear at the ready for whatever enemy was the cause. They were men, clearly, not a word of power was spoken to summon Animus. The witchcraft of the furred and scaled people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to fend off what few you could and protect as was your duty as one of your town's guard. Your people stood on the border of the icy plains of the North where a large settlement of Snow Anthros stood. Humans and Anthros had come to a mutual truce. Human's kept their technology, building and breaking down then building again. While Anthros kept with the old ways of the Earth and Anima, their power drawn from it. Even helping each other on some rare occasions when tensions were nonexistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the morning of this day was no battle against them, those were men. That was made clear. They wore dark robes and commanded terrible machinery, killing many as you tried to save them. In the end you were given a message to be sent by the daughter of the head guardsman. He had died honorably, she said. \"Please, take this and go North to Arya. It's a warning of what happened here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what led you to this place. Not a cloud hung above when you left in the coming Winter's air. Now a blizzard wrapped around you like a coffin ready to encase your frozen body. You'd suffered training that helped in this tiring journey. Arya was a three days walk from your town. A gust of wind nearly blew you with it but you still kept on. Most people did not care from anthros and their supposed 'Black Magic'. But you thought of it as a blessing. Thus making you the laughing stock of the guardsman who had to watch for intruders without passes. And also leading to you being the one who usually kept watch over messengers from their lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky's heart must have been pierced and frozen solid. The blizzard seemed to worsen almost freezing you legs in place. You thought keeping near the cliff side would help to shield you, but it was almost on intention that the wind shifted and blew towards you. You tripped on something and collapsed in the cold snow. Why you couldn't move was hard to tell. Your body just did not seem to lift while your mind was clear and ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally built up the strength and pushed up off the ground making sure the note was still in your possession, you marched forward. Hours seemed to pass and the way was darkened in the storm. You kept one folded hand to your right to follow the cliff path. And as you walked you could only see the white and it's sudden shift to black. But there was something unnatural. A shape in the white that inched ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt swayed in the wind and clambered to the rock side on occasion. It also became more distinguishable to your eyes as it came close. You could also hear faint chimes with them. It was alive, that was for certain. A white figure that danced frailly at the tilt and sway of the gusts. When you reached it you could clearly see before you a being beyond your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an anthro dressed in pale white robes that swayed from anklets, bracelets, its necklace, and even earrings. Making rivers in the air that danced around its body that chimed with bells attached to their ends. It was clearly male as he wore no upper body clothing besides a sheer cloth around his neck, pierced in several spots. By his stance and fur color as well as the shape of his body, he was a fox. And a beautiful one to behold, no commoner even of the anthros wore outfits as extravagant. He had long white hair that howled with the wind. His tail as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something wrong besides the reasoning you could not fathom of him being out here in this glacial storm. He was wounded severely in many places, the blood dripped out in some making his white cloth red.  But worst of all was when he took notice of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to you and his eyes which seemed to hold a distant wish suddenly went into a cold glare. His maw clenched and his pose, although frail, became bent and hardened. He was going to attack. You had no means of defense besides your hunting knife. Your spear was broken during battle. Instead of grabbing any sort of weapon on his person though, he twisted his arms and hands into a sphere. The sphere emanating glints of light that seemed to absorb small fragments of the snow as he spoke words you couldn't understand. 'Animus, he's using magic.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he summoned the power and you held your knife back by the ready, you saw his eyes go wide. And the snow dispersed onto the ground along with a splatter of red. He collapsed on one hand as the other held his throat. You heard him speak softly, \"no...not like this...not to them...\" before he completely dropped into the snow. His cloth waving no more. His body spread out over the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't care if he was your opponent for the short time he was conscious, nor that he was an anthro. As a human, you could not allow him to die. The red reaching over his face, you pulled him up onto your arm as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the crags of the rock you were able to find a crevice leading into a small hole going down. The was no way to make the journey all the way to Arya with him on your back. Especially in this condition. So you helped him within. And with a small set of wood and tinderbox you had a fire. Dealing with his wounds quickly as you trained as a medic for some time, you were able to heal him. The wounds themselves were not severe. But you could imagine the strain of trying to defend yourself with power like what he weilded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do now was wait as he recovered, and for the tears of man to stop falling outside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blizzard outside the cave had gone silent with the deepening snow covering the small mouth of the cave. You were thankful the inside was spacious enough for you to stand at full height. The smell of animals came from the soil beneath you, many animals must have used this cave only to leave due to the small opening that would have trapped larger ones. Using the fire to as light you observed your map carefully. Making sure to keep your eye on the fox on the other side.  You had massed the first of two mountains along the path near the cliffs, that at least you could see through the blizzard. There was one other to cross and you were probably under it now. Only a short way to Arya, a day and a half's walk most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished reading it you began to make food. The anthro looked famished as well as exhausted. You were worried of what he may intend when he wakes, but an instinct also told you there was little to fear. He was no fighter, at least not by regular means. Anima was probably his only way of defense and you had seen what came to be if he tried it's use. All you brought were a few carrots that thankfully would not rot soon from the cold, bread, potatoes and meat to boil or roast. You were not sure what to make for him. You've known some anthro clans and tribes that don't eat meat considering it their brethren. You were not sure of the Aryans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hoped that he did eat meat as you decided to make a small stew. If he did have a problem then bread may have sufficed along with some of the carrots. You began cutting the carrots with your hunting knife, looking up to the anthro who turned and whined in his sleep. Even with your work and bandages, heavy and fast motions would open the wounds back. But he never moved for too long and the turns would shift back into place slowly. You had just noticed your muscles tensing when he moved, you sighed relaxing as you got back to cutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the stew was almost done and tasted somewhat well. That's when you noticed him shifting behind the fire. His moans grew louder, even distorting into words. They sound like human speech. And the mumbling was growing louder, \"elder...I ca...no...bu...Mother...El...eld...Elder!!!\" He jut upward his eyes epening wide then suddenly wincing in pain as his teeth grit and he faced down holding his bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop moving,\" you spoke abruptly while moving around the fire to him. His sight shot up at you, the look of a frightened beast caught in a trap. You spoke as calmly as you could, \"listen. I'm not here to hurt you or what you may have thought when we met earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah...who...who are you?\" his voice, although filled with pain, was calm and young. If you had to guess, he was around seventeen years of age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a watchman from the southern checkpoint. The city was attacked this morning by human assailants, I was coming to Arya as a messenger of what happened. On the way we met, you attempted to attack me but fell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know...*gasp*...you're not lying human...gahhh..!\" he gave an anguished stare into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your satchel and pulled out the letter, \"This was given to me by the head of the guardsman's daughter before after he died to write it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see it...\" his breaths and gasps had calmed somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought anthros could not read human writing except for those related to their leaders that were taught?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, I'm the village elder's nephew,\" he held out his hand that trembled. You didn't find it hard to believe after a moment of thought, his outfit and jewelry gave it away that he was not just a normal anthro. Only those of the water tribes wore as extravagant outfits for the villagers as you've heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the wrapping and handed him the folded paper. It was covered in blood spots and the writing was hurriedly made. Before he read the man sniffed at the parchment, then he  gave a pained look, \"no...captain Gerek...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew the captain? I knew he had gone to Arya often as was his duty but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...he...visited often...\" he was trembling more and tears were starting to form in his eyes, \"if...if it weren't for him I'd...I'd hate humans...\" He wiped his eyes and sniffed a little before preceding to read. You were surprised to see a soft spot after the instance earlier. He had a gentle and just soul, but you did not speak outwardly of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he read his eyes narrowed and his mouth trembled in anger, \"black cloaks...shiastu belik...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've seen the black cloaked men before?!\" you lowered yourself near him in sudden concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those Shiastu are the ones who attacked my people! Gah!\" he gasped in pain from straining himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held his back, \"please, calm down. Tell me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahhh...they came before the sun rose...our homes were engulfed in flames when we left the elder's house. Our best ani were trying to push them back with our Anima. But they used machines...covered in metal...our power of water and ice was no match being that our ani were so few. In the end my mother told me to go South to see Gerek and ask your people for help...forgive em for attacking you. I thought you were one of those Shiastu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I can understand that with the limited sight at the time you had and my wearing the cloak I would have looked like them. What happened to you that got you injured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While leaving, my mother and I were attacked. She is our priestess of the Animus of Arya...\" he carefully reached around his head piece and took off one of the ornaments. It was a shimmering blue jewel. The largest of the ones on his head piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stone is an Animus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the power of our ancestors lies within these stones. Only people of ani pure blood can learn power from it. Anthros, as humans call us are divided between the pure blood and those without. We pure as you know are called the ani. All of us can learn power from Animus, but ani can learn true power from them. My mother was in charge of keeping the Aryan Animus safe. But when we separated she gave it to me, knowing that if it was the Animus they came for then...they would go after her...\" he placed it back into his hair piece. The shimmer had caught your eye and you watched until concern took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what happened to your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...she fled North...to tell our clan leaders of what has befallen our tribe...I know she is safe, no one can defeat her with weapons...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand on his shoulder, \"I know she is fine. Your mother did not obtain priestess rank from doing nothing but being of pure blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at your hand and touched it, holding it, \"thank you for your kind words...human...wait, I never told you my name did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I guess you didn't, haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanura Arya. But please don't call me my full name. It's embarrassing, so call me Vanu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held out your hand with a smile, \"it's nice to meet you Vanu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of shaking it though, he pulled you into an embrace. \"Haha, I know your customs are to shake the hands of compatriots. But here we call you friends when your welcome into our lands, Vearn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaern?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means 'friend' in our language...\" his stomach churned and gurgled as he fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh here, I made soup. It has meat in it though, so sorry if you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's fine. We eat meat as long as it's not ours hahaha!\" he laughed heartily through a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good thing I don't hunt foxes,\" you both gave each other a solemn look before bursting out into laughter. He ate a little respectfully but seemed to know there was no need to be too courteous. He had a good helping and as you ate he said, \"by the way thank you for saving me Vaern. I could not heal the wounds in the condition I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. I couldn't just leave you out there to die, whether or not you were my enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good human Vaern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking a liking to calling that huh? As for the good human part I only do as Gerek taught us. And my own beliefs as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question is now, what should we do.  Those men in black cloaks may still be there, And from your letter, may even be at your home as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good question and you both needed a descent solution.</span></div></div>",

You kept one eye on him as he moved about, hunched over as you did your best to keep warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard him shift around, his eyes slowly opening and turning towards the fire. He made a soft sound as he looked towards the fire, and for a moment, he seemed reasonably relaxed. He turned slightly, but his eyes widened as he suddenly saw you.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was humid out but not hot. The town you just left from couldn't give you as much supplies as needed. They didn't think it was necessary because they thought the animals out here could take care of themselves. You told them you were only doing your job, poacher busting in the heart of Africa's Eastern jungles. Disarming traps and arresting hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since anthros began appearing poaching has reached the highest point in history. You heard about a colony of snakes, living in the jungle near the town you just left. They thought they didn't need help, but you wanted to do your job. So you left in your jeep after filling up on gas and getting some food in case you were out for a long time. And bullets for your rifle and handgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drove off the road to the front of the forest, parking your car among some brush after you entered. Making sure you had everything ready you got out the car and rearranged the bushes to hide your jeep. The forest was quiet and you could smell iron. Thankfully you got there early enough to find the smell, rain clouds were overhead and they would have blotted out the smell. You had to hurry before the scent left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed some oddly placed tracks. Whoever came through here didn't know what they were doing. They tried to step on roots to keep themselves hidden, but that wasn't possible here since the roots were loose. They'd just sink and leave more obvious marks in the ground. 'Amateurs' you thought. You had a path set out for you already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went through you noticed another, fresher trail. It wasn't from a human. There was a gaping trench leading behind some large plants with a gasping odor. You looked behind the brush while covering your nose. Something picked some leaves from the bush, very recently too. You saw the trail leading up to the bush that left the trench in the grass. It curved around then suddenly flipped, startled by something. You had to move faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came to a river where both tracks intersected. The trench following the prints, it was following the poacher as well. As you walked through the river, making sure you had no leeches on you, you heard a snapping sound in the distance and saw birds rush out of the trees. You ran with the tracks, but stayed a tree away in case there was something waiting for you. As you ran you came to a small clearing where you saw something move. You hid behind a tree as soon as you saw this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye you could see something hanging from a tree, caught in a net. You looked closer and saw what was inside. A snake anthro, just as you heard, Nagas if you remembered the name right. It was male with brown skin, and black patches over its greenish yellow eyes. He looked young, maybe younger than you, but taller. He had a grey underside and light patches of beige on his face and across his back. His hair looked like brown dreads, but they were made of scales and looked more like snakes coming off the top of his head; two were white. He had a beaded necklace, beads woven into his hair, and cloth armbands. He was holding a bag with leaves falling out of it, he must have been the one harvesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched him breath heavily and staring intently at something. You slid a little past the tree and saw a man looking up to the net and walking with a blade held out. You made sure to step only on the roots and move slowly behind the trees. The man was talking to the naga as he walked, you weren't really listening. The naga only watched him angrily and wasn't responding. \"Tracking down one of you was hard enough. Trapping you was even harder. The one I was after escaped, but you decided to get follow me.\" You pulled out your handgun and knife, shooting him in the legs would probably put him down fast. Thankfully he wasn't that far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was almost up to the net while you got up to the nearest tree behind him. \"You know what me and my friends are going to do to you? Fuck, I don't know either. We might kill you and use your scaly ass to get a nice profit. Or maybe we could find some nice old rich man to give you to. Some old fucker that you'll probably get lucky enough to be his number one bitch. What do you think of that!?\" You signaled the naga by shining your knife to the light. He blinked and looked to you for a moment before looking down to the hunter and slowly put on a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck you smiling at!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga finally spoke in a soft young hissing voice, it almost sound like two voices overlapping each other, \"...you know what I think...\" You undid your safety and aimed behind his leg, \"...I think you're funny...\" Before the hunter could talk back he was already on the ground screaming in pain. You walked up to them while holstering your gun back in your bag. \"Killing him would be easssier...\" the naga looked down at him with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not my job. I just catch them...well maybe rough them up a bit before hand,\" you had to admit after what you just did, \"I guess you have every right to feel that way though.\" You walked up to the naga and pulled out your knife to cut him out. He fell with a small flop and untangled himself. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kulaya, I'm a soon to be shaman from my village,\" he stood up to his full height. His supported body was about 8 ft. high while the rest of his tail was about half as less of twice, making him around 20 ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tying the man with some rope Kulaya bowed to you but winced in pain. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not conssern yourself human. It'sss from the metal the man usssed to hang me,\" he was holding onto his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can treat myssself in my village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I can deal with this right now with the stuff in my bag.\" You took his hand off his waist, there was a large gash that reached around to his back. You could already see dirt in the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I already owe a debt to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be still, I can't work if your moving,\" he stopped complaining and relaxed as you worked on his wound. \"There, keep that bandage on you and you won't get a scar. It's going to hurt for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thank you...sssir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, no more calling me human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dessserve ressspect. Pardon my talking earlier. I wasss angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's understandable,\" you stood up and took a look into his face as he looked down to the ground. Then he looked up to you. He had a sweet look to his face, just like a young boys who is just coming to maturity. He just held his waist and looked like he had a few things he wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed his bag still on the ground since he fell and it slid off. As you picked it up you heard someone yell in a similar voice to Kulaya and it obviously wasn't the hunter who you both ignored the screams from behind the gag you put on him. \"Kulaya, get away from that human!\" a large naga holding a spear yelled from the trees, two guards were following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssori it'sss alright this man ssaved me! The true evil is thisss man on the ground,\" he pointed to the hunter who was now staring nervously at the nagas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him, he can't run anymore anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him away, have shaman Taiya paralyzzze him then throw him out of the foressst. We will not have any taint on our handsss from human huntersss,\" one of the nagas dragged him off. \"Now who is thisss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thisss iss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name isn't important. I capture poachers and take care of their traps in forests to keep the animals safe from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, a protector of the treesss. Pleassse come back to the village. I'm sssure our chief will wissh to ssspeak with you. And please exxxcuse my rudenessss. We have been wary of humansss asss of late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed them through the forests. You didn't have much else to do besides collecting your money then moving onto the next job so you may as well stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir home was beautiful. It was made from tree houses and huts set on either side of a river that ran from a low waterfall. Their chief's house was at the top of the hill the river ran down. Many nagas slithered around talking and occasionally looking at you with friendly eyes. You were surprised to see so many in such a happy place. Some kids even wanted to get a closer look at you and their parents asked if they could. You let them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSori led you into the chief's home which was a beautifully accented room covered in paintings and woven artwork. At the back in front of a large stone slab was a long and large male naga with hair draping over a mask, his tail was so long that it reached around the room. He was a king cobra at that with many embroideries and beads. You sat with Sori and Kulaya as the cobra spoke. \"You were the one who sssaved my nephew?\" the naga spoke with a deep and foreboding, yet welcoming voice. \"You have my gratitude beyond wordsss. I've also heard you deal with othersss sssuch as the hunter you defeated earlier. I am obligated to you, but I must asssk sssomething of you. Will you hear my requesst?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need sssomeone like you. A kind man who knowss what to do about intrudersss. We are a gentle people, one with the earth and sssoil. I asssk that you may ssstay with usss and help protect our people. We know that you make a living in keeping huntersss and their weapons at bay ssso wwe assk that you would do ssso here. Of course we will give you a home and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to say anymore. You had me at 'keeping hunters' at bay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it'sss sssettled you may ssstay with Kulaya.\" Kulaya looked embarrassed, but oddly satisfied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was cold in the city. The people, the stone, your family, hell, even the rain was cold. What was the coldest, you silently mused, was the feeling between the races. The war that was going to blow up between the races was all anyone would talk about.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n\"Listen to me,\" your sister told you sternly as you sat down and looked at the paper warily, \"those Anthros are dangerous. Why do you keep thinking that you can live with...those monsters?\" slamming her hands on the table, startling you. \"They kill for enjoyment! They kill for pleasure! They kill because that's the only thing they know! Now get out of your fantasy and live in reality.\" your sister straightened herself, \"You have school to be going to. If mom and dad found out about your dumb fantasy,\" she put emphasis on fantasy, trying to rub it in more, \"not only will you be grounded for the rest of your life, but you won't ever have the medical degree you've been trying to obtain.\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\nYou didn't care. There was something about them, something you felt every time you saw a picture of them. Awe? No, that wasn't right. If you were in awe, you wouldn't be in the medical field trying to study as much as you can about Humans, but any kind of Anthro you could get your hands on. The latter was hard to do, with the banning of books on the subject. No one thought that Anthros were safe to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always on the media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latest victim mauled by a Tiger Anthro, whereabouts unknown\"<br>\r\n\"Child snatched by Hawk Anthro during vacation at beach.\"<br>\r\n\"Snake Anthro slowly suffocated and raped corpse of woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what, it was everywhere. It's all going to explode after a while. Everyone wants a fight, but no one has lit the spark, not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you don't believe that the Anthros were all bad. There are always the bad people in the world, the villains that give everyone a bad name. It happened with people, it could happen with Anthros too. Did it matter to anyone though? No, of course not. They wouldn't give anything new a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you walked along the river. The rain quietly hummed as it struck against the sidewalk, and sang as it touched the actual water. You adjusted your parasol as the rain slowly began to increase. School was going to start in a half hour; 7:45. Every day you went to the fancy medical school that your scholarship payed for, and every day, you felt farther and farther away from everything. Mom thought you were demented when you brought up the subject of Anthros and wishing to meet one. Dad felt the same as Mom, but he scheduled a psychologist to help 'remedy' these 'unnatural thoughts' coursing through your head. Sis, she rips your head off daily because you don't share her hatred of Anthros. No sane person in the school wanted you there, prodigy or not, because you held something besides death in your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the sheltered bridge up ahead, where the bus picked you up and took you to School. Bitterly, you went under the cover of the bridge and lowered your parasol. Shaking off the excess water, you sat down, placed your messenger bag under the bench and looked over at the newspaper stand. In bold print, the headlines for today was, \"Anthro Retaliation Over Peace Talk?\"<br>\r\nYou hung your head over your hands in slight despair, remembering the article. Apparently, the government had recently tried to smooth over relations with the Anthros, but the whole scenario ended in disaster. A fight broke out with the Anthros, and the media devoured the contents just like a wolf devouring a steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't sit right with you. Every time something seemed to be calming down, another story came up and agitated everyone. It was just like the Cold War with the Soviets back then. It was always so close to a war, with both sides staring at each other's nukes, weapons, and each other. This was an exact repeat of the events that happened back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" a voice called out above the rain. You didn't need to look up to know who it was. It was Carson, Carson Jones. The resident bully who always enjoyed telling everyone he met that you cared about the Anthros. That you thought that there was good in some of them. \"Hey, what's wrong buddy?\" Carson mocks as he sits next to you. He was wearing his large sweatshirt and sweatpants you noticed out of the corner of your eye. \"Oh, did one of the 'peaceful' Anthros try to murder someone again?\" Carson elbowed you aggressively in the side of your arm. \"To bad huh? Those demons aren't capable of feeling anything but blood-lust, and don't you forget it.\" A light briefly illuminated your face before a car pulled in front of the two of you. \"My rides here, see you around traitor.\" Carson spat as he got up and swiftly kicked you in the stomach. Unfazed, Carson opened his car door and slid in, the car driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenderly, you rub your arm as you try to get your breakfast under control. Carson really knew how to kick a person, him being on the soccer team. It really hurt. You wouldn't hit back though, or say anything back. You didn't have the backbone to be doing it, and everyone on campus knew it. Only Carson felt that it was right for him to beat you up thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the reflection of the newspaper stand, the only person you saw was...a small weakling who couldn't stand up for anything. Your green eyes stared back at you, until it began to travel across your face and other features. Your long, curly hair rested underneath your chin, where your green zip-up covered your favorite green t-shirt of a snake. Snakes were the one thing about your life that really made you happy, any mention or sight of them, especially grass snakes made the cold city feel warm, just for a little bit. It wasn't something you felt often in this place. Your eyes moved down to your blue jeans and white tennis shoes that were currently not dirty. You never really went out into the country, or out of the city for that matter. As soon as school was over, you slithered away to your room, away from your parents and sister, and wrote in your diary. You wrote about a lot, anything to keep your mind off of the pain from a recent beating from Carson, to therapy with your doctor, to wanting to write something down just because you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" you hear yourself sigh softly. \"Are you thinking that something good would happen? Something to change your life? Get real. Mom, Dad, and Sis are right. I shouldn't...\" You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow everything negative came back. No! There's...there's still hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone...someone help me. I don't know what to do...\" You leaned your head back against the pillar supporting the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone...please...anyone...help...someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on...that's...that's not your voice. It's faint, but is it...</span></div></div>",

That building has been abandoned ever since the Mayor declared it, \"An offense to all professional builders and an example of how not to build a building.\" It was falling apart true, but not much of the building was actually damaged. You've hidden in that building on a few occasions to escape Carson and your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly, you try to tune out the rain to listen for the voice, whoever it is could be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H.....p....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice is still there. It can't be just your imagination. Should you really go in though? True, you <i>have</i> gone into the building, but it wasn't far. It was only-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a great smashing sound reverberated through the air, shaking the ground. Startled, you grab both your bag and parasol and hurriedly step away from the bridge, looking towards where the sound came from while opening the umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building! It...part of it caved in! That person...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're going in, whoever it is could be badly hurt or...dead. Besides, the bus won't be around for a while. Hesitantly, you walk to the large doors and push one open. It's pretty much the same, but part of the roof has collapsed, around the back it looks like. The voice isn't there though. Perhaps they were further back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you call out, voice quivering slightly, \"You ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one responded. Perhaps they didn't want to be discover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed liquid is seeping across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god. Whoever it is is hurt, really bad. Quickly, you rush inside and quickly scan the area. The building used to be a warehouse, but most of its empty shelves have stood there with empty boxes littered about. There's nothing important about that however, you need to find the person who's heavily injured, and quick. You scoot around the area quickly before coming across....coming...across...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying along the back wall was a relatively unharmed Anthro. Not just any Anthro either, this...this was a big Anthro a snake. A big, long snake. Heck, it had to be nearly fifteen feet long! You don't know much about the Snake variety, but it looks unbelievably scaly. It's also tied up. Heavily. As well as asleep. Where's the blood coming from then...? Then you spot it. A little way into the rubble was part of a leg sticking out, oozing blood which the rain claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Creeeeeaaaaak</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. You look up. The ceiling isn't looking so good. It's slowly turning downward. The roof won't hold for more than a minute...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...you have to make a decision, now.</span></div></div>",

A good friend, maybe even the best friend you ever had was coming back from five years on the front lines. Aiden has been your best friend since you were in pre-school. He was a tall husky who beat bullies in school and took the blame for others in trouble. He always fell behind in class, but never failed. Always climbing as close as he could get behind you. His father was an army man too; taking his duty believing it was protecting his family and friends. He grew up with the same idea as well, putting others before himself. But it was truly for you. Aiden did like the idea of fighting for his country, but in his heart it was for his family and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me. I'm not doing anything dangerous, just taking out the front men first while the others do the rest. You can go to college while I'm gone and with my money I'll get I can pay for a nice apartment and use the rest for a university. You said you wanted to be a doctor right? If something happens to me I know who to go to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden was supposed to be back a year ago. Right after high school he promised he'd be back in four years. He sent letters repeatedly, sometimes called, and took a vacation once a year to see his parents and you. Although it was mostly for you. Aiden did this for three years until all of a sudden the notes and calls stopped. His parents became worried and called often wondering if you knew anything. You knew he couldn't be dead, the government would send a message and his dog tag. Something else happened to him which made the three of you worry more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until a few days ago when you got a letter. It was a one lined message sent with no return address in a beaten and weather worn envelope. 'I'll be home...wait for me-Aiden' was what it read. You and his parents were more than happy to have gotten it. But, there was also dread you couldn't shake. The message was written on a smeared and ragged paper, the letters trailing off from water pouring on the pencil it was written with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why you sat in the middle of your living room with the TV turned off rocking back and forth in a chair watching the rain pour and thunder clap outside. You decided to take the semester off at your medical school and you were off Tuesday through Thursday and Sunday from the Hospital you worked at as an assistant.  It was Tuesday, even if it was a work day you would have taken it off for this occasion. A patients life wasn't at stake. But your friends might have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was little past eleven. You yawned and watched the platinum lightning, the news said it would rain every night until Wenesday. You felt your stomach growl. Aiden's mom sent you two plates of food for when he got back, along with some fresh honey glazed bread. You got up and had a slice. While chewing on it in the kitchen you heard something strange from your back door, something heavy splashing in the muddy grass then suddenly stoping. You thought it was nothing and turned to go back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you did you almost jumped as a sudden pounding on your back door that went soft until it ceased. You could hear heavy breathing. You were afraid and tried to pretend you weren't home backing away and trying not to be seen if whoever was banging at your back door looked in the window. But, as you moved back you heard a faint growling voice call your name. You recognized it and you raced to the door thrusting it open, \"Aiden! Ghh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in your door wasn't the friend you'd hoped to see. Instead there was a towering figure his hulking mass spread wider and taller than the frame and it breathed heat that still made steam in the warm summer night air. It was naked and had the look of a ravenous murderer. Its maw dripped saliva, bullet wounds and cuts around its body dripped blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trying to find something to defend yourself with as you backed away from it. You didn't know what you grabbed but as you were about to hit the monster with it he grabbed it and tossed it aside. You tried to run but it grabbed your arm. You yelled to let you go, which it did. This surprised you and when you looked back with a complex stare it reached into its under arm and pulled out something. It handed it to you and you hesitantly took it. You looked at what seemed to be a worn photograph. When you focused in you saw the only copy of a picture of you and Aiden hanging out at his parents after you both, a few days before he left. There was only one photo like this and to prove it on its back was yours and Aiden's name along with 'Good luck out there'. You heard the creature say your name and you slowly looked up to him. \"Aiden..?\" he nodded letting tears flow before collapsing with a large bang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd tried your best to move him into the living room and lay him on your couch. He was extremely heavy and gigantic to add. He must have been 11 ft. tall and weighed more than 300 lb. He was also incredibly muscular. Aiden was always a large person, but this was nothing like you've ever seen. You laid out a towel on your couch and carefully examined him, taking out bullets and splinters beneath his fur then patching the wounds. You would have never believed this was Aiden if not for two things. One was the picture which was now on your coffee table and the other was the way he said your name. He only said it that way when you two were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you treated him he gasped every once in the while as you apologized to him. When you got up to his shoulder you noticed that he was awake with his teeth slightly showing and his eyes sorrowfully watching you. You tried to give him a smile as you got back to work but when you did he pulled you into his clasp. He stared you in the eye gasping for breath and crying in your face. You yelled at him to calm him down. He stopped gasping and closed his eyes as he tried to hold you. You knew what was wrong with him now, you put your arms around him as he got slid up using the armrest for back support. He dug his muzzle into your chest. \"...mmh...welcome home, Aiden...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter treating him you helped him into your bathtub after running some hot water and using the shower to wash him off. He looked sad and shocked, but thankful. After that you gave him a warm blanket to cover himself and sat him down in your living room. The ceiling was a little more that 24 ft. high in the living room since it connected to the upstairs. The rest of the house had a 12 ft. high ceiling with 9 ft. high doors, the tub was a large diamond shaped one. Big enough to fit four people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a good look at him you recognized him, he was just very big and burly now. The main difference were his eyes. You knew they were blue but now they seemed to shimmer. Besides that all the same cuts and bruises from when you were kids were still there under his fur. He shivered and stared at his feet, slowly moving his toes. You knew one thing that always cheered him up even after a fight or talk with the principle. A spot he and his dad have just below their neck...you reached up and when he looked at you, you began scratching him under his chin. At first it seemed like no effect until he his eyes started flicking and his tongue licked out. You kept up for a few moments then immediately stopped and watched his delayed reaction. \"I see you still have the same tickle spot even under all that muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly stopped and looked embarrassed, \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been since your last letter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears fell back down, \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiden...what happened to you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" it seemed like he wasn't going to say anything until you stood up and began walking to the kitchen, \"t-the f-ff-ront was...not...dangerous...we d-dealt with them...f-fast...I was com-coming...back...early...a doctor w-w-ith our team asked...for some of us...t-to be part of a project...he wanted u-us to be a part of it...they took five of us in-including me...we were put in a facility and offered money to have research done to us...but, they lied...we were trapped and forced to have tests done to us...one of us was killed, Tommy, he was our top gunman. He tried to break out and they shot him in front of us...Yohan was taken away to be the first one to take the injections and the tests...we didn't see him, but we heard him in the rooms below, he sound like a beast...his voice shook our barracks and his pounding made cracks in the walls...they couldn't put him down so they locked him in the lowest part of the building. Jason was next, then me, then Rione,\" he was a little hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already sitting back down, \"What were they doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were trying to make controllable, evolving soldiers. They were lying about being part of the military. But they were able to get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what did they do to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cringed, \"they...gave me the third injection...a cell multiplying serum they said. It makes my cells reproduce slowly then quickly if I get energy from a source. Before they could put the chips in us that would control us, Yohan went berserk downstairs and we broke out.\" He as crying, \"t-th-they...they killed Tommy! And they said I would be next if I didn't keep Quiet!!\" His claws were digging into his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would anyone do things like that to people? You weren't sure what to do so you just let him sob in your arms as you thought. The police were useless, and although you had living proof in front of you the government might take advantage of it. Where was the safest place for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You shook your head as you tried to think. Aiden had already taken a huge risk trying to get back here, and you couldn't risk moving him any more with the condition he was in. He needed time to recover, and there was no way he could travel again the way he was. He still had several injuries, and it was a miracle that he even managed to get back in his condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly moved your hand, just letting it firmly hold his shoulder. He winced a little, but his gaze turned to yours, shaking a little bit as you tried to steady him. \"Aiden... For now... can you stay here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up suddenly, his eyes red as he tries to suppress his sobs. He stared at you silently for a moment, giving a small sniff as he tried to move a little closer. \"A-are you sure it's okay? You... You're scared of me, aren't you? I saw you... You were...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank as you heard his words. You shook your head before moving up to him, holding the sides of his arms and looking straight at him. \"Aiden, you surprised me. That's all. It doesn't matter what else might happen, but I would never, EVER be scared of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened for a moment before you suddenly found yourself in his arms. He had pulled you against him, almost effortlessly bringing your body into his arms. You winced a bit as he hugged you tight, his fur spread against you and his body holding tight. \"T-thank you... I was afraid... You'd think I was a monster...\" He was barely holding it together, and though it was almost painful for you, you couldn't bring yourself to tell him to let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Aiden... You'll never be a monster... I know you'd never try to hurt me...\" You struggled to move try and hug him, his grip holding you firmly in place and his body large enough to make it tough for you to get your arms around him. However, you managed it with a bit of effort, his eyes clearly tearing up a bit as his muzzle rubbed against the side of your head. \"You're just a bit bigger, that's all... It's not like that's new...\" You give a small, quiet chuckle as you pat his back. \"I mean, I was here when you tried pretty much every sport at school, and when you got back after physical training. You surprised me then, too... I mean, you grew a lot back then, too. This is like that, just a lot more, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his body slump slightly, his grip on you relaxing as he manages a weak laugh. An arm moved up to try to wipe his eyes as he let go of you. \"T-thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just do yours best to smile, a hand still perched lightly against him. \"Of course. Aiden... No matter what happens, I'll always be here for you.\" You smile, looking right at him. \"So... You can stay as long as you need to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled for a moment, but shook his head violently. \"No... I can't... You're in danger here, too. They're going to be after me, and I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should at least have a little while before people start looking for you.\" You saw him shift a little bit, worry still in his expression as he looked at you. \"I know... It's rough right now... But I promise, we'll get through this somehow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed silently as he looked at you. You were close enough to a nervous breakdown as well, but there was no way you could let Aiden see that right now. He had been through more than anybody should, and he would always do his best to hide his problems if there was a chance anybody would find out. It was only when you two were alone that he would even talk a little. It was rare that he would let it show that he was depressed, and to see him in that state drove you to the edge as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly to him as you let go. \"Come on... You need to sleep, and I think you'd better use my bed. You're not sleeping on the floor, and I don't think you'd fit on the couch anymore.\" You slowly move, trying to haul his arm over your back. You feel him slowly standing up, struggling a bit to keep his weight against your shoulders as you do. \"Don't push yourself, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm okay...\" He tried to take a breath as he followed. \"I... Can't rest yet... My parents-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call and let them know if there's a chance, but you can't go now. If people are after you, your house is going to be one of the first places that they'll look. For now, it's safer here. And... and if they come here... Well, we should at least have a couple of days. I'm staying right here with you.\" His eyes widen a bit as he looks at you, but you give him another firm pull. \"Besides, you aren't in any shape to run off on your own, and I doubt I can carry you through the rain without a whole lot of problems. You're not going to be discrete right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel him resisting a little, but you continue walking forward. You avoid looking at his face to try to keep yourself calm, but it doesn't take long before you're forced to turn. You feel his arm shifting off of you, Aiden trying to let his weight shift back onto your own feet. However, you only have to give him a quick glance before you realize...</span></div></div>",

You grunt as you hold him, shaking your head. \"Aiden. You need to rest. You're not in any condition to try something right now. When you're better, we can worry about letting your parents see you. But if they see you like this... You know, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd probably end up panicking...\" Aiden gave a small smile, no longer able to put up a fight as you drag him off. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to drop him gently into your bed, laying him carefully against his back. \"Try to get some rest, okay? Your parents will still be there in the morning.\" You smile as you gently pull your blanket over him, doing your best to wrap it around him as he shifted slightly. It took a few moments before he finally relaxed, and you made sure that he was tucked in tight. \"I'll let them know you got here in one piece...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely...\" He sighed as he laid down uncomfortably. He seemed willing to rest, but it certainly didn't seem comfortable for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll just be glad you're alive. We've been worried about you, Aiden. Just try to rest for now, okay? I'll get your parents on the phone, and you can talk to them for a little.\" He managed to give a weak nod as you quietly went to grab the house phone. While you were worried that you would be disturbing his parents, they seemed to have been awake and waiting for a message.  You didn't want to say too much to his parents, but you had managed to let them know he was at your place and safe. Although his parents wanted to see him, they were content with letting him rest over the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Aiden? Are you okay with talking right now?\" You brought the phone to his room, and he already seemed half asleep. The moment you entered, however, he shook himself awake, and tried to force himself up. You had to run over to try to get him to relax, and it took a minute before his voice was steady enough to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful when you're talking over the phone, okay? We don't know if it's completely safe.\" You handed him the phone, and he hesitantly nodded. You quietly walked out of the room, letting him speak privately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed quietly as you sat against the door frame. You were just hoping that the people who were after him weren't able to listen in. Things should at least be okay for the day, but you couldn't help but worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire thing was keeping you on edge. You were looking forward to a few relaxed days with your friend, and while you didn't have any plans, you were hoping the two of you could take a break from everything. Instead, things had suddenly taken a sudden turn. Aiden had just been through a whole ordeal, and from the sound of it, there was a chance he could go crazy at any moment. You weren't even sure his parents would completely recognize him when they saw him. You couldn't help but worry a bit as you heard him speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done with the phone.\" You walked back in, and Aiden's eyes were tearing up again as you got closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiden? I-is everything okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... I just... I was worried I wouldn't be able to speak to them again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... Things will be okay, Aiden.\" You swallowed as you helped him back down against the bed, your throat dry as you spoke. It was difficult to try to convince him of it when you hadn't fully convinced yourself. </span></div></div>",

You would have stayed to keep an eye on him as you both slept, but you decided to give him privacy. And if he needed you, you'd only be a short call away. You set yourself up a comfortable spot on the couch where you read. As you passed the closet outside your room before you cracked the door you also pulled out a hefty comforter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain outside was still a band or downpour. The rain were the pattering of drums, the thunder the chorus, and the lightning the grandeur but never the finale.  The rain was pouring down so hard onto your front window you were mesmerized by the abstract painting it made. The scene outside seemingly melting with the rain flowing down. \"I always wanted a waterfall on my property...\" you thought aloud to your self. Then a sudden whistling startled you, it was the kettle in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and walked into the kitchen thinking of what to drink with the boiling water. It was hard to focus with the rain and thoughts of Aiden. After standing in front of the kettle for what seemed to be minutes you finally decided on cocoa since there was no chocolate left in the house. As you poured a pack into a mug you wondered if you should make Aiden something, but you doubt he'd be able to drink anything right now. \"I'll just bring him bottle water if he wants something to drink.\" As you were about to pour the water in a sudden howling yell came from upstairs. You were not sure nore did you care if it was the yell or the thunder that shook your house. Or that you had dropped the kettle onto the kitchen floor in a steaming mess. You only found yourself running to your room, and pay witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not able to name what it is you saw, but the lightning had gone into a frenzy outside and shot your power cables making them flicker erratically. You're room was shaking from the constant thunder. But all this was ignored by what you saw. Numerous shifting lights were scattered about your room seemingly pouring in from your window crack. You rushed over to close it, but some of the sparks were still in the air. One you did not notice even touched you. Instantly shocking you but phasing out afterward. \"Electricity?! Aiden!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down to Aiden, he was cringing in his unnatural sleep and yelling out on occasion. The sparks that had entered your room were slowly being drawn into his body, through your sheet and blanket. His body pulsing with each entrance. You tried blocking them, ignoring the shocks and burns on your skin, but most of them went into his body and probably had been since he yelled. And worst of all he was still asleep in this agonizing pain that you only tasted. Thankfully the sparks were now gone and he was no longer yelling out...at what cost you didn't know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS you took out a deep breath, you were relieved to see him in no more pain. But before you could even take in air something else began happening to his body. He started shivering. Not yelling, but his face went into a contorted shape as he seemingly convulsed. Shaking and then pulsing out like he was having a stroke or seizure. You ran to him, yelling for him to wake up as you shook at his fur. But his eyes didn't open and his body was near burning hot. And as you pressed your hands into him, with each convulsion you felt his muscles contracting, farther and farther apart. Then, the gaps being refilled as those muscles expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the edge of your 9 ft. long bed where his legs already reach over to the base seat beneath it. The sheets were getting farther away from his ankles. He was growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you remembered, power sources made him grow. He was growing from the electricity. \"It must be from the storm, he attracted the electricity bouncing off the rain from the lightning.\" You stepped away as his body slowly expanded outward. Reaching another foot, maybe two in size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed with relief when he seemed to calm down. His body was still hot and tense, but his expression seemed to have relaxed somewhat. Your arms and back were still stinging, but it seemed relatively minor compared to what was happening to Aiden. Although you had been surprised at the entire situation, things had become much clearer after witnessing what had just happened. Your heart was still racing, and you weren't sure whether it was a good idea to wake him. Despite the pain he had been through, it seemed as though he was finally sleeping peacefully, and things might calm down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the only thing you could hope for as you got up again, wincing when you moved. You pushed through it before getting up and examining your window frame. The wood had gotten singed by all of the lightning, and the rain was leaking in along the edges. There wasn't anything you could do to seal it any more than it already had been, but it would at least be a little bit of protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there wasn't any point in taking any more risks. You spent another minute to make sure Aiden still looked and felt okay. His body still felt far too hot, but his heartbeat seemed stable and his sudden growth didn't seem to aggravate his injuries. With a bit of regret, you left the room, planning on shutting down the power in your house. There was no point in taking any more risks after the storm had just struck your house directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few minutes, but things wore heavily on your mind. You had to stumble through for a flashlight, and even then, navigating your basement was a pain with all of the supports scattered around it. More than anything, you just wanted to be quick. You didn't know what was happening to Aiden, but it wasn\u2019t natural, and there was a very real chance that he would end up injured, or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had just finished, and had only closed the basement door when you heard another yelp, the sound of it covering the dimmed boom of thunder. \"You're kidding! Not again!\" You dashed up as fast as you could, your heart racing as you dashed up the stairs. You almost tripped in the darkness, but you managed to get in, flashlight pointed right at Aiden as you slammed the door wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the lightning was smaller this time. By the time you had arrived, the lightning was gone, and Aiden had quieted down. However, there were new marks along the edges of your window, and his face was tense again, his body clearly shaking as it began to swell again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't right. It just wasn't right. It was difficult enough to believe that lightning had somehow managed to get in the space of a barely-opened window, through a room, and strike Aiden directly. There was just no way that it had somehow managed to get through a closed window and hit him a second time. You tried to hold him still as his body pushed and moved, but even unconsciously, he was twisting and shifting a lot harder than you could manage. Even before, you never could've kept him still if he wanted to move. Now, it was a struggle against futility just to keep him on the bed. His body lengthened another few inches as you held him, and it was only a moment more before he bulged out further, his muscles thickening and swelling. His breathing finally seemed to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know if it had been moments or minutes or hours since it had started, but you were worried. You held his body tight, feeling it slowly cool as the rain raged in the background. It was getting clearer and clearer that it wasn't safe for Aiden to keep staying in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashlight next to you seemed to flicker. You had dropped close to Aiden's side when you had tried to get him to relax, and it was amazing that it hadn't been damaged worse when Aiden was thrashing around. You sighed as you picked it up, moving away just enough to try to get a better view of Aiden now. The beam seemed a bit dim, but steadied when you looked. It seemed as though Aiden's growth had managed to help with the wounds he had, and although there was a little scarring, it wasn't very visible under his fur. Despite the pain he had been through, Aiden would probably be okay, as far as you could tell in the low light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked when you realized it, shaking the flashlight a couple of times and looking at it. It was an emergency flashlight, and had rarely gotten any use in the time that you had it. The batteries in it should've been fresh, and there was no way they would be this weak after less than a couple of hours of use. You tried to figure out what was going on, sitting on the bed against Aiden's body as you examined it. The beam started flickering again, and it was only moments before it went out completely that something in your mind clicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Aiden... I... I didn't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned suddenly, expecting to hear a shout or a yell from him. However, this time, there was only a gentle growl, almost a smile coming from his mouth. It seemed that he had drained the battery completely, but the electricity in it wasn't nearly enough to cause him pain. You could only give a sigh of relief as you held him, feeling his body warm up a little and stretch out. If he grew from it, it was only fractions of an inch. You were just relieved to have made the discovery without causing any more harm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're absorbing electricity... But only if it's huge, or if it gets too close... My house still had power, so as long as we can keep you insulated, or keep you from getting closer to the sources...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. There was still a storm going on outside, and it was pretty clear that Aiden was effectively a lightning rod right now. You had to try to get him covered, but you couldn't think of anything in your house that would be a huge help. The next best bet was to try to get him into the basement, or anywhere where he wouldn't get struck again. Even though he was relaxed now, you shook him as hard as you could, trying to get him up. It took a minute before you heard a loud yawn echo through the room, and saw him start to shift and sit back up.</span></div></div>",

He rubbed his eyes slowly trying to get accustomed to the light. When he was able to see straight he saw you're face and you holding your side because of the electric spark, \"what happened?! Are you hurt?!\" He was getting up in nearly no pain whatsoever, he didn't even whince. And as the sheets pulled off of his body you saw that mostly all of his wounds had healed and closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw you astonished at his body and he looked himself over too. Amazed and worried, he was about to speak but you interjected, \"I'll tell you when we get downstairs, it's dangerous while the storm is still going on outside. But I need to turn the power off soon. And while we get down there, do not touch anything connected to a plug or somethign with batteries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and slowly got out of bed, \"Okay let's...OWWWW!!!\" his head had hit your 12 ft. ceiling. The bump had left an impression as well. \"What the hell!\" he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's one of the problems,\" you shuddered as you heard thunder outside, \"but please let it wait, follow me and be careful.\" You led him out of your room after turning off the light. He followed you closely, avoiding every outlet and light he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his new bulky body he was havign trouble at every opening and door. Thankfully your living room connected to the upstairs, as such the ceiling was twice as high. But you already knew it was going to be a tight fit under your 8 ft. ceiling downstairs. The door down was under the main staircase, you went in and tried your best to open and move aside things to give Aiden room. You're basement was a partly aboveground one. It had a main room, bathroom, laundry and utilities room, and extra bedroom with a  few closets. Very comfortable, you actually spent more time down there with friends than upstairs. You felt bad for Aiden though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Aiden,\" you set down some candles on a side table next to a couch. Siden himself was sitting on the carpet floor looking to you a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothign is you're fault, please don't say you're sorry when there is no reason to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed an \"okay,\" the sorry being just a reaction more than a statement. But he was right. You went into the laundry room and turned off the power after lighting the candles. You came back and looked into the gloomy room after closing the door and grabbing some blankets from the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came back in you saw Aiden in a sulking poisition, just laying on the floor looking up at you. He was forcign a smile, but he looked very sad behind it. The candle light over his dark face and the room wasn't helping either. You couldn't help sulking a bit too. Here he was, you're best friend in the world, you've helped him through many of his problems. Studying, getting a part-time job, applying for the army, but this is the one time that all you could do was close to nothign for him. That was what you're sorry was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat on the couch next to him, in this uncomfortable and cramped space and told him what happened when he slept.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time you had finished giving your explanation, Aiden seemed oddly quiet. He was curled up a little on the floor, but his body seemed tense and his fur seemed to be standing on end. You tried to think about exactly what you could say, but your throat felt dry and you had trouble thinking of the right words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few moments, but you felt the ground shaking a bit as you heard a loud thump. You jumped a bit, but swallowed as you saw a small indent on the floor, his hand clenched into a fist and visibly shaking. \"A-aiden? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm not.\" His voice was strained, and as he turned to you, you could see the bitterness held in his eyes. He was clearly upset, and though he seemed to have a bit of restraint, his entire body seemed to shake and tense. \"This... All this is happening... Things were tough enough before... And now...\" You could hear the tone of his voice change, increasing to a soft growl. \"The people who did this... They're going to pay...\" You tried to hold yourself a little as you heard him speak, his resentment barely contained in his tone. \"Someone's died for this stupid experiment... And I'm going to end up a giant freak... There's no way I can just...\" He shook his head violently as you tried to approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiden, things... Things will be okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't!\" His shout made you jump. He saw you this time, and before you could speak, his gaze was turned back down, shaking his head quietly. His expression showed shame, but his voice held more anxiety than anything else. \"There's no way I can just avoid electricity for the rest of my life... And it's going to be near impossible to hide... I'm already a monster, and it's only going-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you both jumped and looked around for a moment as you heard the boom of thunder. You were ready to panic, but it seemed to have passed over safely this time. You gave a sigh of relief as you looked at him, but his startled expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? I can't... I can't handle something like this! And everybody else... They're still... in danger... I can't just... Grah!\u201d He curled up firmly, visibly shaking and holding himself as he tried to contain it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly tried to shift a blanket over him. It barely covered his arms and his side now, you could see him close to tears as you draped a second one over his legs. You tried to collect yourself as you spoke, and managed to keep an even voice. \"You'll be okay... Things will work out...\" You tried to say it, but you found it difficult to force the words out. \"You've... you've grown a lot, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were hurt because of it!\" His voice almost cracked as he half-shouted it, and you felt him suddenly pull you into his arms. Even has he held you, you could feel his body rattling against yours. \"You... Because you were trying to protect me... You got such a nasty shock... I'm supposed to be the one looking out for you... I'm supposed to make sure that you can... You can live safe...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head a little, turning your gaze up to try to look at him. \"Aiden...\" You press in against him, your head brushing a little against his chest. \"I am safe.\" He jerked a little, a couple of tears trailing down his face as he looked to you. You had to struggle a little to move, but you managed to give him a small nod. \"I... I know that... that things could go wrong. But... But I am safe with you.\" You quietly shift a bit and give his arm a slight pat. \"Did you realize it? That... You pulled me in... You're holding me now... You could've easily broken something, but... But I'm still in one piece, aren't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression was a little questioning for a moment, but it quickly turned to horror as you spoke. \"Y-you're right... I shouldn't be here... You're going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiden!\" Your voice was sharp enough to snap him from his concerns. \"Look at me, okay? Do I look worried right now?\" You tried to put on a small smile, but it didn't seem to fool him. He shook his head quietly before you spoke again. \"Okay, not what I mean...\" You lifted your arm up as he tried to turn away, and his head held firmly in place the moment he felt your hand against his cheek. \"Aiden... I've got a lot on my mind, yes. I'm not sure about... About what we might do... About if you're going to be safe... But I'm definitely not worried about you hurting me... That will never, EVER be a problem.\" You give him a firm squeeze, and though his body shifted and seemed to resist, his expression softened as his arms loosened over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks... But you know that... That if it happens again... If it gets to be too much for me to control...\" He swallowed and carefully held you, trying to move you but afraid to even let his fingers hold around your side. \u201cI... I mean, I've already done a bit of damage to your home... If I ever end up squeezing you to tight, you could-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll never get to that point.\" You weren't sure exactly what was supporting you, but you were able to say it with conviction. \"No matter how much you change... I'm safe with you... Even if you're the biggest guy in the world, you're still the same guy I've always known... And you've always kept me safe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if... Even if...\" He shook his head a little as he looked down at you. \"I can't... I can't live like this... And my parents... And they'll still be looking for me...\" His voice was so tense, and you weren't sure whether it was from worry or from anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiden... One thing at a time... Your parents will be here tomorrow... You'll be safe for that long... And after, we can-\" You tried to speak, but you felt your head pulled in against him, firmly pressed against his chest. You could feel him shaking, but his heartbeat seemed to slow a little as he held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... I know... Right now, I just... I just can't handle all of this... I can't handle... You know that if things were a little different... Other people have died for this, and it could've easily been me, too... I could've died, or gone insane, and... And... Gruh!\u201d He just seemed to clench his fists, his entire body tensing and pulling you firmly. \u201cThis just isn't right! I don't... I don't want this to... to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh...\" You just put your hand up to his shoulder, squeezing as firmly as you could. \"It's okay... It's okay, Aiden. I don't know what else might happen, but right now... You're safe... And you're still you...\" His body seemed to relax a little as he held you, the covers forgotten nearby. \"No matter what else happens... We have time here and now... So no more worrying, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" He nodded softly before leaning in and giving the top of your head a small lick. \"Yeah... I was... More than anything, I was afraid I would never see you again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here, Aiden.\" You just nodded again as you felt his shaking slow to a stop. You put your hand against his chest, feeling it gently rise and fall as his arms completely covered you. \u201cSo... For now... You'd better rest... You'll probably need it...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou are like the sunset, hidden amongst the clouds at the end of the horizon. Saying goodbye to the world. You are like the night, hiding false things so truth may be seen in your guardian moon. You\u2019ve shined brightly in the deepest black. You are like the dawn washing the world of it\u2019s bad. Seeing you rise brings warmth I can\u2019t fathom unless a day could be experienced in a moment. \u2013Sathomia Myfel,\u201d you read aloud to Tilgasse as he sat next to you on the tree. It was your and his favorite poem written on the day of the Equivalence. It was two centuries ago, longer than any can remember besides the older demons. That day a single woman rose between the forces of Hell and the people of Earth. This was her final writing before she died on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bright and sunny day with few clouds in the blue sky, almost Ethereal from the look of the Earth now. Few days were like this. Since the war, the moon was shattered leaving it\u2019s remnants floating around the plant, disconnected from it\u2019s large piece which was still being held together. Some days the sun would reflect off these pieces and create an Aurora in the sky. It was hard to see in the day, but it was there, dancing in its prism like rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been exactly 263 years, the mayor said, since the end of the war. When the demon race broke through the surface of our world and began to destroy everything in their paths. Our magic was a match for their strength but their numbers were infinite. It was then that a pious woman, Sathomia, called upon the power of the angels. She struck the moon with her might and the world fell silent as thousands died in a rain of destruction directed towards the hole they tore through. She sacrificed her body and laid her soul to rest, proclaiming her return if chaos returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemons formed a forced pact with humans due to her power. And the world began to rebuild. Things were much nicer than most suspected. Demon\u2019s sheer strength brought about easier methods of rebuilding, both races even gave each other design principles and ideas. From philosophy, culture, did you know demons had a government? Now almost three centuries later you\u2019re laying here next to your friend Tilgasse reading from an old text from the time written by Sathomia and her kinsmen during the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilgasse had just fallen asleep as you were reading, you could hear him snore. You were about to as well until you heard a familiar sound. Your dog Fray yelping in the distance as he practically galloped to you. Quickly jumping up to you and licking your face. Although you called him a dog he was clearly a black wolf, with a bright yellow and blue eye, but still one of the nicest dogs you\u2019d met. Even more amazing was that he was a three year old wolf that Tilgasse\u2019s father found abandoned in the woods. He became your birthday present the week after and you\u2019ve been together ever since. \u201cHey Fray, haha, what are you doing all the way out here? Did father call for me?\u201d He ran back and flipped to face you as he barked once. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming. Til\u2026hey Til!\u201d you lightly rubbed Tilgasse\u2019s shoulder. You wish he weren\u2019t such a heavy sleeper. \u201cTil, your father\u2019s calling for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026already? Good thing too\u2026I\u2019m starved\u2026\u201d he sat up groggily. You couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing as you got up. \u201cWha-what\u2019s so funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing, ghaha. Just that your plate will be very empty if you went home to eat now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Damn, again? You always get me\u2026every time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran a little ways away from him, \u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t walk and sleep on your stomach you wouldn\u2019t be so easy to trick. Hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrgh!\u201d he jumped up and started chasing you in a playful manner knowing it was only a joke. And as he did you quickly whispered a spell that made his legs stop in midair as he juts upward. \u201cDamn it, what did I tell you about using magic, haha! I swear when you teach me magic I\u2019ll make you regret it! And don\u2019t take back your word either, you promised!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, yes I did. You only specified fire magic though, all else I can let slide. Maybe only teach you a parlor trick or two like being able to catch up to a dear friend who likes to tease you. Hahah\u2026gha\u2026gagh\u2026\u201d your knees buckled under pressure and you fell forward on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell you put on Tilgasse wore off and he had to catch himself, almost effortlessly as he ran towards you. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong!?\u201d He ran next to you and kneeled down to catch you on one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026nothing\u2026gah\u2026I held the spell for too long. I need to stop using magic without my staff, my body can\u2019t take it too well. I\u2019ll be fine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine to me, here,\u201d Tilgasse scoot in front of you and held his arms back as he scooped you up over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah, no Til, you don\u2019t have to,\u201d you tried to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not listening to a word you say till we get back to your house,\u201d he didn\u2019t allow you to say another word. Thankfully he was going where you were supposed to go, instead of trekking to his house then having to tell him to carry you to yours. When things like that happened it always ended up like this; bullies, accidents, magic exasperation. It always ended up with you being carried home on Tilgasse\u2019s back. Even if he was the one injured.<br>\r\nYou just lay forward and accepted it and quietly whispered so he couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cthanks TIl\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got back your father was in a proud uproar about you getting a letter from the Arch-Mage Academy. \u201cMy boy a general Sorcerer!\u201d He never praised more embarrassingly than anyone else. Your father was a business man, more the calm and rational man. But when it came to outward joy, he was awkward to say the least. He began planning a party in your honor, started writing letters as your mother planned the party. Some of your relatives were already there talking about it as well, giving congratulations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave your best smile, through sweat from the overabundance of attention. Then while everyone was preoccupied you took Tilgasse around back to the river bed leading out of town. You sat on the cobblestone bridge over the low water. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Aren\u2019t you happy about going? I think it\u2019s great you\u2019ll be a genuine sorcerer. Then when you get back we can go adventuring like we planned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026I\u2026I never liked things to change, even if it\u2019s for the better\u2026it\u2019s happening so fast. My father isn\u2019t helping either. I want to become a skilled mage. I want to go see the world like we planned. There are still some demons that refuse to comply with us and their people who have joined with us. I\u2019m glad that no one bothers Ms. Rosaline because her son is half human half demon. But I don\u2019t\u2026want to leave yet\u2026\u201d Frey was now next to you, and you pet him with one hand as you kept your balance with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026it\u2019s not going to be like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d you were surprised to hear him say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really smart, and you like to help people a lot. You\u2019re more skilled than many magic users your age, especially for a sorcerer. I hear it take years to be that class for normal people. Only a few make it to where you are by how old you are\u2026but the point I\u2019m trying to get at is\u2026You\u2019ll be in and out of that school like that!\u201d he snapped his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be waiting and training every moment you\u2019re gone. So don\u2019t be upset about it. We both need to get better at what we do. After all, you\u2019re the brain and I\u2019m the thing that isn\u2019t a brain!\u201d he held up a partly flexed arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly fell off the bridge laughing at his comic sayings, \u201cdid you truly forget the word muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let his arm over the back of his head and gave a childish smile, \u201cmaybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sudden burst of laughter made you slip off the bridge, thankfully you suspected it would happen and quickly cast a spell to make yourself float. Tilgasse ran to the edge of the bridge as Frey jumped off, he saw you float down to the shallow water then look up at him as your dog panted and wagged his tail. You whispered another smell that made him trip onto the dirt end of the cobblestone as he was running down to get you, \u201cwhat was that for?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy wet shoes. and pants,\u201d you said as you walked past him back to your house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This includes, for me; at least 4 elements of the 6 primary elements of elemental magic, healing magic, and psychic, which is the lowest form of arcane. Because of that I can become a full Sorcerer and learn about the magic that regular mages can't learn outside academies...\" your face grew solemn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Isn't that a good thing?\" Tilgasse stepped up to you since you had been walking with a brisk step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of...cheated...I learned about two of the Sorcerer arts from my grandfather...he kept journals from when he was in school and taught me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means you'll have a one up on the group right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...but it also means I broke the law. I have to be an entree in the academy. But I'm not, yet. So once I enter, I'm off the hook...what are you doing...?\" Tilgasse was looking into the side of your face and followed behind you examining the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped when he noticed you were looking, \"sorry, I thought I saw your brain leaking out of your ears from not having enough room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll ignore that statement...is there anything else you want to know that I probably told you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what are the two powers you learned that could get you in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the schools of Sorcery are Arcane, Summoning, and the two major elements Darkness and Light. Grandfather taught me about the last two, specifically Darkness and Summoning. I never really wanted to learn about light magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to learn Summoning and Darkness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they require that every sorcerer has to have some sort of Familiar. I've been thinking of making Frey into one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...no wait. Never mind, that's way over my head I'm sure. Besides we've been standing on your doorstep for a while so I think you should go inside. I'll see you tomorrow okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow Til...\" you gave each other a quick hug before he ran off back home. You stood there watching him for a moment before going inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay awake that night listening to the crickets outside in the fields, wailing about the rain predicted to come that night. Their clouds had already gathered and blot out the moon. You were awake partly to hear the symphony, but also out of anxiety that kept your eyes open. You lay awake fully thinking upon what Tilgasse and you had spoken of. You had brought a cup of tea with you to drink before you slept but there it was on the desk next to your bed, full and cold. After noticing it you cast a spell to warm it up just before boiling. When it began to steam you lifted it up and took a sip, \"...no sugar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were about to put it back down a sudden rumble came from outside that quickly jerked it from your grip. 'Was that thunder?' It stopped as soon as it had come, but by the time you realized the cup broke on the floor another quake came. This one shook at the foundations of your home as shelves were knocked over. You also saw pyres of yellow lights floating outside your windows, small yellow crystal in the air resembling quartz. \"Earth magic?!\" you jumped out of bed, taking your staff from the wall and cloak. \"Everyone, get out of the house! Earthquake!\" No sooner said then everyone snapping to their attention and running from their rooms. Your parents, little brother, and your dog Frey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commotion had escalated into something far worse than what you could see on the inside. The ground was shaking horribly and the sky was red with fire coming from the Eastern edge of town. Demons from the ground and the sky were ravaging the town, even killing demons already living here. \"Why are they killing everyone, we have a pact!\" your little brother yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's going to be okay Eric, I'm sure the town guard and mayor are doing what they can,\" no sooner had you said that when two guards on horseback came. One firing an arrow of lightning into an oncoming demon. As the other shielded from it's attack. It fell in a twitching rage. You hid your brother from the sight. \"We're rounding up what people we can. Especially able mages and healers. We're moving what villagers we can to bunkers but we need the help of all magic users.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what's happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know! Demons began pouring out of the sky and forests, we have as little an idea as you do but we must have the assistance of your son. You all must be move to the bunkers beneath the Town Hall immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your parents could protest you quickly stepped forward, \"it's okay mother. I have to go, they need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mariam, it's alright. Let him do what he needs to. No better mage can.\" Your father led your mother and little brother to the guard while you stepped towards the mage. he took you up on his horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you both sped off in opposing directions your little brother yelled to you, \"I want you back alive big brother!\" And the mage snapped the reins before you could yell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led you to a guard's tower where a few demons, mages, and guards were posted. One in heavy armor approached, \"this is the junior sorcerer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am. What do you need me to do sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've already taken the Eastern edge of the town, we managed to stop them there but there's still many coming. From the trees, ground, and sky. We need as much help as we can get; ever killed before boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monsters in the woods yes with my hunting friend Tilgasse and his father.\" The moment you said that a familiar voice yelled from the distance. Til and his father were sitting at the far end. His father, Roan, looking as dark as always in his hooded black and scarred eye. He was a kind man in person but had a foreboding air. He must have been doing a lot for them, he was and still is a skilled warrior from the army. \"I think it will be much easier for me to work with them around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then, Syx get him ready for combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were all sent out into the field as soon as ready. Roan part of the squad of guards protecting your group. Even your dog helped in tracking down demon's coming through the ground. The mission was to take back the Eastern edge, someone there sent a message saying he had full intel on a mystics note. It was signed under the villages insignia so it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDealing with the demons was easy enough, a few men were injured then easily cured. It was a winning battle and some of the men were impressed with your prowess. Conjuring elemental forces that higher leveled magicians barely knew. Added to that, you and Tilgasse worked like a team more than anyone in the group. When you froze an opponent he shattered them. \"You know, I was going to stop you from joining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you?!\" you asked while charging an electric spell in your staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I knew it would work out too well if we did join!\"  he shoved his sword in the way of the spell and wielded the electricity as he pierced through a demon's armor with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say that the battle wasn't hard. It was difficult to keep things as they were. You were sad to see even one man die, but knew grieving was to come later. The East side was worse then imaginable. You couldn't look down for long, the bodies were indistinguishable beneath the rubble or ripped open in horrific scenes. Even one of your teammates stated, \"hell,\" under his breath. That was when Roan said, \"no, Hell is nowhere to be seen. This place is Paradise compared to it's dark fires.\" He would know, Roan was one of the people who went down to the demon world when an insurrection was attempted 20 years ago. Maybe this was from the same group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even told you once, \"demon's are not mindless monsters roaming the world. They are just like people, but given great power and strength. but what they do with that power is their own choice just like you mages and we humans.\" He then pointed over to his neighbor and her horned husband holding their baby across the road. You thought of that day while looking down to a small ragdoll half burned in the rubble of a torn down house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air of the East side was filled with the dark fog of smoke rising from the blaze. As well as choking with the smell of blood and burned corpses that you were thankful not to see through the thick fires and ash. The battles were much more brutal on this side, you were thankful that other assaults were being made by other groups. You and they assisted each other well. The demons were much fiercer and in greater numbers, you and the other mages were also their targets. They knew to attack the magic users within the formation as you were the generators of the most power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your ground with your best spells at your disposal, crippling the horde when able to cast. It was thrilling and hard. Mixed emotions were filling your head as you all pressed onward to the guard tower, now coming into sight. If the group had survived, it must have been of some miracle. The tower was overrun by the time you got there, demons were almost pouring through its windows and crevices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're splitting into two groups. First squad will clear a path and battle here on the outside so as the draw attention away from the second squad. The second squad will enter the tower and find our men who are holding up in the lower floors.\"<br>\r\nRoan spoke out, \"wait, sir. Isn't this the tower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026yes, this is where the seal is\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were perplexed, \"seal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the great demons, Glasya-Labolas, a count of the demon world who was part of the insurrection 20 years ago is sealed within the tower. We could not kill him; any human who came near him comes under his power. They are still able to speak and think on their own, but their bodies are driven to slaughter each other. Only mages seemed to be unaffected by his power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he was released, it would not be long before this entire town slaughtered itself. Even without the demon's help,\" the captain said while planning who would go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll create the distraction!\" Tilgasse yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, dad, and you along with a few others can stay out here and deal with the horde. Captain, you should be the one to deal with the inside. You assign the men here so you know the place best, right? It wouldn't be right for people who didn't know the inside to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Hmph, smart kid. Roan, your son could grow up to be a descent warrior when he grows up. Good head on his shoulders.\" He began divided the original 27 into a group of 15 and 12. You, Tilgasse, and Roan stayed out in the group of 15 as the 12 went in along with the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assignment was brutal, to say the least. The toughest demons were assigned to attack the guard tower. It took all the might you could muster. Eventually leading you and 4 of the other 6 mages assigned to you to gather your powers for a great spell to destroy as large a portion as you all could. You all gathered in place as the other two mages created a barrier to sever the might of the demons that tried to oppose the spell. If it were not for the other 9 warriors as well you would not have been able to gather the power. Eventually the energy encircled among the chanting and the spell was summoned. A great storm of ice. Shards of glistening ice whipping into a freezing eddy. It devoured all fire in the area and freezing all non-human life within the circle around the guard tower.<br>\r\nExhausted and released of what strength you could give you barely had time to catch yourself as you fell to your hands and knees. The other mages were not as well as you were but better off. You may have had prowess but they had endurance added to their years. Thankfully the spell seemed to work wonders for the outside, what was left of the demons was easily taken care of by the others. So you were given time to rest. \"Roan\u2026why was the demon count sealed here..? Couldn't they have sent him to a more secure place?\" you asked as you and the others got what rest you could, awaiting the Captain and his crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good question, but think on this. If we had sent him to  a heavily guarded area then two things would have come into place. Wave after wave of demon insurrections till he was found due to how quickly they would have found him. As well as the number of people inflicted by his power. A small town was the best place\u2026I'm sorry to say it was ours\u2026\"<br>\r\nIt was a bit cold to believe, but it was also true. If it were a larger and more protected town they would have brought a sea of demons to release him; as well as politics coming into play if other higher demons were involved and not known to be traitors. \"Why would they even try now though? Sathomia's soul still lives\u2026she'd obliterate the traitors once they had grown to be too much of a threat\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some demons never give up their hatred, just like people,\" Tilgasse held your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just returned from cleaning up a small batch of those not caught in the spell. His arm had a gash through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Oh you're hurt, here,\" you held out your hand as a green light emanated from it, closing the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to do that; I could have just wrapped it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, besides I need to do something besides take up-\" as you spoke Frey began barking heedlessly towards the tower. \"What's wro-\" a massive quake tore through the area as you spoke. The tower's stone wall seemed to squeeze into itself before bursting outward in an array of violet and umbral light mixed into the brick and stone. It took quick thinking of three of the mages to protect the group with a wall of power. And from it came a pillar of dark light rising from the depths of the tower remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the light a shadow came from within, a winged creature. It rose then calmly float downward to the ground at the end of the street. \"\u2026damn\u2026we were too late\u2026Hurry, raise a protection spell around us! His power can't reach through another's magic!\" 4 mages quickly rose from their rest and formed a barrier around the group. A chartreuse light spiraled around you all, creating a crystal like dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure's body was like that of a thin wolf in the shape of a man's body. With black wings and gilded embroidery covering it's almost nude but tattooed body it carefully walked down the cobblestone road. Soon its upper body became clear; you saw the full horror of the creature. The arms were chained and shackled over the chest while the hands overlapped and its mouth was bandaged shut with the toothy mouth still showing. Worst of all were the piercing copper eyes staring from the black abyss of its sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour group had walked before the creature ready to battle. \"Glasya-Labolas\u2026Return to hell demon! Your presence is not wanted on this world, by order of Sathomia the Nephilim!\" Roan out spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stopped its slow advance as its eyes rose from the ground. The demon's body twitched as its eyes shot at Roan. Its mouth the slowly curled upward into a grin as a hoarse gasp came from it. But within all your minds a loud and dark voice laughed heretically. Then, it spoke, without moving opening its maw. \"Are you not\u2026yes, I can smell it\u2026the one called Roan\u2026 Gahahahaha!! My it's been a while since I could stretch my wings and still instill terror after two decades of imprisonment in that small box your worthless mages put me in! Did you think a count of Hell Glaysya-Labolas, lord of bloodshed could be trapped forever in a human machination!?\" his voice was practically blaring through your skull. \"Even 1200 years after devouring the fruit of knowledge. You humans are still worms without us and the angels\u2026truly laughable\u2026but I have no time for your games. Come now, remove that barrier\u2026I don't bite\u2026I may be able to use some of you for slaves\u2026Hahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inched closer and terror like you never knew filled your mind. \"Don't listen to him, the moment we let down this barrier we'll slaughter each other! Focus on him, he cannot act on his own accord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roan, do not begrudge my sanctity. My charity. I offer much for little in return\u2026If even one of you may come to my side I promise the safety of all this town\u2026what is left\u2026\" he was against the side of the barrier now. Tapping and clawing at it with one free finger. One of the mages in the group even went as far as casting a spell towards him out of sheer terror. The fire caused by it was instantly absorbed into the demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother, higher demons can absorb magic if it is of less power than their rank\u2026\" Roan said as the demon licked his lips and replied as to how 'scrumptious' the spell was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're fear welled inside of you. It was even allowing thoughts of what may yet come if any of you denied his request. That much power, absorbing magic, was the most frightening thing of all you had seen. But nowhere near what you had imagined from what you heard. What is your reply?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're fear caused many things to flutter in your mind. A series of events leading to this night and moment. What you had seen was the prevailing moments of joy throughout your life, crushed, by this day. In your fear; your mother was cooking you dinner. In your dread; your father was giving you praise. In your anguish; your brother was your greatest playmate. In your sorrow, Roan was your greatest wisdom. And in your despair, Tilgasse was a reason to smile. Your actions had gone beyond the grasp of identity. And the words spoken that awoke you from your terror, \"NEVER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your consciousness caught up with your actions you found yourself outside the barrier, dagger in hand. A gift given to you by Roan for self defense. The tip covered in a dark crimson. And the demon three yards in front of you, his chained hands covering a gaseous wound over his face. He took no care or notice of your exclaim, holding his cheek and looking down on it as if you were not there. His hands moved away as violet and green gas poured out the wound until his skin closed. \"We humans are stronger than you'd like to believe! And will never submit to you! You hurt and betray those that can give you loyalty and friendship! People like that...don't deserve the light of day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrowed onto you, your fear would have welled if you hadn't learned to stand your ground, then he spoke, \"you poor, insignificant, and unnatural creature...the truth if I were to tell you would be more then you could bare. A whimpering babe in a storm is what those that have been told wished to be..in the end.\" A wave of malefic energy pulsed out of him, pushing you back into the barrier. Tilgasse caught you from behind. \"So be it! Cower and pray behind that barrier, this poor town will need the power of the angels that will not heed...\" his wings flapped and his body shot upward. \"If by some miracle that one survives, I will make it my vow to drink from their tears forever!\" his voice boomed as he flew Westward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's heading towards the Hall!!\" Tilgasse called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry everyone, we must defend the bunker! The others do not know of his power!\" as Roan spoke Tilgasse ran out the barrier's circle, \"No son! Don't be a Fool!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilgasse didn't listen to Roan's words, he ran with a blind rage. \"Why would he run without us?!\" Your group began to give chase as the barrier was kept up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife, most likely...gahhh...his feelings may very well get him killed. But I understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to understand that we did not know. The secret was kept between those who fought during the insurrection. If we had told them, the day may be much worse then it is,\" Roan's words were true. Planning came first before emotion in a situation as dangerous as this. Besides, there were mages stationed at the Hall. Your people weren't fools. You just hoped they were prepared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand...my family's there too, but...I don't know if I'd have the courage to do what he wants to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rationality, you have plenty of courage. You confronted a demon, one of the most dangerous. Because you also have a leveled head. Even if it was a subconscious act you knew that he could not affect you. It's an act Tilgasse would have committed as well. My son has a heart that speaks louder than his mind,\" Roan held a small smile that quickly turned to a serious face. You nod to his words and kept your pace with them as you neared the Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was horrific... Bodies lie in the streets; their faces contorted with their pain. The fires had spread. And already, to your worst imagination, you had seen what was foretold. People killed by each other, ripped and run through by their neighbors. Mages killed by the very people protecting them. Your mouth was a agape and words were unable to leave. \"Keep your mind...notice the demons are not to be seen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all came to the open doors of Town Hall in front of the square, no noise came from within. \"I'll go ahead and see if the bunker's been breached. Stay outside, but keep yourselves hidden. If I don't return within ten minutes, go to the West guard tower then leave for Seros and see if the team that went was able to get help. And whatever you do, keep up as small and unnoticeable barriers as you can. Use Fray to smell for danger.\" You nod as you were scattered around the walls and buildings, keeping to the shadows. As did Roan while he passed from wall to wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe, Roan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept inside of a small building half destroyed by the fire but safe to be inside of as the fire had little to spread onto there. You were with one soldier, a young man who you had to protect along with yourself from the demon's power. Fray did not need the barrier's power, animal's were not affected either. He sniffed around the floor of the home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not adept at barrier's, although you had learned to create them. It was perfect for the situation. As less power meant the barrier was less noticeable. Keeping below the window, you watched outside for some time. The only sounds coming from the razing fire, but otherwise it was too quiet. As you watched a shadow flickered across the square, then you heard Fray whine from behind you. You and the warrior looked back and saw nothing. \"Where'd he go?\" You stepped away from the warrior who looked perplexed then suddenly worried. When you turned back you heard a muffled scream, and no one was behind you. Your surprise and fear led you to break down your shield as you prepared to attack whatever came near. Turning round constantly as your magic channeled to your staff you felt something tap at your back. And when you turned, a black tentacle was hanging from the ceiling. And before you could speak you were unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke your arms were being held up and your legs were bent under you, sprained. Blood was dripping from a cut just below your eye. But you were to weak too yell from the pain. You looked forward and saw Glasya-Labolas standing before a pile of burning bodies. \"You spoke...of how strong humans are...these men were not even able to fight back...at least not against me...nor did this one who dealt with them all for me,\" he stepped away. Revealing a twitching figure behind him. The man stood before the fire and lifted up his sword, pierced through a small corpse. The blade swiped downward toward you as the body fell in front of you, it's blood sprayed on your clothes. It was Fray. And the figure was Tilgasse. As a circle of demons high and low watched apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no...no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never liked animals, despite my form. The fruit of wisdom given to them prevents my power from taking them. But, we demons are not without hearts...that is why I'll let you prove your words. Before I have your friend kill you...\" The demon next to them threw your staff before you. \"One spell...is all I'll give you. If you can defeat me with one spell I promise they will let you go. The bloodshed will be useless if I die...\" Tilgasse and Glasya-Labolas came before you. Both you and he were crying, but Tilgasse was unable to control his body. Driven to kill, his body awaited the order to slaughter you. You both looked at each other as the demons that held your arms released you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your staff, \"any spell..?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I hope you understand that none can kill me...and the moment you cast it you are free prey.\" You kept your head down as Glasya-Labolas lowered himself before you, awaiting your action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to your pocket, to Fray's lifeless body, the tears of Tilgasse, then turned back to the muzzle of the cold demon in front of you, \"...then I know a spell...Til...please...tell me its alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke, \"w-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me it's okay, please Til,\" you spoke out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure what you meant but in his trust, he knew it was something he had to say. For any shred of hope left, \"...it's okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...sacrificing your friend to give yourself the strength to kill me...humans are of no equal power to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll die here as you wish Glasya-Labolas...\" the demon frowned at your words. \"Heed me now power of creation sent from the chaos beyond. I offer the blood of the innocent and of the guilty to you so that new life be born.\" An red array spread out from beneath you, encircling you four and pushing away the demons that were close. Glasya-Labolas was sent to it's far side, Fray's body to the other, as Tilgaase float in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! A Summoning Spell?!!!\" he struggled as demons tried to break into the array to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all...you can only absorb magic...a summon only of higher strength then you can kill you, which I can't summon. Instead your body will be used to become my new familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible!! How can you have my blood!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From when I cut you. Your wound may have healed, but my dagger still has your blood. Along with Fray's blood and Tilgasse's consent as the receiver. You are part of the spell, you have no power anymore. It's all within the array.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, then I will just kill you in my new form!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong again...Tilgasse and Fray will also be a part of the fusion, your minds will mix but Til's will be the dominants as your's and Fray's will take up the rest. Face it demon, you lost!\" The array spread as Fray and Glasya-Labolas's body circled into Tilgasse's. The demon screaming out as his power flood out of his body. Releasing into the frenzy and flow of power.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glasya-Labolas's body burned away into a umbral aura as Fray's became a teal one, but significantly smaller. Both aura's seeped into Tilgasse who began trembling, then shaking harshly, to fully convulsing violently as his body became a bright crimson silhouette. You couldn't bare to watch the pain, but the spell needed to be finished or the three of them would turn break down to nothing. \"New life...born from the chaos I have summoned! I offer my blood in pact!\" The blood from your exposed cheek was sucked through your skin into Tilgasse's body. He was now screaming violently from the pain. His screams becoming growls and his body giving shape. \"I give you the name, Tileos Fraloya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your words the array shattered and formed into Tilgasse's body as well. Creating a dense light that you squint to see from below it, Tilgasse's voice ceased it's cry. The light dropped down with a force that drove the air around it back. His body was being given shape within. First being formless, then reaching out into a manlike form as the light dimmed. His body grew to a great height above you, and still grew. His skin became a dark bronze, and the tattoos that once adorned Glasya-Labolas were now marked upon him in black. Pitch black fur came out of his waist as a tail grew with it. His hair spread back in a black arc with ears atop his head. And claws came from his fingers and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy of using the spell was sapping your strength and about to render you unconscious. Before it did though, Tilgasse looked down to you behind him as his form inched higher. Blood welled from his eyes; the left yellow, the right blue. You tried to smile before he turned away and began walking forward. The demon horde about to crash down upon you. You saw him rise higher, towering above the burning town. He bent back and before you slipped completely into the oncoming darkness you said, \"...I'm sorry...\" A bloodletting howl made the ground tremble. Then the rain came...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were trapped you in your mind. The dark smile of Glasya-Labolas was a distant memory, you knew. You kept your mind set on one, the eyes that cried red tears. In the darkness of your thoughts, you felt your body being lifted as the wind rushed past you. For a few moments you they were open to the same eyes you saw before, looking forward then down to you. They carried a sorrowful and glad light. Trying your best to smile you were about to pass back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn echoing voice reverberated from afar as the wind slowed, \"...who are you..! Put him down..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen above you, in a more clear tone, \"...it's alright dad...it's me...\" and the darkness came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no thoughts this time, only feelings. Of what had happened and of what may come. But there was something that you were running to as well. A warmth that held you close, and gave you more comfort then you could imagine being given. You ran to it as the emotions made their way into a long forgotten spot in your heart. Your eyes opened to a brilliant light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the warmth was coming from a familiar but new being, holding you like as the only thing it was ever able to care for. \"...Til...\" you reached out your hand and touched his face as he managed to give a smile. Holding your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...good morning...\" his voice was a hoarse growl, but you could still hear his own behind it. His face was still mostly human, it was fiercer even when in the gentle smile he held. His nose jut out a little, like a muzzle. And his eyes had a greater outline. His teeth were practically perking out of his mouth. His face even twitched a little as it seemed unaccustomed to smiling. His ears had dropped back down but pointed far outward and lost their fur. His hair dropped in a black tangled mess over his dark face. The tattoos of the demon crossed over it as well. And his eyes still glowed even in the bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Til...I'm...sorry...\" His eyes narrowed into a pained look as his mouth stood open. \"...I didn't mean for you to be in so much pain...\" He was biting his lower lip as red tears started forming in his eyes. \"I didn't run after you...because I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" he winced his eyes with the bark. Then he buried his head into your chest, \"please...don't even think of blaming yourself...I shouldn't have run away from the group..!\" his hand clenched on your shirt. You did your best to sit up against what was behind you, and placed a hand in his hair. \"I was worried...and scared...I didn't want him to kill...to kill her...my mother...\" he was gasping. \"Then...h-he...he made me kill...he ordered them not to move and had me...he had me..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrapped your arms around his head, \"Shhh...that wasn't you...that will never be you...Til...\" you cradled him as he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's when I became this...I can still feel him...and Fray...he's dormant and Fray and I are suppressing him...but now I'm also beginning to remember what he does...I'm starting to know what he knows...it hurts...everything hurts...please...tell me...am I still...am I still human..?\" Tilgasse's tears were running through your clothes making them red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift his face to yours, \"Til, you've been human all your life and still will be. Your body and mind may change but you are still you. Whether or not what you are on the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, and you both held each other for a while as dim footsteps came to you. The sky you turned to was clouded, but rays of light came from the holes between. The group coming towards you was...</span></div></div>",

You manage to straighten yourself up a little, sitting up and leaning back into Til's body as you turned to meet them. Tilgasse quietly held you, though his gaze had turned towards them as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, bro. How are ya holding up?\" He nearly broke into tears upon hearing your words. He dashed towards you, his body almost slamming into you as he hugged you tight. You just felt him pressing in, too tired to give any resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid I lost you too... I'm so glad you're okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Jerek... I'm a mage, remember?\"  You manage to give your brother a weak squeeze, before the two of you let go. \"I can take good care of myself, and I've got people to protect me.\" You smile and look back at Tilgasse. He shifted a little as he noticed, but his smile returned and he gave you a slow nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but... You're the only one I've got left...\" His voice cracked a little, and you could feel a bit of the heat leaving your body. You swallowed, but didn't say another word. There wasn't anything else that needed to be said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see... We'll have to... Make sure to give everybody a proper funeral after all this is done...\" You swallowed, doing your best not to think too much about your parents at the moment. There was already a lot on your mind, and you didn't know if you'd be able to handle the load of it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilgasse looked up quietly at his father, swallowing and holding you a little tighter as he spoke. You felt your body slipping from your body's grip, still holding onto his hands. Jerek looked at you quietly, as you heard Tilgasse's voice speaking quietly from behind you. \"Dad... M-mom also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoan simply nodded as he looked at Tilgasse. \"I know.\" Tilgasse was barely able to contain himself, but his father approached quietly, looking over his body, doing his best to sound understanding. \"It's not your fault, Tilgasse. Glasya-Labolas wouldn't have left anybody, regardless of whether or not you're here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Til...\" He near jumped as he heard your voice, turning to look at you. \"We wouldn't still be here if it wasn't for you.\" Your brother watched in a bit of confusion as your hands held Tilgasse's. \"I could only do that magic because you were...\" You swallowed, a little uncertain of the consequences. \"You were willing to do something like this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I was...\" His voice was deep, and despite being close to tears, his voice still had the dark tone of a growl within it. \"I always want to take care of you... I was ready to... To give up my life if it meant that you'd end up safe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and squeezed him tight. \"You idiot... I don't want to end up somewhere because you died for me... You already do way too much for me...\" You manage a weak smile, holding tight against his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to now...\" He shifted you carefully, letting you rest as he held you. \"I'm your familiar now, right... I think it's my job to take care of you, now...\" He gave a small smirk as he squeezed your hand. \"Does that mean I have to call you 'master' now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to chuckle quietly as you looked into his shining eyes. Your brother gave a quiet chuckle from your side, and spoke quietly through his tears. \"Why not? You're always doing what he asks you to, anyways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... You guys...\" You give a small smile in resignation, too tired to give a proper response to the joke. However, as you heard them laughing, you couldn't help but relax and grin. Even though his visage was quite fierce, it was just good to see Tilgasse laughing again, his eyes lifted and his muzzle bumping lightly against you as he hugged you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you two in good condition again. But I'm afraid we don't have time to spare anymore.\" Roan's words snapped all of you back to attention. \"That rain we had seems to have driven the demons away for a little while. I think there was something special about it. That spectacle that you two made probably did something for us, too. But by now, they'll have recovered. They'll be active again, and we don't have the manpower to deal with it anymore. Most of the people who lived here are dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilgasse seemed to shiver a little in his uncertainty, and your vision seemed to cloud as you tried to get up again. However, Tilgasse's hand held you in place, trying to get you to rest while it was still possible. \"Do we still have to fight? I don't know if we... If I can still fight right now...\" He asked quietly as he held you with one hand. The other pressed to his forehead, rubbing himself slightly, as though trying to get rid of a headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Maybe not. There was a little bit of movement, and I only brought Jerek here so I could keep an eye on all of you. I don't want any of you wandering off, or getting distracted. Right now, this spot seems to be their target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here? Why?\" You gasped a little bit, trying to stand up but only feeling your body wobble. Tilgasse managed to grab you before you fell, but Roan's words were quite clear when he spoke. </span></div></div>",

TILLL!!!\u201d You quickly kneeled down and held him with little use. A fiery red aura emanated from his body. \u201cTil\u2026\u201d As he thrust you away one last time you looked on to him sadly. Looking at what you\u2019d forced him to endure now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet Back!

You held your arms over his head then gently brought them down over him as his eyes opened wide and his body stopped. Only quivering slightly as you held him. \u201cTil\u2026I\u2019m sorry I made you go through this. And Glasya, you cannot win you may as well stop trying now. <br>\r\nYour body may have held great demonic power but that was only your body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walked through the forest, your favorite place to spend a quiet Saturday afternoon. The wind felt nice and cool against your skin, a gentle reminder that fall had just arrived. The leaves on the trees were \u00a0beginning to get hints of brown, orange and yellow on their tips, and a faint spicy smell floated through the air. This was your favorite time of year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest you were in was not your usual choice, a forty mile drive outside the house you shared with a friend in Danville, Kentucky, the small college town you had lived in since starting school. A classmate in your creative writing workshop had recommended this forest as a place where she would come to get inspired, as there would hardly ever be any other person found there and it truly let one be alone with their thoughts. She hadn't been lying. The gentle rolling hills complimented the varied colors of the trees, and the wildlife seemed to be more active here, not having to worry as much about human encroachment. Birds sang up in the branches, squirrels scampered about, you even thought you saw a fox dart through some of the undergrowth. This was why you had chosen Centre over the other, bigger colleges you had been accepted to: getting away from the city really let your mind truly think creatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a small Moleskine notebook out of your pocket, along with your favorite pen (one that cost you $150 but worked in any condition and had a feel like a figure skater gliding on the ice), you sat down on the ground, leaning against a tree trunk. You had begun to get to work on a historical short story you had started earlier that week, fleshing out the description of the Arabian-style village which was your setting, when you heard the sound of leaves crunching and sticks breaking coming from directly ahead of you. Something - or someone - was coming your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you didn't see anything at first. After a moment, though, a figure emerged from the bushes and stumbled towards you, clearly injured. As it got closer, you realized it was not a human, but a young feline anthro. You guessed, due to the ruffs of fur under his black-tipped ears and the dark black spots on his light-grey fur, that he probably was a bobcat. You hadn't seen many anthros since moving to Danville, as they generally weren't welcomed by the more close-minded in small towns such as yours and preferred to stay in bigger cities where they had more legal protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell right away by looking at him that something was wrong. He was bare-chested, only wearing a tattered pair of stonewashed jeans, and his fur seemed very disheveled. You guessed that he was a few years younger than you, standing six or seven inches shorter and looking rather gaunt, his ribcage visible through his stomach. His paw clutched his left arm and he had a visible limp, dragging his right hind-paw behind him and wincing in pain. His breathing was becoming more belabored, and as he got closer to you, you heard him coughing, a loud, hacking cough that sounded like it was getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got within fifteen feet of you, you quickly jumped to your feet, unsure of whether or not you would need to defend yourself in case he got aggressive. The bobcat turned his head, saw you, and stopped, his heavy wheezing the only thing breaking the silence of the still air. A frightened look filled his eyes, but he didn't have the strength to do anything other than stand there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stared at each other for what seemed like hours, but in reality probably only lasted ten or twenty seconds, each of you waiting for the other to make his move. Finally, you worked up the courage to speak, saying, \"Do you need any help?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, it was a stupid question; he wasn't going to survive on his own. Without answering, he coughed again, bringing his paw to cover his mouth as he did. When he brought it back down, you were horrified to see that it was now coated in blood.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God,\" you said, stunned. \"What happened to you? Who did this?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.... Help....\" the bobcat wheezed. With one final cough, blood now dripping down the white fur around his mouth, his eyes rolled back into his head, and he collapsed to the ground in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you rushed to his side, kneeling down and grabbing his paw. He still had a pulse and was breathing, but you weren't sure how long he would remain that way. There was nothing you could do for him there; he had to have professional help, and as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you stuck your arms underneath his torso and lifted him up, surprised by how light he felt. He must have been even more malnourished than he appeared. You could carry him, you were sure, but it was at least ten minutes' hike to your car, and thirty minutes back to town, even if you sped. You sure hoped he could make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started walking back the way you came as fast as you could without dropping him, you felt a gentle tug at your shirt collar. Looking down, you saw the bobcat try to force a smile, his wet eyes glistening. \"Thank you,\" he said weakly, \"for trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" you said, smiling back uneasily. \"It's the least I could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat took another deep breath. \"No,\" he continued, \"most would've left me for dead. There aren't many humans who are as nice as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the ones who did this to you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded slightly, turning his head away from you for a bit. You could tell he didn't want to talk about that, at least not right now. When the time was right, you thought to yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging the subject, you asked, \"So what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likax,\" he answered, \"Likax Rufallo.\" he began sputtering up blood again; you could tell that even the simple act of speaking was putting a strain on his body. You began to speed up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Likax,\" you said. \"I'm Carson Fischer. Listen, you should probably stay quiet and rest for a while. I'm taking you somewhere to get help.\" You tried to smile reassuringly, but in your head you were fretting, trying to figure out exactly where you should take him. The closest hospital was in Lexington, but that was over an hour away, and Likax might not survive the trip. There was a small medical clinic in Danville, but the nurses and doctors there might not be willing to treat an anthro, as neither town council nor state legislature had passed a law requiring them to do so. Maybe the best option would be to take him back home; your roommate was on the pre-med track, and he had volunteered in hospitals for years. Besides, you trusted him more than a random health worker.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got to your car and lay Likax, now whimpering in pain, across the back seat, you finally made up your mind on what to do. Getting in the driver's seat, you fired up the engine and pointed the vehicle towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time you pulled into your house's driveway, Likax had fallen unconscious. Fearing the worst, you jumped out of the car as soon as you put it into park. You opened the back door and gently slid your arms underneath him, picking him up. As you cradled the young feline, you felt something stirring in your heart: a slight sense of affection for him, brought on by the situation and by how appreciative he had seemed to have been as you rescued him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked to the door quickly, knowing you had to hurry. You could feel Likax breathing, so you knew he wasn't dead yet, but his body was getting colder. Thank God your roommate Javier's car was there in the driveway as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed up the front steps to the door, kicking it with your feet loudly. Within half a minute, the silhouette of Javier's face appeared at one of the translucent glass windows on either side of the door, and you heard the lock quickly sliding open, the door flung wide seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Carson!\" Javier exclaimed, his voice higher pitched than usual and his eyes wide with shock. \"What the hell happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found him in the woods,\" you answered, stepping through the door. \"He was limping and coughing up blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier followed you into the den, clearing pillows and magazines off of the couch. \"And you brought him here?\" He seemed to be getting a little hysterical. Javier was a good friend and a dependable roommate, but the mix of his Hispanic heritage and his flamboyant personality made him a self-avowed fiery, passionate Latino with a tendency towards drama. Even little things could drive him crazy-- yeah, you thought, little things, like bringing a dying anthro home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot a sharp look at your roommate. \"What should I have done, left him there to die?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you take him to see a doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the people here in Danville.\" You placed your hand on Likax's throat, checking for a pulse, then moved it down to his chest. \"Unless they happen to work at Centre, most of them couldn't give two shits about anyone 'abnormal'. They'd let him die on their doorstep rather than help out one of 'his kind'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Lexington? Or Louisville?!\" Javier was starting to hyperventilate. He definitely had more medical knowledge than anyone you had ever met and he was extraordinarily compassionate, but he had a hard time dealing with high-pressure situations. Not a great trait for a future doctor, you thought, but you knew he would improve with time and practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at him, Javier!\" you exclaimed as you furrowed your brow. \"He's practically dead already. Do you really think he'd survive another thirty-minute drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you expect me to do, though.\" Starting to sweat a little, Javier pushed you aside and knelt next to the couch, feeling Likax's chest and forehead. \"I haven't studied anthro medicine yet, and I've only dealt with a few while volunteering.\" He wiped his brow and turned to look at you, almost crying by this point. \"You're asking me to perform a miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouched down next to your roommate, placing your hand on his shoulder. \"Listen, Javier. I'm not asking anything other than for you to do whatever you can. Besides, you know more about medicine than any of those quacks over at the medical clinic, and I'll help out with anything you ask.\" You paused for a moment, making sure he saw the trust in your eyes. \"I believe in you, Javier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at you for a few moments, absorbing your faith in him. Finally, he took a deep breath and started to calm down. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Likax, he continued placing his fingers on various parts of the bobcat's body. \"He's in shock. We might be dealing with a collapsed lung.\" After a few moments, he shook his head in frustration. \"How can anyone perform an examination with all this fur everywhere? The only thing I know for sure right now is that he's still breathing and he has a pulse, though it's definitely lower than what it should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need?\" you asked. Not only did you want to help your roommate deal with the situation, but for some reason, you also felt an intense desire to do whatever you could to save this bobcat. This young, cute bobcat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier sighed, running his hands through his short black hair. \"What I need is a surgery table, a surgical instruments\u2026 and a surgeon who knows what the hell he's doing.\" He turned towards you, a determined look beginning to form on his face. \"Go get me my hospital bag from my room.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" you said, rising to your feet and heading towards the stairs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sitting on the shelf above my desk. And Carson!\" he called out, and you turned your head back to look at him. \"There's an AED underneath my bed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrunched up your nose. \"An AED?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Automated External Defibrillator.\" Seeing your continued confusion, Javier continued, his voice filling with more and more urgency. \"The thing that gets someone's heart beating again if it stops. I got it as a graduation gift from an uncle with a weird sense of humor. It's about the size of a briefcase, black and yellow and made of plastic. Bring it too\u2026 just in case.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping as you nodded, you ran up the stairs and threw open the first door on the right. Javier's room was the polar opposite of yours, everything clean and organized, the shelves labeled and the closet neatly divided by clothing type and season. Three large filing cabinets stood next to the desk, holding every school assignment Javier had done since kindergarten. His walls had none of the band or movie posters that wallpapered your room, only his high school diploma on one side and a framed picture of his family on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Javier's desk, you saw that the black medical backpack was right where it was supposed to be, directly above it on a shelf marked \"Hospital Bag\". You grabbed it and slung it across your shoulder, then knelt down to look for the defibrillator kit. Javier kept the space beneath his bed even more organized than the rest of his room, full of long plastic containers with labels like \"Old Medical Journals\" and \"Med School Brochures\". The black and yellow briefcase was there, just like Javier said, sandwiched between a container and the wall.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to free it, you heard Javier's voice cry out from downstairs, \"Carson!! Hurry!\" With the AED in your hands, you ran out of the bedroom and almost threw yourself down the stairs, hoping you hadn't taken too long, that there was still time to save your new furry friend.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

You handed it over, and he bolted back to Likax's side, flipping it open before he got there. Though alarmed, Javier seemed to have a sense of determination guiding him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you asked as you ran behind the couch, looking down on Likax's body below as Javier attached the pads to his chest. The bobcat seemed so frail and helpless, and now didn't seem to be breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A minute after you went upstairs, his pulse stopped,\" Javier quickly explained as he looked at the prompt on the AED. \"He's in cardiac arrest. Watch out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed a button on the kit. A small zapping sound emitted from the pads, and the bobcat's body convulsed with the electric shock, but otherwise didn't respond. Javier looked back at the kit, his face full of concern. As he pressed the button again, you winced as Likax's chest popped up again, then fell back down, still lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" Javier leaned over the bobcat, starting to perform CPR. Bringing his hands together right below Likax's chest, Javier pressed down hard, repeating the motion several times in a rhythmic pattern. He then brought their faces together, and as he began to do mouth-to-mouth, he had a hint uncomfortableness in his eyes. You had seen Javier kiss and make out with countless guys, but you doubted he had ever touched lips with an anthro before. In another situation, you would have been a little jealous, but things were too grim for that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few repetitions of this, Javier moved back to the AED, seeing if there had been any change. He pressed the button one more time, sending another shock through Likax's body, but when the bobcat didn't respond, he finally gave up. His head sunk down low, and you could make out a tear or two streaming down his cheek. Your own eyes were getting misty, as you sat down on the floor next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" he sobbed softly, his voice cracking. You didn't expect or desire Javier to take this so hard. He'd been around death before, both at the hospitals he'd volunteered at and with his family back home in Brazil. You hoped he wasn't blaming himself for what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing your arm around him, you leaned against his shoulder and hugged him tight. Your heart was tearing itself up inside, but your friend needed you now. There'd be time for grieving later. \"You did the best you could, Javier,\" you said in a feeble attempt to console him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and looked at you, his normally-bronzed cheeks flushed with red. Wiping his eyes and sniffing, he attempted to control himself. \u00a0\"What was his name, Carson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likax,\" you answered. \"Likax Rufallo.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly nodded. \"That's a nice name. I -- I wish I could've known him more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sat there in the den, holding and comforting each other while you tried to figure out what to do next. If only today had gone a little differently, you wondered if you might have been able to save the poor young feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't have time to wonder for long, as your thoughts were interrupted by a sound that startled you. You looked up, trying to see the source of the sudden noise. What you saw shocked you beyond belief.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stunned, both you and Javier stared at the figure of the bobcat you had presumed to be dead, siting straight up, coughing and wheezing heavily, but still very much alive and awake. You rushed over to Likax's side, placing your hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likax!\" you cried out. \"My god! Y-you're alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing once more, he took a deep breath and then looked up at you, a faint hint of a smile on his lips. \"Of course I am,\" he said, his voice weak and rasp. \"You didn't think I'd give up that easily, did ya, Carson?\" You felt your cheeks begin to get flushed, impressed that Likax remembered your name when he had only heard it once while barely conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed again, his breathing still labored. You quickly ran to the kitchen, grabbed a glass and filled it up with water from the filtered pitcher in your refrigerator, then hurried back. You handed the glass over to Likax, who accepted it silently but gratefully, taking a long drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but--\" Javier sputtered, still kneeling down on the floor and in shock. \"The AED! The readout! It said you didn't have a pulse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face Javier, Likax shrugged and took another sip. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I blacked out for a long portion of it. I just remember gradually becoming aware of the faint sound of people sobbing, and then fully coming to and realizing what had happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier wiped away the tears that were still streaming down his eyes, moved up onto the couch next to Likax and began to feel the bobcat's throat and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy there, man,\" Likax said, grinning a bit more stronger than before. \"I usually want to know a guy's name at least before I let them feel me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier pulled his hands back as his eyes narrowed, and a questioning look came to his face. Chuckling, you sat down on the couch on the other side of Likax from Javier. \"Likax, this is Javier Serrano. He's my roommate, a pre-med student. He\u2026 he saved your life.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're eyes were focused on Javier, who returned your stare a bit blankly, but then shook his head. \"No, no\u2026 I didn't do anything. I honestly don't know how you're still alive.\" He gingerly took Likax's wrist, feeling it for a second. \"Your pulse seems to have somehow returned to normal, though. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax thought for a second. \"Better. Still a little woozy, but definitely better than I had been.\" He took another big gulp of water, emptying the glass. A little bit of it dribbled down his chin, dampening the fur of his muzzle. When he noticed this, he chuckled, looking up at you, a bit embarrassed. \"I guess I still need to pay a bit more attention when I drink, though. I'll go get a towel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat the glass down on the end table next to the couch and started to stand up, but Javier quickly jumped up and gently pushed down on his shoulders. \"Hey, hey, don't try to get moving too quickly here.\" His eyes looked over the feline's body, examining for any signs of concern, you guessed. Likax appeared much more healthy than he had been even when you first saw him. He sat up straight, he had stopped coughing and his breathing had returned to a normal level, and his eyes even started to glimmer a bit. His still-frazzled fur was the only visible sign that he had been in any recent distress.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax,\" you said to Likax. \"I'll go grab you a towel from the kitchen.\" You picked up the empty glass. \"Want some more water too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax nodded eagerly. \"Yes\u2026 please.\" He added at the end, reaching out and touching your hand lightly for a moment, his still-sparkling eyes looking up at yours in thanks. You couldn't help but grin at his appreciative and pleasant demeanor. The politeness, the humility, and the gratitude he expressed had started to capture your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, you heard Javier tell Likax, \"I'll be right back too.\" As you opened the refrigerator and pulled out the water pitcher again, your roommate walked to the other side of you, his face much more somber than yours. \"Have you noticed something odd about Likax in the past few minutes?\" His voice was hushed, almost whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" you smiled as you filled the glass, \"other than the fact that he just seemingly came back to life after dying in our arms? No, not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier glanced back over at Likax, who had picked up a book of scenic photographs from the coffee table and started to thumb through it. \"I don't know how to explain it,\" he said, \"but I could swear that he's gotten a little bit\u2026 larger, I guess, just in the past few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrunched up your nose in confusion, then turned back around and took another look at the bobcat. The differences weren't something you (or most other people) would've noticed or thought about, but Javier did have a keen attention to detail. \"Now that you mention it,\" you said, turning back to your tasks and kneeling down to grab a clean dish towel from the cabinet next to the refrigerator, \"he does appear to be a little bit bigger. Couldn't that just be from gaining his strength and health back, though? Like, he's able to hold his head up a bit higher because he feels better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier shook his head. \"That might explain an increase of an inch, but I could swear that he's at least three or four inches taller than he was. Also, as I was just checking his vitals, I could've sworn that I felt muscles in his arms and chest that I didn't feel before. It's not a huge amount, mind you,\" he leaned in closer as his brow furrowed, \"but enough for a doctor to sit up and take notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" you shrugged as you put the pitcher back into the refrigerator. \"That just sounds like he's recovering even better than could be expected. I don't think you should worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier still had the concern in his eyes but didn't respond. He followed as you turned around and headed back into the living room, handing Likax the glass of water. \"Thank you very much,\" the bobcat said as you sat down next to him on the couch. \"I can't begin to express how appreciative I am towards the two of you for saving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" you said, leaning back in your seat. \"It's what anyone would've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"I owe you my life.\" He placed his paw on your thigh, giving it a gentle squeeze. Through your jeans, you could feel a tiny bit of pressure from his claws. \"I promise you, I'm not going to ever forget this\u2026 or you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head slightly, peering at his face. The slight warmth flowing from his paw on your leg seemed to be radiating throughout your entire body. There was something inside this feline that you never had seen from anyone else, human or anthro. Inside, you felt a sudden urge to jump on top of Likax, to wrap your arms around him and kiss him passionately. You fought it off. It wasn't appropriate, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Javier leaned against the wall, watching the two of you with a bit of a frown on his face, \"what exactly happened to you to lead to all this? How did you end up in the woods almost dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sparkle in Likax's eyes faded, and he broke his gaze with you, looking out the window. He slumped a little, hesitating to speak, and you could feel his discomfort. Your first reaction was to scowl at Javier, but you quickly realized that you, too, were itching to know the answer to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Likax finally finally made eye contact with Javier, \"It's a long story\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Javier said, sitting down on the easy chair next to your side of the couch. \"Neither of us have anything planned for the rest of the day. We're all ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax took a deep breath, working up the courage to speak. \"Okay,\" he said, \"I'll tell you guys, since you saved my life. But you have to promise not to speak a word of this to anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your hand on top of Likax's paw, nodding fervently. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier rolled his eyes slightly. \"Fine. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Likax said, sitting back up straight, \"well, I guess I should begin at the beginning. This whole ordeal all started when\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

It was a holding place for anthros, since they didn't want us mixing with humans. Unfortunately, it was deep enough that humans were the ones running the place. Not pleasant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded quietly. Though there were a few anthros about, it was always quite clear that there was a good bit of sentiment against them. Although people were interested in them, they clearly weren't ready to be out in the public eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, there was a bit of a riot there. A group of the rowdier prisoners made a fuss, and they couldn't hold the gates very well. They had to try to catch a lot of the people. I think we were just lucky that they weren't allowed to use anything too strong at the gates. Tasers and tranquilizers, I think.  The problem was when a few of us managed to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few of you? Who else got out?\" Javier was clearly a little shaken this time, nervous at the idea of having other prisoners out and loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of dogs, a ferret, and some bird, I think. I wasn't paying too much attention when I ran, and I can't say I really knew them too well.\" Likax shook his head as he leaned against the wall, swallowing quietly. \"Anyways, I managed to get a decent distance away. I had run most of it. I mean, I'm not the best, but I had spent most of the day dashing, so I thought I was safe. Found a decent spot, and tried to get some rest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something happen then?\" You couldn't help but notice him tense a little. His fur was a little on end, and his tail shifted a little as he looked out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I managed to get a full night alone, but they found me early on in the morning. By then, they had managed to pull out stronger stuff. Few people with guns, some smoke... I just ran in the opposite direction. I think they didn't have a chance to surround me, but I still got hit a few times. I was injured pretty badly, so I just tried to get out. I managed to lose them after a bit of a cliff, and... Well... I think you know the rest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier stood up a little, gripping the arm of his chair a little tightly. \"Not really... There's a lot of stuff that I don't know. I'm not the one that found you. I suppose Carson can fill me in on a few things. But... I've got something important to ask right now.\" He swallowed before looking right at him, Likax turning his head with a questioning look. </span></div></div>",

The tension in the air felt thick and blanketing.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, uncomfortable pause, you stood up, putting yourself in between Javier and Likax and sticking out your hands. \"All right, Javier, listen. Likax has had enough trauma for one day, and --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feel of a soft paw pad on top of your hand stopped you. Likax had stood up as well, his eyes soft and concerned. \"No, Carson, it's okay. You both have a right to know.\" He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, then opened them again. \"To answer your question, Javier... Yes, the people running the prison did do odd things to me-- to all of us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier nodded, as if Likax had just confirmed what he had suspected all along. \"What kind of things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax sighed deeply. \"Pretty much every weird thing you could imagine, and then more. Originally, it was just typical product testing, making sure hair products or food and drugs were safe before they were released to 'the public', I guess. But after my first two or three months there, a strange man in a white lab coat came in and told me that they had 'found some special markers in my genetic makeup that made me an ideal candidate,' and I got pulled for an isolated experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isolated?\" You frowned. That particular word jumped out at you, sounding so harsh, so unfair. You pictured in your mind the poor bobcat, wasting away in a dark cell all day, every day, only being pulled out for some crackpot scientists to probe him and run their tests. A shiver went down your spine as anger started to seethe in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier, however, seemed less empathetic for the bobcat and more curious about the nature of the experiment. \"But what exactly did they do to you? What all were they testing for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax sat back down on the couch, slumping his shoulders a little. \"The procedures themselves were fairly mild, as far as I could tell at the time. They simply chained me to a steel chair in a small square room, which was empty and painted white save for a full-length mirror on the wall I was facing. I would be left there for thirty or forty-five minutes at a time. They never told me what they were trying to discover. But I began to piece things together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you figure out?\" you asked, sitting down next to him, brushing against his tail with your hand accidentally (or so you told yourself).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I started getting suspicious when I noticed my fur, skin, and whiskers were all tingling during every session. It started out small; I thought it was just nerves or something. But it kept getting more and more intense as the months went by. Eventually, I couldn't even hear my own thoughts during these procedures, and afterwards, I would be sick and temporarily unaware of my surroundings. I knew they were doing something horrible to me, I just didn't know what. Once the riots started, as soon as my cell got unlocked, I snuck down to the white room to look for clues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Javier asked with some doubt evident in his voice. \"Why didn't you just make a break for it while you had the chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax shrugged, a small grin appearing on his face, the first time he had smiled since mentioning prison. \"Why else? I was curious. I'm a cat; what can I say? I wanted-- no, I needed to know what they were doing to me and why. So, while all the prison guards dealt with the other prisoners at the gate, I stealthily picked the lock to the white room, picked up the steel chair\u2026 and threw it through the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I wouldn't exactly call that stealthy,\" you said, completely engrossed in Likax's story. \"Why destroy the mirror?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was nothing else in the room. No secret doors, no hidden cameras or sensors. The only thing I could think of was to break the mirror. And I'm sure glad I did. On the other side, there was a huge machine with three large coils hooked up to a series of incredibly powerful-looking computers. The half-a-dozen screens in that room displayed an overwhelming amount of data, and I couldn't decipher it at first. But then I saw it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saw what?\" You were on the edge of your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax leaned forward, his head now inches from yours. \"I'm not much of a science buff, but I recognize a double helix when I see it, especially when it has my name and picture underneath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier had been pacing the room, listening intently while trying to avoid looking at the bobcat. At these last words, though, he spun around. \"You think they were doing something with your DNA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax shrugged. \"I don't know exactly what they were doing. I don't know how or why, or even if they considered themselves successful in what they did. I don't even truly know who 'they' are. But I discovered that day something truly terrifying. There were other anthros who...\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat stopped, the words stuck in his throat. He closed his eyes and swallowed slowly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What do you mean?\" Javier leaned against the wall, eyebrows raised. \"They weren't as lucky? What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax started speaking slower and more hesitatingly. \"I wasn't the only one who they had been running those same experiments on. The computers were hooked up to a network with a database of hundreds of anthros who had been experimented on at the same prison during the past decade. It also showed surveillance video from over two dozen other white rooms like mine. Most were empty. But some...\" The bobcat swallowed hard. You could tell the wounds were still fresh; it pained him to recount these memories. \"...some had been... Their bodies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax looked down to the ground, suddenly overcome with sadness. You reached out your hand and placed it on his shoulder, attempting to comfort him. He kept his head down, leaning it against your chest, and he sighed. You could tell he was on the verge of tears. Every cell inside you ached for him, longing to hold this poor, young, mistreated feline in your arms, gently rubbing his fur and making him feel better. Maybe, someday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you, Javier kept pressing on, persistent as ever. \"What bodies? What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat tilted his head up, his moist eyes looking straight into yours. \"I can't... I mean, I do want to tell you two. But... please, not today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even give it a second thought. Nodding, you stood up, sending a sharp glare toward your roommate. \"Enough, Javier. We'll talk more about it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Carson--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" You stuck your hand out, motioning for him to stop, your voice soft but firm. \"Tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier looked at you with concern, but finally rolled his eyes. \"Fine. Whatever.\" He turned around, storming off into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel torn in two. Part of you wanted to tell Javier to screw off, that he was being an ass and needed to show some basic compassion, like any good doctor would. But, deep down inside, you knew your roommate too well, and he had earned your trust. If something was troubling him, it probably deserved your attention.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's pissed at me.\" Likax sighed, the depression in his wide eyes only growing. \"I should probably get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" You leaned over the side of the side of the couch, doing your best to smile, despite the circumstances. \"Javier's just wanting to make sure everyone's safe, including you. He can get a little worked up sometimes, though, and miss the big picture. Don't worry, I'll talk to him and iron things out. But you're staying here with us tonight, no question. That's something I will not budge on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax didn't respond immediately, mulling the situation over, his eyes looking past your face as he did. Finally, he stood up, walked around the couch, and stopped directly in front of you. \"Carson... I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hell with it, you thought. You reached out and grabbed Likax's paw, holding it in your hand for a moment. You rubbed your thumbs on the soft flesh of his paw pads, loving how warm they felt. Then, taking a deep breath, you leaned forward and gently kissed the bobcat on his furry cheek. It was only a quick peck, but it enough to leave him wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson!\" he gasped, a hint of excitement in his voice. \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it too much?\" you asked, afraid for a moment that you had crossed a boundary which you probably shouldn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax stared at you, his eyes starting to sparkle. \"...Not at all.\" He reached his paw up to your face, brushing the back of it against your cheek. He then leaned forward and kissed you, slower this time and on the lips. You closed your eyes and savored the moment, your heart nearly leaping out of your chest. It was all happening so fast, but it felt so perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Likax broke free from the kiss, leaned his head on your shoulder, and wrapped his arms around you in a warm embrace, you notice something kinda strange. You remember that before, in the forest, he had stood about half a foot shorter than you. Now, though, the bobcat was able to look you in the eye without having to tilt his head up or stand on his tiptoes at all; he seemed to be almost exactly your height. Your gaze travelled down his naked back to his jeans, which had gone from baggy and loose to nearly skin-tight (or fur-tight, you supposed) and about to burst off. Javier was right; he had definitely gotten bigger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you started to worry, but then as you looked back at Likax's warm, passionate smile, you realized that you had nothing to be afraid of. It didn't matter if he was a prison escapee; it didn't matter that he seemed to have miraculously come back from the dead, and it certainly didn't matter if he grew to be seven feet tall or even seventy. You knew somehow that you could trust Likax, and that the two of you would protect each other for as long as you physically were able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back from you, Likax smiled, staying silent for a moment. Finally, he tilted his head to the side and said, \"Well, if I'm gonna stay here tonight, is it alright if I go ahead and take a shower? My fur has been all sweaty and matted for far too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you grinned, \"upstairs, second door on the left. Towels are under the sink, and the green soap is mine; feel free to use that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He gave you one more quick peck on the lips, his paw lingering on your chest for a few seconds longer, then headed up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your legs turn to rubber as the bobcat left the room. Did that really just happen, you thought. Did that sexy feline really just accept your advances, kissing you passionately in return? Was it all just a dream, or was it reality?\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered, your skin tingling with excitement. Whatever happened next, no matter how things ended up, you knew that this day would rank at the top of your list for years to come.</span></div></div>",

You feel betrayed by this and we\u2019re about to bust in and proclaim your outrage but then you see it. The longer they kiss the more you see Javier starts to have to tilt his head up, it seems almost like he is deflating not only growing shorter but loosing mass too, that mass seems to be transferred into muscle and hight for Likax as he shoots up to 6\u20193\u201d mid kiss. All the  while his biceps seem to bulge out more, his pecs puss out of his chest creating a small shelf and his legs seem to thicken slightly. Supprized by this all you can do is watch with your jaw hanging open, slightly aroused by what you see, then the next thing he dose surprises you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Likax opens  his mouth more and more as the kiss continues slowly engulfing Javier\u2019s head until his head is completely inside Likaxs mouth. At this point you realize Likax is swollowing Javier moving his mouth over your friends neck and pushing him in further then lifting his head up to allow gravity to assist bringing Javier to Likax\u2019s belly. You watch as a grin creeps over Likax\u2019s open maw as the outline of your friends head is slowly making his way down Likax\u2019s  throat. Javier is pulled further in up to his now slightly flatter chest each gulp from Likax pulling Javier in more and more, once you see Javier is up to his waist in Likax Javier begins to panic as if he is suddenly brought to his senses and starts kicking his legs. Too little to late you think as Likax grabs Javier\u2019s legs and starts pushing him the rest of the way in. After a minute you shake out of your stupor and see in horror as your friends form is pushing at the walls of Likax\u2019s belly while Likax is sitting down, head tilted up moaning in pleasure, rubbing his full stomach. Slowly the movements in Likax stomach slow to a hault as his bloated belly begins to shrink leaving a 6 pack and in its place. Likax shouts \u201coh yes finally you tasted so good, and now you are nothing but proteins for my muscles, just how people like you deserve to be.\u201d With that Likax grows to 6\u201d3\u2019 and all his muscles expand making him look like a Olympic athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose your balance and fall, pushing the door open and landing on you face in the bathroom. Looking up you see Likax with a big grin on his face as flexes his huge bicep and says </span></div></div>",

You swallowed, and shook your head a little, trying to shake off the feelings. While you had certainly gotten eager at the idea of Likax staying around, this wasn't the best time for it. There were other things that had to be taken care of first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the kitchen, sighing a bit as you began to move in. Javier was standing next to the doorway, clearly still listening in on the conversation that you were having. He shook his head, and simply stared at you for a moment. \"He sure calmed down fast... What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gave him a bit of support.\" You tried your best not to blush as you spoke, and though Javier looked suspiciously at you, there were other things on your mind. \"Look, I'll explain later. What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? I think knowing what happened to a few hundred anthros is rather important!\" Javier was trying to keep calm, but his voice was clearly starting to lose its composure. \"Whatever happened to them is bad, but that's all we know. They might've died from some injury, or might've had to get put down... Whatever they did, it's pretty clear they were willing to keep on doing it to more anthros. I don't know about you, but whatever it is, it certainly didn't sound good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean you should be pushing Likax for it right now, though.\" You tried to keep your voice calm as you spoke. \"I know it's important, but we're not going to get anything if we end up driving him away, or making him panic, or something.\" You could hear the shower starting to run as you spoke, trying not to think about Likax too much as you spoke. \"After what happened to him, do you really think he's going to be in any condition to remember what happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He needs to eventually.\" Javier snapped a little at you. \"Look, I know he's not in the best condition, and normally, I'd suggest that he just take a few days to rest. But this is hardly a normal situation. I don't even know why he's still alive, and it's clear that something weird's going on here. Right now, if we don't find out everything we can, we're in trouble. There's no guarantee that Likax is going to stay healthy. For all we know, he could drop dead at any moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But he's unlikely to die, right? I mean, you said his heart stopped, but somehow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. I have no idea what's going on. There are a lot of things that can be going on. We only know a few things right now, and it's essential that we find out everything we can if we want to make sure he's going to stay in one piece.\" Javier sat on one of the stools you had in the kitchen, pulling out one of his notebooks and scribbling something down on it. He always seemed to carry around at least three or four of them, and seemed to jot down notes whenever he had a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You did your best to keep calm, trying to peek over his shoulders. \"What are you writing in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we know so far. I don't want to forget something important.\" He turned to glance at you as he started jotting down a few things. \"So far, all we've got is his story, and the fact that his body's definitely weird. He had no pulse, but he somehow recovered on his own. On top of that, he's grown a little bit, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than a little. I got a good look. You're right... He's definitely bigger now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Besides that... How long ago did you find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a fair bit of time to try to catch Javier up on everything. You had to explain where you found him, and how you had brought him back. His notepad remained untouched while you spoke, but he went back to when you finished.

The inkling of a smile formed on his face. \"Go ahead and check on him,\" he said, grabbing his laptop, which was sitting on the counter nearby. \"I'm gonna check online and see if I can find out anything more about anthros in federal prisons. Maybe that'll help us understand Likax a bit better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Just make sure to take everything you read with a grain of salt. There's a lot of hostile sentiment towards anthros on the internet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Carson.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Javier flipped open the computer, you stepped out of the kitchen towards the staircase, slowly making your way up. The bathroom door at the top was closed three-quarters of the way, the light still on inside, and you could hear the sound of the blow dryer running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likax?\" you called out as you gently rapped on the door. \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blow dryer shut off, and a few seconds later the door opened, the bobcat's now-clean face smiling at you from inside. His fur looked much more soft and fresh than before, still a little damp, and he had a towel wrapped around his waist. \"Hey, Carson. I was wondering...\" He looked down at his feetpaws for a moment, a little shy or embarrassed about something, you weren't sure what. \"...I kinda need to borrow some clothes, if you have anything that you think would fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you nodded. Glancing past Likax, you noticed the dirty jeans he had been wearing earlier now sat wadded up on the floor. They seemed to have some newly-developed rips along the hips and upper inseam, the result of a suddenly-too-big feline unsuccessfully trying to squeeze into them, you guessed. You made sure the smile didn't leave your face as you made eye contact with Likax again, but you noticed he now was looking down at you, having grown a couple inches taller during the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought about broaching the subject, asking him if he had any idea of what was causing his growth. After how the conversation earlier in the living room, however, you didn't want to make Likax any more uncomfortable than necessary. If he didn't bring it up on his own, then, at least for now, you weren't going to pry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what we have in my dresser,\" you said as you stepped back into the hall, motioning for Likax to follow. The two of you headed into your bedroom. You made sure to leave the door open behind you so as not to give off the wrong impression (or to leave any room for your own temptation). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you entered, though, you wished you hadn't, or at least had cleaned up a little beforehand. Dirty clothes were strewn about the floor, some in a small pile on the bed, and a few hanging off of a chair. The laundry basket was (ironically enough) filled with clean clothes, not yet having been put away after you had washed them a couple days ago. Several books formed a stack on the bedside table, and the books that were on a bookshelf had been thrown up there haphazardly, without any rhyme or reason. Dozens of loose papers and notebooks covered the large wooden desk on the opposite wall from the door, the fragments of writings you had done for school or for pleasure. You felt much more comfortable with the disorganized state of the room than you did with a spotless room like Javier's. It allowed you to breathe in all the miscellany of your life and be as creative as possible. Unfortunately, as you now began to fear, it didn't exactly give off the best first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax, though, seemed unfazed by the mess, even impressed, whistling a little as he walked in. \"Wow. I like this room,\" he said, no trace of sarcasm apparent in his voice. He walked over to your desk, glancing down at the papers. \"You're a writer?\" he asked as he put his paw on one of the notebooks, then quickly removed it, a guilty look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can look, it's okay,\" you assured him. \"But yes, I'm actually minoring in Creative Writing at Centre. I've been writing short stories and poetry since I can remember being able to hold a pen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive!\" The bobcat exclaimed, his eyes lit up. Shuffling a few more papers around, he started smirking at you. \"You do it all by hand? Don't you own a computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" you shook your head as you sat down on the edge of your bed. \"Javier lets me use his laptop when I need to, but I found back in high school that when I sit down at a keyboard and try to write, I'll inevitably get distracted and end up wasting an hour on Facebook or Wikipedia or whatever. It's better if I just don't give myself that temptation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax brought his paw to his chin, nodding in thoughtful contemplation. \"That makes sense,\" he said. \"Limiting yourself can open up a lot of possibilities, interestingly enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" you said, smiling. \"My favorite English teacher, Mrs. Vincent, always would say that if all you have is a blank page and a pen, your imagination can roam free, going wherever it wants to. Adding tools like computers to the process only serves to put up fences for your thoughts, keeping you boxed in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax grinned at this mental image, then sat down on the far side of the bed from you. \"Ever get anything published?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, running your hand against the back of your neck. \"Nothing major. A couple of book reviews in the Centro -- that's the student paper here. When I was 9, I had one of my short stories featured in the kid's magazine Stone Soup. And... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Likax asked, scooting a little closer to you with a curious smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing started to quicken as you considered whether or not you should tell the bobcat about your poem. THE poem. The one that had spawned from so much heartbreak in your life a few years ago. On one hand, he'd probably appreciate the message you intended; then again, you didn't think it was particularly good writing, and the whole idea behind it seemed cheesy and embarrassing now in retrospect. Likax might even think you were pandering to him and his current situation. \"Nothing,\" you finally said. \"That's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax persisted, though, placing his still-damp paw on your shoulder. \"C'mon, Carson,\" he said with a supportive smile, \"I can tell that you're holding something back. I'm not gonna let you just leave whatever it is hanging in the air like this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up into his wide-open eyes, which were reflecting the room's light and had a bit of a sparkle to them. You felt your insides beginning to twist with the decision you faced. Did you trust the bobcat enough yet to share the deepest, darkest place inside your heart?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A snow leopard, actually. I guess I have a thing for felines.\" You finally turned to look into Likax's eyes, the hint of a wry smile appearing despite your glum expression as the bobcat blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Likax appeared to be thinking something, but he didn't ask any questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" you continued, lying on your back and looking up at the ceiling fan, \"I did spiral pretty far into depression right after he died, but writing the poem actually helped me get start to get out of that funk. I didn't really intend it to be seen by anyone else, but I trusted Mrs. Vincent, my English teacher, enough to show it to her, and she urged me to enter it into a state poetry contest the school participated in. I finally gave in, submitting under a pen name. Two months later, I got a notice in the mail that it had won first prize and was going to be published in the Courier-Journal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax looked down at his feetpaws, his ears twitching. When you said the newspaper's name, though, his head suddenly shot back up and he turned to look at you. \"Wait!\" he exclaimed, \"was your pen name Tomas Kinyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart skip a couple of beats when he said the name. \"Uh... yeah. How did you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your poem, it was titled 'Shining in the Stream'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back up, your jaw dropping in amazement. \"Wha-- Where did-- How--?\" You had trouble putting into words the sudden rush of emotions that had just come upon you, and were left speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax stood up and shook his head in amazement. \"This is unbelievable! Simply incredible! I never thought--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also jumped to your feet and eyed the bobcat as he paced back and forth in your bedroom. \"Likax! What's going on here? How the hell did you know the name of my poem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to you, a wide grin on his muzzle. \"Be right back!\" he exclaimed, running out of the room. You stood there, partially frozen in shock, your mind still trying to put everything together. After twenty seconds, Likax burst back into the room, holding the jeans he had been wearing that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how much your poem meant to me while I was in prison.\" He pulled out something from the back pocket. It looked like a laminated piece of paper, seemingly folded hundreds of times and worn from heavy use. \"I always kept it on me, reading it literally every day that I was locked up in that hellhole. I-- It kept me going, gave me hope when I thought about giving up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the paper to you. Sure enough, it was your poem, clipped out from the newspaper, slightly yellowed with age. You read the first lines again, which you hadn't looked at since you started college. \"I can't believe this,\" you said, not able to hold back your tears any longer, your face becoming wet. \"Why did you keep it? What about it struck you so deeply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's eyes had also started to moisten. \"I was so overcome with the feelings you poured onto the page, and how much you obviously loved your lost anthro friend... I still cry every single time I read it, Carson.\" He reached out his paw and touched your cheek. \"'Tears mixing with blood in the stream, wand'ring alone in the red angry night,'\" Likax quoted the final lines of your poem by memory. \"'Until skin and fur reunite once again, my soul's only quest is for your inner light.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned away from Likax and stared out the window, watching the sun begin to set behind the bluegrass-covered hills, not sure what to think. As proud as your parents (and Mrs. Vincent) had been when you had gotten the poem published, you had never thought it to be one of your finer works, too personal and much more wrought with emotions than you preferred your writing to be. And once your high school classmates found out about it, you quickly were labeled a \"fur-fag\" and shunned by the majority of the class. But now, there stood before you someone who your writing had truly touched, who wasn't just telling you something you wanted to hear but actually had taken the poem to heart, even going as far as to commit it to memory. By far, this was the most thrilling moment of your history as a writer, but for some reason you couldn't bring yourself to appreciate it as much as you should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax walked up behind you and gently placed his paw on your shoulder. \"I knew that if there was even just one human out there,\" he continued as he gently took back the poem from your hand, \"who cared so much about an anthro as the author of this poem did, then I still had a reason to live, if only to hope to meet him. I just never dreamed that I'd ever get that chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, and the two of you stared into each other's eyes for some time. Everything that had happened today seemed just too astonishing to be mere coincidence.  You didn't believe in fate, but something seemed to have brought the two of you together in the woods today, and whatever the reason or cause, you were grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you finally choked out, \"I'm glad that someone got as much out of reading that poem as I did from writing it.\" A chuckle managed to break through your clenched throat. \"I gotta say, Likax... I'm touched that it meant so much to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Likax stepped closer and wrapped his arms around you, holding you close. He even lifted you up a few inches off the ground, leaving no doubt in your mind that he was continuing to grow. When he noticed your feet were dangling in midair, he quickly sat you back down to the ground, stepping back a few feet. \"Oops,\" he said, a sheepish grin appearing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" you said, grateful for both the change in mood and the opportunity to ask a burning question. \"So, uh.... I guess since it's come up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've noticed it too?\" Likax asked, his eyes appearing slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda hard to miss. You're almost a foot taller than when I first saw you in the woods.\" His ears started to droop, and you patted him on the back reassuringly. \"It's okay, though. I'm not saying it's bad that you're bigger; I'm just curious. Do you have any idea how it happened? Was this something...\" You caught yourself before you mentioned the experiments, but Likax was too clever to miss where you were heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat closed his eyes and sighed, shaking his head. \"I have no idea what's happening,\" he admitted. \"And, no, this didn't occur at all during my time in prison, as far as I can remember. I've always been a bit on the scrawny side, so it's a major change for me. Maybe I shouldn't be complaining,\" he opened his eyes and looked back at you, a mischievous (and, you thought, sexy) smile forming, \"but it kinda makes it hard to fit into my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes! Right!\" You rushed over to the dresser, opening up a drawer. \"That's what we came in here for, wasn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax leaned against the wall and chuckled, his eyes still full of mirth. \"It'd be helpful. Unless you want me to just wear a towel around the house all day. Or less.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your tongue and continued foraging through your dresser. Most of the clothes you had were now a little too small for Likax, but you finally pulled out a white tank top that had always hung loose on your chest, along with a pair of gold nylon shorts that had white vertical stripes on the sides. You handed them to Likax. \"Try these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Likax said, heading back to the bathroom to change. You moved the dirty clothes off the desk chair and sat down, still overcome with the events of the day, your imagination running wild with what the near future could bring. A minute later, you heard the bathroom door open, and Likax walked back into the room. The clothes were a perfect fit (for now), the elastic waistband still stretchy enough to accommodate the growing bobcat, and the snug shirt form-fitting around his toned chest muscles. You certainly thought he was attractive before, but now, especially dressed in your clothes, he was downright irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you stood up, adjusting your pants as you did so, \"so what do you want to do for the rest of the evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Likax thought for a moment, \"we should stay inside, for tonight at least, until we've come up with a master plan for what to do. But in the meantime, I was thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't help but pause as you heard him say it. \"My writing? There's really not too much like what you know...\" You couldn't help feeling a little encouraged, but you certainly didn't want Likax to see something too different. \"I told you that the poem was an exception, right? I don't usually write stuff like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still want to see, though!\" His expression was still clearly excited, and he was trying to peek around the room, looking around your room for any bits of paper that were lying around. You shook your head, trying to collect the bits and pieces that were laying around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... I'm not really organized...\" You shook your head a little bit, blushing as you wondered if it was worth showing him. \"I think most of the finished stuff is in my binder...\" You sighed a little bit, quietly stuffing the papers into a drawer before digging through your backpack. \"I usually carry that around with me. If you really want to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" You jumped a little as you noticed him standing right behind you, eagerly looking over your shoulder as you dug through. His ears were shifting in his excitement, and he leaned in closer, his hands on your shoulders as you looked. You just chuckled and smiled as you managed to pull it out, doing your best not to let your state happiness show too obviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up before holding the binder out in front of him. It wasn't that thick, but it was a rather nice one, covered in a bit of fabric and cleaned up a bit. It wasn't too much but hopefully, it was enough for him to look through. \"Here. I know it's not that much, but I think it's most of the stuff that's really finished. I've got a lot of scattered works in progress, but most of it doesn't make too much sense yet.\" He seemed to grow a wide grin as you handed the binder to him. When you let go, he happily held it in his arms, and you almost thought the room would be shaking when you saw him bouncing around a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" He smiled as he cracked it open, sitting back on your bed without a moment's pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, easy! You just showered, you don't want my clothes against your or something!\" You tried to shift it off of your bed, tugging a little as you tried to get things clear enough for him to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. After everything that's happened, getting a little filthy won't be a huge deal.\" He smiled at you as he leaned back against the wall of your room, shifting up and starting to glance at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mostly just some short stories. I'm better at them then at poetry... Half the time, I end up digging through a thesaurus when I'm writing a poem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head as he looked at you. \"It's what you end up choosing in the end that really shows, not how you got there.\" He just let his eyes glance at you for a moment, before they shifted back into your writing. \"Really, how come you don't have anything made by a formal publisher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still learning the details. There are still bits and pieces that I need to work on, and I don't want to really submit something until I'm ready. Until then, it's mostly been small stuff.\" You smiled a little to yourself as you saw his eyes dart line to line, reading a little faster than you thought he could. He seemed content, and you let a few moments pass by silently. You watched his eyes move steadily, his body steadily rising and falling with each breath. It was amazing to think that he was close to dying less than a few hours ago, when he was so calm and relaxed now.  When you were certain that he was deep into the text, you turned and started to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Carson?\" You turned back to look, and his eyes had broken from the papers, looking back up at you. \"D-do you mind keeping me company while I read?\" He seemed to shift a little bit, sitting up straight as he looked right at you. You couldn't help but smile, and part of you certainly wanted to stay with him. Still, there were things you had to take care of, and Javier would be too distracted to make dinner. You took a few moments to decide, before responding...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Likax's eyes lit up in excitement as you nodded your head, and you could hear him start to purr softly. After a few moments, though, the purring was replaced by a low growling sound. The bobcat looked down at his stomach, then looked back up at you, his eyes wide in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" he mumbled, smirking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against the doorframe and smiled. \"Somebody's hungry,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Likax admitted. \"I haven't really eaten anything in over twenty-four hours.\" As if to drive the point home, his stomach growled again, this time louder. \"But that's okay!\" he quickly added. \"I can wait 'till later to eat! I really want to see more of your writing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout this,\" you countered, feeling a little hungry yourself, \"I'll go downstairs and place an order for pizza, and then I'll come back up and we can read while we wait for it to be delivered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat's whiskers twitched at the word 'pizza'. \"A-are you sure?\" he asked a bit timidly. \"I mean, I don't have any way to pay for my share...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay?!\" You shook your head fervently. \"Don't mention that word! You're my guest; I'll take care of you, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson...\" Likax closed his eyes, and you noticed his tail had started to wag slightly. He looked like he wanted to protest, but he simply bowed his head in humble gratitude. \"Thank you, Carson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked so cute, so adorable right now (despite his steadily-growing stature), that you couldn't resist. Stepping directly in front of him, you leaned forward and kissed his forehead, quickly pulling back and smiling playfully. He looked up at you with an expression of befuddlement that quickly turned into a cheesy grin as you left the room without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran down the stairs with a hop in your step, rounding the corner into the kitchen. Javier still sat at the counter, staring straight at the laptop with an intent look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Javier, I'm gonna order us all some pizzas for dinner,\" you said as you grabbed the Danville yellow pages from the desk underneath the kitchen phone. \"What kind of topping do you prefer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't respond, and you looked over to see his eyes were still fixated on the screen. You waited a few seconds for him to say something, but he didn't move. \"Javier?\" you repeated, a little louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw you staring at him, waiting for an answer. \"Hm? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you indicated the phone book you were flipping through. \"Pizza, Javier. My dime. What kind do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, anything's fine,\" Javier said. That answer told you he wasn't really listening, as Javier was notoriously picky with his pizza, not eating anything but plain cheese pizza with light sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat the phone book down and walked up to the counter. \"What's going on, man? I've lived with you for too long to miss out on when something's bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier sighed softly, then flipped around the laptop to show you what he had been reading. It was a article from the Louisville Free-Fur Press, the anthro community biweekly newspaper you recognized from your hometown. It was dated over a year ago, and in big block letters the headline screamed \"Anthro Teen Arrested During Rally.\" The picture was of a bobcat in a crowd composed mostly of other anthros, being handcuffed and led away by two human police officers. Though the photo wasn't the best quality, you could clearly identify the face of your new feline friend, and the caption identified him by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's this? Where did you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier rolled his eyes. \"I know how to do a Google search, Carson. This was near the top of the results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the beginning of the article aloud. \"'A planned peaceful demonstration for anthro rights at Waterfront Park today turned ugly when a group of human counter-protesters started heckling some of the presenters who were on stage. One speaker, seventeen-year-old bobcat Likax Rufallo, president of the Young Furs of Kentucky organization, confronted the hecklers during the speech, which after a heated exchange of words finally escalated into an all-out brawl.'\" You stopped reading the article and looked up at Javier, a bit confused. \"Young Furs of Kentucky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"I've never heard of the group either. Apparently, they're some kind of activist group for anthro teenagers whose M.O. is staging controversial events like this that either fall flat on their face or attract a lot of attention, like this one apparently did. They have a pretty barebones website; not a lot of information to be found on them, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you continued with the article. \"'Police officers quickly arrived on the scene to break up the fight, arresting Rufallo and quickly removing him from the park grounds. They later charged him with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of instigation to violence. Eyewitness on the scene, though, say that while Rufallo's rhetoric was intense, he never threatened violence or called for it, and that the only fighting he did during the brawl was in self-defense.'\" Groaning in disgust, you flipped the laptop back around to Javier. \"I don't want to read anymore,\" you sighed. \"It sounds like he was completely set-up to be caught, and that his charges were all fabricated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier nodded. \"Remember, this is a paper that has a stated political agenda. Still, I can't believe the police would keep him locked up for a year on charges this flimsy. I wonder if something else happened that never got reported.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see any other articles or mentions of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Javier went back to looking at the computer as he talked. \"Only a few other anthro papers in the region picking up this same article, and the Young Furs site I mentioned also listed him as a past president. Other than that, though, nothing. Not even a mention of a trial. It's almost like they locked him up right away and threw away the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't surprise you. While Louisville had a more progressive attitude towards anthros than the rest of Kentucky (or the South, for that matter), there were still plenty of reports floating around of police misconduct and brutality in the anthro community. You could easily picture a bad cop or a crooked judge fixing the system so that Likax would never get a fair trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" you said after you thought about it for a moment, \"I don't want you saying anything about this to Likax tonight. Please. I want him to enjoy the rest of the evening. We can talk to him about it some more tomorrow, after he's gotten a good night's rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it,\" Javier's voice was flat and a bit annoyed. \"But that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop researching and finding out as much as possible about him and his story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You stopped speaking, leaving the discussion at that. After picking up the phone and placing the order (two large pizzas, one all cheese and one with The Works), you turned back to the stairs and headed up to your room, excited to be back with the bobcat once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Likax was still sitting on your bed reading, and when you opened the door, he looked up at you, beaming ecstatically. You couldn't help but notice that his clothing seemed a tiny bit tighter than before, a hair's width of the bobcat's furry stomach now being exposed where the bottom of the tank top no longer could reach. You ignored it for now, eager to answer any questions Likax might have about your stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Carson!\" His eyes were warm and encouraging. \"This is really good stuff! You're certainly a talented writer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a little, you shrugged. \"I do what I can. I don't know if it's really <i>that</i> good, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" He jumped up and walked over to you, the binder still open. He pointed to the currently-open page, the first chapter of a novella about a human boy who had been adopted by two male anthro foxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That?\" you asked, a little surprised. \"I started writing that a couple years back, when I was a freshman. I haven't ever gotten around to finishing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should!\" Likax exclaimed. \"I've read through it three times now, and the characters--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you interrupted him. \"You've read it three times? Just that first chapter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax shook his head, a big grin on his face. \"No, all seven of them! Well, that and the rest of the binder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of-- What?!\" You nearly fell back in surprise. \"That's over a hundred pages! I wasn't gone that long, was I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat chuckled while walking up to you, placing his paw on your shoulder. \"Nah, it was only ten minutes or so. I-- Well, I don't know how to explain it, mostly because I don't really understand it myself, but... I guess I just can read things really fast now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped open as you tried to process what he was saying. \"But, that's nearly impossible! You couldn't comprehend everything that quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Likax smiled proudly and crossed his arms. \"Go ahead. Quiz me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, all right...\" You racked your brain, trying to come up with some detail that <i>you</i> actually remembered from your own writings. \"Okay, how's this: in the short story 'All The King's Unicorns', what's the main character's reason for leaving town at the end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Likax answered, \"Oh, that's easy. He hated himself for how he had behaved at his mother's funeral and how his family had basically disowned him because of that behavior, so he was going to make a new life across the country. I kinda teared up during that one, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't imagine how he'd have time for tears, you thought, if he read it as quickly as he said he did. \"That's right,\" you said, smiling but still amazed. \"How 'bout a tougher one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought a little harder. \"Okay, here goes: the third chapter of <i>Fathers' Paw</i> has the main character, Jeremiah, getting tormented by a guy at his school. What's the bully's name?\" You were sure that Likax wouldn't be able to answer this question. The bully's name was only mentioned once in the story; the only reason you knew it off the top of your head was because you'd named him after a particular jerk from high school that stuck in your mind somewhat prominently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax brought his paw to his chin, glancing up in thought for only a moment, before finally looking straight into your eyes with determination. \"Charlie. He didn't have a last name, I believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whistled in amazement. \"Wow, Likax. Okay, I believe you; you read it all! But how could you possibly do that so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat shrugged, a silly smile on his face. \"I have no clue! I wasn't able to do it before. Maybe it's related to my sudden growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense, you thought, in a weird, completely nonsensical way. \"Well, I guess you don't really need my--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no no no no!\" Likax placed his arm around your shoulder, squeezing it tight and gently guiding you to the bed. \"I'd still love it if you'd be able to answer some questions for me. And, if you don't mind, I have a couple of things I think could be changed to make some of the stories even better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thirty minutes flew by in a flash as you went over two dozen or so pages of your writing, Likax asking about things he wasn't sure he had interpreted correctly, and also pointing out some lines of dialogue that didn't work or small inconsistencies in your stories' logic. You couldn't help but be amazed by how well he understood and appreciated your writing style, how much the two of you were on the same page, and how his suggestions for improvements were always spot-on. In the back of your mind, you couldn't decide what role you wanted Likax to fill more: your editor, or your lover. Perhaps both, you finally said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seemingly no time at all, you heard the sound of the doorbell ringing. Looking out the window, you saw the car with the pizza company's sign on top of it. Likax jumped up off the bed, his feetpaws landing on the floor with a loud THUD, and headed for the door. \"Pizza!!\" he cried out, with all the enthusiasm of a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Likax,\" you said, loving his excitement but also concerned. \"Why don't you stay up here while I answer the door and pay for the pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tilted his head for a moment, looking at you questioningly, but suddenly got what you were saying. \"Oh... right. For a moment, I guess I kinda forgot I was a... well, you know... a wanted fugitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you stepped out of the room. \"I'll call you down when the coast is clear.\" As you closed the door most of the way, you couldn't help but think of what would happen if someone <i>did</i> see Likax in your house. After all, you couldn't hide him forever, especially if his growth didn't eventually stop. You'd have to formulate a plan of action with Likax before things got too far out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not tonight, you decided. Tonight was about recuperation, rest, and relaxation. Paying the delivery woman for the pizzas and giving her a healthy tip, you then closed the door and locked it, watching out the front window until she was back in her car. When she was gone, you decided to let the drapes fall closed and also lower the blinds, blocking any view of the living room from the outside. Satisfied that you would be safe, you turned your head to the stairs and shouted, \"Likax, you can come down now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was filled with the sound of a very large feline running out the door and down the stairs. In no time at all, Likax and you had plopped down on the couch, munching on a slice each. As the spicy scent filled the house, Javier eventually wandered in, grabbing a slice of the cheese and eating while standing. The pizzas soon disappeared, the bobcat devouring two slices for every one you and Javier had. You didn't blame him; finally getting a chance to eat real food after a year of prison cafeteria slop had to be a godsend to the hungry feline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Likax covered his mouth and burped quietly. \"Sorry,\" he apologized sheepishly. He patted his belly, which you noticed now was being covered by even less of his shirt. You hoped that was just because of all the pizza he had just eaten. \"That was the best meal of my life.\" He gazed at you, glowing. \"Thank you so much, Carson and Javier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Likax.\" You glared at Javier, who mumbled the same thing as he sat down on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you sat in silence for a minute, digesting your dinner and starting to feel a little sleepy.</span></div></div>",

He gave his belly a bit of a small pat before sighing and closing his eyes for a moment. He seemed content to lie back, and you couldn't help but smile as you sat next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier was still sitting nearby, but he seemed a little bit distracted as he looked over Likax. He had eaten dinner without as much as a word, and it looked as though he wanted to keep his eyes on the bobcat the entire time. He still seemed a little distracted, but either he trusted Likax enough not to mention it, or he was suspicious enough that he didn't want to bring up anything. After he ate, he had taken a couple of moments to bring his laptop back to the other seat, and was once again tapping on it. You assumed he was still trying to find out more, but from the look of it, he was still drawing some major blanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you felt Likax shift on the couch, his head tilting a little onto your shoulder. His eyes opened, staring at you for a moment. He seemed to glance towards the television every couple of moments, looking over it. You were going to suggest turning it on, maybe just watching what was on. However, as Likax glanced around, it soon became clear that he had something else on his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't feel the need to say a thing. You just watched quietly, chuckling as his gaze turned to the shelf, then back to you, then back onto the shelf again. You remained quiet, but couldn't help as you saw his gaze swap between you and towards the Xbox on the shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let his gaze return to you before speaking. \"Hey, don't look at me. That's Javier's.\" It only took him a moment before his eyes added Javier to their rotation, glancing over him after looking at you. You were busy watching him, a bit amused by the entire thing, and a little surprised that he was still taking the time to keep his eyes on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes before Javier even realized he was being watched, and another couple passed by before he had to ask. \"Well? What is it?\" You just smiled and shook your head as Likax eagerly stared. You tried to catch Javier's eye before nudging towards the shelf. To your surprise, he gave a small laugh as he realized what you were pointing to. \"Yeah, that's fine. The game cabinet's the one on the right.\" Likax nearly pounced at the cabinet upon hearing those words, and you were almost worried he would crash. However, he landed inches from the TV, popping the cabinet door open and glancing through the ones you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you haven't really had a chance to play before?\" You chuckled as you saw him dig through, his tail shifting along as he glanced. He seemed to eventually settle on a fighting game, a claw popping the case open before he managed to get the disk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I had a few part-time jobs before, but I never really had earned enough for anything new.\" He grabbed a couple of the controllers from where they were on top of the console, and in a second, he was back on the couch, dropping one in your lap. \"I was usually at least a few years behind in terms of technology. I can play at a friend's sometimes, but I've been\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Well, away, I suppose\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" You could see his shoulders shift down a little, and you quickly interrupted his train of thought, snapping your fingers in front of him a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of that now, alright?\" It took a moment, and he seemed a little nervous as he sat next to you, but the sound of the game starting quickly drew his attention away. He smiled and gave a quiet nod, getting comfortable and preparing to play with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Today's been a good day\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" He smiled as he gave you a quick glance. You couldn't help but smile back at him. You probably would've spent longer looking at him, if there wasn't something else immediately distracting the two of you. \"Here we go\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 No holding back on me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I may not be the best, but you're really asking for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple of rounds were a massacre. He was taking his time figuring out the controls, and if he was asking for you to really play, you certainly weren't going to argue. You weren't completely focused on the game, but you were still doing well enough to thoroughly beat him down. It only took you a few more rounds before you had noticed that\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of you played for about fifteen minutes, you winning six out of seven matches, before you heard the phone ringing from the kitchen. You paused the game and stood up, knowing it was for you, as anyone calling for Javier would reach him on his cell phone. \"Play for me a bit,\" you said, handing the controller off to your roommate. Turning to Likax, you placed your hand on his shoulder gently. \"I'll be right back.\" As you left, you saw the bobcat watching you out of the corner of his eye, but he turned his attention back to the game once Javier sat aside his laptop and un-paused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the phone on the fourth ring, bringing the receiver to your ear. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" a gruff, unfamiliar voice said. \"Is this the residence of Carson Fischer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, thinking it was a sales call, and began to hang up. Right before you got the chance to, though, the voice said, \"I'm calling about Likax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze, your heart skipping a beat. You considered hanging up anyways, but something inside urged you to keep listening. Still, you couldn't just come out and say that Likax was there; what if the gruff voice was with the police, or they were listening in? You had to say something, though. \"I-I'm sorry, sir, but I d-don't know anyone by that n--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Carson,\" the voice said. \"I'm a friend. I don't have a lot of time to talk, but I need to tell you something. They're close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who's close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice ignored your question. \"You'll be safe in your house tonight, but tomorrow both of you need to leave town. Tell the bobcat that Mujexa wants to meet. He'll know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to say something, but heard a CLICK from the other end, followed by a dial tone. Your mouth still agape, you slowly put the receiver back in the cradle. If what the voice was right and someone bad was close to finding you... you shuddered to think of what could happen to your friend... and to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying your best to put those feelings aside for now, you walked back into the living room. Likax and Javier both were focused on the screen, jamming on the buttons on the controller. \"Who was that?\" Javier asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was-- a wrong number.\" You tried your best to hide your nervousness, sitting back down next to Likax, your heart still racing. Being close to the bobcat again, though, made you feel better, and you started to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier, however, could tell that you were hiding something. As the round ended, he glanced over at you, a bit worried, but kept quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Likax pumped his arm into the air, his face lighting up in jubilation. You looked at the screen, which showed the record now stood at seven wins for you and Javier, with five for Likax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Javier!\" You turned your head his way with a surprised smirk. \"I told you to play for me, not to just let Likax start wailing on my fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Javier responded defensively, \"I played my heart out! He's just really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been playing for all of twenty minutes, Javier.\" You rolled your eyes as he passed the controller back to you. \"You've had this game for two years!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, he picked back up his laptop, a perturbed look on his face. He muttered something in Portuguese under his breath, which you weren't about to ask him to translate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started playing again, though, you realized that he might have been right. As soon as the round started, Likax's character rushed at you with a flying kick, knocking yours down. The white-clad fighter on the screen leapt into the air and landed on your shirtless samurai warrior, pummeling him with his nunchucks, taking down your health nearly halfway, then quickly jumped back up to his feet. As you tried to lunge out and strike with your character's katana, Likax quickly dodged your attack and delivered another knockdown blow, leaving you with only a sliver of health. You didn't stand a chance from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the rounds faired similarly. At first, you though you might be getting tired, your reflexes slowing, but when you looked over to the bobcat's paws, they seemed to be moving at a faster-than-possible rate, him anticipating your every move and pressing the corresponding buttons to counter before you had even started your attacks. After playing for five minutes, Likax had swept four matches, three of which he didn't even lose any health during, earning a perfect score. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see what I told you?\" Javier motioned to the screen as it pulled the record up again, Likax now leading nine to seven. \"I think he's been hustling us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's eyes went wide with surprise as his ears started to shift downward. \"No!\" he protested. \"I've wanted to play this game for a while but never got the chance to until today. I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you said, an idea coming to you, \"let's see how you fare against other people.\" You exited back to the menu screen, choosing an online match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax turned to you with a pleading look. \"But...\" he started, \"I've never played a video game online before. I don't want to beat people I've never met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This game's over two years old,\" Javier stated. \"The only ones left playing it online are the truly dedicated and hardcore. If you can beat any of these loons, I'd be shocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax slouched down, his whiskers sagging. \"I don't want to play with anyone else though. I want to play with yooooooouuuu.\" He dragged out this last word as he sat the controller down and stretched across your lap, looking up at you with the sweetest, most adorable eyes you had ever seen. At that moment, you wanted more than anything to play with him too. And you weren't thinking video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another player connected. Likax reluctantly sat up and grabbed the controller again, selecting a large, heavily armored monster of a fighter who weld a massive battle ax. \"Be careful,\" you cautioned Likax, \"that character plays a lot different than the last one you used. Are you sure you--\" But the match had already begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments for Likax to get used to the slower, heavier fighter, but once he did, the results ended up being virtually the same as when you and Javier had played against him, Likax winning the match handily. The other player immediately requested a rematch, which Likax accepted, but after they had gone a round and a half without Likax's fighter even being touched, the other player abruptly disconnected, causing the game to go back to the home screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I've never wanted to play online,\" Likax commented as he put the controller down on the table. \"There are some real jerks out there on the internet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Looking over at Javier, you noticed he was still frowning. \"I just don't understand,\" he finally said, \"how you can pick up this game a half-hour ago and suddenly be unbeatable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax shrugged. \"I don't know. I guess I'm a quick learner. Is that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier didn't answer right away. You started to recall the speed with which Likax had read through your writing binder earlier. You started to mention this but stopped yourself, realizing that your roommate had already grown too suspicious with the changes in Likax's size. Giving him more reasons to distrust the bobcat sounded like a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he finally said, his brow still furrowed, \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax smiled, and you breathed a sigh of relief. As you leaned back against the couch, the bobcat stretched his arms up into the air and yawned loudly. You couldn't help but stare as his fit, muscled stomach was uncovered slightly. Bringing his arms back down, he noticed you watching him, and his eyebrows went up slightly, as he grinned suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to yawn a little as well, you stood up. \"Well,\" you said, \"it's been a long day. I think we all could use some rest.\" You walked over to the TV and turned it off, along with the Xbox, putting the controllers and game away. \"Do you mind sleeping on the couch, Likax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\" The bobcat's voice sounded eager enough, but you could sense a slight disappointment in his demeanor when you turned back around to face him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask him up to your room, idiot,\" you told yourself. But you couldn't. Not tonight. As much as you wanted to, you knew the best thing for the bobcat was to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing down blankets and pillows, you tried to make the couch into as much of a bed as possible. As Likax lied down, his feetpaws hung off the edge, but otherwise he looked comfortable enough. He smiled up at you and gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Carson,\" he murmured, his eyelids half-closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Likax,\" you sighed. Leaving him sleeping on the couch was the hardest thing you had to do all day. Halfway upstairs, you fought the urge to rush back, take the bobcat in your arms, and run straight to your bed, locking the door behind you. Instead, you just trudged into your room and collapsed on your bed, hoping your exhaustion would finally catch up and carry you off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body had other ideas, though. After an hour of lying there awake, replaying the events of the day over and over in your mind, you decided to just do what you always did when you couldn't sleep. Getting up, you walked over to your desk and sat down, pulled out your favorite pen and a blank sheet of paper, and began to write. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish the first paragraph, however, the door behind you creaked open. Spinning around, you saw a figure standing in the doorframe looking straight at you, causing your heart to skip a beat.</span></div></div>",

He had his laptop in his hands, and was shooting you a rather harsh glare as he approach. You sighed a little bit as you put your pen down, turning to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is about Likax, isn't it?\" You had expected Javier to ask you about the bobcat, but you really didn't know what to say. Sure, the cat was odd, and there was something going on with his body. However, that didn't seem like enough for Javier to have acted as quiet as he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and no. Likax is troubling, but he doesn't seem bad.\" You were a little surprised to hear those words coming from his mouth. \"Yes, I know. I didn't trust him, and blah blah blah. That can wait for now. What's more important is that you've completely lost it when it comes to dealing with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've lost it? What's that supposed to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means,\" He interrupted, \"that you've obviously fallen for the guy.\" You tried to stammer out a response, but Javier only had a vaguely sardonic look on his face, before shaking his head and chuckling. \"Come on, Carson. I've been your roommate how many years, now? You think I wouldn't notice that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was being discrete...\" You barely managed to mutter something, and he gave a rather obvious laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll save that for later. Right now, we have more pressing issues.\" He sat down on your bed, looking at you. \"First off, the obvious. I assume you've noticed he's still growing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of hard to miss it, yeah. He's already having a hard time fitting in the stuff I lent him, and it's only been a few hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been slowing down a little bit, but not enough. He's gotten maybe two feet taller. \" Javier's voice was starting to get a little anxious as he spoke. \"It's slowing down a little, but not enough. As far as I can tell, if it goes at the rate it's been, he'll barely fit through the doorway by tomorrow, worst case. And that's assuming whatever happens to him doesn't pick up or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I know he's growing, but it's barely-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson, he's grown two feet in maybe three hours. In case you haven't noticed, it hasn't exactly been that long.\" Javier's voice was starting to rise, and you could tell that he wasn't very good at holding back his anxiety by now. \"And that's only one thing. I assumed you noticed him playing the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. He picked it up fast, but it shouldn't be that fast...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just learning the game. His reflexes were improving, too. Never mind human reaction speed, he's probably broken some anthro records. I don't know what's happened to his body, but there's something unnatural about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so what? He never meant-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson, this isn't about if he's a good person or not!\" Javier's voice was growing louder, and you were afraid that Likax might hear him shouting before the night was over. \"This is about the fact that something weird's going on with him! He's the one that told us they were doing some experiment, and we've seen some of the results, right? Who's to say there isn't anything worse? For all we know, he could just randomly burst into flame at any moment!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous!\" You were trying to keep calm, but when Javier was starting to lose his composure, it was usually difficult to keep him calm. \"Even if that happens, we'll deal with it. But there's no point in worrying right now, right? If he's got better reflexes or whatever, or if he's bigger, it means he'll be able to take care of himself.\" Your heart raced a little bit as you spoke, privately hoping that the cat was willing to protect the two of you, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Let's assume that for now, he's going to fit in the house and he's not going to cause problems. What about the people after him? I doubt we'll be left alone for a very long time. Even assuming that nobody saw your bring him here, they're going to have a bulletin out on him. It won't be long before people know about him as an escapee, and we won't be able to hide him then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we won't have to.\" You swallowed a little, and Javier gave you a questioning look before he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. Don't tell me... That phone call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was some guy named Mujexa. He knew my name, and he knew we were keeping Likax here. I think he's a friend, though... He said so, and if he wasn't, we'd already have people breaking down our door, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier muttered the name to himself a couple of times, opening his laptop as he thought. The new information seemed to have calmed him for the moment, and it didn't take long before he began typing. \"I don't think I've run into that name before... Who is he... Why would Likax know...\" He shook his head a little bit, clearly trying to contain himself from the verge of panicking. \"What did he say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that I should get out of here with Likax tomorrow.\" Javier's mouth dropped open as you spoke. \"I... I think I have to. I don't think he mentioned you, but... But he knew my name, right? That means somehow, he must've seen me pick up Likax in the forest. Unless Likax somehow made contact while we were both distracted, that's the only time we could've been seen together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it? You're just going to pack up and leave? Carson, this is insane! Even for a crush of yours, you're just going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!\" You were growing more nervous as you spoke, and the sheer ludicrousness of it all was hitting you hard. \"But if there's really someone after me, I don't have any other options, do I?\" Javier only stared quietly at you as you spoke. \"Besides... I know it's probably stupid, but... But I care for the guy, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier quietly looked at you, staring for a moment before shaking his head. \"Figures...\" He sighed as he resumed typing, though his eyes seemed to remain focused on you. \"When you've made up your mind about something like this, there's just no changing it. I won't waste my time trying.\" He looked quietly at you. \"Just let him know and get yourself packed up. I have to figure out what I'm supposed to do now, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed before nodding to him. You stood up slowly, starting to walk out the room. \"Javier... Thanks for putting up with me. I mean, over all the years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just gave a small chuckle as he waved to you. \"We'll have to see if I have to keep doing it.\" You couldn't help but smile a little bit as you started to walk out the room, hoping Likax was going to be okay with the news. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The digital alarm clock on your bedside table read 12:15 when you left your room. It wasn't really that late for you; staying up until two or three in the morning had become commonplace since you had started college. You knew, though, that Likax was probably exhausted and needed his sleep after all that he had been through today. Running away from the police and coming back to life after being seemingly dead weren't exactly everyday occurrences. You second-guessed yourself, thinking about letting him sleep a few hours more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Javier had made it all too clear: the two of you needed to have a plan if you were going to survive, and that plan needed to be put in motion immediately, before the sun rose in the morning. And you realized that you couldn't begin to formulate any sort of plan without the bobcat's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly and quietly walked down the stairs, careful not to trip or accidentally miss a step in the dark. As you got to the bottom step, you saw blankets and sheets thrown onto the floor in front of the couch, and you assumed that your furry houseguest had gotten too hot and thrown them off as he rolled over in his sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couch was situated in such a way that it faced away from the stairs, so you couldn't quite make out if he was asleep or not from where you were. \"Likax,\" you called out, \"are you awake?\" Not hearing a response, you walked over to the couch. As you bent over the back of it to try and wake him up, your blood turned cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couch was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing faster now, you spun around and darted over to the wall, hitting the light switch. Shielding your eyes as the room illuminated, you scanned around, not seeing any trace of the large feline. \"Likax?!\" you called out again, more frightened this time. Still, no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson?\" Javier called from upstairs. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's -- it's Likax!\" You were on the verge of tears. \"He's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Javier ran down the stairs, his face almost as shocked as yours. \"Gone?\" he asked. \"What -- what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think I mean? He's nowhere to be found!\" Your brain and your heart demanded that you start searching for him, but your feet had seemingly frozen in place, unable to cope with the situation. Did you say something offensive to drive him away? Was he afraid Javier was starting to turn against him? Or did someone -- you shuttered as you finished the thought -- did someone sneak into your house and catnap him as he slept?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally got control of your limbs, you began looking in the other rooms of your house. Both the upstairs and downstairs bathrooms were empty, and there was no sign of the bobcat in the utility room or down in the basement. As you started to look through the kitchen, however, you noticed that the screen door there leading out to the backyard had been left open just a crack. Could Likax -- or someone with Likax -- have left through that way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to the door and flung it open, stepping out onto your back porch, not caring that it was the middle of the night and you were wearing only lounge pants with a simple white undershirt. You scanned your backyard for signs of Likax or anything else that would indicate an unwelcome person having paid you a visit. Finding nothing, you then looked over at the backyards of your neighbors on both sides, still unable to locate any clues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were streaming from your eyes now, causing your vision to start to blur. \"This isn't fair,\" you said aloud to whoever wanted to listen. \"Why would the universe give me someone like Likax, someone so perfect and caring, and then just yank him away from me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could sink too far into that despair, however, you caught the shape of something or someone moving out of the corner of your right eye. Spinning your head that way, you saw -- nothing, at least at first. Part of you wanted to give up then and there, go back inside, and collapse on your bed again, but the movement you saw gave you a sliver of hope. Could it be--?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw it again, a large shadowy shape trying to sneak by undetected near the light of a lamppost. The figure looked to be over seven feet tall with a broad build. \"It has to be...\" you whispered to yourself, as you felt a glimmer of hope inside you start to light. \"It just HAS to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrusting your instincts, you jumped down from your porch and started running barefoot through the grass, trying to catch up with the shadow and not caring who saw you. The figure was moving purposefully but slowly, allowing you to easily catch up with it. As you got closer, you saw the light grey fur and pointed, black-spotted ears that you had come to know so well during this afternoon and evening. It was definitely your bobcat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you got to him, Likax turned to look at you, his eyes nearly bulging with surprise. You leapt at him, throwing your entire body into his soft, well-kempt fur and his warm, firm muscles underneath it. Even with a full-running start, the large bobcat barely moved when you slammed into him, standing tall and stable. You wrapped your arms around his midsection in a desperate attempt to not let him go, and buried your face into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson!\" he hissed, careful to not let his voice get too loud. \"What the hell are you doing?\" He wrapped a large powerful arm around you, trying to gently pry you off, but you held tight. Seeing that you weren't going to budge, he decided to gently rest a paw against your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Close to hysterics, you didn't care nearly as much if you were heard, though the muffling of Likax's chest fur near your mouth helped take care of that for you. \"What are YOU doing? Why would you suddenly vanish like that in the middle of the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't answer for a moment, and you looked up to see a pained expression on his face. As close up as you were to him now, you could definitely tell that he had gotten huge. Even clinging to him with your feet a few inches off the ground, he still towered head and shoulders above you. He had to be at least seven-and-a-half feet tall. You realized he was still wearing the clothes you lent him, though the shirt had ripped halfway down the middle of the chest and back, and the shorts looked like they were just about to burst off, barely covering his crotch and upper thighs, nearly skin tight. Of all the emotions swirling in your head right now, the most prominent was an incredible sense of physical attraction, one like you had never felt before. Likax was so big, so strong and powerful, yet so gentle and caring... you felt your affection for him growing stronger with each inch of height he gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he finally answered, shaking his head, \"I didn't want you to have to be involved in my predicament anymore. You and Javier did so much for me, and I care so deeply about you, Carson. The very last thing I want is to put you at risk. There's just too much about me you don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know enough,\" you said, a quiet confidence building inside you. \"I know you're a kind-hearted cat who's curious, inquisitive, and a joy to be with. I know that you have a passion for what you believe deep down inside you. That passion may have led you to being thrown into prison in the first place, but it also kept you going through all those months of solitary confinement. Most of all, though, I know that the one thing I want to do more than anything in the entire world is to be with you and help you through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat sighed and closed his eyes, opening them after a few seconds with a warm but worried look. \"It's not that easy,\" he said. \"There's nothing you can do to help me, any more than you've already done. I have to run away; I just have to! Staying here in Danville is suicide for me, Carson. And--\" He covered his face with his paw, and you could tell that he was starting to cry. \"--I'm horrible at saying goodbyes. I figured that I'd hurt you only a little by slipping out in the middle of the night rather than getting arrested or shot in front of you and hurting you much much worse, possibly even leading you to getting arrested as well! You gotta believe me that I only left the way I did because I wanted you to be able to disavow any knowledge of where I had gone to. It'd eat me up inside to know that I caused one of the few caring, compassionate humans in the world to get thrown into jail for assisting a fugitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed a little as he said this, turning your back to him for a moment and looking out at the empty alleyway on the other side of your neighbor's fence. You weren't sure which feeling inside you was stronger: hurt for Likax having abandoned you, or awe and understanding that he did it because he wanted you to be safe. You wiped your tears on your sleeve as you tried to put your thoughts into order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likax,\" you finally said, caressing his cheek as you did, \"I believe you. I know you're too honest and caring to lie to me, and, I admit, I'm touched that you wanted me to be safe. But you've got to understand,\" you turned around to face him and grasped his paw in your hand, \"I'd do anything for you. I WANT to help you! EVERY step of the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head slightly. \"I know you do, Carson,\" he said. \"I just don't think it's wise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it, you thought to yourself. He has to know; I can't keep it in any longer. You stood as tall as you could and looked him directly in the eye as you said...</span></div></div>",

His hand held yours, and though he tried to pry you off, it was clearly half-hearted. \"I... I think you'd have a hard time finding someone as... peculiar as I am right now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to give a small laugh, though you really couldn't feel any humor in it. \"I think so too. But... I'm odd enough.\" You slowly let go, your body sliding against his as your feet touched the ground again. \"When it comes down to something like this... I really am stubborn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw him shake his head as he looked down at you. \"You're calling that odd? I really don't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you this now, because... Like it or not, I'm not letting you go alone. Even if you try to sneak out, I'll follow you. If you aren't with me when I wake up, then I'll do my best to find you. And even if you end up getting caught...\" Your throat was dry as you spoke, but you did your best to speak to him. \"Then I'll still stick with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Carson, it's too dangerous.\" You could hear Likax's voice faltering, and though he was trying to keep you safe, it didn't seem as though he really liked the idea of what he was trying to do.  \"There's no reason for you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even try arguing.\" Likax seemed to jump a little as he heard your voice. Even with his size and strength, the firm tone of your voice had surprised him. \"I told you, I'm stubborn. If I make a major choice, I'm sticking through with it until the end.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax looked at you, worry clear in his face. \"You can be a bit stubborn, fine. But I'm not going to let you just follow for something like this. This is much more dangerous than-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotten in trouble because of it before... Had a few fights, given my parents a bit of a time... I think Javier knows as well as anybody after I totaled his car once. But you know what?\" You swallow as you just look at Likax, your hands drifting down to hold against his. \"I don't regret it. It's a miracle that I'm still in one piece after some of the trouble it's gotten me in, but I'm glad I've done what I've done. And I won't regret this, either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Why would you-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only manage a small noise as you lean in. You do your best to stand on the tips of your feet, reaching up to try to get a good grip on Likax. Though you could barely reach him, you managed to give him a lingering kiss on his cheek before you lost your balance and slid onto him, gripping over his back. \"Because I care about you, too, Likax... I care about you too much to just let you leave like this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see him shifting as he gently held you. It certainly seemed like he wanted to speak, but he was trying to hold everything in. You just held tight against him, your head resting against his chest as you heard and felt his heartbeat. It was racing, but despite whatever had happened to him in the past, it was now going strong and steady. You were just relieved that he was still here in your arms, and that you could still hold him like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likax... Please... Don't try to run away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't want to... I don't...\" His voice was faded, and you could feel his arms just hanging over your shoulders as he held you. It certainly seemed like he wanted to stay with you, but he was trying hard not to admit it. \"But you can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming with you.\" He tried to respond, but you shook your head. \"I'm coming, whether you want me to or not.\" Despite his misgivings and your worries, your voice was quite clear when you said it. By now, it wasn't a suggestion, or you asking for permission. It was a fact, and despite his worries, Likax had no choice but to accept it. He looked at you in silence, before forcing a small yelp out of you as you felt both of his arms wrapping against your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You're crazy, you know that?\" Despite all of his worries, Likax couldn't help but break into a smile. He lifted you up in his arms, just letting your weight lean into him as he held you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think I got that when I almost tackled a seven-foot bobcat.\" You felt his hand press into the back of your head, your arms softly pressed against his sides as you let him keep you close. \"But you wouldn't still be here if I wasn't a little bit crazy, so... I'll just have to deal with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax nodded softly, and you could feel his face brushing against your head. \"Yeah... I'm glad, too... Thanks, Carson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you held each other silently. You were almost drifting off as you looked at him, and his gentle smile seemed to keep your mind drifting away. You felt his body pressing to yours, and you could swear you felt him growing. Despite holding so still, his fur seemed to push along, and his arms rubbed gently into you. Only the feeling of a stiff breeze snapped you back into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Likax... Let's head back for now... Even if it's just for one night, we should rest and figure this out while we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw him swallow as he tried to make a decision, and just let him hold you tight. It only took a few seconds before you heard him reply in a weak voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Let's go back for now. There's no point in me trying to sneak away now, is there?\" He just lightly held you as he began walking. Though it felt a bit awkward, it seemed as though the thought of letting you down hadn't crossed his mind. He easily began moving back to your house, creeping as quietly as he could. Though he was certainly large and his weight made it impossible to be completely silent, he still managed to deaden his footsteps and creep back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier was around the door when the two of you arrived. It took a moment for him to realize that you were there, but he gave an immense sigh of relief as he opened the door for you, muttering something to himself. \"Just hurry and get back in here, okay? I can't imagine how you two could stand out more right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you simultaneously managed to give him a quick glare, as if both to say, \"Don't ruin the moment\". However, he ignored it as he turned back inside, leaving it open for the two of you. It was a little awkward for Likax to try to fit in through the doorway, and he took a minute to do it. Although he could probably manage it normally, he still was eager to keep you in his arms. Though he moved about a little, it was only after a few moments of turning and shifting that he managed to get inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, then. First things first, before you decide to run off again.\" Javier was clearly a little irritated by now, and continued speaking as Likax sat on the couch, positioning you in his lap. \"I've packed a bit of food and some emergency supplies in that bag.\" He nodded towards a plain bag on the ground, fastened by a loose string. \"Considering we can't really get you any clothes that'll be guaranteed to stay on, I just tossed in a huge blanket. That's everything I could find for you, and I doubt we'd have a chance to get anything else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded quietly, though Likax looked a little taken aback. He looked back at Javier with a bit of surprise.\"When'd you have time for that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now, I'm willing to bet. He probably did it the moment he saw me catch you. Javier's fairly good at planning things out. He's just panics when he doesn't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard that.\" Javier shot you a quick look, but you gave him a small shrug before hearing him resuming his speech. \"Anyways, just do your best with that much. You might be able to get some if you're alone, but try not to show up in public places. You already stand out enough as it is.\" He sighed as he looked at the two of you. Likax seemed to be too distracted to really listen to Javier, but what he heard next quickly drew his attention. \"Now, then...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could feel Likax\u2019s fur bristle against your skin at Javier\u2019s somewhat-harsh tone. The passion in his eyes seemed to disappear instantly, and you barely made out a low growling sound coming from his chest. Your first instinct was to rebuke Javier, but as you opened your mouth to do so, he cut you off before you even got the chance to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cI know it\u2019s not going to be easy to talk about all this right now, but you have to try. Any small bit of information you could give me or Carson could come in handy later saving your lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Javier,\u201d you stated with a frown on your face, \u201cI thought you agreed that we wouldn\u2019t talk about this kinda thing until tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier pointed to the clock on the DVD player, which now read 12:37. \u201cIt is tomorrow. Besides, with how things are going, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna have much more of a chance to talk. You two need to hit the ground running first thing in the morning, if not sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut--\u201d you tried to interject again, but Likax took your paw and gave it a firm but gentle squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Carson,\u201d he said, looking into your eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to explain everything. I\u2019m a big cat now, after all.\u201d A sparkle appeared for a moment in his eyes, making you hope that he did indeed feel better. He turned to Javier, his expression again serious. \u201cSo what do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Javier said, \u201cfrankly, I\u2019d like to know everything you could possibly tell me, but I don\u2019t think we have the time for that. Let me try to ask the most important questions, at least from my perspective. Then, at the end, you can let me know if there\u2019s any other bits of crucial information that I missed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier sat down and leaned in close to Likax. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s start from the beginning. First off: what lead to you getting thrown in prison? I found a small article online reporting on your arrest, but I\u2019d like to hear it from your own mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas it that article from the Free-Fur Press?\u201d Javier nodded in confirmation. \u201cI read that at the prison library before they transferred me to solitary confinement. Well,\u201d Likax sat back, making sure you had plenty of room in his lap to be comfortable, \u201cthe reporter got it more or less right. There\u2019s some details that she missed, like the fact that I did my best to ignore the hecklers until they actually started tearing down some of the loudspeakers we had set up, and the small detail that they all were armed with switchblades, but everything else is pretty accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you actually assault anyone or instigate violence like the police said?\u201d Javier asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax started to shake his head, but then stopped. \u201cN-- well, not really. I never called for anyone in the crowd to attack the hecklers. I just wanted them to get away from our sound equipment. I did scratch up one big burly bald guy\u2019s face pretty bad with my claws, and accidentally knocked down his wife, who was with him, in the process, but, to be fair, he was brandishing a knife and had tried to stab me with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d you said, smugly smiling at Javier, \u201cthe article was right. He was acting in self-defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier didn\u2019t respond to you, his thoughts having moved on to something else. After a few second of looking down at the floor in silence, he made eye contact with Likax again. \u201cSo what happened after the arrest? I couldn\u2019t find any articles or information about your case going to trial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there wasn\u2019t any trial,\u201d Likax sighed. \u201cAfter twenty-four hours in the county jail downtown, I was put in a truck and driven to the maximum-security federal prison a few miles east of LaGrange. No one ever told me why, and believe me, I protested endlessly, demanding to speak to an attorney. I even got knocked out when I struggled with one of the guards while being transported. After that, I found myself unjustly imprisoned without any hope of legal recourse, left there to be a lab rat for those sick fucks\u2019 experiments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Likax swear startled you; the bobcat had been so gentle and pleasant since you had first seen him. You figured, however, that after going through what he had gone through, not having any resentment or feelings of hostility towards his captors would be the real surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier, however, seemed unfazed. \"There's one thing that doesn't make sense about that, though,\" he said. \"If you were imprisoned without a trial, why didn't any of your friends or family get a lawyer, or go to the media, or protest on your behalf-- anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax chuckled and shook his head. \"It sounds like you don't know much about how anthros are treated in our society, Javier. There's so much repression and brutality, even coming from the police themselves, that I doubt the few that I would consider my 'friends' would have enough courage to go against the system like that.\" He sighed and closed his eyes, leaning back on the couch. \"And I don't have much family to speak of. My father died before I was born, and my mother... let's just say she wasn't cut out to be a parent. I was taken away from her when I was seven and have lived with my grandmother since then. Now she's one powerful old bobcat; she taught me how to be proud of who I am and what I could do, and if anyone tried to find out what happened to me after I was locked away, I imagine it was her. But I don't think she probably would've gotten very far. A teacher's pension doesn't buy you much legal help, and I doubt there were many mainstream reporters willing to listen to her talk about her missing grandson. I... In a way, I feel sorry for what she has probably put herself through, all on my account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier sat quietly, contemplating all that Likax had said. What he described, you knew fairly well, having dealt with or witnessed similar discrimination during your previous relationship. Still, it angered you a little to think about how mistreated anthros still were, and how little you could do to change any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Javier finally said after a minute's silence, \"I think I have a pretty firm grasp of what was going on before you got arrested. What I need to know now is what you saw in the testing rooms in the prison. What had they done that disturbed you so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax sighed and sagged his head a little, but didn't take long to answer. \"Okay, Javier. I'll tell you. You're not going to like it, but I guess you need to know. Just... just keep in mind that it's not going to be easy for me to say or for you to hear.\" He took a deep breath before continuing. \"The things I saw... they would turn your stomach to see them. Many of the testing chambers had the bodies of their previous subjects still in them. A few of the anthros looked like they had died in their sleep. But there were several dozen whose...\" He stopped again, his voice starting to crack. \"...whose bodies were...mutilated. That's the only word to describe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth dropped open in horror. \"Mutilated?\" you repeated. \"You mean, like cut up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax shook his head. \"No. Nothing that simple. Some looked like they had lost any trace of fur, their skin and muscle completely bare. Some appeared as if they had been burned alive, their fur or skin severely charred. A few... a few of the most horrific ones... the only way I can think of to describe them is that they looked like their insides had burst out of their bodies, blood, muscle, and bone all having broken through skin and fur. I... I'm not sure how it all happened, but I'm fairly certain of what the experiments were trying to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier's eyes lit up at this last sentence, and he leaned forward. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Likax looked up and stared directly into Javier's eyes.  What he said next shocked both you and Javier.</span></div></div>",

You didn't know what to say to that; it seemed so incredible, so far-fetched that if you were hearing it from anyone other than the bobcat who was holding you in his arms, you wouldn't have believed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Javier didn't seem to be comprehending it either. \"H-how could they... I mean, what in the... De-fur you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax slowly nodded. \"It's too hard to believe, right? Too implausible?\" He shrugged his shoulders, gently moving you up and down in his arms as he did. \"I didn't believe it either when I first heard the rumors, back before I had gotten locked up. I thought it was just the ramblings of an old, demented ex-con. But after seeing what I saw, and going through what I went through\u2026 it just fit so perfectly. There's nothing else they really could have been doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes had begun to grow damp, and you buried your face into Likax's chest-fur, partially to dry them, and partially to feel the warmth of his quick-beating heart. A thought crossed your mind: why did Likax not end up like the others? What was so different about the experiments he had gone through, or, perhaps instead, what was so different about the bobcat himself? And what if Likax had been one of the others who hadn't made it? Even though you had only known him for a day, you had grown so close to him in that time that you couldn't imagine what you would do if anything like that happened to him. For a moment, you were thankful that he had somehow managed to escape that torturous place unharmed, but then another, darker realization set in: they were still after him, and there was still a very real chance that Likax could be forced to go back to that awful place, or worse. You shuttered at the thought, and vowed to never let that happen to your bobcat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier had closed his eyes to take all of this in, contemplative as always. After another silent minute, however, he quickly stood up, startling you and Likax. He walked at a quick pace towards the stairs, disappearing from sight. You and Likax looked at each other, both slightly confused. \"What was that for?\" he asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and shrugged. \"Beats me,\" you said. \"I have a hard time figuring out what's going through Javier's head sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard what sounded like a large chest creak open, then shut several seconds later. Javier's bedroom door slammed shut, and he quickly shuffled down the stairs. As you turned to look at him, you quickly realized why he had left, and your face nearly went pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Javier!\" you exclaimed. \"Where the hell did you get that gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't answer you directly, only sticking it out, grip pointing towards you and the barrel facing the side. \"Take it,\" he said, his face firm and serious. \"If what Likax says is true, then the people who are after you will stop at nothing to capture him. You need every advantage you can have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you tried to push away the firearm, but Javier insisted. Reluctantly, you gave in and grabbed it from him, examining the gun closely. It was a modern-enough looking pistol, small but surprisingly heavy, with a black rubber grip and a metallic barrel. Your mind travelled back to the only time  in your life that you had ever fired a gun, when you were sixteen. The recoil it had given you then had terrified you and made you never want to touch one ever again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Javier\u2026\" you murmured lowly. \"I don't know what I could do with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you better learn quickly,\" Javier stated, his face rigid and firm. \"You're probably gonna have to use it soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Likax with a questioning look, asking with your eyes if he approved of you being armed. He sighed slowly, closed his eyes, and nodded. With his acceptance, you took a deep breath and turned back to Javier, saying only one word: \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier walked over to the bag he had packed for you and Likax, sticking a small box into it. \"The gun's unloaded now,\" he said, \"but this ammunition box is full. It should hopefully get you as far as you need to go. At least to Mujexa's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the name 'Mujexa', Likax's claws slid out involuntarily, and his eyes narrowed to slits. \"Where have you heard that name?\" His voice was deep, almost a growl, and a brief flash of fear came over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him, Carson,\" Javier motioned to you. Looking up into Likax's eyes with both confusion and panic, you stuttered to speak. \"I-I\u2026 well\u2026\" Gulping, you collected your thoughts, and finally managed to get them out. \"Last night, when I got the phone call\u2026 it wasn't a wrong number. It was someone on the other end that said 'They're close', and that I needed to tell you that Mujexa wants to meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's breathing started to grow faster. \"Carson\u2026\" He stared at you, as if trying to decide how to respond. \"When were you planning on telling me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"I-I'm not sure. I figured it would come up whenever we finally left here. I\u2026 I didn't want to upset you, Likax.\" You avoided looking directly at the bobcat, doing the best you could to try to keep your eyes from watering, without much luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how upset you were, Likax's face softened, and he placed a finger on your cheek, wiping away a tear. \"It's okay, Carson. I understand what you were trying to do. It just\u2026 it throws a wrinkle in our plans, that's for sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corners of his lips started to turn up in a wry smile, and you fought the urge to bury your face in his chest again. Sitting up, you climbed off of the bobcat's lap, and moved to sit on the other end of the couch. After composing yourself, you asked, \"So\u2026 is Mujexa someone we can trust? I mean, he did tell me on the phone that he was a friend\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax chuckled a little, looking down at the floor as he did so. \"Well, first of all, I doubt you actually talked to Mujexa himself. He would never send out a message or call somebody directly; he has people under him to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having sat in silence for a few minutes, Javier finally leaned forward again to speak. \"Maybe it would help us to know who he actually is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax turned to look at your roommate. \"Remember when I told you that during the riots at the prison, a few other anthros escaped? Mujexa was one of them. He's a black-footed ferret, in his forties or fifties, very lean, and a little taller than I am-- I mean, I was\u2026\" He grinned sheepishly at this last remark. \"Ironically, out of hundreds of anthros who had been unjustly imprisoned, he was probably the only one in the whole place who actually deserved to be locked away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you asked. \"What'd he do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've heard of the Comradity?\" Both you and Javier shook your heads. \"Well, the quickest way to describe them would be some sort of cross between an anthro fraternity and the mafia. Comradites don't do anything overtly illegal, but they're involved in a lot of shady business. Mujexa runs the Comradity in the southeastern US; he only answers to the First Comrade, who runs the entire organization. Now that Mujexa is out of prison, he's probably already back in Atlanta, where the Comoradity has a very large presence. But can we trust him?\" Likax considered this question for only a moment. \"I'll say this about him: he's a pretty interesting guy, very intelligent and quick-witted, and extraordinarily charming. But from what I've seen, the way he operated in prison and worked the system, and how he treated people who got in his way, intentionally or otherwise\u2026 well, let's just say I'd trust him only as much as I absolutely had to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier nodded, and you leaned back against the couch, absorbing all this information in. A quasi-crime boss didn't sound like the sort of character you necessarily wanted to be associated with; still, he was your only real lead so far, and you knew that you and Likax couldn't handle the police (or his growing situation) for very long on your own. Whatever you decided, whatever route you chose, you knew that you'd have to watch Likax's back, and trust that the bobcat was doing the same for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Javier stood up and started talking as he paced the room. \"Okay, so we know what we're up against, and we know what our options are. Now, we just need to form a master plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax nodded. \"I guess you're right. What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around with a determined look in his eye, Javier alternated between looking at you and Likax. \"The way I see it,\" he said, \"you can do one of two things:\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You first option is to head back home.\" Likax's head gave a slight jerk as he heard it, a little surprised at the suggestion. Javier continued speaking quietly, looking at the bobcat with a quiet expression. \"If you know enough people there, they might be able to protect you. Your friends and family could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Likax interrupted with a flat-out refusal, not even bothering to let him finish. \"I'm not going to put them at risk.\" You noticed the bobcat's grip tighten a little bit, the couch creaking a little under his hands. \"I've already caused them enough trouble. I had enough qualms with just letting my friends come to my rallies, knowing they might get in trouble, too. I'm lucky they only arrested me and nobody else. If I do anything more serious than that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, then. You've probably made your mind up, but I have to ask anyways.\" Javier's voice was still a bit cool as he spoke, and though you knew he was just trying to make certain, it was clear that Likax was getting a little riled up by him. \"You sure this isn't an option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no!\" His voice had risen to what seemed like a snarl, and though he was doing his best to keep himself calm, he was visibly tense. \"Even assuming I know anybody who could somehow help against an armed group, I'm not going to cause any more trouble for them! It's already bad enough for me and for you guys, but I really... I wouldn't be able to stand willingly dragging any more of them into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier nodded quietly. \"Thought so. Something else you might want to keep in mind...\" His voice seemed a little unsteady from Likax's outburst, but he tried his best to continue on.  \"In a situation like this, don't forget you're already considered a criminal.\" Likax's fur shifted up, bristling visibly as he heard Javier say it so bluntly. \"You've escaped prison now, so anybody you stay with is technically a criminal too. If what you've told us is accurate, the last thing we need to do is give them any more opportunities to go after anthros. Worst case, you'd have an open war on your hands, and I don't see that being your goal.\" He sighed as he sat back, looking up at the ceiling. \"Right now, I just wanted to make sure you understood the implications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've just asked...\" Your voice was a little quiet, and you were a bit afraid to speak up. However, Likax seemed too distracted glaring at Javier to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Likax. But if the last few hours haven't made it sink in, me 'just asking' wouldn't, either.\" Javier shook his head quietly as he thought. \"Unfortunately, that means the other option...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going after Mujexa.\" Likax's eyes seemed to sharpen as he glanced around, shaking his head. \"I don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice was shaking as you spoke, turning up to try to look at Likax's face. \"A-are you sure it's worth the risk? It doesn't sound very...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took him all of a few hours to get someone to contact you, right?\" Likax's face seemed to show a twinge of fear as he looked down at you. \"If he already knows that much, he's probably got someone watching us. If we don't go looking for him, it's only a matter of time before he tries to drag me somewhere the hard way. Right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be easier to find him and cooperate, rather than wait for him to start causing trouble for you.\" Javier shook his head quietly as he spoke. \"You'd think I could manage to dig up some information if he was really as important as you say, but I haven't found anything on him yet. Either he's been lying to everybody while he's in prison, or he's good at hiding himself. If it's the second, that's something that would definitely come in handy. But if it's the first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I wouldn't put it past him. The problem is, he's the only real option I can think of. I just... I still don't like it. I just got out of prison. But he definitely had someone watching, if he found about your number this fast. He's probably got everything he bragged about. It's just... creepy to think about being watched like that. And, it means that things are probably going to get worse for you, if he already knows about you...\" His gaze returned to the ground as he seemed distracted by the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed as you moved a little closer. He certainly seemed to have a lot on his mind, but you weren't going to let him keep on worrying. \"Likax... Even if it's risky, I'm coming with you, okay? So please, don't worry about me. Just do what you have to.\" You manage to give him a weak smile, and when he turned his face up to look at you, he had a small one on as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you two get too distracted,\" Javier interrupted, \"I'd like to remind you that even if you plan on going after this guy, you'll want to figure out what to do when you get there. Do you really think some underground boss is going to just let you sit around? You <i>do</i> realize the implications of a giant anthro going to shady places to ask for help, right? Somehow, I don't think you'll be getting assistance for free, and I'm fairly sure they could think of a few things for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax seemed to wince a little at the idea. \"Yeah... I know. Look, I don't like that idea of owing him. I mean, I <i>really</i> don't like it. But right now, it's better than nothing. Maybe some other opportunity will show up along the way, but right now, we don't have a better choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess we know what we're doing, then.\" You give Likax a small nod as you hold tight against his hand, finally feeling it shifting before he gets a grip on yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are still missing something obvious.\" Javier sighed, his hand pressed on top of his hair as he looked at the ground. \"Do you even know where you're going? Carson, while you were on the phone, did he give you any directions? Contact method? Any real way of finding him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Likax and Javier both looking at you expectantly. You had to grow a little worried as you turned to Likax, your hand letting go to hold on against your seat. \"He said that you would know where to find him.\" Likax seemed to have a small look of surprise on his face, closing his eyes as he tried to think. \"Y-you don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax shook his head as he looked at you. \"Nothing too concrete. I mean, we didn't really talk too much while I was in prison. He's not the kind of person you really want to blab to. He... doesn't forget things that might come in handy, and in prison, that's... pretty much anything. He did talk to me once or twice, so I have a few hints, but he was always rather vague.\" Likax grunted and closed his eyes, trying to think. Neither you nor Javier felt like interrupting his silence, so it was a minute before he finally spoke. \"I think we'd better head to Atlanta. It's the only real certain place I know of that's connected to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what? You wander around until he finds you?\" Javier seemed a little jumpy as he tried to think things through. \"You do realize that there's no guarantee he'd spot you before the police did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be that bad...\" Likax swallowed and spoke. \"We don't have too many options, and getting out of here would be a good start. And, it's a bit of a long shot, but there's still some chance we'll manage it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still some chance? That's... This isn't just some small thing you can do on a moment's notice, you know!\" Javier's voice rose as he spoke, rising from his chair and fidgeting a bit. \"I'm... I'm doing my best to make sure that you two will be alright, and you're not exactly giving me a lot to work with, here! I mean, it's at least an hour's drive, and he might not even fit into the car that well! Not to mention the fact that you'd be seen... And if you tried by foot, that's easily-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Javier, calm down. We know that. There's not too much we can do to help it, okay?\" Your voice would a bit difficult to hear over the sound of Likax's quiet growl, or over Javier's rather harsh breathing. And though Likax did have something to add, it did little to help reassure either of you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNear the edge of town?\" Javier looked at Likax questioningly, then rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, for your sake I hope you guys will end up getting more specific directions than that. Atlanta\u2019s a pretty big city, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you sighed, \u201cit is... But I'm confident we will be able to find what we're searching for.\u201d Looking up at Likax, your soft smile became a strong, confident stare. At first, Likax looked unsure of your response, but your confidence seemed to be contagious, and he quickly had a determined expression as well. You didn't quite know where you had found this inner confidence, but it gave you a whole new exhilarated feeling. You and your bobcat were going to make it together-- you were sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Javier finally turned his back to you and sighed. \u201cWhatever. I just hope you\u2019re ready for what you\u2019re getting yourselves into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exchanged a quick glance with Likax, then jumped up from his lap and walked over to Javier, placing a hand on his shoulder. \"Javier, I know you're worried. Don't get me wrong; I'm worried too. But I just have a feeling that this whole mess is going to work itself out somehow. Don't ask me why I have this feeling, I just do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to face you again, and you could tell he was fighting back tears, a struggle you too suddenly felt come over you. \"You're crazy, you know that?\" he asked. For a second, you stayed silent, not quite knowing how to respond, but then Javier began to laugh softly. \"Both of you. You're completely insane.\" He leaned forward and wrapped his arms around you, embracing you tightly, continuing to speak as he did. \"I know that nothing I can say will be able to change your mind; you're set in what you plan to do. I can't say that I agree with your course of action, but I know that you're doing what you think is best, and I respect that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears began to flow from your eyes, and you knew that it was useless to hold them back. \"Thank you, Javier,\" you said as you hugged him tightly in return. \"I can't begin to repay you for all that you've done for me-- and for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier broke the hug, and smiled at you, wiping the tears from his eyes as he did. \"So is it official, now?\" he said, looking back and forth between you and the large bobcat on the couch. \"Are you guys an 'us'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your heart skip a beat, you glanced back towards Likax, who seemed to be as hesitant as you were. \"Uhh, well\u2026\" you said, rubbing your hand on your neck, attempting to stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Javier said, \"it's not important. What is important is what you two are going to do.\" He pulled out his cell phone, checking the time on the screen. \"It's now only five and a half hours until sunrise; if you leave now, you might be able to make it to Atlanta before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave now?\" As Javier said this, you felt the entire day and night suddenly catch up with you. It was late; you needed to sleep before you got near the wheel of a car. \"Uh, Javier\u2026 I think that it's not a good idea for me to drive before morning. I'm\u2026 I'm just too tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier's face began to grow worried again. \"But what if someone shows up to the house by then, or is tracking you during the daytime on your way down? Besides, who's to say that in the morning Likax won't be too big for the car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" Javier had a good point, but you were too tired to think things through. You just needed some sleep, to lay your head down on a pillow, and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll drive.\" Both of you turned your heads to Likax breaking his silence. He rose to his feet, still with that spark of determination from before, but now, at his full height, the bobcat seemed even more sure of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Javier seemed to not like this idea at all. \"When was the last time you've driven a car? Do you even know how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" Likax simply nodded in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" you sputtered, \"you have to be even more tired than I am! I mean, you practically died and came back to life today, not to mention having spent the last few days on the run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, you saw the corners of the bobcat's mouth turn upwards slightly. \"Actually, I feel full of energy. I don't think I would be able to sleep even if I tried.\" Turning towards the door, he picked up the bag that Javier had set aside, and motioned for you to follow him. \"So, unless either of you have a better idea\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Likax for a few seconds, unsure of whether his plan was a wise one. There were just too many questions: how many years had it been since he last drove, did he even have a driver's license (though you quickly realized that this would be a moot point, since any policeman who tried to pull you over would have much greater concerns), and would he even be able to drive comfortably at his size? But you quickly realized that if the two of you were going to make it through this together, each of you had to trust the other. And if Likax said he was able to  drive\u2026 well, then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you said. \"We'll leave now.\" You turned to look at your roommate one more time, possibly the last time you'd ever see him, you realized. You could tell that he was dying to stop you from going, to keep you from embarking on this fool-hearted quest, but he refrained from interfering. You gave him another final hug, your eyes tearing up again. \"Goodbye, Javier. Thank you for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffed a bit, returning the hug. \"Stay safe, both of you. And try to get word to me however you can, whenever you can-- as long as it's safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do that,\" Likax said, turning around to wave goodbye to Javier. \"Thank you for saving my life and taking such good care of me tonight. I promise that I'll find some way to repay it-- someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier closed his eyes and bowed his head down, biting his lip slightly. \"You're welcome, Likax,\" he finally said. \"It was nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you and Likax headed out of the door towards your car, you climbing in the passenger seat while Likax squeezed into the driver's seat. It was tight for sure, and he had to adjust the seat controls all the way back and down, but he managed to barely fit. You just hoped that any more growth spurts would wait until the two of you got safely down to Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, then,\" you said as you handed him the keys, which he put into the ignition. \"Here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, he turned to you and gave you a quick kiss on the top of your head. \"It's your last chance to back out,\" he said, a sparkle in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" you grinned back. \"You're stuck with me. Now let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulled out of the driveway, and the two of you were headed on your way. You quickly gave Likax directions to I-75, which, from there, would be a straight five hours drive to Atlanta. Before you even got to the interstate, though, your exhaustion had gotten the best of you, and you started to snooze in your seat. Just before you drifted off, you realized that your head had slumped a little to your left, and was resting on Likax's shoulder. His fur felt soft to the touch, and the warmth of his broad muscles soothed your tired head. Despite everything that had happened during this crazy day, you wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way than this. </span></div></div>",

Even as you began to drift off, you felt relaxed. His driving seemed to be smooth, and though he had his eyes on the road, you could see him turn a little to occasionally give you a glance. However, the drive was smooth, and you drifted off easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was amazingly smooth. Even with the occasional bumps and jumps that were unavoidable, Likax did his best to move. You occasionally drifted back close to waking again. However, each time, you only saw the streetlights lined up in front of you, and Likax's shoulders against your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long drive was over in what felt like minutes to you. The car had pulled to a complete stop, and Likax gently shook you a little. You yawned as you tried to get your eyes open, looking around in the limited starlight. Your words were a little slurred and drowsy as you spoke, shifting around in your seat. \u201cMmmmph... Whatime is it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle past four AM, I think... The roads were fairly empty, so I drove fast. How are you feeling?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned again and rubbed your eyes before you managed to get them open completely. \u201cNot too bad. It's not a full night, but I'm doing okay. How about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill awake and doing alright. A little drowsy, but I can manage until we find somewhere.\u201d He gave you a small smile as he shifted about, struggling a little to get a good grip on the door handle and pushed the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing you had arrived a little early. He was now struggling to fit in the car, and had to sit with his head hunched forward and his knees bent up in his lap. He had to turn and just fall sideways to try and move out of the car. It was clear that he had to take extraordinary care not to break anything as he got out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I think you'd better drive, though. If you're up to it, I mean. I think I'd need to lay down in the back if I want to fit anymore.\u201d He shifted slowly, turning to you. \u201cBut all we have to do is look around a little, right? I mean...\u201d He sighed and shook his head. \u201cMujexa's probably going to be looking around here... I think he said his shelter's just camouflaged on one of the dirt off-roads nearby, so we'd better get looking around...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the dark? You'll have to do all of the searching, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour eyes can't really notice? I guess my eyesight's improved a little, too...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, it's more like, 'You're a cat and I'm not.' I can drive around okay, but you'd have to be the ones keeping your eyes open.\u201d You shook your head softly, seeing a momentary blush in his face as he moved into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh... Right. How long do you think you can go for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a few hours, tops. While I could look around in the daylight, you'd be exposed. We wouldn't be able to afford that. But if we don't manage it tonight, I think it's safe to say we'll be going on foot tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... Let's try to find it.\u201d You started the engine back up as you heard Likax struggling not to slam the door shut too hard. You took off to the roads, just trying to keep it steady. You could hear Likax jumping a little, his head brushing against the roof of your car and shifting each time you hit a stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even after a couple of hours of searching, you hadn't turned up anything. Although Likax still fit in the back of the car, it was difficult to ignore the sounds he was making as he shook around in the car. It was impossible for you to really get a good view out of the rear-view mirror, and he had trouble trying to turn whenever he needed to look out another window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d You kept driving as you moved. Although you were still able to drive, the fatigue of an incomplete night's sleep was hitting you fairly hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. I'm fairly certain I would be able to see it if we find it. We need to keep searching. We've covered a lot of space, but the information we have is pretty vague...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure I'll be able to...\u201d You tried to suppress it, but you gave a rather obvious yawn as you moved. You noticed Likax's head turn to look at you, both of his eyes gazing at you through the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTired, huh... We'd better stop, then. I don't think you're in any condition to be driving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I'll be alright. It's only going to be a little while before dawn, so I can manage for-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarson, you're already pushing yourself a lot. I may not be tired, but you still are. We need to stop now and figure out what we're going to do now.\u201d He signed a little as he gave your shoulder a firm pat, his arm shifting a little to push over the seat. \u201cThere's a good chance we won't find anything tonight, so we need to figure out something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded softly, just pulling the car over and trying to find a good spot to stop. \u201cRight, then... I've got a couple of ideas on what we could do...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight shaking of the car kept you awake enough as the two of you spoke. However, it didn't take too long before the two of you decided.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOkay,\u201d you finally said, \u201cif we\u2019re gonna stop for a while, we might as well try and find the safest place possible.\u201d You opened your glove compartment and pulled from it a stack of maps. When you had first gotten the car as a high school graduation present, your mom insisted that you always keep no less than six different maps at any time, \"just in case\". You had never bothered to really look through any of them, as the extent of your traveling was just from Louisville to Danville and back again, but you were sure glad to have them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what we have here,\u201d you said as you flipped through them. \u201cLouisville city map, Kentucky state map, Indiana...\u201d You shook your head. \u201cNothing specifically for Atlanta or Georgia. I guess we\u2019ll have to make do with Southeastern United States.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unfolded the map and held it up so that both you and Likax could get a good look at it. Scanning it, you found Georgia and were relieved to see there was an insert for the Atlanta metro area on the edge of the map. \"How \u2019bout this place?\u201d you asked, pointing your finger. \u201cChatahoochee River National Recreation Area. It looks big enough and sparse enough that we should be able to find a place there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax rubbed his chin and slowly started to nod. \u201cAnd it shouldn't be too far away, either. The last sign I saw said we were six miles from the Route 19 exit, and it looks like the park's only a few more miles north on that highway. Here, give me the map. I'll navigate from back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreed, you started the car up again and headed in what you hoped was the right direction. About five minutes had passed when Likax said, \u201cGet off at this exit.\u201d You did as he directed, and a few more minutes later, you saw the signs for the Recreation Area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered, your heart sank when you saw several cars lined up in a parking lot, fearing that this park was more popular than you had guessed, but as you drove along, you didn't see signs of anyone at all, and there seemed to be enough forested area to provide cover for the bobcat. Maybe this would work as a hiding spot, at least for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d Likax\u2019s arm shot out as he yelled, causing you to jump in your seat slightly. He was pointing to a well-hidden dirt path into the woods off the left side of the road that on your own you would almost certainly have missed. You quickly turned, skidding the tires slightly, and jostling both you and the huge bobcat as your car hit the dirt at much too fast of a speed. You heard a loud THUNK, and you looked in the rear view mirror to see that Likax was wincing, having whacked his head against the roof of your car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d you exclaimed, quickly bringing the car to a stop and turning around to make sure he was okay. \u201cI didn't even notice it until you said something!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Likax shook his head, embarrassed, as he rubbed his head with his paw. \u201cI should have pointed it out sooner. And, um, I\u2019m sorry for, uh, that.\u201d He gestured towards the roof, which had a slight but noticeable dent in it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d you said, grinning, as you reached your hand up to help soothe the small bump forming. \u201cThough I\u2019m not sure if \u2019dented by bobcat skull\u2019 is covered in my insurance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure all was well, you continued driving, slower and much more careful this time. You kept your eyes as open as possible, making sure you didn't see anything that would indicate the presence of another human being: a car, a bike, footsteps in the dirt -- anything. As far as you could tell, it seemed like no one had used this path in years. Once you had gotten far enough in that you were satisfied, you stopped, put the car in park, and shut the engine off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s stay here for a few hours,\u201d you said, opening the door and getting out of the car, turning to watch Likax struggle to get himself in a position to put his hand on the door handle, without much luck. You quickly opened the door for him, and his legs, which had been bent up in order to fit in the back seat, sprung out of the car, his feet thumping as they hit the ground. You heard a loud ripping sound, and you realized that the shorts Likax had been wearing were now completely gone, and, for better or for worse, he was left naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, how do i--\u201d The two of you soon realized that Likax wasn't going to be able to just stand up, at least not without causing some major damage to your car. After a few moments of trying to figure out what to do, he began to slide himself out, slowly, but surely. Eventually, he got far enough out where he could get his balance and lean up and out of the car without hitting his head on the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rose to his full height, you became aware of just how much the bobcat had grown during the drive. You were now eye level with his hips, meaning he had to be over ten feet tall. He truly was an amazing sight to see, but you knew that meant he was now a much bigger target for those pursuing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, though, Likax seemed to be not at all fazed. \u201cLet\u2019s hike a little ways into the woods,\u201d he said, \"so in case someone comes by they won't see us right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and began to walk at his side, but the combination of the bobcat\u2019s much longer legs and your extreme fatigue meant that it soon became a losing proposition to keep up with him. Noticing this, Likax bent over, wrapped his arms around you, and gently picked you up. Your first instinct was to protest this, but you didn't have the energy, and it did feel good to be pressed against his warm chest and hear the loud, healthy beating of his heart inside. Within a few minutes, you were drifting off to sleep, just as Likax found a large tree to sit down and lean against, and just as the sun was beginning to rise.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You weren't sure exactly how long you had been asleep. There was barely any light out, so you couldn't have been out for more than a few hours. However, your awakening was hardly peaceful. You snapped up a little as you felt someone shaking you rather violently. You tried to mutter as you moved and opened your eyes, but before you could even speak, you noticed the barrel of a gun pointed right at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet. Don't move, and don't make a sound.\" You stiffened suddenly, and your hear was racing as you looked at the letting out a nervous, choked noise. You tried to turn, but the firearm was suddenly pressed to your forehead. \"Don't make me say it again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed before giving a slow nod, trying to shift a little. The feeling of Likax's fur helped confirm that he was still right there with you. However, he wasn't moving at all, even as you felt a couple of hands grabbing your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your big friend here's asleep.\u201d You heard the voice answer as you were pulled upwards. \u201cWe might not be able to put him down for very long, but he won't do anything rash if you're out of his reach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his sleep, Likax's arms still pressed firmly on you and made it difficult for the men to get you loose. However, he wasn't in a position to resist, and in a minute or so, you were pulled free. You could barely move, and you couldn't even get a good look at your assailants. They were all in street clothes, but each of them was wearing the same vest, adorned with a splotch of white across the chest. However, as you were pulled up and slowly regained enough of your senses to get a better look, your heart sank. It was painfully clear that each of them was human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dragged a short distance away, and you could hear one of them speaking. \"Come on. We don't have time to loiter. At his size, the tranqs will only work for ten minutes. Get him secure.\" You swallowed as you felt  the two men holding you pull your body back against a tree. Within a minute, you had been tied against it, and your hands had firmly been bound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you need me for?\" You manage to speak out, but feel someone give your head a firm smack. It stung a bit, but you were quick to realize they weren't trying to injure you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet. We're not interested in you.\" You heard one of the guys next to you speaking, keeping a rather disinterested voice. \"We only want the bobcat. You're only here to make sure that he doesn't snap at us when he wakes up. If you cooperate, we'll be on our merry way soon enough.\" You grunted as you struggled a bit, but saw the man with the shotgun approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha? If you think that I'm going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even have to do a thing. He wakes up, he sees you like this...\" You felt the gun pressed to the side of your head. \"Then he'll talk. It'd be impossible for us to talk with him otherwise. All we need is for him to stay still long enough for us to talk. You're just our guarantee to make sure he doesn't run the moment he sees us. So as long as-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant! He's waking up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already? Even our conservative estimates said it'd be another minute... I suppose we'll have to keep this in mind.\" The man with the shotgun was quick to respond, and looked at you. \"We're prepared. Get his attention over here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrph... You awake, Carson?\" Your heart seems to race as you hear Likax's voice. His arm raised up to wipe at his eyes, and he tried to look down in his arms. However, before he had any time to fully wake, you heard the man next to you speaking again, the gun held firmly to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right here.\" One of the men spoke, and the unfamiliar voice quickly snapped Likax awake. His eyes seemed to jump immediately, and were pointing right to you within the span of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson! Who...\" He shook his head violently, standing up suddenly and glaring at Grant. \"Who are you, and what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just your cooperation. Things have been rough enough already. We figured this would be the only way to get close enough and make you listen. Just stay calm, and your little friend here will be free soon enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax took a heavy step towards you, and this time, you had to swallow. Even though he was clearly worried about you, it was impossible to ignore the threatening expression he had on his face. In addition, it was now clear that he had been growing in his sleep. However, while you had gotten used to the idea of him getting bigger, you simply weren't prepared for seeing the twelve-foot bobcat like this. You could swear the ground was shaking as he moved closer, and his almost rabid expression and bristling fur couldn't help but make you nervous. His entire body was tense and ready, and he looked like he would be ready to maul someone in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't alone in feeling nervous. Grant kept his gaze on Likax as he spoke again. \"D-don't move!\" Though he was trying to keep his composure, his voice had clearly cracked a bit as he spoke. \"You probably could take us all out right now. But you try, and this guy,\" he said, nudging you with his elbow, \"is gone for good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax kept his glare, and his expression remained tense, but his footsteps stopped as he just looked at the man. \"You'd better be telling the truth about letting him go. If you are, I'll talk.\" He only gave them a silent glare, bending a little to look at them. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just swallowed quietly as you heard them talking. You weren't completely sure what was going on yet. However, it only took a couple of minutes before you realized...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a few moments, silence filled the air as the two stared each other down. It quickly became clear that Grant was the group\u2019s leader, and judging by his grizzled appearance and gruff demeanor, he seemed like the type of guy who had probably stared down death without blinking at some point in his life. But even he looked to be sweating slightly when faced with handling an adversary more than twice his size, and the rest of the group looked even more nervous. You hoped that they\u2019d all be able to maintain their cool long enough to keep from making any rash mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax seemed to be growing more agitated as the seconds ticked on. \u201cI\u2019ll only ask one more time,\u201d he finally said, breaking the silence, \u201cWho the hell are you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you have a seat,\u201d Grant replied, motioning with his gun, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat growled but complied, sitting back down on the ground, crossing his arms over his knees and leaning forward. He kept glaring at Grant, a fierce anger apparent in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d Grant said, relaxing only slightly. \u201cNow we can talk. My name is Grant. I'm with the Enlightened Cabal. I doubt you've heard of our organization.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax shook his head. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Grant nodded, \u201cThen we\u2019re doing our job as intended. It\u2019s much easier to get our work done when no one knows to look for us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you do, then?\u201d Likax asked, sneering. \u201cAre you with the government?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant burst into laughter. \u201cYou're about as far off as you can be with that. No, we're an independent group that exists to, shall we say, help fix things that need fixing, especially when it comes to the anthro community.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2019Fix things that need fixing?\u2019 you thought to yourself as you eyed the various weaponry in the hands of each of your captors. That didn't sound good at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax seemed to be thinking along the same lines you were. \u201cSo is that why you're after me? Come here to \u2019fix\u2019 me? Perhaps change me into one of your kind?\u201d With each sentence, his muscles seemed to tense up more and more, as his hands clenched into fists. You could tell that he was thinking back to what he had seen before he had escaped from prison, the bodies of anthros who had been the victims of those sick experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant smiled, a strange smile that seemed genuine, yet cold and calculating. \u201cNo, my dear bobcat, the very opposite is true. The very purpose of our group is to help anthros achieve their destined superiority to humankind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax appeared puzzled at this, and you didn't blame him. \u201cWhat?\u201d you said aloud. \u201cA group of humans that fight against humans? That doesn't make any--!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words were cut off as one of the gunmen closest to you leaned over and smacked you across the face with the butt of his gun. \u201cShut the hell up, vermin!\u201d he yelled, scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Likax leapt from his seated position and lunged towards you, paws raised with claws extended, letting out a deafening roar that seemed even bigger than his already enormous size. With one swipe, he knocked your assailant to the ground, sending his gun flying. Likax quickly pinned him down with one huge paw, ready to slice him into ribbons with the other. The remaining gunmen seemed startled for a moment, but they quickly recovered and raised their weapons at Likax. Just as they were about to fire, though, you heard the sound of Grant\u2019s voice booming throughout the entire forest: \u201cEnough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Likax and the gunman stopped. Likax turned his head towards Grant, his face still enraged and his breathing heavy, but after a moment, he calmed down, stepping back  and sitting down again, obviously struggling with a multitude of emotions boiling inside him. Shaking your head, you eyed Likax warily. You couldn't believe that this was the same bobcat who you had carried out of the woods, frail and half-dead, just the day before. It was awe-inspiring to see him jump to your defense like that, but the ferocity and power he now commanded was undeniably frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who had attacked you slowly rose to his feet and scampered back over to the rest of the group, grabbing his gun from where it had landed. Grant shot him a look of apparent disapproval, but after an awkward moment, continued on with the conversation as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, Mr. Rufalo,\u201d he said, \u201cI promise that we\u2019re here not to hurt you but to help you reunite with a friend. I'm sure you know who we\u2019re talking about, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax\u2019s eyes narrowed as he slowly began to nod. \u201cMujexa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Mujexa. You see, the Enlightened Cabal has been allied with the Comradity since both our organizations were founded, and when Mujexa returned from his stay in Kentucky and asked us to bring you in for a chat, we were happy to oblige.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head began to spin as you tried to process all of this. \u201cWait, so you\u2019re trying to take us to Mujexa?\u201d you said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly who we\u2019ve been looking for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant walked over to you and shook his head. \u201cNo, we\u2019re taking the bobcat to Mujexa. You, boy, are going back to Kentucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you felt your blood turn cold. You started to protest, but decided to keep silent as the other gunmen aimed their weapons back at you, hoping not to create another incident like before. But there had to be some other option, right? You had been through too much with Likax for it to end like this; it seemed all completely wrong. But there didn't seem to be anything you could do .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Mr. Rufalo,\u201d Grant continued, turning back to face the bobcat, \u201cif you come with us now peacefully, we\u2019ll take you to see who you were wanting to see anyways, and your human friend will return back home, alive, safe, and no worse for the wear. Everything works out for everyone. Agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax sighed, his shoulders slumping, as he rose to his feet. The gunmen tensed up again, but Likax simply crossed his arms, looking back and forth between Grant and you. He clearly didn't like the terms he was being faced with, but it did seem like it might be the only way for things to end peacefully. You knew that Likax must be as torn up inside over this decision as you were: neither of you wanted to leave each other. But if this was what was best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Likax finally said. \u201cWe stay together. Either Carson comes with me, or neither of us go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown crossed Grant\u2019s face for a moment, and he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible, Likax. For one thing, neither the Comradity nor the Cabal know anything about this kid. There\u2019s no way we can trust him enough to bring him into a base, especially one of such strategic importance as this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax closed his eyes and turned his head down. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI trust him more than anyone else on Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t up for debate, Likax,\u201d Grant muttered. \u201cComradity tradition says that the only living humans allowed in their bases are members of the Enlightened Cabal. Mujexa would never agree to letting him in with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Carson and I will go back home to Louisville and see if we can find someone who can help both of us. Together.\u201d Likax took a firm step towards you, the ground trembling under his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be possible, either,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIf Mujexa has said he wants to meet with you, he will meet with you, the easy way or the hard way. I hope for your sake that it's the easy way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax kneeled down, bringing his face right in front of Grant\u2019s. He didn't seem angry anymore, but an sensation of intensity emanated from him, something almost indescribable. \u201cThen,\u201d he simply said, \u201cwe have a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared each other in the eye for what seemed like an eternity. Finally, Grant turned away from Likax, shaking his head but saying nothing. Likax\u2019s eyes moved from him over to you, softening as they did so. In this moment, looking into the big bobcat's eyes and seeing how much he cared for you, everything seemed to change, and you instantly felt that there was no need to worry. No matter how this situation resolved itself, Likax would be there for you, and you would be there for him. Neither of you were going anywhere without the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Grant finally said, breaking the silence. \u201cThe two of you can come to see Mujexa together. I have a feeling that it may be the worst decision I've ever made, but so be it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA relieved smile filled Likax\u2019s face, and you began to relax. It looked like things might finally be starting to fall into place for the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d Grant continued, turning back to you, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to be able to just waltz into a Comradity base. Like I said before, the only humans that are allowed in are the Cabal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d you said, \u201cwhat does that mean for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means,\u201d Grant replies, \u201cthat before we head to the base...\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You must be initiated into the Enlightened Cabal.\" Grant shook his head quietly as he looked at you, and the men accompany him jerked up to look at him suddenly. He didn't seem to bother giving them a response, but focused on your skeptical expression instead. \"I've already told you more than you should know about the cabal. This is the only way you're staying with Likax, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a small nod, but it seemed as though you weren't the only one who was suspicious of the whole thing. One of the men nearby pitched up, his voice barely containing his disdain. \"We just found out about this guy a few hours ago! You know that we can't formally invite someone until at least a half a year! How are we supposed to just go along with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are special cases for a reason. It wouldn't be the first time we had someone who urgently needed in.\" Grant walked closer quietly, and though he had lowered his arms, Likax still shifting a little closer to you when he saw the man approach. \"He'll just be an initiate. We can treat him like provisional members. It'll be enough to get him into the Comradity.\" He moved in, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small knife. Likax's growl only made him turn his head this time, as he glanced back at the bobcat. \"I'm untying him. That's all. He'll be coming with us, so we might as well let him loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat quieted down, only giving a small nod as he approached. You felt the ropes around you falling, though Grant certainly wasn't gentle as he grabbed your arm and pulled at it. \"Come on. You can argue more when we're not out in the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's paw quickly moved, and you could feel his grip in your free hand. You turned to him, and he certainly didn't look happy with the way you were being treated. However, you gave him a small nod as you walked, his wide strides keeping up with you easily as you were pulled along. \"It's alright, Likax. I've been worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow, I can't imagine that.\" He shook his head quietly, and his eyes shifted sideways, throwing an open glare at the man who had struck you before. The man had the same expression, but it seemed to pointed towards you, and not Likax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I'm going with you. Think that's more important right now...\" You manage to give his hand a small squeeze as you walk along, seeing him duck a little to keep under the tree branches that you pass by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back at you, giving your hand a firm squeeze in return. However, a quick tug from Grant soon brought your mind back to the situation at hand. \"Keep quiet. We already attract enough attention without the noise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's hand seemed to clench for a moment, keeping tight against you. Though he was following quietly, it seemed his nerves were still on end. With everything going on, you couldn't blame him. You cleared your throat a little bit before asking in the quietest voice you could manage. \"So, how are we going to be moving? I don't think most vehicles will work now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've already got something prepared for Likax. We weren't sure exactly when we would find him, so we were ready for him to have grown a lot more than this.\" Grant continued walking, his tone cool and collected once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... good.\" You kept walking, quietly, glancing around. You were more than a little tense from the constant stares you were getting from the others. \"So... I'm supposed to be initiated into your...\" You sentences drifted into silence as you stopped yourself from speaking. Your first instinct had been to call them a cult, but <br>\r\nit was more than clear them would be a bad idea. \"Your group. What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Lucky for you, new initiates are only given tasks and little else until they can be evaluated further. All you have to do for us is to take a few vows to assist anthros, and to follow our tasks without asking questions. We're not foolish enough to trust newbies with anything more than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax spoke with the sound of a threat in his voice. \"He's only joining you because he has to. You'd better force him into anything dangerous, or else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Grant gave a small chuckle. \"Normally, we have a background check, and watch someone for months before even offering this much. Even then, half of the people we invite get kicked out within a month without even knowing the name of our group. As long as your friend keeps his mouth shut and sticks with you, he'll be fine after all this is over. As for danger...\" He spared Likax a small glance, an eyebrow raised. \"You realized what's happening, don't you? You should know that he's in enough danger just by staying with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax seemed to pause, and you had to stop when you felt him hold still. However, you gave his hand a small tug, before nodding to him. \"Likax, I told you... I know. So don't worry, okay?\" He swallowed, but managed a small smile at you before he resumed walking. You turned back to Grant, speaking firmly as you resumed walking. \"Look. Don't push Likax, alright? He has enough on his mind right now.\" Likax seemed to turn a little to you, but you continued speaking as you tried to keep your eyes from wandering back to the bobcat. \"I don't know anything about your whole purpose, but you can be sure that I'm going to help Likax.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men walking behind clearly disproved, and even Grant gave a small \"Tsk\", but he nodded. \"That'll do for now. If you're busy helping Likax, that's enough. The moment you leave him-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen.\" Your voice and Likax's both rang out at the same time, and you couldn't help turning a little to see him. He was glaring straight at Grant, but you could see the slightest hint of a blush on his face, and his hand squeezed yours a little more firmly as he walked. Grant didn't bother to give a response, and the next few minutes passed in silence as you walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going, anyways?\" You eventually broke the silence when your pace seemed to slow, eventually making it through a bit of brush and to the edge of the trees. You tried to look for the vehicle you thought you'd be using, while you heard Grant speak. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The initiation must be held at a specific place,\" Grant replied. \"Every member of the Enlightened Cabal since my grandfather founded the group seventy-two years ago has been initiated in Holden's Grove; I'll be damned if I'm going to change tradition now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell Likax didn't like this answer. \"Do we really have time for this? Need I remind you, I'm a fugitive on the run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking back at the bobcat, Grant dismissively waved his hand. \"Don't worry about that. We found you first, so you're going to be fine. Besides, the ones looking for you aren't close enough to find you in the next forty-five minutes; we'll definitely be done by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax sped up his walking until he was side-by-side with Grant. \"And just how do you know that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we do, Likax.\" Grant didn't seem to want to explain it any more than that, but when Likax started to growl lowly, he sighed and continued. \"Look, our surveillance team back at base is hardwired into the tracking systems of both the FBI and the Georgia State Police, so we know where any squad vehicle for either organization is at anytime. No one's even close to this park right now, so unless you plan on suddenly taking off running for the nearest 7-11, then you'll be fine. Besides,\" he said, seeming to snort in amusement, \"half the Georgia State Police are on the Comradity's payroll, so to speak. They'll make sure that no positive progress is made on this case for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat seemed to accept this answer for now, and the group continued silently for a few more minutes. The trees in this part of the woods seemed to be getting denser and denser, and you started to worry that Likax might not be able to fit easily, or at the very least may start to crawl. He seemed to be squeezing by, however, and soon you arrived at a small clearing of trees, no bigger than fifteen feet across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, there's only room enough for me, the 'initiate', and two assistants. He motioned to two of his men, who handed their weapons off to the others and headed into the clearing. \"And Likax, the ceremony requires an anthro to sponsor the human for initiation, so seeing as you're the only one here, that'll have to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Likax shook his head. \"No way, I'm not participating in any of this. We're only doing this so that Carson and I can stay together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping closer to the bobcat, Grant glared up at him, a feet that seemed both gutsy and unnecessary at the same time. \"Look, Likax, I don't like this any more than you do. But if there's one thing that's more important to me than fighting for anthros, it's honoring the traditions of our fore-bearers. And this is a tradition that cannot be changed. Either you do this, or the whole deal's off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skipped a beat as you saw Likax start to clench his fists and start to growl again. Quickly approaching his side, you placed your hand on his knee and looked up at him pleadingly. \"Likax, I know this isn't what either of us had planned. But it'll be okay, I promise. And besides, I wouldn't want anyone else by my side for this, anthro or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson\u2026\" As the now fifteen-foot feline looked down at you, the expression on his face soften, and his refusal seemed to melt. He closed his eyes for a moment, taking in a deep breath, before finally saying, \"Okay. I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Likax,\" you smiled at him, gently rubbing your hand against the back of his knee. As you did this, you could swear that, for a moment, you heard the large bobcat purr. Or maybe that was just your ears playing tricks on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Grant sighed in relief. \"All you have to do, Likax, is to answer \"I do\" when I ask if any anthro sponsors this human. Try to use your full name, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Likax stepped into the grove, having to squeeze between two fairly close trees, barely making it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone, Grant turned to you. \"Carson, as for you, just follow along and repeat after me when I tell you to, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" you answered, trying to appear as positive about this experience as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing,\" Grant said as he pulled something out of his pocket. \"You'll have to wear this blindfold for the majority of the initiation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide in alarm as he handed the long black cloth to you. \"Blindfold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Grant replied, \"Don't worry, nothing bad will happen. It's just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tradition, yeah.\" You didn't want him to have to go into another mini-speech again, figuring that the initiation itself would have enough of those. \"Whatever.\" You wrapped the blindfold around your eyes, allowing Grant to tie the knot in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Initiate,\" Grant said, his voice suddenly becoming more formal-sounding, \"take my arm and follow my lead.\" You reached out in the darkness, feeling the arm of Grant's jacket, and followed along as he slowly led you into the grove. After a moment, he called out, \"Stop!\" and you did as instructed, letting go of his arm. You could feel the warmth of your bobcat friend standing right behind you, and you smelled a slight mix of chemicals and smoke, as if someone had just struck a match, but other than that, your senses were completely cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Grant's voice boomed from directly in front of you. \"Initiate! You have been brought here today as a candidate to join our organization. Until now, you have only heard rumors and have received shadowy information about our group, but nothing concrete. You may have even began to question whether or not our group even really exists. Tonight, that shall change. Tonight, you will dedicate yourself to the betterment of all anthros. Tonight begins your journey to becoming Enlightened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant let a few dramatic moments pass before continuing. \"However, only those who have already provided service to anthros can begin this journey. Do we have an anthro present who wishes to sponsor this human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds pass before you heard Likax's low voice above you. \"I, Likax Rufallo, sponsor Carson Fischer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likax,\" Grant continued, \"what has Connor done to deserve the honor of becoming Enlightened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment before Likax responded again, and you could tell he was considering just how much he should share. \"He\u2026 He saved my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant considered this for a moment. \"That indeed is a great service, Likax. I will accept your sponsorship. Carson Fischer, do you accept this sponsorship for membership?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about replying with a smart-aleck comment, but the weightiness of the situation led you to simply reply, \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then raise your right hand. Do you, Carson Fischer, accept membership in the Enlightened Cabal, voluntarily and of your own free will\u2026\" Grant's voice seemed to get caught up on that last phrase, but he quickly continued, \"\u2026 and thus will here-forth work to advance the positions of all anthros to their rightful place of power?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, you nodded. \"I do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove the blindfold,\" Grant ordered one of the assistants. As they did so, you gradually became aware of two candles that the assistants were holding, the only source of light in the grove. \"Carson, you are now a member of the Enlightened Cabal. If you do not take on this initiation seriously and with the importance it commands, you will quickly have that membership revoked. But if you keep true to the virtues that have brought you this far, the virtues that have led this collective, then you will surely succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stared at each other, and you almost got a sense that Grant was reevaluating his prior judgement, trying to decide whether or not you actually might be an asset to the group. Maybe he was just giving you the evil eye, though; he was very difficult to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then,\" Grant said as the two assistants extinguished the candles. \"We're done here. Let's go see the Comradity.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk away from the grove was just as tense as the walk to it. Although you were now a member of the Cabal, it certainly didn't feel like anything was different from five minutes ago. However, while the ones accompanying you were still grumbling a little about it, Grant looked oddly thoughtful as he walked ahead. You stayed a short distance behind, trying to help Likax out through the path as they moved ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat... wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.\u201d Likax spoke again as he managed to get loose from the brush. With an effort, he managed to slide out from the area, a tangle of wood and leaves caught in his fur. \u201cA little more cloak-and-dagger than I would've liked, but it doesn't sound like you're getting pulled in too rough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, at least.\u201d You held onto Likax's hand as he stood back onto his feet, crouching to try to keep his head somewhat level with yours. \u201cI just hope that they can actually keep you safe, and don't get you involved anything insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you're the one who just joined up. You'd better just hope that they have the good sense not to ship you out or something.\u201d He gave a sharp glance up towards the others as he continued to walk, pulling your hand and tugging you a little closer as he moved. \u201cI don't want you getting sent away...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant gave a slight sigh, rolling his eyes a bit before he looked back at the two of you. \u201cYou know I've been paying attention, right? It's hard to miss the fact that you two are trying to stick together because you're in love.\u201d The two of you stopped and stared for a moment, both of you starting to try to say something before Grant spoke again. \u201cFine, close friends. Or crushes. Whatever. It doesn't matter to me. All I know is, you two are gonna keep me busy enough just trying to work around whatever it is you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax was too stunned to speak. He seemed a bit dazed after hearing someone else say it. You could see his shy expression, and you knew your expression probably wasn't much better. The two of you stared at each other in silence for a couple of minutes, before you were eventually able to get out a few words. \u201cS-so... What are you planning on having me do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShort term? He'll come along with us. We can say we're introducing him to the Comradity, if we need to. Once we get you into the base, we'll have a bit more time to plan from there. Long term? That's what I'm trying to figure out. As a new member, you normally wouldn't even see Likax. He'd easily count as classified, and we'd normally want to put him somewhere out of casual reach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I'm not just going to sit around while you're making Carson do your bidding!\u201d You felt Likax squeeze your hand a little more firmly. He had recovered his voice now, and you could hear a growl coming from him, his entire body rumbling a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBit dramatic, aren't you?\u201d Grant placed his fingers on his forehead as he kept walking. \"At the moment, the closest we can get is saying Carson was the one that brought you in. In that situation, we would normally keep the two of you together, and make sure that neither one of you leave.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine.\u201d You had responded without a moment's pause. Likax stopped walking to look down at you, and your head turned up to meet his. \u201cIt isn't like I was expecting to go out a lot while we were on the run. As far as I'm concerned, if I can keep an eye on Likax, that's enough.\" Likax blinked a couple of times before smiling at you, and you had to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, keep moving.\u201d You had heard one of the men speaking as they went further ahead of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go on ahead, Jacob. Get our transportation warmed up. Andrew, you head for Carson's car. Keep an eye out for anybody nearby.\u201d Grant slowed down slightly, and the others seemed to hesitate. However, they both gave a small nod before going ahead as Grant turned to speak directly to the two of you. \u201cLook, you two. As much as you two want to stay together, it puts you in a bad spot as far as the Enlightened Cabal is concerned. We don't usually have situations where we need to protect a human. You might be an initiate now, but under normal circumstances, you'd be given a few jobs in the immediate area. If you couldn't handle most of them, you'd be kicked out before the month's out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax gave a small grunt as stood there, shaking his head. \u201cIf Carson gets kicked out, then I'll-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant stopped walking ahead, and turned to face the two of you. \u201cLook. I'm trying,\u201d He replied with irritation, \u201cto account for everything that could happen. And quite frankly, at this phase, I don't know exactly what the Comradity wants to do with you. I don't know how long the Cabal will have to keep their eyes on the two of you. But I'm doing my best to make sure you stay together under our watch. The alternative is letting you get captured or killed or whatever else when you run off. And none of us would want that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax faltered as Grant spoke, and you had give his arm a bit of a pull. \u201cCome on, Likax. I don't completely know what's going on, but they're definitely trying to keep you safe right now. We can trust them for now, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax gave a small nod as you released his arm. Grant seemed to be satisfied with things, and resumed walking ahead. You sighed and start to move as well, but suddenly felt Likax's arm sweep around your body and lift you up. You made a sharp, startled noise, but turned up quickly to see him looking back at you. \u201cThis'll be a bit faster. You don't mind, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d You blushed a bit, but managed to meet his eyes with a small smile as he resumed walking. His fur was still on end, and his stride was a little rough as he walked. It was easy to tell that he was still a little on edge. It was understandable. Even with his body holding yours, you felt the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax easily caught up with Grant, and held you securely in his arms as he moved forwards. Everybody moved silently for a couple of minutes, pushing through the trees as Grant retraced your steps back towards your car. It seemed as though everybody was thinking, but your curiosity made you speak out. \u201cSo... If I can't leave to do the Cabal's tasks, then how am I supposed to stay as a member?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we're lucky, we can just stick you on guard duty for Likax. That'll save us a lot of trouble, and it'll give you the excuse you want to move around with him.\u201d Grant sighed a little and shook his head. \u201cIf things aren't that smooth... Well, normally, you wouldn't have to do anything too extraordinary to start with. Mostly some scouting out. Keep an eye on a few important figures, and report back with any information that might be valuable. We might be able to figure out something if the Comradity's willing to use you as a go-between.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax raised an eyebrow as he heard Grant speak. \u201cThat's all? If that was all he needed to do, then there wouldn't be a need for this kind of secrecy, would there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsing a newbie for something like that is already a major risk. Normally, we'd ask him to do something like this once he's trustworthy. Initiates aren't shown much of the organization. Too much of a chance of an information leak.\" Grant stopped as your car came into sight. \u201cHere. Andrew will take your car for you. Grab everything you want to bring, give him your keys, and then we can hurry off.\u201d He stepped moving towards the brush nearby to speak with Andrew, who was waiting nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax let you slide out from his grip and onto your feet. You unlock the door and dig through the glove compartment, putting everything you could spare into your pack. You hesitated for a moment when you saw Javier's gun again, checking the safety on it before dropping it in with the rest of your things. You sighed a little bit as you glanced over the back seat, making sure you didn't leave anything important. \u201cAre you sure that I can't just follow you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot an option. Likax wouldn't fit, and we can't afford you getting lost. Andrew will drive it to a secure spot. You could go with him, but you'll probably want to ride with Likax instead.\u201d Andrew seemed to have a sour look on his face as he approached, but Grant ignored it and continued. \u201cAs for our transportation...\u201d Grant glanced over your shoulders, looking into your car as he spoke. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group walked along the dirt path in silence, traveling the quarter mile or so until the paved road came into view. Parked on the side of the road was what looked to be a box truck, about the size of a small U-Haul. It was painted completely black nearly all over, except for the windows, the tint of which was darker than the legal limit. Of course, if this was a vehicle of an organization like the Enlightened Cabal, then that probably wasn't a concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Grant's people, one man and one woman (the first female you had seen in the group) were sitting in the cab of the truck. As Grant walked closer, he stopped for a moment, listening and glancing from side to side. \"We're clear,\" he whispered, then signaled with his hand towards the two in the truck. They nodded, and the truck's lights came on and the engine came to life, though it seemed to be much quieter than any truck engine you had ever heard, more like something you'd expect out of an electric car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant walked around to the back and slid open the door, revealing a surprisingly spacious interior with small bench-like protrusions on either side. \"Likax, you climb in first. I want to make sure that my men are between you and anyone that might decide to-- well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's eyes narrowed but he didn't say anything, climbing into the truck and sitting down. The fur at the tips of his ears brushed against the ceiling, but luckily he could sit straight up without bending over. You climbed in next to him, sitting close enough to feel his body move as he breathed. Grant and the rest of his men climbed in behind, and as soon as the door slid shut, the truck jerked into motion, the motor nearly as quiet as when it was idle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of truck is this?\" you asked Grant. \"I've never seen anything this big run so silently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at a tablet computer, it took a moment for Grant to respond to your question. \"It's an advanced electric transport originally developed for the US Army. They rejected the design for cost overruns, so the Comradity was able to pick it up. Our two groups use it whenever we have to transport something without attracting much attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdvanced military equipment? The Comradity must have more resources than you had thought. Looking around, though, you realized that all of the funds must have gone into the purchase of the vehicle itself, as there was little visible equipment inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Grant continued, still staring down at his tablet, \"you'll be issued an entry-level rifle in two or three days, once we can get it allocated from our supply back at base. In the mean time, the pistol you have should be sufficient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Likax exchanged glances. You didn't think that Grant was watching when you grabbed the gun, but obviously he saw more than he let on. At this point, you realized that if the Enlightened Cabal turned out to not be on your side, then you were in a whole lot of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should only take us about ten minutes to get to our destination,\" Grant said as he turned to look up at you, but then stopped, as if he was unsure about what he was going to say. \"In\u2026 in the mean time\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c...If you have questions, I'll answer them-- Within certain limits, of course.\u201d Grant had a look of disapproval, but his voice didn't waver as he spoke. You could hear a few \u201ctsk\u201ds and saw a few disapproving looks from around the vehicle, but nobody argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's start with the basics, then.\u201d Likax's voice almost echoed in the back of the truck, filling the room. \u201cAll you told us was that you wanted to help anthros 'achieve their destined superiority to humankind', whatever that means. What, exactly, do you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot of things,\u201d Grant responded evasively as he kept tapping at his tablet. Likax raised an eyebrow at it, but Grant sighed and shook his head. \u201cIn general, we watch the important targets on both sides and gather information about them. See if there's anybody who would help to support anthros in society. Try to put anthro-supporters in a good place, and discredit detractors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat hardly scratches the surface of it.\u201d Likax was almost staring at Grant now, his ears perked and his body a little tense. \u201cIf you were only a political group, there'd be no point in hiding everything like this, and no reason to be handing out weapons to everybody.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant quietly evaluated Likax's statement before speaking again. \u201cOur means can be... Less than pleasant. We have... a number of eyes out and about, and we deal with more than just public figures. We try to figure out who's important, what inventions and developments might assist anthros more, which humans are willing to help and which influential ones need... persuasion. Weapons are for when we need to protect important targets, or watch potential threats. We try to avoid violence when possible. Much more difficult to try to conceal, and the Comradity is better-equipped for it... But I won't deny that it occurs on our part, too.\u201d Even as he spoke, Grant's eyes never moved from off of the tablet in his hands, too busy with work to take his attention off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered at the thought, a bit of concern entering your mind as you hear it. Likax's arm moved around, reflexively pulling you a little closer. You only gave him a small nod as you look back at Likax, holding his arm firmly. \"It's alright.\" You mumble out your words, doing your best to convince yourself as well as Likax. You were a little worried, but it wasn't anything beyond what you had been expecting back when you agreed to try to meet Mujexa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Likax's voice was a little gruff as he spoke, but he seemed to accept the answer. \u201cNext question, then. Why is Mujexa so interested in me, and why are you guys so interested in me? I've never been anybody important enough for <i>this</i> much trouble. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you're still alive somehow.\u201d Both you and Likax look at each other in confusion, but Grant nods his head a little. \u201cYou know the experiment you were in? We found out about that a while ago, and Mujexa's been paying attention to what details he could gather while he was stuck in prison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's body shook at the mention of it. You could feel his grip around you tightening, even pulling your body in against his as he tried to comfort himself. \u201cEasy...\u201d Your hand brushes gently over his arm, feeling it tense and press against you. You could tell that Likax had grown more since the last time you checked, and it was all you could do to try to hold him and comfort him. His breathing was still a little strained, but it looked as though he was in better condition when his head looked down at you. You managed a small smile back at him, pulling his arm a little closer and almost hugging it. As you keep holding him in as tight as you can manage, you look back towards Grant and nod. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat experiment, to turn anthros into humans?\u201d Both you and Likax hesitated, but you both nodded in response. Grant raised his eyes for a moment to see the two of you, before turning them down again and speaking as he worked. \u201cSo far, every anthro who's been experimented on has ended up dead. Some were half-mutilated by the time they died, some died before the first changes started to show on their bodies... Even the ones that were pulled out of the program after the first few sessions fell ill shortly after. By all of our accounts, you should've died late yesterday. We heard that you had been found in bad condition, but somehow, you're still here with us today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you look at each other nervously, and you only give a small nod to Likax, confirming what you remember. It was impossible for you to forget how Likax looked when his heart had stopped, back when Javier had proclaimed him dead. You're not sure if Likax knows what happened back then, but you could feel your heart pounding as you thought back on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs far as we know, you're the first one to still be up and moving after their experiments.\u201d You're not sure how long you've been quiet, but Grant's voice interrupts your thoughts. \u201cThe growth might've been an unintended side effect. We don't know. What we do know is that for some reason, you went through whatever they're subjecting to anthros to, and though you should be dead by now,  you're still a healthy anthro... As far as we can tell, anyways. We want to know why, and we want to make sure that the people in charge of the experiment don't find out about you. But I can't speak for Mujexa, so I can't say if he has any other plans in mind besides just watching over you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I see.\u201d Likax's voice was quiet, and you could tell that he was a little perturbed by what Grant had said. However, you couldn't see any way of discussing it with him without drawing too much unwanted attention to the two of you. You just held tight to Likax's body, your mouth dry and your heart still beating firmly as you just look back at Likax, your grip as tight as you can manage against his fuzzy arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a few bumps before your body shifts, pressing firmly against Likax's side. You shuffle a little awkwardly as you glance up at him before turning towards Grant. \u201cDid we arrive already? I thought we had more time...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant gives a small nod to the others as they get up and begin to open up the rear of the vehicle. You squint your eyes, expecting to have sunlight shining in and blinding you. But instead, you notice...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The truck you were in seemed to have parked in a room, if it could even be called that. The ceiling stretched high above, at least sixty feet in the air, and the wall opposite yours had to be at least two football fields away from where you were. The walls appeared to be made of rock, jagged and dark, like the space you were in had been blasted from inside a mountain or something. Several desks and planters were spread throughout the open floor, and doors and windows lined the walls, as if someone had tried to model this place off of some sort of office building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Comradity's Atlanta Base,\" Grant said as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over towards you and looking out the back of the truck, Likax whistled a little. \"This place looks huge! I had no idea the Comradity had anywhere near enough power or resources to have a base like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you grabbed Likax's paw, or more like his finger, and gave it a squeeze. \"I know. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but it looks like they at least might have the means to help us. Just\u2026 be careful. Watch your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling softly, Likax placed his paw on your shoulder, covering nearly your entire torso, and patted it gently. \"I think you might want me to watch yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you rubbed the side of your face against the side of his wrist. \"Hey, I'm the one with the gun, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Likax replied, smirking. \"I pack a little heat of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other men of the Cabal slowly filed out of the truck, followed by Grant, you, and Likax. The bobcat had much more of a struggle exiting the truck than he had getting in, and by the time he stepped out and stood up to his full height, the top of your head barely came up to his knees. He had grown well past fifteen feet and had to be pushing twenty. Gulping, you can't help but stare in awe at his imposing form, his slim but powerful figure, and, between his legs, the impressive--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fischer! Rufallo! This way!\" Grant barked out orders, motioning with his hand to follow him. Turning away from Likax, you jogged and caught up with the group, while Likax was able to move much more casually with his significantly longer legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunker you found yourself in seemed surprisingly busy, with dozens if not hundreds walking, and sometimes running, from one end to the other. It didn't take too long to realize that all of them were anthros. Some appeared to be much like the prison-tough types you imagined Likax was familiar with, while others looked more like regular office workers. You noticed, with some dismay, that most of them wore some sort of firearm, ranging from small pistols strapped to their belts to large-barreled rifles slung around their backs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked through the room towards the far end, most of the anthros didn't seem to pay any attention to your group. A few, however, seemed to narrow their eyes as they looked at your group, growling slightly. Many who did look your way, though, seemed to back off when they saw the towering nude bobcat that followed at the rear of your group, and turned and walked away rather quickly. One large, muscular wolf pulled out his pistol as you passed, holding it to his side while glancing between you and Likax with his teeth bared, as if to say, \"Don't try anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore them,\" Grant leaned over and said to you, low enough for the others not to hear. \"Many of the Comradity's members have been mistreated by humans for so long that they instinctively distrust any humans, even those allied with them.\" Out of the corner of your eye, you noticed Grant grimacing slightly, as if recalling some painful memory. \"It's\u2026 part of what we as a group are striving to overcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement. \"I understand. I-- I know all too well how cruel some humans can be.\" Looking into Grant's eyes for a moment, you begin to reassess your opinion of him. Behind the tough, grizzled demeanor, he seemed to be hiding some inner turmoil, something that had happened to way in the past. You decided that it might be worth your while to have a one-on-one talk with him at some point; he might have more in common with you than you presumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, though,\" Grant continued, \"while Mujexa doesn't exactly have a whole hell of a lot of respect for humans, he at least respects the history between our organizations. He'd flay alive any Comradite who so much as lays a finger on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a charming individual,\" you muttered. With every detail that you learned about this Mujexa, he seemed less and less like someone you would want to meet. You hoped that your stay with the Comradity would end up being a short one, as unlikely as that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour group arrived at the far wall and stopped, right in front of a  large steel door nearly reaching the bunker ceiling. Two armed guards stood on either side of the door, one a lion nearly seven feet tall, the other a smaller (but no less equally menacing) alligator. Both wore heavy-looking body armor and helmets, and carried two very powerful-looking rifles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Likax,\" Grant said, motioning towards the crocodile, who nodded and turned to open a panel on the wall, causing the door to start sliding open. \"This will be your room during your stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax glanced back and forth between the door, the guards, and Grant, gritting his teeth and clenching his fists. \"Why all the security? Am I being held prisoner\u2026 again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, Grant started to rub his temples with his fingers. \"No, Likax. You're free to go anywhere within the bunker. Not that there's that much you'd be able to see besides what you've already seen. There's only three or four rooms in the base you'll be able to fit in now, you know. This room is just the one we've prepared for you to sleep in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing his arms, Likax continued to frown. \"What about Mujexa? When do I see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for a few hours.\" Likax didn't seem to like that answer, starting to growl. \"Hey, don't blame me!\" Grant threw up his arms, exasperated. \"He's a night fellow, and sleeps during the day. It's just past oh-nine-hundred, so he probably will have gone to bed about an hour ago or so. And, believe me, neither I nor anyone else in this base has the power to wake him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bobcat started to tap his footpaw impatiently. Standing next to him, you placed your hand on the side of his knee, causing him to look down at you. \"Likax, neither of us got very much sleep last night. I think it might be a good idea to relax for the day until Mujexa's awake and ready to see us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Likax nodded. \"Yeah, you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'm glad the two of you understand.\" Grant said, turning and walking into the room, and the two of you followed. The room seemed large but rather empty, about a third the size of the main chamber that you had just come from. The walls appeared to be stone but much smoother-cut, with some odd-looking stains and burn-marks visible every so often.  \"This used to be a laboratory,\" Grant explained, \"until Mujexa decided that the Comradity's experiments needed to be completed\u2026 elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few pieces of what you could call furniture appeared throughout the room: the most prominent of which was a huge bed against the far left wall, the mattress almost fifteen feet off the ground, thirty feet wide, and fifty feet long. \"As I mentioned earlier,\" Grant continued, \"we didn't know quite how quickly we would find Likax, so we prepared for him to be a little larger than he is now. Of course,\" he said with a wry chuckle, \"you might end up growing in to it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your eyes, you continued to look around at the rest of the room. A table and single chair, both to scale with the bed, sat pushed up against the back wall, and on the far right side you saw what looked like a crude sink and faucet. \"This\u2026 actually doesn't look too bad, Likax,\" you said, smiling up to him. \"Kind of like your own little apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax seemed to soften his demeanor a bit and nodded slowly. \"Well, it's certainly better than prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the compliment, I guess,\" Grant snorted. \"As for now, I have to go debrief one of Mujexa's aides on just how our operation went.\" Glancing at you, Grant sighed. \"I hope, for your sake, Carson, that they don't have a problem with my\u2026 improvisation. You two can stay here. I'll try checking back with you in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Grant,\" you said as he turned and began to leave. \"And, good luck, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant stopped for just a moment, and you could swear you saw what looked like a smile forming on his face. Shaking it off, though, he continued out of the room, the rest of the Cabal behind him. A few moments later, the steel door started to slide shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose things could be worse,\" Likax said as he kneeled down next to you so he could look you face-to-face a bit better. \"Still, I'm not entirely thrilled about having that big steel door there that they could lock at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Likax,\" you said. \"But for now, we just need to trust that they mean what they say. It's all we really can do. And\u2026 at least we're still together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikax's eyes softened. \"Yes, we do. And I'm truly grateful for that, Carson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stared into each other's eyes for a moment, not wanting to do anything to ruin this moment. Finally, Likax stood back up to his full height and took a deep breath. \"So, what do you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

We should take it easy, right? I mean, there's a lot of stuff to get used to. The organization... The new room... And...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your new size,\" You say, reaching a hand out to try to hold onto his paw. He tenses before bending down completely wrapping your hand in his grip, squeezing it firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I know I've been growing ever since this whole thing started, but now...\" He swallows, his tail slumping a little against the ground as he looks to you. \"If this keeps up, it's only a matter of time before I end up a literal giant...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step closer, your forehead touching his chest. \"Hey... I'm never going to say no to having more of you around. It just means there's more of you to love, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could swear you felt his heart skip a beat. He pulls back with a hesitant expression, almost flabbergasted as he looks at you. \"Carson... You... You mean it? You love me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment before you realize what you just said. The words just slipped out of your mouth, but you know you meant them. Your cheeks began to burn as you awkwardly fumble for a few words, Likax pulls his paw away as he watches, the hesitation in eyes turning more and more into worry as each second passes by. You force yourself to look up into his eyes, the two of you both shaking from your nerves (him more than you). You swallow as you try to brace yourself, before you nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Grant already noticed something between us, right? And even Javier said something before. There's no denying it now... And I'd probably regret it if I didn't tell you while I still have the chance. Yeah... I love yoooouwoah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words are interrupted by Likax sweeping you right off your feet, into what must've been the biggest hug in history. You feel two arms completely wrapping around your back, pressing your body in tight against his fur. Your breath is squeezed right out of you as he holds you in tight, before shifting you up enough to press his mouth to yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis kiss firmly pushes in, shifting between your lips effortlessly. You barely have time to begin returning it before it breaks, leaving the two of you staring right at each other. Your pulse is racing, and as he starts to lean back, the two of you tumble onto the bed. The bobcat falls onto his back, smiling widely as he holds you up in a couple of paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson... You don't know how much I wanted to hear that... I just...\" He shakes his head a little, holding you tight. \"This is real, isn't it? You're really... I'm really...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It is.\" You reach forwards and press a hand to his cheek, holding him close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson... I love you, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pulled close, your body relaxing in his grip. You move enough to shift upwards on him before letting your lips meet his again, resuming your earlier kiss. The two of you hold against each other, letting the feeling of it linger as you embrace. You're not sure how long it goes on, but the minutes fly right by as you hold each other, kiss each other with the passion you've been reserving for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all you know, minutes or hours go by. All you know and care about is the fact that now, the two of you are together, doing more than you ever considered doing since so long ago. And through it all, your feelings for the cat... for <i>your</i> cat... are only growing stronger. Every time you press your fingers through his fur, you're brought deeper and deeper into a passionate fervor. And from the way he presses his paws against you, from the way his whiskers brush over you, you know he feels the same way about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Carson?\" His voice finally speaks out, breaking the silence the two of you shared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Likax?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess you like how I look, right?\" The slightest blush tinges his cheeks, but he still looks at you with a relaxed smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" You blush deep as you stare over him, your eyes passing over his bare body. His new size only gave you a better look at him, and your eyes still enjoyed every inch they saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" He quietly growls, a paw nudging at you, \"I think I deserve a full look at you, too.\" He lightly bats at you, the gesture making you shift a little on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha?\" You swallow and stare at him, not quite sure what to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon... Pleaaaaaase?\" He pouts, the slightest shift in his lips as he does. You can only take it for a few moments before you give him, tugging at the bottom of your shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine... But I'm not much to look at. After all, I'm-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wonderful, Carson.\" The moment your shirt's off, you feel a paw pressed directly to you. Likax slips his grip over you so gently, a shiver of delight passing through your body the moment you feel it. You almost freeze, but you can only smile when you see Likax beaming back at you. \"Go on, Carson... I want to see all of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind starts to fill with images of what it might lead. You holding close to Likax, pressing up to him, maybe even seeing what the catch's like when he gets a little eager... You mumble a little to yourself as you wiggle in his gentle grip. Your hands fumble down to your pants next, tugging a little and letting them slip down. They're at your ankles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a booming voice echoes through the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carson. Likax. Need your attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Grant's voice interrupts the two of you, bringing the moment to a grinding halt. You hear the bobcat growl in irritation, and you shout back into the air, \"What, Grant? I thought we were supposed to have some privacy here! I thought you didn't need us for hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mujexa's still resting, but things have changed. We need your attention now,\" Grant says, his irritation starting to show. \"Oh, and in case it wasn't clear enough, let me remind you of something. It's important that we keep an eye on Likax. That includes at least putting a few cameras in his room. So I wouldn't do anything you don't want us to see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had killed the moment before, that was just burning the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if you want to blush, shout, or just try to hide somewhere in all of Likax's fur now. You only manage to stammer out a little, as Likax replies with an irritated tone, \"What do you want, Grant?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's silence for a moment before he responds...</span></div></div>",

If not excuse me for writing this but I have not been able to find it. I don\u2019t know the name but I do know the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was a cold winter\u2019s night in Canada; you weren\u2019t sure what city the resort you were staying in was a part of.  Tomorrow is your parent\u2019s anniversary and they were down in town enjoying themselves at a party for the night. You live with your older brother while going to college, this semester you\u2019d taken off for the winter vacation. He is a hard worker at a good paying job. You got loan money when extra came in as well as getting small bits here and there from favors and short jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou didn\u2019t want to go to the party and stayed at the resort cabin, a nice two floor building fit for a group of people; although it was only you two. There was no reason for you not to go. No ill blood between you and your parents besides general family problems. You just didn\u2019t feel like going and thought that since you\u2019d see them the rest of your time here there was no reason to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe TV was off, not like you watched it very much. You preferred to read, which you were now, in front of a nice warm fire. A blizzard fell heavily outside making the windows rattle loudly. It knocked at your attention, especially when the wind blew hard making them rattle louder. The last time they did you snapped your book shut and grieved out a sigh as you slid up from the quarter circular couch. You went to the back into the kitchen where you left the pot on for boiling water. You made yourself some hot chocolate and sat back down to try and read again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou got through 27 pages of the book when you heard another loud rattle on the window. It hadn\u2019t done so that loudly in a while which made you look up to it shaking. And when you went to look at them and see if the latch was coming off the wind died down, and a quiet tap came from the front door. You thought it was your brother and stated, \u201cDid you lose the key?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was no answer. And after a long pause of confusing silence another low tap on the door, with long pauses between each until it ended at a fourth tap. You were a bit worried, thankfully it was a lodge so the area had patrollers to deal with trouble. Maybe it was your parents and they didn\u2019t hear you. Either way you walked towards the door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOutside it was pouring snow, freezing too, your eyesight was filled with white and yellow coming from the street light and the end of the path yet no one there. You were about to close the door until you noticed through the thick white a red trail followed by fresh tracks in the snow leading up to the door. You gasped as you looked down to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomeone had collapsed on the porch and was bleeding terribly. It was a person in shape but, it was also animal. It was a large white animal in the shape of a person. You almost mistook it for just an animal if it weren\u2019t for how large it was. You almost left it there until you looked down to its wounds. They were round, definitely gunshot wounds. You didn\u2019t just want to leave it there, so you carefully tried to lift it into your home. But it was very heavy so you had to lift it by it\u2019s head then feet before managing to get it inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou realized that the loud rattling from earlier was probably the gunshots. Which was why the window didn\u2019t move, so after you got the creature inside you stepped out. You examined the prints and the red in the snow. The prints were already covered up, but the red trail leading into the woods was still noticeable but short. You quickly cover them in more snow then ran back inside, closing and locking the door. \u201cThe blizzard should get rid of those tracks quickly. Phew\u2026\u201d you slid down from the door as your back was against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe you looked down and stood back up, examining the creature you left inside. It was unconscious and probably collapsed after knocking on your door. You slid it to your couch and managed to lift it up onto your couch after getting a towel to put under it. Then you ran upstairs and got a med kit, it was heavy duty in case of extreme emergency like the phones being down or the snow being too high. Looking at it closer, it was definitely male; and it looked like a snow fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere were three gunshot wounds in all; two on his back and one in the back of his leg. Only one still had a bullet left in it, the others must have dropped out, thankfully they weren\u2019t that deep. And none had punctured an organ. If they had he would need surgery that you couldn\u2019t provide. \u201cThis is going to hurt a lot, sorry. But bare with me. And stay alive.\u201d You removed the bullet and cleaned the wounds making him quietly yowl even while unconscious. After cleaning them you padded them with cotton and then dressed them. The leg shot was very close to the bone, even if it hadn\u2019t though he\u2019d still have trouble walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou turned him over with as much care as you could. You were a bit afraid before and your heart was racing. But you thought for a while as you treated him. He wasn\u2019t a scary creature coming to kill you. He had managed to clamber up to your doorstep. And with the last of his strength, knock. There was a human side to him, maybe not all, but some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou took a good look at him now in the light to see how he looked. His face was just like a snow foxes, with long hair around his fluffy ears trailing down to his bushy tail. You carefully opened one eye, it was twitching wildly so he was definitely sleeping. And probably having a very bad nightmare you wish you could comfort him from. He had bright turquoise eyes. You shut his eye and looked at his hands, they were just like human hands except with black pads. Then you looked at his legs, they were just like foxes legs except larger and with more muscle. His body wasn\u2019t muscular; in fact you could feel his bone through his fur. Wherever he was he wasn\u2019t fed well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho would create something like this? It\u2019s like some science fiction clich\u00c3\u00a9.\u201d You felt his fur; he cringed at your touch and whined in his sleep. You always wanted some strange thing to happen in your life. This was a good amount of strangeness at that. You just hoped that when he woke up it would still be to your liking\u2026no\u2026no matter the state he\u2019s in, violent or otherwise, you\u2019d still care for him. You did let him in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cold Friday night in autumn, you forgot the day but it was the first week of October. Right now all your attention was drawn to a single person. You passed him by in an alley where he smoked a cigarette bright enough to illuminate his face. You could smell the fact that it wasn't tobacco. The night air was damp but his visage made the oxygen a drought. Which is why you found yourself in this disgusting and horrifying place. Watching him from a lone seat near the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped lightly down the walkway, the smoke from the many lit cigarettes creating a sort ethereal fog around him. The crowed was in awe. Even members who had seen him before were still enthralled. Maybe even those who lay with him. He was truly a sight to see. His body was athletic and well fed, his work gave him just as much, but it also curved and swayed with the femininity of a great dancer. His dark, charcoal fur, was just close to black enough to see his fully black tribal tattoos plastered on his skin. His tail, hands, and bare feet were much darker of black. But the two things that drew in the night of his body was his bright pinkish red hair and bright yellow eyes. Besides his features were his clothes; gold hoop earrings, dark red pants, fishnet gloves that were finger-less and reaching up his arms with many holes and tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not drawn by the show or the ideals of sleeping with the attraction. You have never thought that way before. At least not to the point to bring yourself to a place of sweat and desperation. What had really brought you was his large collar that didn't touch his neck and reached out to the edge of his shoulders, for good reason. The front and back had plates with his stage name on the front carved in black reading 'Scarlet', the back having the word 'Slut'. But the part that had caught your attention, what shined in the gleam of his cigarette, was a bell attached to the end. It shined brighter then anything else he wore, the studs and earrings could not compare. Not even the silver stud on his open tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were drawn by this bell because you were the one who gave it to him, four years ago at Croncite Orphanage. His name is not Scarlet, it's Ferion, Ferion Vermilion. You and he had grown up in the same orphanage till you both turned eighteen. You went on to be a musician; you could play the: cello, piano, a little bit of the flute, but you specialized in the violin. You were sometimes called to auditoriums to play in orchestras for your skill. Even being invited to Venice to watch a concert, a place you only dreamed of going and now wish to live in. You also taught children to play instruments in personal lessons. You were also offered a job as a music teacher, but turned it down due to the amount of time it would have taken from you. And when extra money was needed, you'd take a part-time job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was the night of a concert in the city's main hall. But it ended too late for you to catch a bus back, which lead to you walking back to your home. Thankfully the new furry police kept the streets incredibly safe; morning, noon, and night. So you felt safe to carry your violin back with you. That's when you saw him and that's why you're here. Among the smoke, the drunkenness, the screams of pain and ecstasy, and many of the things you ignored. The only attention you gave was to the dim stage that began to glow from dark blue spotlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you were waiting for was one sign that it was definitely him. And as he walked down the runway a third sign came to your ears. 'Oh my darling I love you...and the kid who just stands tonight...' The opening words of the ending theme of a favorite show you both watched, 'Sorcerer Hunters'. It echoed into the chorus and his show began. He divided his steps into the song. Wording out the song as his body snapped and thrust into many positions with the sounds. Even tying in the runway pole with his motions. He must have practiced for a long time, on a dancing point of view he was flawless. And you knew this well from the many shows you were invited to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you watched, what you had been waiting to see came into play with the dance. His baggy jeans tightened as the collar inched over his shoulders. His body thickened as it climbed up the pole's length. Bringing more awe to the crowed, some writhing in painful enjoyment as their pants grew tighter then there could stand and their mouths drooling seventy percent alcohol. But you only watched on, clutching at your shirt and holding back your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song came to it's close you saw him twist around the pole, his height about a third up it's twenty-five foot length. That's when you saw in full what you'd come to see, what proved it was him. And the same reason police laws could be easier enforced. Ferion suddenly shot up in size with a heaving breath. His earrings were now only the size of regular rings to him. His collar fit to his neck. And his baggy pants were ripped to tatters that fell to the floor leaving only a new pair of ripped shorts holding back a bulge that could have easily torn through them given the strength. It disgusted you even more, but it was the final shred of proof that he was Ferion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause  one thing that made it certain, his contacts fell off when he grew revealing their original blue color that you knew very well. Then he took a pose around the pole and asked in a booming voice, \"Alright My Little Chiketties. Who's Brave Enough To Ride The Big Kitty Tonight? I Bite, A Lot...\" His voice was a giant tease, with all the sarcasm of an old actress hardened by the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the crowed of nervous and drunken people could make up their minds, you had already rose from your seat with your hand in the air, \"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked back to you and Ferion spoke again, \"Ooouuhhh, A New Toy For Scarlet. I Like New Toys...Meet Me In Room 302 In Back...Don't Keep Me Waiting...\" he exited through the large curtains as his tail flicked and fluttered. And when he left you picked up your carrying case and leaving as well. You'd gotten the perfect chance to meet him despite the circumstances...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sad that even with the new laws that were possible to be enforced, prostitution was not against them. Unless it was not what they called 'licensed'. The qualifications of which made as much sense as encroaching death being the same as living a normal life with an incurable disease. It was alright because there was nothing to be done about it. And with the inclusion of human and anthro size-changers like him, the palette of possibilities were only growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were your thoughts as you found yourself at the door of room 302 of the apartment complex behind the club you left, and never wanted to return. You knocked on the door and a habitual, \"come in,\" called to you. A song was playing inside, you didn't recognize it. 'I'm not a princess (a lot of anger in it)'. He was wording out the song as well while snorting a new so-called 'safe drug', the law was not without it's limits. Especially when said law does not enforce to not do wrong on some accounts. He turned back smiling with slanted eyes, \"a little something to keep the fun going. Speaking of which, since you're new and a cute newby at that, you get a discount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And unlike most of the lazy bitches here, I can go all night. Now tell me, what do you want to do tonight? I do a lot of fetishes; and you look more like the foot type. I like that type most, an old friend used to give me rubs all the time and it felt so fucking good. But I don't do extreme role playing shit, I hated Lord of The Rings,\" he was mentioning many things you already knew. Which made you clutch your violin case, then you shook off and closed the door. He had made his way into his bed against the poster covered wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the chair in front of the desk he sat in before, \"may I sit here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouh, a gentlemen...I don't get a lot of those. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you can pay for it,\" he kept up a sarcastic front. Behind it you could see what little care he actually had, what little was there was amplified by the powdered happiness. You sat in front of the bed. \"So what will it be, shy little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gathered the courage as you looked down to your hands, \"...Ferion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you know my name too, now it'll cost you a third of the usual...hell we can have all weekend if you want now...\" he was now lying on his chest with his legs in the air. His head stood on one arm, and his eyes still narrow with little more care then before along with his black ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just older in features. His hair was neon red instead of black, he never had tattoos, and he wore gold contacts. You could even tell his species which no one could, being that his real parents were both a cat and dog anthro. Making him end up with cats eyes and mostly tail except the silky end, and dog like muzzle. After looking him over you picked up your violin case and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face became perplexed as you spoke, \"...four years, and you still look the same...we'd both were running late to the train...you were later then me and I was stepping on as it was about to go. That's when you came running, growing too so you could move faster...and you gave me this...\" you showed him the violin. You're name in gold letters inside the frame. \"Just like the inside of your bell that I gave you before the train left station...\" Then you played a song, a song only for him. That you knew he could not forget with as many times as you played it. And tears welled in his eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Meet me on the roof.\" Ferion did his best not to show a trace of emotion as he spoke, and his voice seemed steady. However, you could see the uncertainty reflected in his twinkling eyes. He looked at you for a moment, before breaking away, his body moving in a quick stride as he moved through the doorway. Even as you watched him go, he didn't seem to be rushed. His walk was the same steady, practiced shifting he always seemed to use, and his posture maintained the same grace he always had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly packed your violin back in its case, before standing up slowly. Whatever you were expecting, it certainly hadn't been this. You weren't even sure if Ferion was acknowledging you or not. However, there really wasn't any choice for you to make. You had to follow him, and to talk to him. Now that you had confirmed it was really him, there was no way you could simply leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved back through the building, his tail catching your eyes as he waited near the top of the stairwell. He pushed the door open when he noticed you, quietly slipping through it. It was a bit of a climb for you, with one hand carefully holding onto the case. You were a little out-of-breath when you reached the top, before pushing the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small gust of wind brushed over your body when you made it outside. You took a quick glance around, only to see other, taller buildings surrounding the area. It felt a little crowded, and you tried to glance around the area, looking for where he might've gone. You couldn't see his figure anywhere, and he was certainly capable of making himself known if he wanted to. However, you did notice a rather small room, so you walked towards it quietly, opening the door and peeking inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerion was waiting for you there. He sat on a small bed quietly, his head turning to the door as you entered. It looked like he had put a little bit more clothing on while he was waiting, but it was all loose on him. His shirt was baggy, though it barely covered his stomach, and his legs were still clearly exposed. You could only look for a moment before turning away, trying not to stare too long. You were a little surprised as you looked around the room. Compared to where you had been, the place was rather sparse. It didn't have the same dim lights, the gaudy decorations, the music in the background... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my real room. For when I don't need to put up with some random, desperate guy.\" You heard his voice, but kept yourself from looking right at him. Instead, your eyes seem to bounce around the sides of the small space. The walls were pained a faded shade of red, and had a couple of photographs around. There were a couple of chairs, and on his desk was a small TV, and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart seemed to pause when you saw it. It was an old photograph of the orphanage, and of you two. You had gotten it taken when you were both going to leave together. You couldn't really say anything, and only took a minute to get a good look. Ferion followed your gaze to it, and let you look for a while, but his voice eventually broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when I'd see you again...\" You felt him take your arm and pull you in against him, hugging you tight. You had to give a small grunt as you felt him, his fur brushing up before sliding you sideways, sitting you next to him. He had a wide grin on his face as he spoke, staring at you. \"It's really been... four years? Hard to keep track...\" He simply held your hand firmly, and while your mouth was a little dry, you did your best to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Longer than I would've liked...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head as he stared at you. \"Better late than never.\" You felt his hand shift gently over your leg, leaning in closer as he held tight to you. \"I was surprised to see you, though... Never thought you'd ever end up coming to a place like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head quietly. \"I wouldn't. Just... You're an exception. I thought I saw you, so... I wanted... I had to make sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the show?\" He asked with a mischievous voice, his tail flickering over your lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard not to. You always were a good dancer, and you were good at... expressing yourself.\" You tried to dig around for the right words, but he didn't seem satisfied. You could feel his hand reaching around, slipping a little under your shirt. You held his arm in place, your voice still steady as he moved. \"I... can see why people would be interested in a night with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a quiet chuckle, before his tongue lightly flicked up your neck. \"Oh? So...\" His voice made you pause, the sound of it somewhere between a growl and a purr.  \"Are <i>you</i> interested?\" You had to swallow as you felt him eyeing you up quietly. His tail seemed to slip against you, and his leg slid along yours. You tried to back away a little, hesitant on what he was doing, before he suddenly just burst into laughter. He held onto your shoulder with both of his hands, pressing you down onto the bed as he held tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-ferion! What's the big idea?\" You couldn't help but stutter it out as he shook his head, trying to steady  himself as he quieted down. He wiped his eyes a bit, before sitting up and grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man... Still the same... I can't believe you're still like that!\" He grinned as he looked at you, his tone finally settling back on the cheerful one he always seemed to have in the past. Even in the roughest times, he had managed to keep a smile on his face, and it was the first time that you had seen a genuine one tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this! You were <i>acting</i> that entire time?\" You tried to keep your composure, but he kept laughing as he tried to look back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaaaybe. Maybe not.\" His laughter finally quieted down as his hands slid down, settling on the side of the bed. \"I really am glad to see you again, and I have to admit, I'm interested in what you think about me.\" He shifted his hand onto the back of yours, giving a light squeeze. \"But if it really was you, there wasn't going to be any way you'd let me do that without dinner and a movie first, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you!\" You firmly pulled his head in, wrapping your arm around and just running your fingertips through his fur. He kept laughing as you tried to hold him, just letting you dig for a moment before you felt his head drag your arm down, his whole body swelling up for a moment as he shifted into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally let go, he sat back down, though he didn't bother to shrink again. He did his best to keep looking at your face as he spoke, though now you were firmly seated on his lap. \"I really am glad to see you, though. I've only heard bits and pieces, but it sounds like you're doing well. I'm... glad you got to put my gift to good use.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... didn't think you'd end up using my gift in something like this, though...\" You reached up, giving the bell a small jingle. His whiskers seemed to droop as he heard you speak, but he quickly responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't plan on this, either. It only happened when I caught some guy's eye... One thing lead to another, and...\" He swallowed and shook his head. \"Look, I know it's not the best thing. But I am happy here.\" His voice almost had a pleading quality to it, and he hugged you tight against his stomach as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You like this job?\" Your tone was incredulous, but he seemed to give a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of it, I'll admit. There are some people I'd rather not meet. But... But I enjoy doing a lot of this.\" He picked you up easily, holding you gently against his body. \"I like being able to do something like this... To have this kind of freedom with my size and my body...\" He shifted you slowly, turning you to look you straight in the eyes. \"I like being able to show off my skills a bit...\" His tail gave a small flick as he turned, your eyes unable to help staring as he gave a bit of a pose, his once-baggy clothing tight against him and exposing most of him to you. \"And I like knowing that people...\" He growled playfully, one of his hands brushing over the front of his crotch. \"Enjoy this...\" He slowly let you down, his voice a little concerned as he spoke. \"I didn't have too many options after we left, but... I'm content with things. It may not be what I planned on, but I like being able to do this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice seemed to fade a little. He certainly seemed confident on stage, and while he was alone with you, he didn't really seem to be acting. He genuinely felt comfortable with his life right now, but you couldn't help the part of your mind that seemed to be nagging you. You closed your eyes and gave a quiet sigh as you tried to think of what you'd say. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been roughly twenty years since the world went to hell. It's been described any number of ways, but no matter how people try to explain it there's no way to really bring the chaos and horror into focus. Some people say that the pendulum of science and magic finally swung back the other way. Others theorize that our universe crashed into a parallel and another reality bled into ours. As far-fetched as the explanations sound, they still make too much sense. All anyone knows is that one night, when Jason was ten years old, the world flipped while he were sleeping. When he woke up, the world wasn't the world any more. It was some entirely different place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on the past two decades, he still found it incredible he survived. Most of humanity couldn't cope with what went down. People changed into walking, talking animals in flashes of light. Entire cities disappeared, only to be replaced by miles of primitive forest. The dinosaurs that populated these alien stretches of land were sentient, with their own cultures. Unfortunately, most of them viewed people only as food. Technology either went haywire or stopped working entirely. The people that were left either couldn't find a way to make it on their own or got taken out quickly by all of these...things they couldn't understand. There were reports that Buffalo had vanished entirely when a person found out they could make nuclear explosions simply by snapping their fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new society that he found himself in had just started, and even then it had happened in fits and starts. He lived in the western foothills of the Appalachian mountains, and a fairly eclectic town had sprung up in the valley below. People came up to barter for venison jerky or an ever-burning lantern that he had learned to make, and he found himself heading into town twice a month to spend a night at the pub that had just opened, or take care of business that needed to happen. For the most part, though, Jason left the town alone and they left him alone. He liked it that way. It was the first real quiet he had gotten in several years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why the sorceror was getting ready to blast someone to Kingdom come one night when he heard the most awful, terrified shriek sounding in the darkness. It roused him from a dead sleep just in time for him to hear something scrabbling on the front porch of his one-room cabin. He leaped out of bed and grabbed his wand for focus; he technically didn't need it to cast spells, but it helped when he was running on nothing but adrenaline. He ran to the front window to see if he could make out anything. Just as suddenly as it arose, the sound died. There was nothing out there but trees, the lit spiral of the Milky Way in the sky and the wide grassy field he kept around his property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened the door slowly. As soon as he did, something solid and fuzzy slid against his leg. He jumped back and pointed his want at it, felt his will immediately center in his chest and bolt from his fingertips into the wand. The tip of it glowed and sparked before he called it back again, dispelling the fireball he was going to hurl but letting the wand become his light source. Once he discovered what was on his doorstep, he couldn't blast it. It was a person, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore accurately, it was a Rabbit. It was bipedal, probably stood around five feet tall, and covered in white fur. At least, it would have been white if its pelt hadn't been matted with blood. It was completely naked and wheezing, its claws scraping against the wooden floor as it tried to crawl its way inside. One huge, dark eye wavered as it looked up at Jason. He couldn't tell if there was sentience there, or any kind of recognition. But it was clear that help was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help...me...\" it croaked, then collapsed in the threshold of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright pinpoint of light grabbed Jason's attention from the treeline twenty yards away. That speck of fire grew in size and intensity until he could feel the heat of it. That fireball collided with a tree stump in his front yard. A geyser of dirt and splinters roared up from the ground and came crashing back down on his porch, through his front door. All that was left of the stump was a few smoldering roots inside a crater five feet wide and three deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, adrenaline shot through Jason for the second time tonight. He pulled the unconscious rabbit into his cabin and stepped out onto the porch, his wand already vibrating with his will. Whoever these people were, they weren't going to get this Rabbit. They certainly weren't going to get away with blasting away part of his property, either...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason pulled the Rabbit inside his cabin none too gently, letting him drop on his floor. The sharp smell of blood filled his nose, mingling with the frightened scent of his new friend. It only seemed to help focus his adrenaline, to sharpen his response to these intruders. He lifted his wand and felt the rush of magic well inside him. The wood, made from a branch of willow in his own front yard, became an extension of his right arm. He could feel his will being made manifest through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you are,\" he shouted into the night, \"but you're trespassing on private property. I'm sure you just didn't know. I'm giving you this last chance to recognize your mistake and walk away. Just step off my land, and I won't think anything of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence in the dark for several moments. \"You have a Rabbit in there with you, I'm sure. He came this way, and his trail leads right to your front door. Give him up and we'll leave you in peace, stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lit the tip of his wand so that the gunmen could see his face, and so he might be able to see them a little better. He felt his magic draw forth into the light, but he also felt it moving backwards, behind him into his house. That's odd. It had never done that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who I may or may not have in my own house is no concern of yours. Just get off my land before this goes any further. You should know that I'm a wizard very well-versed in magic, and there's a lot I can do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence again. A different voice spoke up this time. \"We know what you are, wizard. We don't want any trouble; we just want the Rabbit. He might not look it, but he's extremely dangerous and he needs to be apprehended for our protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked back at the stranger on the floor. Up close, he didn't look as bad off as he did earlier. Most of the blood had dried, and he wasn't as small or scrawny as he seemed outdoors. The Rabbit looked at him with his big, dark eyes, a pleading expression on his face. He didn't have the look of an evil man about him; he didn't look like he could hurt someone if he wanted to. A look passed between them that told him everything he needed to now. He liked to believe that part of his magical ability was the gift of reading someone's nature quickly and accurately. Whoever this stranger was, he was the one in trouble. Not the bullies outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting story. Now let me listen to his and be the judge of who's dangerous and who's not. If he's as bad as you say he is, then I'll hand him over tomorrow morning. After he's been patched up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took the ensuing silence to see if he could find any of the people who were hovering around the edge of the tree-line. Judging by the voices alone, there had to be three or four people out there, tops. It would be difficult, but if he could get them clustered together and got a lucky shot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wizard, this is no affair of yours. Just give up the Rabbit and we'll be on our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens if I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason swallowed quietly as he tried to listen for a reaction from the men. There was a small murmuring ahead of him, and he could only pick out a few words from their conversation. He managed to catch something about too much magic flying around and about the Rabbit's reaction. He swallowed, his arm outstretched and at the ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden roar of gunfire from ahead made him instinctively jump back from the doorway. Fragments of wood split from the door frame as the shots rang out. He had barely managed to evade the first shots, and he quickly tried to take cover behind the walls as they continued. It was quite clear that the people intruding on his home were no longer interested in negotiations. His grip on his wand tightened, and the light within it seemed to shimmer as he prepared himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze passed over the Rabbit as he prepared himself. The creature had dashed to the corner, and was hunched and cowering in fear. He had pulled his ears down over the sides of his face, doing his best to try to shut out the noise. However, his eyes were still open, the fear he held clear as he barely squinted back at Jason. Jason only looked for a moment, before giving the Rabbit a small nod. \"Don't worry.\" The Rabbit stared at him for a moment, but a brief, loud bang made him try to tuck his head down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cursed quietly under his breath, inching sideways to get closer to the doorway. He moved his arm, careful only to expose the tip of his wand towards the forest. There was no way for him to get an accurate shot from his position. At least, not without exposing himself and risk taking numerous shots. It would be a waste to try to randomly blast at them, so he quickly tried to prepare a different bit of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to focus more of his magic into his wand, the tip glowing brighter as he tried to charge it. The odd feeling in his arm only seemed to grow stronger, the magic within him splitting off into different directions as he let it flow. However, he could at least manage enough for a simpler spell. It was only a few seconds before he closed his eyes, letting a blinding flash of light fill the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShots continued to ring out, but the noise seemed to scatter, fewer bullets shots now firing off wildly. A few still seemed to strike parts of his cabin, but soon enough, Jason's eyes were open again. He knew that he might only have a moment, so he quickly moved his head out, his arm outstretched and already preparing a blast. It only took a moment for him to see most of the men now gathered together, their eyes closed or squinted as they tried to recover. They were still a good distance away, but while it wasn't a great shot for him, the situation was good enough for him to risk a shot. Without a second thought, he let the magic within his wand release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast was clearly rushed. Jason didn't have enough time to properly aim, and the blast had gone off a few feet. He had hoped that the blast would be large enough to catch most of them, but the explosion was smaller than he was used to. He quickly began to move back to cover again, getting a good look as he did to try to gauge his assailants' conditions. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a few moments for Jason's heartbeat to stop ringing in his ears. When it did, and he could properly make out the quiet of the forest once again, he heard the crackle of a few small flames and a chorus of groans. That's encouraging, he thought, and leaned around the door frame to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a huge scorch mark at the edge of his front yard. A few of the smaller trees had gone up like matchsticks, and he could make out several smoking figures lying prone beneath them. His eyes widened for just a moment, a pang of sympathy stabbing him right in the chest. Then he remembered that these were the same men who just tried to kill him. If it wasn't going to be them, it would have been him and the Rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened, the wizard stood in the doorway of his home and raised his arms. The tip of his wand was clearly visible in the moonlight. He wanted them to know that he was ready to defend himself if any of them were in the mood to take potshots. \"What you've experienced is just a small demonstration of my power.\" He spoke in a high, crisp voice. He always loved this part. \"If you'd like to taste more, take another shot. However, if you've had enough for tonight just say so. I'll come out to you, heal you to the best of my ability, and send you on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason waited for their response. There were no more gunshots, at least. After a few minutes of silence, he could hear a man croak \"Please. Help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard grabbed his medical kit from its spot near the door and walked briskly to the men. The cool air of the evening was replaced almost immediately with an intense heat, the remnants of his fireball saturating the air with magical energy. It was high enough to make him falter for a moment, but he quickly recovered and reached the spot where these men were sprawled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of them had died from the blast, and there was nothing he could do for them. The other two had very serious burns, while only one escaped with relatively minor injuries. He helped tend to the other two, and with a combination of magic and field medicine they were able to get them in a condition to hobble back down the mountain and into more expert care. Jason was silent most of the time. There really wasn't much to say at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the only-slightly burned man turned to leave, however, he spoke. \"You have no idea what you're doing,\" he said, looking remarkably earnest for a man that had just tried to kill him. \"That...creature you're harboring in there is very dangerous. You should have let us take him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head, unmoved. \"Let me be the judge of that. I'll come into town tomorrow evening to check on your friends and we'll discuss it more then. Good night.\" He turned and walked back to his cabin without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the strangers leaving him alone to investigate this strange Rabbit in his house. At first, he couldn't see the creature in the corner where he had left it, but when he looked again he saw it standing with his back towards him. He blinked and walked over to it. Its ears were flat against its head and it was hunched over, clutching its arms. It looked to be in some kind of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" he said as soothingly as he could. \"It's all over. Just...just come over here and let me take a look at you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G...get away.\" The Rabbit shrugged away from the hand that Jason had offered. As soon as the wizard touched its fur, he felt a strange, sharp tug. It was severe enough for him to pull his hand away and gasp. What was happening here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...just want to take a look at you,\" he said feebly, but now he took a step back. \"What's your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B..B...Benton.\" The Rabbit spoke through gritted teeth, in a voice low enough to be considered a growl. \"I'm sorry I g-got you into this mess. AGH!! Please...step back!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenton hunched further into the corner until he was a white ball of fur, and Jason could feel energies flowing from the air towards him. It was as if the Rabbit were a vacuum sucking the magic right out of the room. Benton whimpered and clutched his sides harder, then cried out. The sound was decidedly unnatural, and Jason took several steps back towards the far wall. His eyes were wide and his wand was out. He mentally prepared another fireball, even though he was certain most of the cabin would be caught in the blast. Maybe the strangers were right after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbit grunted and shivered, and then his hunched shoulders began to widen. That skinny back broadened with muscle that rippled underneath his thick fur, and then those legs grew decidedly thicker, longer, pushing the rabbit's head higher in the corner. Benton's whimpering lowered, drew out into a thickened growl as he grew. It happened in short, punctuated spurts, almost as if every heartbeat made him expand a few more inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped as he watched, not quite believing what he saw. He could feel the magic swirling around the room now, ruffling pages, moving loose trinkets around on his table. In the center of it was this Rabbit barely five feet tall moments ago, now pushing six and a half feet and growing steadily...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was difficult to think with everything happening, but Jason tried to take stock of the situation. With the steady flow of magic and the shifting feeling in the air, it was clear that the Rabbit was draining magic somehow. He took a breath, trying to figure out how his own magical energy felt. It took a moment to accurately gauge things, and the tension of the situation made it difficult for him to be certain, but the magical energy in his body seemed steady. There only seemed to be small traces of magic slipping loose. Did it mean that the Rabbit was only absorbing the magic in the air? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was off about that idea. He remembered the odd tug he received when he touched the rabbit. Could that have been the same thing? And he remembered the peculiar feeling that he had whenever he tried to prepare a spell. If the Rabbit had been draining magic somehow, it would explain the odd feeling that he had when he prepared his spells. Any magic that he could try to cast would lose some of his potency. He shook his head and let the fireball he had prepared dissipate. Throwing more magic around carelessly was the last thing he needed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was right, that meant the rabbit was reacting any active spells and lingering magic in the room. Jason's eyes widened as he realized something, and he turned suddenly, moving to his front door and slamming it shut. There was still a lot of magic lingering on his front lawn after the fight that had occurred. With luck, closing the door would be enough to keep the remnants from entering his cabin. However, as he turned to look again, the rabbit was still clutching at himself and growling louder, clearly in pain as he surged upwards. The wind around him was picking up. The Rabbit's height was quickly approaching seven feet as he kept growing. There was still more than enough magic in the air to cause him pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the rabbit was reacting to the magic in the room, he would have to do his best to remove it. Dispelling magics had never been a strong point for him, but if there was ever a time to give it his full effort, it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to focus himself again, his eyes closed as he tried to gather his energy into his wand. It was more difficult this time, with most of his magic quickly draining away and adding to the turbulent swirl around him that was growing more and more violent with each passing second. The steady surges in the Rabbit's size grew as Jason worked, the rabbit quickly reaching and surpassing the seven-foot mark. It was all Jason could do to remain calm throughout the experience. He just needed a little more time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any visible indication that his spell went off. However, a wave of relief passed over Jason as he felt the magic in the air lessening and the violent vortex surrounding him dying down to a trickle. As his eyes opened, he saw the Rabbit's violent reaction reduce, his body relaxing somewhat. While there was still a gentle flow around him in the air around him, everything felt calmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly looked to the Rabbit, letting off a sigh of relief as he heard the Rabbit's strained breathing quiet down and his arms slowly drop from his sides. It was all he could do to try to contain the situation, and the experience left him drained. He had been unable to remove all of the magic in the air, but he had at least dissipated the majority of it. There was still a slight, steady change in the Rabbit's size. However, it was difficult to notice, and while the Rabbit inched upwards ever-steadily, he could tell that most of the magic in the room was gone. The Rabbit would probably absorb the rest in the room, but there was nothing else he could do about that. It was just a relief to hear the creature slowly calming down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly just collapsed onto the ground, only managing to sit down with an effort. He found himself a few feet away from the Rabbit, nervous to try to approach again. He spoke in a quiet voice, trying to look at the Rabbit as he did. \"You okay?\" </span></div></div>",

Jason tried to recover from the effort of dissipating the magic that had built up in the room, and the Rabbit calmed himself down, tensing every once in a while to feel his size increasing with every beat of his heart. He looked a bit sheepish now that the worst of it was over. His ears flicked back and he couldn't look at Jason directly. The wizard would have found it endearing if it weren't for the fact that he was closing in on eight feet tall and showed little signs of slowing. There must have been a lot of residual magic in the room. That, or the Rabbit was converting the magic he already absorbed in a much more manageable way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was the first to break the silence. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbit looked up, then away again. \"I...don't have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbit shook his head. Jason noticed that the inside of his ears were turning darker. It was obviously an uncomfortable topic for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Would you mind if I gave you one?\" Jason did his best to smile reassuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nameless Rabbit returned the smile, rolled his shoulders. His musculature was improving along with his height, and the bulge of his shoulders, arms and chest were large enough now to be seen through his thick pelt. \"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a show of considering it, but he already had a name picked out. \"How about Rodney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbit's eyes flashed and he leaned in closer, his nose twitching. \"Rodney? Sure, that sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \"Rodney is your name, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbit smiled, the first genuine sense of relief he felt from the creature since he had stumbled onto his doorstep. \"Thank you...um, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard laughed and told him. Rodney repeated it a couple of times, committing it to memory. \"Would you mind telling me what all of that was about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney's features darkened, and he hunched a little more. The growth seemed to be tapering at last, though he was pushing past nine feet tall and closing in on ten. His long ears had long since been bent by the ceiling, and they whispered on the wood whenever he moved. \"I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason raised an eyebrow, and Rodney's expression immediately became apologetic. \"I mean, it's just better if you didn't know about it,\" the Rabbit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you let me be the judge of that?\" Now that he had put the Rabbit at east, Jason felt the need to take control of the situation once more. Maybe it was because he had a nearly ten-foot-tall stranger inside of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney's large brown eyes searched Jason's face for a long time. He then sighed and looked down. \"I escaped from a very bad place. Those men were determined to drag me back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you being abused?\" Jason remembered the condition Rodney was in when he first arrived. The wounds appear to have been healed now, replaced by muscle that was still swelling underneath his pelt. His height had slowed considerably, but he was still gaining considerable mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all were,\" the Rabbit's face was earnest, almost young, and it was a distinct contrast from the bass rumble his voice has become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason arched an eyebrow. \"All of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were...made for that.\" Rodney looked down at his oversized feet, hunching down to fit more easily into his corner. \"But I couldn't do it. I can't live like that. I had to get out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason held up a hand. The last thing he wanted was this beast to get agitated. \"OK, OK, I believe you. Listen...it's really late, and we've both...uh, it's been a difficult day. Why don't we both get some sleep and we'll talk a little more in the morning. If I can do anything to help before sending you on your way, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney smiled, but this time it felt more polite than anything. \"Of course. I thank you for saving my life, and for allowing me the hospitality of my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason barely heard it. He was rapidly fading at this point; draining the magic from the room had finished him off worse than he thought. \"It's all right,\" he murmured, then stood and flopped onto his bed. \"Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing he remembered before darkness enveloped him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason yawned and stretched out on his bed as he slowly awoke. It took an effort to force himself back up, his limbs still slightly numb and a dull headache buzzing in his head. It took him a moment to remember why he felt so stiff, memories of the last night slowly returning to him along with the effects of pushing his magic too far. Shifting up, he stretched out a little, starting to walk a bit as he tried to go grab a bite for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped dead in his tracks as he saw the massive ball of fur still curled up in the corner of the room. Jason quietly approached, a little uncertain of what to do. Even curled up as he was now, the Rabbit came up to his chest. As he watched, he could notice the Rabbit's body shivering a little. He slowly reached his hand forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped halfway, the memory of what happened sticking out sharply in his mind. The last time he had touched the Rabbit's body, it felt as though his magic was being drawn away. Would it really be alright for him to do it again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head violently, trying to throw off his worry. He had dragged the Rabbit in without any problems, and they had been in contact more than enough then. Touching the Rabbit should be fine, and if it was too much, he could always pull away. Jason swallowed, still feeling a bit of hesitation as he reached forward. Relief came to him when his hands made contact without any issue, pressing against the Rabbit's shoulders and shaking him softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... Rodney... You're gonna get sick if you're not warm enough. You can use a blanket if you need to, you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney stirred a little. His head looked up slowly, seeing Jason's small smile there. However, the moment he was alert, Rodney quickly jumped back, his head nearly slamming into the ceiling and his hands pressing back against the wall in panic. His body was trembling, and his head was pulling back as he nearly shouted in response. \u201cI didn't-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, easy!\u201d Jason's hands slipped down as Rodney moved, but he firmly took the Rabbit's arm and gave it a pat. \u201cYou're safe here. Take a breath and relax, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney's breathing was still rough and ragged, but he managed a slight nod as he slumped back into the wall. He turned around a little, looking surprised as he felt his ears brushing against the ceiling and his arms bumping against the wall, his forearms thicker than he had been expecting. He quietly looked over his own arms, holding his hands out in front of him and staring at them as he slowly moved his fingers, looking at them and just trying to confirm exactly what he's seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel alright, Rodney?\u201d Jason's voice is a little more calm as he moves, craning his neck up to look at the rabbit. It felt odd to be comforting a creature when he could only reach up to his hands with easy, but he did his best. Rodney gave a small nod in return, shifting a little. \u201cTry to calm down, okay? I'll get you some food. I don't have too much here, but is there anything you'd like?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...\u201d Rodney quietly shifted downwards, sitting down and leaning back against the wall. \u201cI... I don't know... Anything's good.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I'll go figure out something. If you're cold, you can take the blanket off of my bed, okay?\u201d Jason's hand lightly gave Rodney's shoulder a pat while it was in reach, before quietly turning into the next room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thanks...\u201d Rodney's voice was quiet as he spoke, but in the silence of the room, the word was more than audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dug through the few bags of fresh food he had, finding a head of lettuce. He brought it up, closing his eyes and beginning to channel some energy into his hands... Before stopping suddenly. He had grown too used to using magic to help do simple chores, like cooking and cleaning. While it helped him live alone, it was something he thought he shouldn't risk with Rodney still sitting in the next room. With a bit of a sigh, Jason quietly brought the lettuce to a bit of water, doing his best to give it a rinse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he brought it back, he could see Rodney awkwardly shifting near the bed, still eying the blanket, as if uncertain whether he wanted it or not. \u201cReally, Rodney. Just take it if you're cold. It's not a big deal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney turned sharply, the blanket sweeping into his lap as he did. \u201cU-uh... Jason, right... Um...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded quickly, before presenting the lettuce to the Rabbit. \u201cHere. It's the first thing I could find that I figured you could eat. I really don't know enough about what rabbits normally eat, so you'll have to look for yourself. It'll probably be a bit easier that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thanks, but... But I shouldn't...\u201d Rodney reached his hands forward, holding them in wait. Jason drops the food into his hands, sitting down on the bed next to him while he watches Rodney munch on a few pieces of it quietly. \u201cI don't... want to overdo it here..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, it's okay. I'm not that bad off that I can't spare some food for someone in trouble. Just let me know if that's enough, alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's... It's not that...\u201d Rodney swallowed his bite, his eyes almost watering as he looked back at Jason. He shook his head a little, his ears standing up a little more as he speaks. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I just don't think I should get too used to staying here.\" The big Rabbit looked at Jason with another apologetic glance before nibbling a few more bites of lettuce. Rodney was being relatively dainty, eating slowly, but still half the head was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason rolled his shoulders, trying to work out the stiffness in his joints. \"Trust me, you won't. I have no intention of keeping you here forever. But while you're here, you shouldn't be nervous about accepting my hospitality. What I give, I give freely. If I don't want you to have it, I won't offer it. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney looked at his smiling face, his ears perked forward and nose twitching rapidly. After a moment he nodded and grinned back. \"I...understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbit nibbled more of the lettuce and Jason was content to let him eat in silence. He used the time to think about what he had to do today. Going to town would eat up most of his time, of course, and he would definitely be looking into what the people were doing down there. If what Rodney said was true, then chances are something terrible was happening that he would need to step in and stop. He had to find the best way to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but it's just...I'm not used to being treated this way.\" Rodney broke him out of his thoughts, leaning forward to look a bit more closely at Jason. \"Everyone else I've ever met has treated me like I'm this tremendous bother. I...know that I've caused you a lot of trouble already, and I don't want to make any more for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked at that. \"Look, all you've done is made my life more interesting. And, well...forced me to remember that there's a world outside of my land. If something is going on down in the village where people like yourself are being abused, then...I can't abide that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney's eyes grew wide. \"You're not thinking about confronting the Company, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm going to confront the company. It sounds like they're doing bad things to other sentient beings. What kind of person would I be if I stood by and let that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney gulped once, then stared at Jason for a long time. It looked like the Rabbit didn't quite know what to say. \"It's...it's just...everyone in town loves the Company and what they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they know what's actually happening in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney looked thoughtful for a moment. \"I...don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a deep breath and sighed. He smoothed his robes in his lap. This one could be awfully obtuse about things when he wanted to be, he thought. It might be best to encourage him to speak as plainly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. So what's happening in there?\" Jason kept his voice as low and soothing as possible. If he was going to stop this...company, then he would need to know everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney took a deep breath and looked down into his own lap. Jason saw him look at his legs and heavy paws, and for a moment it looked like the Rabbit was legitimately surprised to see their size. He was enormous, after all -- nearly ten feet tall and well over a thousand pounds. It looked like he had grown a little more in his sleep, but he couldn't be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how much you know about us, sir, but...we're called Fables. We were created...some time ago to help make use of the magic that had been flooding the world. I don't know much about why I am the way I am, but I've heard that I can pull magic from anywhere around me and just...store it. Most people just call us batteries. They tie us up in a place where there's a lot of energy, and we absorb it. Then they plug us in to...some kind of machine...that drains us until we don't have anything left in us. Sometimes we're taken out to recover, but most of the time we're just...used until...\" Rodney trailed off at that point, tears starting to form in his eyes. He kept fiddling with his fingers, tugging on bits of fur or a claw tip. It was obvious that he found this uncomfortable to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're terrible to us, sir. All the time. They tell us how stupid we are, how we're nothing but animals, how the only use we have is our bodies. It...gets to you after a while. You start to believe what they say, even if you don't mean to. Like, you're not worthy of anything. That the only way you can be good is to...hang on for as long as you can so they can take you out of the machine and let you rest so you can do it again. For most of us, that's all we have.\" He looked up again, at Jason and past him at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen Fables draining other Fables to last a little longer. We...don't make friends with each other very much. There's no point. If you're going to die any time you get put into the machine, why would you? Besides, we're all just...worthless. Batteries.\" He shook his head, his ears whispering along the ceiling. \"I never believed that. If that's all they were, then why could we talk or walk or...do anything? Why bother giving us feelings or thoughts or anything, why not just...make batteries? If we're worthless, why are we alive at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down again, one hand picking at the thumb claw of his other hand. \"I tried to make friends, but most of the others wouldn't even talk to me. But I managed to make one friend. His name was...Taylor. We talked a lot when we weren't needed, or when we were chained together in the machine. It made me...feel good to know that there was someone who I could talk to. It made everything feel like it had a point, you know? I had something to live for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney smiled to himself, placing his paws in his lap. Then his expression darkened considerably. \"One day, Taylor went for a shift on the machine, and...it felt like he was gone for a really long time. When we're not in the machine, we're put in cages, and...his just stayed empty. I went into the machine myself one day, and they...they chained me right next to him. I thought he might have passed out, so I tried to wake him. But he wouldn't. He was...nothing but fur and bones at that point. Just completely wasted. I heard someone laughing and I looked up, the guards were looking right at me. They...they knew. And they put me there so I would know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbit was silent for several moments, sniffling. Jason could see the big tears streaming down the fur of his cheeks, but he didn't know what to do. He was stunned. How could someone do that? It was unbelievable to him. Men couldn't be that cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that, I decided that I had to leave.\" The Rabbit's deep voice was breaking now. \"I...didn't know where I would go, or what I would do, but I couldn't stay there any more. It took me four months to do it, but I escaped.\" He looked up at Jason. \"I'm never going back there if I can help it. I would rather die first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason swallowed hard. He didn't doubt the Rabbit meant what he had said. But he couldn't let him leave until he got to the bottom of this. If this is what was happening in town, then he couldn't rest until the Rabbit was safe and the rest of the...Fables were released and nothing like this could ever happen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodney,\" he said, \"I know that you've been through a lot, but I would really like it if you stayed here for a little longer. At least until....\"</span></div></div>",

His eyes jump as you say it, and he shakes his head violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can't! There's... They've got hundreds of people watching the power plant! And even if the villagers aren't directly involved, they don't want their power source gone! You wouldn't ever be able to go down there again!

I don't really go there much to begin with. I'm used to taking care of myself. And I'm not entirely defenseless. I think I might be one of the ones who lucked out a bit after all of the changes happened. You've seen what I can do, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's still suicide! You can't just rush in there! Even if you managed to get into the power plant where they're housing us, you wouldn't be able to try to fight that many men! And-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Rodney. I never said I'd try something like that!\" You chuckle and ruffle his head. \"I said I'd try to get all of them out. Doesn't mean I'm planning on charging in through the front door. I might be able to sneak them out, I might be able to organize a breakout... There are plenty of things I can do. I just want to see what's happening for myself before I try to make a more definite plan.\" You chuckle and give his shoulder a light press. \"Though it does mean that you might be here for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney awkwardly fumbles a little with his hands, nodding his head. \"Y-yeah... As long as you're sure... I just...\" He looks up at you. \"Jason... Be careful... I don't want the first nice human I've met to end up getting in trouble because of me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and shake your head before stepping back. \"It's alright, Rodney. I get into trouble well enough on my own.\" Rodney gives a silent nod before he resumes nibbling the lettuce. \"Anyways, that can wait for now. It's still early in the morning, so I can take care of a few things and get a meal before I go take a look. You just try to relax, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney gives a small nod, still holding onto the remaining lettuce, awkwardly looking at it as you move away. You move to your cabinets, grabbing a few pieces of the smoked meat that you have on hand. You start to make a light snack of it, pausing as you think about what you were told. Rodney awkwardly watches from his spot in the other room, the rabbit still looking too nervous to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a small canteen, uncapping it and taking a quick drink from it before glancing back to Rodney. You walk towards him, his eyes turning away from you as he nervously shuffles against the ground. You're about to offer the canteen to Rodney, but you pause for a moment. You think about what Rodney's said before asking, \"Hey, Rodney? Come to think of it, do Fables need to eat and drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney shakes his head. \"Um... Not really... We can eat and we'll get energy from it like other creatures, so it can help... But we can live purely on magic... S-so... You don't have to worry about food or anything... I mean... I... Uh, you can probably tell, but I've got plenty of magic in me right now...\" He paused for a moment, looking at the few bits of lettuce still in his hand. He awkwardly tries to raise his hand, presenting it back to you, his ears drooping a little in guilt. You think about it for a moment before realizing that the lettuce might've been some of the first food that Rodney's ever had. But you chuckle and shake your head before pushing the canteen into his free hand as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Rodney. You're a guest here. You're welcome to have a bite once in a while.\" You give him a nod, a small smile coming to his face as he takes it and takes a small drink. \"Honestly, I'm a little surprised. I would've thought that Fables would be able to break out on their own if they get as big as you are now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney violently shakes his head, the canteen swishing a little in his grip. \"They... They aren't. The Company's careful to make sure we're at a manageable size... They never let us get any bigger than around the size of a normal human. It's... It's part of why they drain us dry... To get as much energy as they can out of us, and make sure we can't ever try to get loose...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that they bring you guys to where there's a lot of magic, though. How can they just keep you small if they expose you to that much magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney shivers with fear. It's clear that he's not exactly comfortable discussing it, but he's forcing himself to speak to you. \"M-most times, if there's a lot of magic in the air, they'll bring a whole lot of us... They'll just march us all... By the time we get there, if we aren't dead, we'll be exhausted and nervous... Every Fable will be desperate to try to get enough magic, just so they can survive...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow the bit of meat you're chewing on, giving him a solemn nod. Even the description of such an event filled you with disgust. But if no Fable had ever gotten close to his current size, it would explain why Rodney's so nervous. It must be an incredibly new experience to him, and you're not even sure if he's aware of how strong he must be now. You hope that he can adjust to it okay. \"I'm sorry to bring it up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney shakes his head violently. \"N-no, it's okay... You're not... You're doing more than enough for me already... I mean, you saved me from those people... And you're giving me a place to rest... Even this magic... A lot of it is yours, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry... The magic's not a big deal. I'll be okay after a bit of rest.\" You put on your best face as you say that, though you're not sure if that estimate is right. You'd normally be fine in a day or two, but your magic certainly isn't recovering as fast as it usually does. You can do your best to try to keep it hidden, but you know that Rodney's probably still draining a little bit from the air in your house. Your recovery would be slower than normal... You'd have to be careful with how much magic you use while the rabbit's around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is! I mean... You saw how big I've gotten... I've never seen any Fable getting this big before... It's enough magic to keep me on my feet for weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment, tilting your head. Your curiosity gets the better of you as you look up and down over Rodney's body. \"Hey, Rodney? How much magic can you handle, anyways? It'd be bad for you if you get overloaded or something, right? Are you sure that you can manage it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney swallows before he responds...</span></div></div>",

Follow me I know a place with a high concentration of magic.\" Jason tells Rodney<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Rodney travel for about an hour deeper into the woods until the reach the place Jason was talking about. As soon as they enter Rodney starts growing instantly first it scared him. after he reached 15 feet tall he starts to smile and begins to stand proud while Jason begins to admire Rodney's steel heard muscles from afar. He watched Rodney's pecs grow and push out further from his chest untill Rodney could not see his feet, his biceps are huge and his legs are thicker then tree trunks. eventually Rodney growes to 25 feet tal with his muscles growing in proportion to him. Even Rodney's cock started to grow impressively fast, it's now 10 feet long and 7 feet thick, and his balls were so big that they began to drag on the ground. Rodney seemed to be enjoying it at this point draining the area dry of it's magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey keep away from my magic!\" Screamed a witch that apeared out of nowhere. Swinging a staff and flying on a broom toward Jason \"look out!\" Rodney warned. Jason jumps out of the way in time and the witch face plants right into Rodney's pecs. She begins to screams as her magic begins to be absorbed by Rodney. Rodney put his hands up and says \"what do I do?! She's screaming! What do I ... Ohhhh ahhhh that feels so good\" as he says that the witches muffled screams slowly quiet as Rodney's pecs flex then relax then flex and relax slowly pulling the witch into his pecs until she is compleatly devoured by Rodney's pecs causing Rodney to pulsate with power and grows to 30 feet tall and his cock is fully hard and his balls begin to churn and have inflated to 2x it he size it was before. The pure pleasure from absorbing the witch has made Rodney's mind foggy and really horny. Rodney begins to jack himself off using both his hands to do so making his cock pulsate and eventually shoot out gallons of cum all over the forest and over Jason. Jason has been watching the whole time becoming quite aroused himself. Some of Rodney's cum landed in his mouth and it tasted incredible. Jason was compleatly dominated by the sensation, it was like a drug and his mind was swimming in pleasure. Jason's hearing,sight, and smell was completly dampened buy the drug state caused buy Rodney's cum. Rodney's eyes glazed over and began to walk toward Jason and picked up his limp druged up body and him head first into Rodney's mouth. Rodney then begins to swollow Jason up. One gulp already sucked Jason  down Rodney's throaght up to his chest. The next series of flexing through muscles gets a lot more of Jason untill their is only his legs not constrained by Rodney's throught muscles only showing the tips of Jason's feet hanging outside Rodney's mouth. At this moment Jason shakes out of his drug haze and realize that he is being swollowed whole and absorbed of his magic. He immediately connects the dots and realizes Rodney is going to absorb him. Jason begins to flail his legs which gives Rodney emense pleasure of the feeling of his prey squirming and gets hard again ready to blow another load. <br>\r\n\"Please Rodney.! Please let me go! I'm your friend!\" Jason pleads but to no avail one more gulp and down into Rodney's stomach Jason goes. He curls up as tridents stomach walls begins to squeeze against him and feels his mind and body fade and become absorbed by the muscular hunky bunny. <br>\r\n\"Rodney.... I... Care.... I'm ok... With being absorbed by you... I would happily die for you... To die giving you power.. . Is something I'm ok with.\" Jason manages to spit out before falling unconscious. Rodney suddenly comes to surprised and crying. \"You are too good to me\" Rodney says as he sees Jason's form ion his belly stop struggling. Rodney then makes himself puke up an unconscious Jason. \"Please please. Don't die I need you.\" Rodney crys out. After a few moments Jason choghs up and takes a deep breath. Rodney almost highs him but remembers the consequences of doing so. \"Im so sorry Jason I'm so sorry.\" Crys Rodney. \"It's ok Rodney. It's ok let's just go home so I can recover.\" Jason reassures.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light was streaming from above. And the bitter cold of the winter chill that crept through you was no longer there. You had been running for hours through the northern snowfall, deep into the woods and far up the mountains near your village. Whatever worth you were is long gone. Selling children into slavery for their own benefit was becoming a trend in your back-water town. Your dreams of grandeur in a life far away from it were almost snuffed out. Had it not been for a dear friend\u2019s help you would have been next. You had already guessed as well but the greatest hints come from others. You just hoped that she was okay too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were given this help just before they had come to take you away. But they are on your trail as you ran through the empty woods. Thankfully your footprints were being covered slowly by the snow that nearly blinded you. The chill comes naturally with the land and the snow was low so the grass that peaked through helped to cover your path as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere you were running to mattered little, as long as you escaped. But you were in unknown territory. And with the snow and forest life, lost at the time. That\u2019s when your memory becomes vague, because that was the time that you were nearly caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you managed to get away, they were still able to follow you through the snow. By then you figured that they were probably professionals at collecting their \u2018merchandise\u2019. Many must have run-away before, and they were sent to catch them. Your parents must have already paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already run out into a clearing that ran over the edge of a cliff. There was no escape where you were now. You ran to the edge to see if you could climb down. But the height was beyond your miniscule climbing ability. You were trapped\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you thought your hopes had died, you noticed a ledge below. You walked near it. It was a bit of a ways down, and if you missed\u2026 But at this point of desperation you didn\u2019t care. Without a yell or care, you jumped down to the ledge below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way you had lost your footing and stumbled backward, into the mouth of a cave no less. Sliding down you found yourself amongst clear ice crystal. One you had mistakenly bumped into, hard. You were in a partial daze because of it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even in your daze your greatest fear of the time had come to fruition. Your interlopers saw the ledge and were already entering the cave after you. You backed away in fear, but partly paralyzed from your crash. Their faces were cold but they were enjoying the hunt, you could see it plainly in there malevolent smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you backed away, you heard a faint cracking. Most of the noise in your ears was a hallowed washing noise like a river. You could not even tell if they were talking or their footsteps were making a similar noise. You just kept moving back until the cracking became a full snap. The ceiling rumbled and then you noticed what you had done. You\u2019d released an icicle so large it connected to the floor from it\u2019s spot. You must have loosened it when you bumped into it. It fell back and crashed into a large wall of ice behind you, cracking the glassy wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only paid attention to the men after seeing the wall crack; it was not as if it would help to kill the three of you in this cavern.  You kept your gaze on them. But, to your surprise they had stopped inching closer. In fact they were no longer looking at you but past you. Something behind you was making their blood run cold and you were glad for it.<br>\r\nAs they stopped, the ice behind you shattered and a piece slammed into the back of your neck.The last thing you remember before blacking out completely were the men being thrown to the side and you being lifted up. The visions after were dark and blurry, but you remember a strange and comforting dream. Of being surrounded by snow white feathery clouds around you as you were whisked through the sky, the sun falling below its spectral line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the events that led you to this odd environment. You were surrounded by odd white feathers. But they had no stems, anything connecting to the fur, or skin for them to come from. But these feathers were huge and cradling you softly in their warmth. On closer inspection, the fur that made them was almost crystal like; glassy and colorful. If you had to say, they were more like feather scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you were sitting in was drenched in light coming from above. You peeled yourself out of the warm cocoon as best you could to see. When you finally managed to pull away the feather bungalow you found yourself covered in bright light you had to strain to see until your eyes adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour real location was in a silvery blue cave in which your feather bed was inside of. The light was coming from a hole high above you. You could see the sky through it, the hole was huge enough to show. But was so high and put at such an odd angle it could not be climbed through. The floor was too far away for you to see, but from where you were already it was still a faraway height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled upward to see. Thankfully the feathers did not bend easily, only curve. It was odd to stand on something so soft yet strong, but you were able to see at least. The path of feathers led downward to a lake below where the feathers ended in odd prongs. But there was something stranger then the prongs. Something was moving down at the lake. Swishing left and right very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had beautiful golden curves and trails coming off of it. Then you saw it suddenly flick upward and the entire trail shifted with it. You heard and felt the rushing of wind from above you. And as you turned to look up, your world was turned with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face stood above you, reptilian in looks. Your thoughts automatically came out as \u2018dragon\u2019. And the feathers you had been laying in were its furry scales. To your thanks it was asleep and gently breathed as it did. For whatever reason it had taken you and not eaten you was beyond your knowledge. But your fears would not let you be near it without an explanation for long.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you did dare speak a word or you may wake up the beast. But when you backed away, you noticed that the beast was waking. Its eyes cracking open and move their gaze upon the you backing away. It lifted its head up and open its eyes fully, then smiles. \"Glad to see you're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you talk?!\" you stopped backing away but almost fell backward on the fluff of his stomach giving way to your irregular motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, Yes I do,\" responded the dragon happily, \"Are you alright by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would you...gah!\" you completely fell backward from the feathers giving way and nearly slid off into the lake below had you not been caught. You found yourself being placed right side up by the dragon in his open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up some and said with lovingness, \"have to be careful, wouldn't want you to get hurt now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very surprised at his reactions to you, a monstrous creature of his size...what could he be thinking? \"...the only dragons I've ever heard of...are fire breathing creatures that eat people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled softly, \"I can understand where your fear would stem from then. But have no fear of me,\" responding comfortingly, \"as I, amongst others, are quite different. Dragons like me are actually quite fond of people, especially the ones who save us. Like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save..? When did I..?\" your mind was in a bit of a mess. But his sincere smile was more comforting to your racing mind then thoughts of being eaten. And now hearing this has stiffened you up to the point that you weren't sure what to think. You sat still in his palm looking up to his smiling face, waiting for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I'm not sure what happened before hand but I was trapped in that glacier which broke apart when you came along. If it weren't for you, I'd have remained trapped there until who knows win,\" the dragon answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're what broke out of the glacier?!\" you were surprised and bewildered. You were at least able to understand if he may be thankful. But you still weren't sure of his agenda. \"Okay, I get that I saved you now. But what is it you intend to do now that you're free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I only would feel right if I were to help protect you. I rather like the company of humans to begin with...but being what I am, and how most of your race presumes us to be...it's not always quite as easy as I'd hope it could be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were even more perplexed now, but you heard the solemnity in his voice as he looked down and away from you for a moment. \"You really aren't bad at all...sorry I mistook you for something you're not...do you have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks back at you and says in a firm, confident tone, \"They call me Nova.\"<br>\r\n\"Nova...like the sun...uhm...it's nice to meet you Nova,\" you let out your hand in a sort of nervous greeting. Not sure what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova reaches out with his other hand and carefully shakes your hand, \"Nice to meet you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand was soft and fluffy with much smaller feathery scales then the rest of his body. He was warm to the touch too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting to know each other a bit you were finally able to have a comfortable conversation with each other. No longer scared, he was a very pleasant person to talk to. <br>\r\n\"Do you remember how or why you got trapped in that glacier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was with my mother when we were attacked. We had gotten separated but I knew I would only be best off running away, though blindly, rather than trying to look around and find her. I ran into the cave hoping they might leave me alone, or that I might be able to ward them off with the space being less open. But neither occurred and they managed to knock me out,\" he told his story, \"I think I recall a moment of consciousness realizing that I was being trapped , but the shock of it all quickly dragged me back into a coma-like state. Then I was awakened by the destruction of the glacier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm so sorry you lost your mom...and you don't know how long you could have been in there either... I was in a pretty bad mess myself...\" you told him your story as well while sitting in his palm. Of being chased and ending up in the cave Nova was in. \"In a way, you saved me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it was fate then,\" he smiled softly with a somewhat solemn tone, from the sorrowful stories both have as their pasts, \"I'm glad that I was also able to save you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova brought you up closer to his face to say that as meaningfully as he could. You felt his calm breaths warm you up more in the obviously cold cavern, \"uhm...Nova...can I pet you? I've never pet a dragon before; I did pet a dog once. But it wasn't mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova nodded, \"Of course you may,\" he lowered his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully placed your hand on his soft fluff above his nose. You pat it as best you could and watched as his eyes softened on you. He was enjoying the feeling, even mesmerized by the time you were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nuzzled your hand gently w/the tip if his nose, smiling. You were a bit stunned by the initial movement, but then you felt the warmth and comfort in his face. He really was kind. \"Nova, what do you want to do now that you're free? You're a dragon...they're being hunted around the world...but you shouldn't be. You're actually really nice Nova.\"</span></div></div>",

And I'm sure there are other humans like you out there who would be kind to me.\" You nod, trying to be positive. \"But the look on your face when you woke up here--if you had a weapon, I might have been hurt, or worse, before I could explain myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to deny that you would have done that, but thinking back to how you felt when you found yourself in this giant dragon's clutches, you realize that if you had a chance to attack then, you probably would have. \"You're right. But I'm happy I couldn't,\" you add, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova returns your smile before going on. \"And even ignoring any physical threats, which I honestly think I can deal with, I just don't want to be forced to defend myself, or constantly explain that I'm not evil and not going to eat people. It just makes the most sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you're basically in the same situation. You have nowhere to call home anymore, and you aren't even sure if you could travel anywhere without a risk of getting caught by the slavers and their bounty hunters. Most importantly of all, you trust Nova. Despite his imposing frame, his face exudes a fundamental happiness that puts you at ease. It's all the more remarkable when you think about everything he's been through. You quietly resolve to help this dragon as much as you can, though you have some doubts about just how much you can help someone many times your size. \"I understand,\" you say after a while. \"In that case...do you mind if I stay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova chuckles a little before he answers. \"What do you think I meant when I said I would help protect you? Of course that's okay with me. I know we could both use the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...a lot. I promise to do what I can,\" you're both silent before you look around the cave once more and realize that you still don't know exactly where you are. \"So...where have you taken me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right, I never actually told you, did I? We're in a cave about a half hours flight from the glacier where you found me. I figured it was a perfect hiding spot because the only entrance is that hole up there,\" he points the the giant hole that allows light to come through. \"There might be an exit deeper in the cave, but as you can guess, the caverns can get a little restrictive for someone my size. Regardless, I think we should stay here for now. I'll start a fire when the night comes so we have some source of light and warmth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you can't help but ask Nova, \"Can you breathe fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but not for that long. Enough to get a fire started, but it's not like I could just provide enough light and warmth myself. We'll have to go get some kindling before the night comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" One of your chores in the village was always to go gather kindling and start the fire, so you're totally okay with doing that chore for someone you actually care about. Wanting to continue the conversation, and still curious, you ask Nova, \"so, how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In dragon years or human years? I'm afraid we age a bit differently than you. In human years I'd be...17, I think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how old I am,\" you say with a smile. You still can't believe your fortune. A couple of days ago, you were sure that your life was over. Now, thanks to this dragon, of all creatures, you realize that you have a prime opportunity to do all the things you never thought you'd be able to do. You feel you have a new lease on life, all thanks to this beautiful golden dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that Nova never explained what happened to the people chasing after you. \"Nova, what happened to the people you saved me from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs before he responds...</span></div></div>",

But it's been decades since those times and the two have now become a singular and powerful form. Runology, Symbology, Arcane, etc. have all become the basis of the world's powers. Politics giving results by seeing it's future results in seconds. Medical research creating cures for nearly every form of ailment. Military becoming a massive force that could wipe out more than just the world and powers that could save it as well. The world now resembles a beautiful dream as the effect; islands brought to the skies, dome cities beneath the sea, even hallowed barrier cities beneath the mantle layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a scientist for your country, proud to do your work. A researcher of 'life' magic; progressing the inner workings of living things and how it lives. With the discovery of chimera sciences and it's allowance by governments world-wide, you're research reached a staggering spike in possibilities. You worked under no surveillance with some of your best friends growing up. All studying in your homeland seaside country where the sun set over it's silver walls and tower peaks. Your country was more interested in magic and preferred not to tamper fully with technology. Good for you since you had little know how in that field. Some was still necessary for progress of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently you had gotten into a relationship with a woman who had moved to your country from another. Never really able to make relationships with woman, except one of your old friends who you worked with now, it was very abrupt. She was a researcher as well and wanted to get into your newest project. Eventually your relations blinded you to the obvious and she was let into your project with your own permission. She was really a commander who had tricked you into allowing her into your research and use you as a proxy to your work. The laboratory was stormed by operatives and you were all forced to work under her leaders command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took over your work and forced in odd machines and forbidden magic into your research. When complaints were made, the first one to do so was killed as an example. All of you were watched on a constant basis. And so as to keep up appearances to your government you were all watched. You yourself were watched personally by the woman who eased her way into your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original project you were working on was to make a being made by DNA and magic only; no normal birth methods were allowed. It must be capable of rational thought, as well as being able to use magic. The original concept given to you and started by you, thus leading to your DNA being a part of the mix. As well as the DNA of the smartest and most adaptive animals on Earth as minor components. The two major components were yours and the national animal of your country, the dolphin. The result was already born and developing, you were even able to play with him and test his intelligence. You even remembered shedding a tear when he was able to speak your names. He was given the project name S.E.R.F. by your dear friend she said it meant, \"Someone's Evolutionary and Revolutionary Friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were turning your work upside down. Before only basic magic was placed into your research, but they were adding unnecessary and dangerous components. Worst of all was the addition of of the forbidden Death Magic, using life as a source of power whether it be from yourself or others. They were turning your revolutionary work into a circus of abominations. Adding whatever animal or magic you had not before and using the capacitors and machines to compress them. They titled their work S.U.R.F. which she told you stood for 'Singular Ultimate Revolutionary Force'. When you tried to ask what they wanted to do with your project you were simply told that your country was little cost for the world. Then when the work was close to completion you were all removed from the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were all taken back to your homes and your research files were all stolen. You were no longer allowed back to the lab under threat of death and were all still watched. The woman herself stayed away and you were now watched by a silent guard who never slept. He went back to the lab at dawn. This lasted for days; mornings with worry and nights with dread. Until two weeks had passed and a morning you woke up to was covered by a black sky and grazing fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your fellow scientists had run to you in the morning after you were awoken by a loud explosion that shook the city. \"We have to get out of the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lab exploded, the fire keeps spreading. They want us out of the city limits so the mages can wash out...\" you sped past him through your doorway and out to the streets where people run into and past you. Your focus only on the dark fire rising at the sea front. You heard him yell to you but you did not listen as you ran towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the center of the blaze, the large gate to the underground site was wide open, many of the intruder's bodies were strewn across the ground. They died while trying to escape, meaning something happened before the fire and explosion. When you looked down to their bodies they were drained of their blood which lay in trails spreading back to the inner bulkhead leading to the lab. As you knelt down you also noticed something was pulling you in. The blood trails were scaling up the crack of the bulkhead doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into the pocket of one of the corpses you pulled out a blood stained key card and ran to the bulkhead's service door to it's side. Opening the door and running up the stairs, the pull was becoming stronger and the hall was becoming darker and hazier by each stair you climbed. 'They even used illusion magic, why would they try to make something so unpredictable?' you thought to yourself. When you got to the top of the stairs you stood before a windowed door leading to the main room. The window itself had shattered, but the shards hung suspended in space as well as drops of blood; frozen in time. You hesitated for a moment before opening the door to a sight more horrible then you predicted going up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concrete walls were covered in blood, swirling about the large chamber. A black haze twisted around in a spiral that nearly blinded you through your glasses. Far below, down the service ladder was a worse sight; a sea of blood seeping out from the cracks of statues in running and frightened positions from what you could tell. The sights and smells so awful you could not bare to look for too long with out the bile rising from your stomach. Holding a handkerchief to your mouth and nose you looked on more. Papers, glass, and pieces of machinery were flung to the air and suspended in space. That's when you saw it, a feint glow at the center of the room where the holding tank was. The plate  carved with the letters 'SERF' hanging from loose and twitching wires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spared little hesitation and climbed down the stained ladder, slipping before falling into the red sea. You trudged and fell often in the knee deep and glue like entrails of what used to be people. The statues of which hung about in horrific forms, ripped apart by the force and petrified as they were the nearer you came. Terrified screams and tears ran down your face but you pressed on as the power grew stronger at the epicenter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to the edge of the holding tank, there she was. The woman who ruined your life...what was left... Her body had been ripped apart from the inside out, the pieces suspended in mid air. What was left of her face was in blissful awe as her arms were spread outward. Her eyes had melted off of her face...you couldn't look anymore...never in your life had you ever been thankful to see such horror...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed the few steps to the inner tube where the golden light was it's strongest and the blood rose to the holding tanks lower machine. The glass of the tank was shattered and swirled with the blood and black. And at the center of the light...there he was...fully grown and curled in a painful and twisted form, gasping for air he didn't need to breath... He was long, well built, and covered in crimson seals of the strongest forms of runes and symbols. The blood about entered and exited his body. His own powers leaving him in seething pain as he cried scarlet tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serf!\" you tried to run to him but his eyes snapped open onto you and his powers flung you to the air. You were suspended with your arms outward, his powers were pulling your limbs away. \"S-Serf...I know you...gargh...you can understand me...it's me...GAAAAGGHHHH!!!\" he twisted your right arm, the bone about to break through your skin. \"L-gah-l-look in my Bag!\" You tried to reach down to your bag but it was snatched off and thrown to the side releasing it's contents. A single small book...yours and his favorite...the first he ever read...Animals and ABCs... He saw it in the corner of his eye and all the power holding you aloft drifted away making you fall slowly to the platform in pain, \"...r-remember Serf? You said...you always wanted to be a Zebra? So we put Zebra DNA into you so you could turn yourself into one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis crimson tears ran down in streams as he said in a small squeaking tone, \"...P-pa-pa..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...Serf...it's me...\" you gave him a small smile...</span></div></div>",

I thought it'd be a nice twist to the views of self.)<br>\r\nMarch 27, 1793<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   My name is Renold Johnson, heir to the Johnson Delivery business run by my father. Not necessarily rich, my father's business has kept my family and I wealthy. I live with my father and his two servants in our small manor outside of London. My mother is currently living in London with my younger sister as she goes to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am writing this strange series of events that began three days ago, March 24, when I met and made the most peculiar of friends imaginable. Pardon my speech as you may not believe the words I say and consider me a mad man for saying this. But we humans are not the only people in the world we know. In the walls and floorboards, beneath the ground, and in our sewers lies a world of creatures. Specifically animals with the speech and properties of humans. A rarity in life you may never encounter. But I was perplexed and now proud to say that I have met one such creature. In my house no less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late that afternoon as I returned home from the delivery chambers across town. My father is a bit cold and bitter of a man, which in some cases I am content with as it has made me the better man in the end. He has been bed ridden for a number of days. We fear his time has grown short, but he still prattles on as if he is healthy as ever. We talked over the shipments as I gave him the reasons our men could not take in in time. He gave a sigh of grief and called our workers imbeciles before shutting me out after giving instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I left and walked briskly down the hall I saw our maid set a block of cheese next to a hole in the wall. I asked her what she had been doing and she snorted out that we had gained mice, the cheese was poisoned. She called them smart little weasels. I could only dream at the time if a mouse had intelligence, even thought it an interesting idea.  As she passed and this thought came to fruition I only partially noticed the scurrying of something past my feet. When I jerked my head back there was nothing but the hole and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon when the sun was just beginning to lower and the sky was turning it's autumn hue I had a descent dinner made by my butler. He complained that a mouse was stealing food from the pantry even though he had locked it. An incredibly large one at that. I laughed heartily at him and had to stop myself from calling him a fool. Still it was odd that all these things had gone on and I simply told him this. \"Listen very carefully. If a mouse did have the process to think of a way into a locked pantry for food then he would have to think as a man. Not only this he would have to think of his own mortality like a man as well. Unlike you, our maid, and my father; I would enjoy the company of such a mouse. I may even consider him a compatriot if he had half the mind to be one, hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know that it was these words that sparked a meeting that I would never wish to be a dream. To that end I believed it was at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that night while I was falling asleep. Our home stood on a small hill that allowed me the view of London just over the ledge of my window. I fell asleep every night to that view when in my home, it comforted me to see all the hustle quieted by the night. As I began to doze I heard a small rustle in my dreams. A quiet but commanding voice urging at my thoughts. \"Compatriot, is that what you said? If you ever met a mouse that could think like you humans, you'd be their partner? Is that the basis of what you said? Mrrrrrrrr... Johnson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought the voice only a figment of my mind and spoke outwardly, \"urh...yes...yes I did say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't we become partners Mr. Johnson? I have a few good ideas for your service. You seem to need the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a glint of a figure just above my face, \"yes...it is true that we do need help,\" I said responding very calmly to the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you put that in writing?\" The figure held out a signing sheet much larger then himself, another holding a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes...\" I took the pen and signed the sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, it will be nice to work with you Renold. I can't wait to start!\" The small figure shook my finger in feverish response. It was odd for a dream. I could feel the tiny man's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before i even realized it I had sat up like a bolt to a sitting position holding a tiny man that dangled from my finger. He was around eight inches in height sporting a large red cap, orange coat over a white button down shirt, brown pants with a brown bag strapped over his shoulder and a pair of small brown cloth shoes. His face was round and furry, pale white at that with large green eyes. A tail swat back and forth behind him. What broke me from my gasping gaze was his voice laughing, \"Hahaha! Easy there Mr. Renold, I'm more fragile then I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Thomas, Thomas Melcrus. Glad to be your partner Renold! I'm doing this as sort of a favor as well. A thank you for saving me. If it weren't for you that cheese may have killed me and my family if you hadn't said anything to the maid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an experience beyond any dream my mind could imagine. A part of me could not believe and a part of me was so excited it had to believe.</span></div></div>",

You see colored lights in the distance; stark reds, blues, and yellows that proclaim dominance over the quiet star-light above. Such a sight, the Boardwalk nightlife. A soft sigh looses your lips and your eyes peer over the edge of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder the fall. Smashing into the torrents, getting sucked beneath the undertow. Torn asunder and dashed against rocks. Not the \"easy way\" out you once deluded your mind into accepting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravel crunches and scuffs behind you, pulling you from your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new visitor shuffles past you with his eyes pressed forward, never blinking. You're first caught off guard by a most distinguishing feature: his physical resemblance to a Siberian Husky dog. The initial shock wears off when you realize what he's planning.  He pauses for a moment, then moves closer to the edge. He peeks over, then steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a bad day, stranger?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky goes rigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus H-\" He bit his tongue. \"I, uh, didn't see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it isn't my business to pry, but it's hard not to notice the way you're looking at that drop.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says nothing and just pants in an attempt to catch his breath. A small bit of furred flesh protrudes beneath his ill-fitting green polo shirt with each movement of his diaphragm. One lazy bit of double chin oozes over the highest button by his collar. A patch that reads \"Sturges Pastry Shop\" is skewed atop a generous deposit of adipose on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here for a lecture.\" He says between defeated breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor am I.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll just be on my way.\" He steps back to the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only the sound of crashing waves in the distance. He steps away from the edge, plants his hands on his hips, and bends over at the waist. Pearls of sweat dribble down his cheeks. He wheezes a little and looks over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at me. I can't even keep up a damned jogging pace anymore without falling apart.\" He said. \"I wasn't-\" he paused to breath, \"wasn't always like this, you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your arms behind your back and listen patiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never should have bought a box of Sturges pastries. I swear that's where it all went wrong.\" A low gurgle fills the air, the husky rubs his gut and sighs. \"Oof, just thinking about them is enough to trigger it these days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trigger what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <i>hunger</i>. It's something else. I feel like there's this little monster inside of me that's always wanting me to eat, and if I don't listen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled louder, as if to emphasize the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" You stroke your chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried out Sturges last year, back when they first opened. God, it feels like so long ago now. The moment I took one bite of their cinnamon buns, nothing ever satisfied me quite the same again. I had to eat more, and when I ran out, I had to go get more. When I couldn't get more, I tried to eat to fill the hole those buns left in my stomach. Fifteen pounds later, and I knew something was up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you tried to get off the sweets, but that didn't work out so well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" He sighs. \"The hunger became so demanding that I lost two jobs for eating on the clock, and a third for stealing burgers at a fast food joint. So I'm on my last leg, My body demands another cinnamon bun, but I need to save money for rent. I fought the urge the whole way to the shop, and I almost won too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky anthro buries his face in his paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The manager says to me 'there's my favorite customer, I have a batch of buns hot n' ready,' and I say not today because I got laid off at my other job so I need to save money on rent.  Wouldn't you know it, out of the kindness of his heart, not only does he give me the buns for free, he hires me at the pastry shop right on the spot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bitter, humorless chuckle slips his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today was my first day. They let me sneak a consistent supply of my favorites, so long as I didn't touch anything else. Closing time happens, I want to go home, when they tell me I can have the buns we didn't sell that day. All of 'em for free. I gorged like a pig. Just one straight hour of eating. I knew how wrong it was, but for the first time in a long time my body was happy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks back up at you with his helpless, pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran the moment I took back control. I lugged my fat, disgusting self as far away as possible. I don't know what they did to me, I don't even know if I can prove it, but if I hang around any longer I'm going to need a forklift just to get around. And the worst part? The only reason I hesitated was because I realized I would never taste another Sturge's Cinnamon Bun if I jumped.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a surprising gesture, the husky throws his arms around you. You feel the entirety of his heft envelope you. Every supple, warm roll of pudge on his body presses against you. It's a strange feeling, like being hugged by a mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I gotta jump, before I lose all control of myself. I wanna die on my own terms. I don't want to explode, or drown in my own fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words devolve into sporadic sobs. You pat his back, unsure where to go from here. Not exactly what you expected to find on the scenic route to the Boardwalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there's a way you can take control again.\" You say. \"No need to throw yourself off a cliff to fix it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive.\"  You say. \"Perhaps we should get you to a doctor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They just tell me the same thing. Diet, exercise, that deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous rumble emanates from his stomach. The husky winces in pain and wraps his arms around his gut. He lets out one sorrowful whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh why won't it stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get you something to eat first, then figure out what to do.\" You say. \"Oh, jeez, where are my manners. My name's Calvin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juneau, like the town.\" He gives you a slight nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, uh, my car's this way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble down the hill with the hefty husky in tow. His pudgy body wobbles with each step along the way. Somehow you were going to help him, at least you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/dog2.png\" alt=\"*Dog2*\" title=\"Dog2\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Choices</font><br>\r\n<i><u>Bigger is Better!:</u> Hit up a nearby burger joint  and let Juneau indulge himself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You open the door for Juneau, the husky out of breath from the brief walk. He huffs and puffs as he sits into the passenger's side, hand pushed on his chest and bracing himself against the door. It stings a little to see him winded from that walk, his entire body jiggling and straining as he struggles to tug the seat belt around his mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old clunker starts up with a rumble, and you pull out, a smooth turn before you hit the road. Another rumble resounds from Juneau's gut, the bulge shifting with the sound. \"Oooo... Starting to hit again,\" He murmurs, rubbing firm against himself. \"I can't believe it's already back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get some decent food in you, see if that'll help.\" You drive down the familiar roads, used to the familiar streets, turning down a corner as you make your way to the supermarket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it won't be enough,\" He murmurs, rubbing his gut in an effort to calm it down. \"No matter how much I ate, I wouldn't get full. There's no point when I won't be able to-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you overate before, right? What'd you normally eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky pauses before hanging his head, shame written across his face. \"Sweets, soda, fast food... Anything I could get my hands on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a little nod. \"I figured. I know it's hard, but doctors suggest diet and exercise for a reason. We'll get some better food in you and see what we can do from there. It doesn't sound like you've been eating very well, so getting some better food will help a little. I take it you haven't tried working out, either?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know what kind of food to get. I couldn't cook while my stomach was demanding anything and everything,\" He mutters, still refusing to look at you. \"And as for exercise... Well, just look at me,\" He mutters, hands grasping at his squishy chest. \"I'm a mess. It's a struggle to move around! I can't work out like this! I can barely run a few feet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and reach over, eyes still on the road while you push your hand to his arm, squeezing the soft flesh. \"Hey, don't sell yourself short. Your endurance might need some work, but you're stronger than you think you are. You have to be to move all of that...\" You pause for a moment, spotting him as he stares out the window, avoiding your gaze. \"You have to be to walk at all. It might be covered up, but you've probably got a bit of muscle under it all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" He doesn't turn back, but the edge of a smile rises to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" You respond, giving him a squeeze. \"One thing at a time, though. I don't think we can put a damper on your appetite, but we can at least make sure you eat the right things. Then, we can worry about shedding some fluff and putting on some mass instead. Hell, if you put on a little more muscle instead of just packing on fat, I bet you'd get all sorts of attention.\" The husky's face turns flush at your words, his hands twiddling together as he sits there. \"What do you say? Shall we start by filling your belly with something a bit better?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, turning quiet for the rest of the trip. You focus on the drive, and in a few more minutes, the car stops near the back of the half-full parking lot. Juneau winces as he sees the long walk into the supermarket, but when you take his arm and help him out of the car, he nods. The two of you move forward, slowed by Juneau's mass but making your way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter, Juneau gets a couple of looks and mutters from the others around. He hangs his head in shame, but you ignore it as you guide him along with you, refusing to leave him on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to do this?\" He mutters, avoiding every eye as he walks. You nod when you grab a cart, taking one slow step after another, Juneau still struggling to keep pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you pass by a few aisles, going right towards the health and nutrition portion of the store. You stop as you look over the aisles of things, working to make heads or tails of the label. You haven't heard of some of the terms written on the front of the protein powders and meal-replacement shakes, so you settle for throwing in some of everything. \"It may not be the tastiest thing in the world, but I figure this'll fill you up. Maybe once your belly's full with something other than sugar, you'll feel a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't this all... You know... Expensive stuff?\" His face is flush as he continues to stare at the ground, waddling a little as he follows you. You continue piling on the things in your cart, not sure which brand to get and tossing them all in instead of overthinking it. \"I can't just ask you to do all that for me, it wouldn't be-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"I can afford to splurge a little. Besides, it's still cheaper than going out to eat all of the time. If you want to repay me, then you can do it by putting your effort into this, okay? Really giving it your all on this particular round of diet and exercise. I'll even join you if it helps motivate you. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky's eyes start tearing up as he turns back to you, a small smile on his face. \"Thank you... Thank you so much, Calvin. I'll... I'll do my best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and take his hand before you start heading right for the check-out. The lady in line, an older-looking swan, raises an eyebrow at the two of you, but she bags everything without a stray word. You're still hauling the cart back to the parking lot when you dig through the bags for a shake, and toss it to Juneau. \"Here. Try this for starters. Vanilla protein shake. Pretty straightforwards, as far as this kind of thing goes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky struggles with the sealed cap, but he manages to pop it open. Even as you're walking, you stop to see him slam down the full shake in an instant. You expect him to start making faces, but you're more surprised by his reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Not bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You keep pushing, but you're still thinking about how you had to struggle to force down some of that stuff. The husky's already working on getting another shake open, but he gives an eager nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It just tastes... Satisfying, in a way.\" He slams the next shake down as well, He moves on to a pack of protein bars, ripping the wrapper off before stuffing his mouth with it. Hie eyes pop open at the taste, before hauling the box out of the cart, starting to tear through each of the individual ones. You walk ahead and start to pack everything into the trunk, while the husky continues to chow down like a ravenous man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't kidding when you said you're hungry.\" You wince a little as you see him tear through the full box. Just how many calories was he going through? That would be enough to last you all day, and he's just getting started with his meal. By the time you're almost done packing, he digs into the last bag and tears out the tub of protein powder, digging his muzzle into it and chomping it down raw. You get queasy at that sight, wondering just how anybody could stand that stuff without mixing it into a drink, but Juneau goes through it like a desperate man, still carrying it with him as the two of you climb into your seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're starting up the car when something incredible happens. </span></div></div>",

You've always liked rain, hearing the pitter-patter of the droplets and watching them trickle down your window. It's very relaxing. Granted, you prefer to enjoy rain from the comfort of your own home. Driving through it, on the other hand, is <i>not</i> your idea of relaxing. Yet that is the situation you find yourself as you head home from campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had not been your day. Right now, you wanted nothing more than to head home, slide into bed and sleep. But there had been a big accident on your usual route home, so you had to take a detour. An unexpected phone alert--something about a flash flood warning--and a few missed turns later, and you were kinda lost. So you took it slow, idling around winding suburban streets, trying to get your GPS to work for longer than two minutes--gah! You knew you should've thrown that thing out a long time ago but never really got around to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously round a corner, trying to avoid a repeat of the 7-11 incident, and spy something that doesn't seem quite right. Up ahead, a lone catboy walks down the sidewalk, striped tail dragging through puddles on the concrete. You catch up to him quickly, slowing as you approach to try and get a better look. He's a little on the short side, a little on the heavy side. The outline of his belly is just visible through his grey hoodie, and his jeans look a little too small. His hands are jammed into his pockets, and he appears to have cut holes into his hood for his ears to poke through. He looks to be about the same age as you--18 or 19, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's staring at the ground and hasn't noticed you yet. You can't just leave him to walk around in this weather. How do you get his attention?</span></div></div>",

Yeah, I was, y'know, just in the area, and I was wondering if you...like, I'm not trying to be weird here, but do you--are you going somewhere? Do you need a ride, or something?\" Gah, that was awkward. And he looks so flighty, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" He hesitates, looking down for a few seconds. \"Y-yeah, that'd be nice...\" Apparently that worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a little smile and unlock the side door. \"Hop on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shimmies into the passenger seat, his fur sopping wet. He grabs the seat belt with one hand and reaches it across his belly into his other hand. Now that you can get a good look at him up close and personal, you realize he's ever cuter than you thought. You've known you were bi since freshman year of high school--man, those were some awkward times--but you haven't had much luck with finding your kind of guys: cute and a little twink-y, but with a big bear belly. Ok, to be fair, you didn't have the <i>purest</i> of intentions in giving this guy a ride, but hey, it's still better than walking around in the cold rain, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Axel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Axel, huh?

The occasional stoplight gives you ample time to steal a glance at your portly passenger. He stares forward, unaware of the attention you give him. His glazed eyes are that of a man whose thoughts lie elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust be bewildered by a complete stranger feeding him, you muse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you pull into the parking lot of a Mexican-themed fast food joint. Beef, cheese, and taco-seasoning blasts your nose the moment you enter the glass doors. That familiar rumbling sound returns. Seems you couldn't have arrived soon enough. You step to the counter with him, and prompt him to order first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a soft-shell, hold the meat and cheese please.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that didn't sound right. The catboy licks his lips once, his hunger further betrayed by a hint of salivation on his lips. No way Axel's spare tire survived on such meager portions. You decide to get something a little hearty for your order: an entire box meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you are sitting with Axel at a booth for two. He's stripped his hoodie to reveal a forest green t-shirt that cradles the overhang of his paunch. At first he picks at his meal, his will to exercise restraint dwindles with each minuscule mouthful. Finally he caves and horks the whole thing down in a few bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you predicted, the tiny portion dents his hunger about as well as a pebble to your car. You peel the paper from your first taco; his begging eyes zero in on the loaded wrap. A smile crosses your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then, you seem like you want it more anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe demolishes your food, leaving you to wonder if he even tasted it. He suckles his fingers for any taco residue. Ravenous. He looks ravenous. You push the rest of the meal to the plump catboy. Happy to indulge his appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo surprise, he empties that box. A telling rumble emanates from his midsection once more. You exchange looks with one another, a nervous frown on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need more?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're really tempted to play devil-on-the-shoulder.

I've been eating a lot lately and it's starting to show...\" Dammit. That's just what you were afraid of, he's self conscious about his weight. Well, with a little bit of encouragement he'll come through. As your digesting his response, he anxiously clasped his hand together in front of him awaiting your reply. he jerks slightly at yore calculated rebuttal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll level with you. Despite what people might tell you or say about your figure, it shouldn't matter to you. You do want you want to, be who you want to be and eat as much as you like. When I saw you on the street, you looked desperate and lonely so I picked you up and helped you out. What I'm trying to say is that, even though we just met, I'm here to help.\" he is very taken aback, physically recoiling and gaping slightly. \"R-really?\" he exclaims in a hush whisper. \"Yes\" you reply smoothly arms crossed. He then leans back in his booth and continues \"Wow... that's really nice of you... thank you.\" you smile \"No problem. Anyway, now do you want anything else?\" He beams back, still slightly nervous but noticeably more confident. \"I'll order for you just tell me.\" he reply's \" Hmm... another box meal should do it.\" with that you waltz up to the counter, repeat your previous order and walk back with the meal two minutes later. During this time you reflect on Axle and you. Your intentions were never entirely pure and somewhat manipulative honestly, but hell get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you sit down with the red tray add slide across the table towards him, Axle quickly digging in and finishing within minutes, taco planets and burrito stars disappear into his black hole belly. He finishes in record time, ending with a small \"Urp!\" and a flustered expression. \"Finished?\" you ask facetiously. \"Yeah let's go...\" he says nervously zipping up his hoodie again and standing up to go. He seems a bit ashamed and guilty about eating so much but seeming satisfied. You step out of the bustling res truant into the damp parking lot, Axle following behind silently and content. You make it to your car and gingerly slide into the drivers seat, Axle attempting to do the same but rocking the car slightly due to his weight. You start the car again and drive out, sitting in slightly awkward silence with Axle. His stomach grumbled slightly, and at first you thought he was hungry again, but then discern he was digesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that this had gone on too long and ask him some thing. \"So I don't mean to pry, but why were you on the street?\". He stiffens at the question and sniffs slightly. Uh oh, you might have struck a nerve. You wince as he hesitates, and begin to apologize; \"I'm sorry, you don't have to-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine.\" he wipes his nose and continues \"My dad was making me take a walk... a-as a punishment f-for being so...\" he stops voice constricted with emotion towards the end of the sentence, tears prickling the corners of his eyes as he releases a shuddering breath. \"S-so...\" he tries again but you stop him in his tracks, pausing to pull over before continuing. \" Don't say it. I understand\" you say honestly, rubbing his back before speaking again; \" It's okay. I understand.\" he shudders under your touch and attempts to compose himself, breathing deeply. \"I-I don't want to go home\" he says barely above a whisper, \"Can i come with you?\" he practically pleads, looking at you with those soft, now wet, yellow eyes. In the most stern and serious voice all day, you reply with gusto \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to get to your apartment considering the way you were driving; fast, that is. You were infuriated. How could they be so cruel to such a sweet, adorable young man? It sickened you immensely and as far as you were concerned, Axle wasn't going back anytime soon. Speaking of which, the rotund catboy was seemed transfixed on his hands, twiddling them in his lap. Once again, he seemed ashamed of his actions, saying sorry without words. God, you need to work on his self confidence. You arrived shortly, alerting Axle with a short \"were here\" and getting out. You and him walked for a short time between concrete and steel doors belonging to people heard not seen. You arrived at your door; the same grayish blue as the rest. You fiddled with the keys for a minute stealing a glance at Axle. You never appreciated his true curvature. His tummy stretched his hoodie and hung over the hem of his pants, the paunch capped with a flabby untoned chest. His face was round with chipmunk cheeks and a double chin. Wide hips and supple calves were packed into ill-fitting sweatpants. You could only imagine his posterior, you were definitely letting him go first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing with the task at hand, you open the door, and as promised let him go first. You get a good look at his rear, supple and soft, each round cheek sliding past each other and bouncing with each step. You follow him into your modest abode, disorganized but humble. You close the door walking to the kitchen, thinking of what to make him and yourself. He stands in your small living room looking at you and looking like he wants to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?' you ask, figuring you should start off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say..*sigh* I'm sorry for bringing you into this. You didn't have to do any of this but...t-thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it. Especially after your parents I just couldn't let that happen.\" you reply, getting out some leftovers and poping them in the microwave.<br>\r\nHe smiles that cute shy smile, proceeding to then plant his wide arse on the couch and making himself comfortable. After bringing the food over and Axle promptly demolishing it, you brought up the subject of his parents. Would they want him back? Did he have a curfew? Despite the uncomfortable topic, you had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... will your parents want you back at a certain time? Or..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they don't really notice when i come or go, except for today it seems...\" his voice was tight, but he managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Well, not great because your parents..but I'm glad you could stay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it continued, Axle practically living at your apartment, only leaving when you did. And it was true, not a single person called or seemed to even notice his disappearance. Heartless bastards. Axle was still his shy, anxious, adorable, and most of all hungry self. You even got to hug him! So soft...Anyway It seems that half of your cash went into feeding him. Although after a week, you noticed something about him.

Do you want some?\" <br>\r\n\"No, just wondering\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were 'just wondering' in a sense, but only to confirm your suspicions on the cats recent change in diet. That is, nothing but sweets and candy. As stated before your reasons for taking Axel in werent entirely pure, but for some nefarious, fattening reasons. His progress was good, a 3rd chin, squeezable love handles, door-way jamming hips, thick arms and legs, and the mountainous dome of his engorged gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was coming along well, but it could be faster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>People simply couldn't understand anthros. Ever since their discovery, people had tried to question anthros about their habits and ideas. It was difficult to tell when they would behave like animals, and when they would behave like people. The differences seemed non-existent sometimes, and staggering minutes later. When anthro lands were first discovered, the language barrier proved to be a great problem, and human's attempts at non-verbal communication insulted anthros more than it did to help. The first humans were driven out in a matter of days. Even the best diplomats that were sent only managed to calm things a little bit. It was clear that a large effort would be made before people and anthros could really communicate and understand each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that didn't stop the few odd stragglers from trying. A few humans managed to visit anthro lands, and were permitted to stay for a short while. Only a few would last longer than a week before getting kicked out. Those that remained for long periods of time were rare, but they did occur. So far, nobody who had remained with the anthros had been able to fully grasp their language, or report back about what they had learned. Progress had clearly been slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opposite was almost true as well. Anthros occasionally ventured into human lands. However, things didn't tend to work out quite as well for them. A few were captured as exotic pets, and numerous injuries were commonplace whenever there was a scuffle involving one. The anthros that were lucky enough to venture into the more peaceful human locations rarely spoke much, and very few anthros remained in human lands before deciding to go back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, it was a bit of a disappointment. If people acted that way, it wasn't any surprise that anthros were hesitant to trust humans. You did have an interest in them, but besides the occasional spot on the news or photograph, you had never seen one before. You didn't quite know how you would react if you saw one, and it was impossible to tell whether or not you'd be able to communicate with them at all. However, it was still something that dragged in the back of your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't imagine meeting an anthro. Your job only required you to head out occasionally, so most of the time, you just remained at home, devoted to your work. You did head out on occasion, but there were only a handful of friends who really visited you often. The trip to anthro lands would cost you more than you could afford, and it was too much to hope that an anthro would end up where you were, deeper in human lands than they would be able to travel. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had started like any other for you. Early morning, breakfast, and a bit of work. You only needed to take a break in order to try to pick up some groceries before lunch. With your schedule, it was quite simple to put your work on pause and head out. The store was close enough that you normally walked the distance. Looking up at the sky, you grabbed an umbrella before heading out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived at the store, something had caught your attention. A few shoppers were standing around, talking about the rumors that an anthro had been spotted in your town. They couldn't agree on the exact species, but it seemed to be something like a wolf or dog. It had apparently been close by, but always ran before anybody could get close to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think too much of it as you grabbed some food. There have always been numerous rumors of anthros, and there's always been some fantastic confusion between meeting an anthro and an ordinary animal. You took care of your shopping fairly quickly, and made sure to get extra in case the weather was going to be rough soon. There was only a light rain on the moment, and you didn't feel like using your umbrella with a minor sprinkle, so you began making your way back home. It seemed like it was going to be another peaceful day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk back was only a few minutes, but it passed by a few hidden streets along the way. The town was generally clean and safe enough, but few people bothered to remember where the back streets ended and began. Cutting through them always saved you a couple of minutes, and you never ran into trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this time, you had to stop along the way. Something had caught your eye, and you paused as you thought you could spot something lying behind a dumpster. You could only make out the head of it, but it seemed as though there was a Doberman hiding behind it. You slowed down a little bit as you approached. It was hard to see, but you didn't spot a collar on it. If the dog was a stray, then you didn't want to get too close. However, you noticed that its eyes seemed to be drooping, and that it seemed half-asleep. You quietly approached, planning on walking by, hoping you could make it without any incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature didn't seem to move as you approach. You let out a sigh of relief, thankful that the dog seemed to be relaxed. However, as you passed the dumpster and got a full view of the creature, you had to stop. Your eyes widened as you spotted the limbs on the creature, clearly longer and stretched out a bit. His body was in decent shape, and his fur was short, but it definitely wasn't a normal dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to speak before noticing his hand held firmly over his chest. You nervously move your hand closer, a little afraid of making contact. You gently lift his hand up, trying to take a look at what he was covering. His hand was odd, still furry but like a human's. However, your attention quickly went to the wound he had on his body. Though it was red and bloodied, there seemed to be very little still coming from it. However, the fact that the Doberman didn't react meant that he wasn't in very good condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow, a little uncertain of what to do. However, you didn't want to leave him outside. You carefully tried to shift him a little bit. You saw his eyes suddenly snap open, and half-expected him to lunge at you. However, he only managed a weak growl. You hesitate for a moment, but quickly make up your mind. Without giving him a moment to do more, you just pick him up quickly, doing your best to not move him too suddenly. \"Come on... It's going to rain soon, and you shouldn't stay out here.\" Though you feel him struggling a little, it only takes a few moments before he seems to give up, his body leaning into yours. He was heavier than you expected, but you managed to hold him steady over your shoulder as you tried your best to carry him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just grateful that there was only a short distance back home, and you didn't encounter anybody on the way. It would've been a huge problem to try to explain the situation, and you were just glad to bring him in quickly. You laid him down on your couch when you arrived, and got your first aid kit out, doing your best to patch his wound up. He winced as you cleaned it and disinfected it, but was clearly too exhausted to do anything else. It took a fair amount of time, but you finally managed to get him bandaged up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and sat on the floor as you finished. Now that the anthro was taken care of, you had a chance to rest, but the break meant gave your thoughts a chance to fully hit you. Here you were, with an injured anthro resting on your couch. You had no idea how to react, and you had no idea what had happened to the guy. For all you knew, he could've been a convict or something. However, you couldn't bear the idea of leaving him alone in human lands. It just seemed like a bad idea, and you thought you could at least keep him while he recovered. Whatever the reason was, it didn't seem right to leave him outside and injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you stood up. You couldn't keep your eyes on him all the time, and your stomach was constantly reminding you that it was time for food. You considered making something for the anthro, but had no idea what he would eat, or when he would be awake and able to eat. You sighed and just began cooking something simple. It didn't take long before you had a small plate of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you heard a soft growl from the couch. You stood up suddenly, only to see the dog trying to get up. You heard a soft growling, and quickly rushed over to him. \"Easy! You're still badly hurt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared at you, snarling and trying to lunge at you, but wincing as he moved. You quickly held his arm, and just helped him sit up on your couch. \"Look, just rest, okay? You can do whatever you want after you're better, but if you try now, you're just going to make it worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept moving a little, but after a few weak shakes, he just sighed, looking down at the ground. He seemed resigned to it, and quietly sat on the couch, looking at the ground. You sat down next to him, a little uncomfortable with speaking at the moment. You simply sat there, not sure how to best break the silence. However, as the seconds passed, it only felt more and more awkward. You couldn't stand the silence for much longer, so you simply spoke again. \"So... A-are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned slowly to you, his expression still a little crestfallen. He tilted his head as he looked at you, and it took a few moments before it became clear that...</span></div></div>",

He gave a couple of fierce barks, doing his best to hold himself against the top of your couch. He managed it, but nearly collapsed, and you tried your best to catch him with your free arm. \"Fine, fine... Just relax... I'll get you some food. Just try to rest, okay?\" You simply pointed out the bandages on his wound, and he seemed to get the message from that. \"Like it or not, you can't move right now. I don't know what happened to you, but just get some rest, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled as you held him tight. While he was certainly stronger than you, his would was clearly too much of a distraction. With a bit of effort, you forced him onto his back and did your best to keep him down. He seemed to struggle, but held against his would halfway through, the pain in it clearly acting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk... This isn't going to work... Please, just rest.\" You sighed as you released him. \"I'll go get you some food.\" You sighed as you moved back, looking over the small plate of food you had prepared for yourself. While you were hesitant to offer it too him, it seemed more important that he got something. You really didn't know what he could eat, so all you could do was keep everything separate and see which ones were okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed the plate in front of him, on the table in your living room. He quietly growled at you the entire time, but seemed a little surprised as you placed it in front of him. \"Here. I don't know what you can eat, so don't push yourself, okay?\" He seemed to have a questioning look as you dropped a couple of bits of silverware nearby, but never took his eyes off of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you eat in peace. I've got my own meal. Just try not to move too much, okay?\" You sighed as you left him alone. He seemed to have quieted down, and while you wanted to keep an eye on him, it didn't seem like a good idea to keep staring the entire time. As you left, you could hear the sounds of him just digging in at the plate. It seemed he could eat all of it, but he either was too hungry right now, or didn't want to bother with the fork you had left him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you sat down at your kitchen, just popping open a box of cereal. You weren't in the mood to try to make something else, and you weren't feeling that hungry after everything that seemed to have happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard him struggling a little, his head pushing over the seat of the couch to try to take a look around. He seemed to stare at you as you ate. It made you feel a little awkward, but there really wasn't anything you could do but continue eating. It continued for a few silent minutes, nothing but the crunching of food filling the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished? I'll clean up for you.\" He seemed to stiffen a little bit when you went to pick up the plate. While you still heard him growling, he seemed hesitant to move more than he already has. You quietly picked up the plate before walking off. He seemed to keep his eyes on you the entire time. It felt a little awkward when he watched you clean the dishes, move off to try to do work... He even seemed to have kept his eyes on the bathroom door the entire time you were in it. You supposed he was still suspicious, but there wasn't much you could do about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as time passed, you couldn't help but worry a little. He had certainly been more active than you would've liked, and while he looked okay, you wanted to make sure. He certainly seemed to relax, but by now, you were worried that he was too distracted by the pain to do anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly got your first aid kit out again after time had passed. His expression had gotten more and more pained along the way, but it was clearly not improving. You opened it up, and he hesitated as he saw you pull out some bandages and some disinfectant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to change your bandages, okay? I promise, I'll do my best to be gentle.\" He seemed to swallow as you approached him, and shifted uncomfortably as you did, his throat clearly growling as you got closer. </span></div></div>",

Guess it's an anthro thing or something.\" You carefully took them off, before starting to wipe through his fur carefully.

I just want to get it clean before we get your bandages on again!\" He nervously let you approach, but he managed to hold still for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly worked before replacing his bandages. It didn't take too much, and you had the bandages firm on him. \"There. That should be okay. Just don't try and push it, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only gave you a questioning look as you stepped away, but he seemed to lean back into the couch as he relaxed a bit.

He certainly seemed a little more relaxed around you, and you were glad to be able to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you were a little nervous. You couldn't help but lock the door on your way in. While you wanted to trust the anthro a bit, you couldn't help but be nervous. You wanted to do your best to help the anthro, but the entire thing still left you wondering about it all. You didn't know how he had gotten there, or how he got hurt. It had been quite a day, and you were barely able to relax as you moved into your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed quietly as you shifted in, just closing your eyes as you laid back and thought about the whole thing. The anthro seemed okay, but he certainly wasn't comfortable in human lands. You were a little nervous about keeping him there, but you couldn't help and wonder about him. The entire thing was a huge mystery for you, but you fell asleep hoping that things will turn out well. </span></div></div>",

Your mind was a trampling mess of compressed thoughts spilling out over it. The dust storms had risen faster then your people had seen. Sand was ripping apart your world, not the golden sand that surrounded it though. Black sand. Then there was you running with the faint voices of your family screaming to get away. You were caught in the gusts and then there was black. And finally gold in the eyes of some wandering beast; gold that shimmered like the sun but was surrounded by darkness that made night seem like day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body suddenly burst upward and your breath was a loud huff. Everything in your sight was blurry. There was white. You were lying in blue and black, lifting up the colors. They were warm and soft to the touch. Almost weightless yet comforting and thick, covering you wherever you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and uneasily walked to the edge over the soft sheets. You were wearing nothing but black shorts, you had no idea where your patched robes were. Stumbling through the cream wall, they were sheers. You had to tug on them to keep your balance but managed to not pull them from their attachments. Your body was thin thankfully, not scrawny yet not well fed. The deserts were home to many like you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exiting the sheers you tried your best to focus on your surroundings. Your eyes drifted from shapes to bland colors as they focused. Your breath was still uneasy. As you looked around your eyesight gained slight clarity, slowly, shapes were easier to see and what you could was strange yet beautiful. As you tried to inspect the far white walls a voice destroyed the silence, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you did not sleep well, young one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-who\u2026who\u2019s there?!\u201d you snapped your gaze to the right where the voice came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were bright lights in the direction, between dark shades and tall columns. And between two was the source of the voice who solemnly spoke back to you. \u201c\u2026hhhhhhhhaaa,\u201d he steadily breathed out a sigh. \u201cLast night was quite the ordeal for you\u2026for us both\u2026you would have forgotten, that\u2019s why your dreams of those events turned to nightmares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled away from the sheers breathing heavily as your dizziness returned, \u201cwha-what do you mean?! What happened last night?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t try to move yet, the strain of the ritual would have taken it\u2019s toll already!\u201d the figure snapped out of concern and equivalent order. He spoke gently yet firmly. You immediately listened to him and tried to focus all your sight on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you did your eyes went wide. He was a tall and thin man, but had a heavily built back even harder and more muscular than you've ever seen. He wore long sheer robes that trailed across the ground over a short staircase leading up to the pillars, and opaque ones beneath around his waist and reaching his knees. Gold trailed off many parts of his body as did his hair reaching out of his head piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what struck you were not his clothes but him. His skin was deepest black, it looked silk like from a distance. But strangest of all were the tail that protruded from the back of his robes. And two tall ears that stood proudly on his head. He leaned against a pillar on one arm, his other hand pressed against the opposing pillar and his legs were crossed. His tail flicked majestically as its ornaments rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bird flapped above him staring down to him, \u201cgo, tell the men. Also, bring back food for my vassal.\u201d He said before turning to you as the bird left with a flock flying past the pillars. That\u2019s when his gaze met yours. The same golden eyes from your dreams, and the beast; a jackal, \u201cAnubis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMany know of my names. Few left who know of my true purpose. But can you remember last night. What pain you brought upon yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026no\u2026\u201dyou managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe let me explain\u2026I also should tell you of what you have gotten yourself into. Do you know how brash and foolish you were? How selfless?! But you may have made the right decision if all goes well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, just tell me what\u2019s going on!\u201d you sputtered due to the fact of realizing who you were talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, do not fear me. Also forgive my words, being trapped in that form for so long left a cold bitterness on my actions and words. We, the controllers of your land really do exist,\u201d he stepped down towards you. \u201cHowever some of our history has been misconstrued. I, as you know, am Anubis. The Presider of death, and Measurer of life; my existence upon birth has required me to give people the honor of dying. Then sending souls to either by purified or tortured.\u201d He was near you now. You weren\u2019t sure what to do. \u2018Is this\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is no dream. Last night you made a pact with me. Osiris cursed me long ago. Not of his own faults but nonetheless his cause. He placed me in that form you met in the storm, an ill nurtured and decrepit black jackal. Forcing me to steal food out of hunger and ravage other animals for sustenance for the past 873 years\u2026that was until\u2026\u201d he kneeled down before you. His face was now eye level with you, being as tall as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unable to speak and crossed your brows in bewilderment as he spoke again. \u201cYou joined in pact with me. And for that\u2026I thank you\u2026\u201d He lifted your hand and placed his lips on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stepped away, he let your hand pass from his. \u201cNo\u2026I don\u2019t even know what happened. Tell me. I can\u2019t remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d he stood back up, \u201cas I said it was Osiris\u2019s doing. Where as I am in charge of the process and honors of death, he is in charge of what comes after. When a soul dies I weigh it to either be purified or tortured until purification after their time of judgement ends. Purification allows for the soul to be reborn. But due to so few needing to be purified, his land was filled with vile torture and eternal damnation.\u201d Anubis walked back to the pillars<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe invaded my land and declared himself true ruler of death. He sealed my power into the once lush land, turning it into the desert that spread to the lengths it is today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, Egypt was once covered in forests besides near the rivers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, until my power over death was placed into it. Killing it\u2026and to my horror\u2026killing the people. I cannot forgive him for that most of all; whether or not those tortured souls rage within him. He was the one that summoned the black sand. In order to declare himself the true ruler he believes that destroying all of Egypt and taking the souls of its people into himself to be purified in despair will make him a true king. Unwilling to accept his own mistakes in destroying the balance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ran from your home in that storm. I watched from a distance with my servants, also cursed. You came to me and in your mind weakened state allowing to speak through your thoughts. You begged me to save your people. I told you power came at a price. You said you were willing to give any price and I named it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou were worried now, you had nothing of value to give. \u201cWhat did I give you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI needed a large amount of power to even come close to regaining my position. Therefore I needed a soul to bond with. To give me that power I asked for half of your life. And you gave it to me\u2026for your family and for your town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you save them? Where are they?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone away from the desert and it\u2019s influences until this ordeal is over. Osiris can easily kill many outside other of our brethren\u2019s domains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were scared yet relieved, \u201cThank you Anubis...When you said that I gave up my life, that's why you said vassal to the bird. Half of my life is giving you power. But what can we do now? I can't fight a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that word...we are a part of this world, not it's rulers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...this is hard to...\" you weren't sure what you had gotten yourself into. Standing before you was the king of death who you had apparently saved the night before in a blur of your memories. \"I don't know how, or even if I can fight. Still what is it that you intend to do. You saved my family even at my cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are most welcome. As for what to do; when we bonded you received part of my power. You can command my powers to some small extent. This leaves many options open to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel very different, but I believe you...then what's our main priority?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Think of the plant living.\" You looked into his eyes in disbelief, and near protesting. But his gaze told you 'I believe'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried again to focus on the plant's life. To make yourself not think of what it looked like before, you closed your eyes. You just envisioned a fern, not remembering what the one before you used to look like. Just a new plant similar to it. It formed in your mind and you felt something odd and warm coming from your hands. Then Anubis's voice \"good, you did well.\" When you heard this you opened your eyes to find that the plant had formed to a similar shape to the one you envisioned, beautiful green leaves and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped away, partly afraid but also interested to say the least. \"That's the power I have from you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can control how near to death a living thing is or even reverse the process.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You both met in middle school five years ago. He was being mugged by some students for his lunch money, but he didn\u2019t have any. His lunch was packed, so they were going to beat him. Everyone knew he wouldn\u2019t fight back so they didn\u2019t gather around him. You wouldn\u2019t let them do it then and you\u2019d still fight for him now. You rushed the kids and managed to fight off their boss as the others left calling you \u2018fag lover\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated to admit it but it was obvious. Those sweet, gigantic, turquoise eyes, his button nose, droopy ears, snow white fur, and cotton tail of his. Ciel was the picture of adorable.  Thus he was easily picked on and made fun of and almost forced into a life he would have never been happy in. So you chose to protect him, not just because he needed it, but because he was your friend. Even though he never fought back he never ran, knowing you\u2019d be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel got through junior year before he realized he couldn\u2019t be weak anymore. But he also made a resolution. He wanted to be strong like you, maybe even more than you. He didn\u2019t want to stand behind you when you protected him. He wanted to shield you now. To be with you and prove to everyone he wasn\u2019t weak. Even though you told him often that he was strong in his own way. He understood what you meant, but did not believe it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both in college now, the same one, even in the same dorm room. You were training to be a chef while he strived to be a model for muscle magazine. He had a well-shaped body now but you were still taller. He could lift you up now even though you can remember a day when you could lift him up and toss him in the air. You could still lift him though, just not throw him. You both even talked about now and back then and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd that he wanted to change so badly. You never argued against him trying to be strong, you even encouraged him. But you had to ask one day, \"Ciel, I know you want to get muscle. But are you really doing it for you?\" you made sure to bring this up during dinner and also made sure to tell him the subject was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was silent and only managed to meekly say, \"...yes, I am...\" He tried to sound positive. You didn't push but you knew that it wasn't all the truth. You also knew something he tried to hide, but was more obvious then him liking men. Of all the men in the world he loved you. You didn't mind it, you were a bit intrigued by the thought too. You were always attracted to woman naturally but were never in anything serious of a relationship. If there was any man in the world you felt comfortable with, it was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for how he made his way, you let him as he pleased. He is too innocent a person to force or even think of forcing himself upon you. He did do a few accidental things, some he never noticed. One in particular he did almost every day now since he started sleeping over at your house. He started this the third time he spent the night at your house, it was strange but cute and warm beyond words. You'd always let him sleep in your bed as you slept in a bag on the floor. But on that night you felt something odd curling against you as the bag unzipped. You never said a word, but when you woke up in the morning there he was warmly laying next to you with the tip of his thumb in his mouth. Even to this day with his 187 pounds of thin muscle he did this in the night. And you always made sure to wake earlier than him to get into the other bed across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never told him about it and he always wondered how he'd end up in your bed. Honestly he would never know unless you told him and were thankful he never found you next to him. You didn't want his innocent act to be spoiled by his remorseful thoughts, so you never told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Ciel..? Don't tell me they rejected you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I...I got in!\" he cried out the day he was accepted into the agency, digging himself into your arms. His pictures were posted online the day of his first shooting and you were more than proud of him. that night you took him out on the town, it was only a few days after you moved into the dorm and one of the greatest nights of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going smoothly at your end too. You were invited to a restaurant to attempt a dish for the head chef. You were even told that depending on hot good the dish was you may even be offered a position at the restaurant. Four other students were also asked to come, two of which were two years ahead of you and could be told were professionals. In the end however you managed to gain second placement which was due for a part time position. One of the older students gained the first and you became fast friends with him. But the other was a problem. He didn't take his defeat graciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could accept the other being in first but not you. You could never tell directly but you saw it clearly in his gaze at you in class on occasion or his ignoring you in passing each other. The gaze became more and more angry and dark to the point that you never saw it again. It was strange but the man just never came to class. He seemed to disappear off campus. People even asked if you had seen him. Sorry to tell them you had not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the day came that you could not think about without your heart sinking deep in your stomach to this day. It was on the way home from work you had invited Ciel to come with you, he'd come sometimes either way when not at work just to see you and taste the food; vegetarian that he is. You and he were simply walking home on the weekend when a man in a long dark jacket came from around a corner blowing out breath in hard unsteady puffs. \"I've been waiting for you. You never came, you never even accepted my invitations,\" the man was clearly deranged and you could tell who it was as he came to light, the student that went missing. \"I left it in your mail to see but you never looked at it, you never looked at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react and as you tried to back away he jumped on you, knife in hand. You held his arm back as it neared your face. \"Even at the judging...you never looked at me! You purposely destroyed My Dish Didn't You!!\" the knife was being brought down with more force. Ciel could only back away in terror gasping and wondering what to do. That's when you managed to free your right hand and knock him in the face with your elbow. The knife slid across the pavement. As you reached for it his hands clenched around your neck and your breath slowly left your lungs. \"No no, No No NOOO!!! You don't get to win twice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said this as your sight slowly went dark and the outlines of objects became fuzzy. Your last words before nearly loosing complete consciousness were, \"...run...Ciel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, you only saw as a sudden flash of events half faded but burned into your memory. Ciel shot his fist into the man's throat, the blow knocking the air that left your longs into his out into the open night. Ciel was trembling and he picked the man up by his collar. Before the man could gain his composure, Ciel kneed him in the stomach. His body coughing and writhing on Ciel's side as he held onto Ciel's sleeve. Ciel knocked him aside, then dropped to the ground and pummeled him until the man's face was red and blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the darkness and fading scenery you could barely see through your eyes, Ciel managed to nearly kill the man that almost killed you. When he got up from his hate filled daze Ciel was breathing heavily looking down at him. The he gasped and stepped back putting his hands on his mouth and screaming behind them. He then dropped back to the ground and looked to you and shook at you, calling your name. When your eyes opened fully all he could do was break down on your chest. You slid your hand up and pet his fur softly, \"you...did great Ciel...\" That was when you heard the sirens. And red flashes filled your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that day Ciel became quiet and would come home early asking where you had been often then going to your room and working out. On the third day you just found him sweating horribly and nearly fearful staring at himself in the mirror. You stood behind him and he gasped when he noticed you and almost broke down. You came behind him and turned him towards you. You stared into his eyes, they were filled with fear, hate, and sadness. All you managed to do was slowly wrap your arms around him and let him cry. You even managed to carry him to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...he...I couldn't l-let...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel...\"</span></div></div>",

You were a little surprised as you felt him squeezing tight, holding you closer than he ever had before. Tears were still dripping down his face, but his expression was stern, and his teeth were clear as he held you. \"I... I couldn't let so-something happen to you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently held him, wiping his eyes softly. \"I'm okay... I'm still in one piece. I'm glad you are, too...\" You do your best to try to smile, wiping one of his eyes. However, before you could do more, you felt him squeezing, a bit more firm than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...

Whenever something happened, if you weren't there to comfort him, Ciel was likely to break down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a seat next to him, turning gently to wipe his eyes. \"Ciel... I'm safe... You took care of me...\" You blushed softly as you held him, your hand patting his back softly. He suddenly stopped, his expression finally relaxing a little bit. There was a light blush on his face as well, and he slowly pulled his head back, looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you see his face finally smile as well. Your hands slip across his back as he pulls away from you, getting a good look at your expression. You give him a firm nod, confirming it for him before speaking again. \"Yeah... You've gotten stronger than me...\" You just smile and give his shoulder a firm pat, his blush growing deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you think so?\" He just nervously smiled as he lifted an arm for you, doing his best to flex a little bit. He had gotten better at showing himself ever since he had gotten his job, but he never let you catch him practicing. Even knowing you had seen all of his pictures did little to help him relax when he was face to face with you. However, he seemed to have worked up the courage to do so, and you could only nod at him as you looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really been at it, haven't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed, unable to hold himself very well as he just sat up on the bed, next to you. \"Y-yeah... I... You got hurt, and I wasn't strong enough to completely protect you... I've been looking at myself, and I know I'm not the biggest... I was worried you would think I was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>not</i> weak.\" Your voice was serious, and it made him jump a little bit. You gently held his head, making sure he was looking right at you as you spoke. \"No matter what size you are, you've always been stronger than you think. You've been working hard, and you've always been improving. And no matter what, you've always done your best. You are definitely not weak. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I've never been... There's no way that you'd-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel. I'm here with you now because I care about you.\" His eyes widened as he heard you speak, and you thought your face would turn as red as his, but you continued to speak. \"If there's any guy I'd be with, it's you, okay? So I don't ever want you to think you're weak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you knew?\" You could tell his heart was racing, and you only gave a small nod in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Yeah, I knew.\" You swallowed, uncertain of if it was okay for you to say it. He shifted a little bit, but you firmly held him in place. There was no turning back, so all you could do was tell him how you felt. \"Ciel... I... I really don't know, okay? I don't know how I feel, and... And I don't know if I'm ready for you yet. But... But whatever happens, I promise... I care about you, okay? I'll always be here for you, as friends, or... Or as more...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel only managed a weak nod as looked at you. The seconds passed before he broke into a wide grin, holding you tight, leaning his head against your chest. He had his eyes closed, and he just hugged you as tight as he could. \"T-thank you\u2026\" You only managed to keep your balance for a moment, before falling back onto your bed with him curled tight into you. You chuckled softly as you held him, just laying back and staring at the ceiling a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes passed without either of you saying a word. You were too busy thinking of what would happen now, and Ciel seemed too busy holding in tight to do anything. You let the minutes passed, and when you simply grew too nervous to let it continue, you tried to stand up. However, by that time, Ciel was already asleep. He had pushed himself for days, and now that he had finally gotten a chance to talk to you, he simply couldn't hold it anymore. His body held tight against yours, and this time, you didn't think you could get him to let go without waking him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and just chuckled a little as you saw him curled up, his thumb tucked in his mouth as he slept. You just shifted the best you could, getting the blanket over him before closing your eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were lucky. Ciel had barely managed to avoid trouble with the police, and it was only because of a couple of witnesses that the two of you managed to get through the night without legal trouble. However, the entire thing still hung heavy on his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever the two of you were home together, he seemed as cheerful as ever. He had grown a little more confident with you around, and while he was still nervous, he was able to happily talk to you about all but the touchiest subjects. He seemed a little less worried, and he was more relaxed whenever you saw him working out. He even seemed to push himself a little more whenever he saw that you were nearby. You thought he might be trying to show off for you, but it was good to see him giving it his all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whenever he was outside, things were a bit different. Though he had gotten more confident when he was dealing with other people, he had also grown mistrustful of them. He was still able to talk to others, but he snapped rather easily, and whenever he thought someone was being threatening or upset, he tended to respond the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with the rumors of the fight, it meant that people were hesitant to trust him. The both of you were new to the area, and now, one of the first things that people know about him was that he had beat someone half to death. Though people had originally thought he was meek, it meant people now tried to avoid him when they saw him. It made him rather tense, and he still did very little to try to talk to others. When he worked now, there were only a few people that were willing to talk to him unless it was necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same whenever he visited you. While he was still as cheerful as ever while talking to you, everybody else nearby hesitated to talk to him. You did your best to keep him relaxed, and he did his best to stay cheerful around you, but it was a bit difficult to see people keeping clear of him. You knew he was still the same wonderful person, but the way everybody was acting simply made things worse for him. The fact that he shot glares at almost everybody who got close to you also caused some worries. Though he was simply being protective of you, most people simply couldn't understand why he almost always had a scowl, and thought he disliked most people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the days passed without too much incident. Ciel had finally started to talk a little more to others, and work was going well for you. It seemed as though things were going smoothly once again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, Ciel! I'm back!\" You dropped your backpack on the ground as you arrived home. You could hear the sound of weights from Ciel's room, and just smiled to yourself as you walked into the kitchen. \"Want me to make dinner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks!\" You heard a tired yell from his room. You just chuckled to yourself as you began. Somewhere in the last few weeks, it had become a habit. Since you had classes and work later than he did, he was almost always working out by the time you got home. His appetite had increased a bit, and since you were planning on cooking, you generally took care of the meals for you two. It meant you were a little busy when you got home, but you didn't mind. Lately, it seemed Ciel was even busier. Whenever you got home home, he was working out. It had been tough to find time between his classes and work, but he seemed to have made it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the shower running as you cut up a few veggies for him. You hurried as you worked, knowing he was quick whenever he was finishing up. He seemed more eager to meet you whenever he had a chance. It was just a relief for you to know that he had gotten a bit more manageable when he was out in public. Although people were still hesitant to approach him, now that he had met most of the people nearby, he was at least a little more willing to let others approach you. He still snapped whenever he was meeting new people, but he would at least take care of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, thankfully, it meant he was doing better at work. Now that he had become a bit more outspoken, it meant he was more confident when he worked. He had gotten a lot more work, and apparently he had gotten a bit of popularity as well. The number of views his pictures had were rising, and you really weren't surprised at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... here we go.\" Ciel barely had anything on as he stumbled into the kitchen. He had gained at least 10 pounds in the last few weeks, and it showed whenever you looked at him. You had been a little worried the first couple of times, wondering if it was healthy for him to be gaining at that rate. Although a few anthros were able to gain at a faster rate, Ciel certainly wasn't one of them. You had urged him to the doctor, and you had only relaxed after you had been assured that it was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still blushed a little bit as he sat down at the table. Although he was doing his best, he still couldn't keep calm when you were seeing him. You both remembered what you had said to him, and it looked like he was taking every opportunity he could to show off for you. But, though he had gotten the nerve to do it, he couldn't stay calm when he knew you were looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking better every day, Ciel.\" You smiled as you dropped his food in front, before sitting down near him. He seemed to blush deeper, staring at his food for a moment before focusing on it. You just kept looking at him as he began to eat. Although he was still working, you could see his shoulders a little broader and his chest pumped out from his workout. He was definitely looking better now, and although he knew it, he still seemed eager to work more at it. You couldn't help but smile before turning to your meal as well. He never took long to eat, but he was always happy to wait for you and talk to you while you finished your meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you always had a few hours after dinner. No matter what, you always did your best to make sure you could spend it with each other. Although it was pretty casual for you, it always seemed to mean more to him. Even if you were just watching TV, he always ended up snuggling up close. Although he was always nervous when he realized it, you didn't mind. It wasn't any more than what he seemed to do in his sleep, and you always felt warm with him that close to you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were starting to get a little worried about Ciel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed as healthy and content as ever. Whenever he was with you, he was more than happy to just to stay close. He was certainly devoted, and he worked as much as ever. He was certainly developing, and his weight was steadily increasing. He was able to spend enough time with you, and you were honestly surprised that he could still keep up with classes and his work with everything going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was what worried you. It had only been a couple of weeks, and he had somehow managed to get another 10 pounds on him. You had been keeping your eyes on him to make sure he was okay, and he was certainly willing when you wanted to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther people were noticing, too. He was getting more and more attention, and he had even been asked out by a couple of girls. He had apparently been too embarrassed to even give a proper response. He had gotten a bit of mockery at work. Of course, he had shouted a bit afterwards, and had gotten chewed out on the scene he had made. You were a little concerned about his job, but you were just grateful that people were even willing to talk to him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you couldn't help but worry about him. You had to swallow your worries and just ask him. You were concerned that he was doing something extreme, and more than anything, you didn't want him to end up hurting himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had decided to ask him yourself before bed. He was already half-asleep on the couch, and you couldn't blame him. The TV was on, but neither of you were paying too much attention to it as some movie played in the background. You felt him shift a little, and his body was leaning in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Ciel. We'd better get you to bed. You're really too tired right now.\" You did your best to put his hand against his arm, and shifted a little to try to pick him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped awake a little as he heard his voice, and gently nodded. \"O-okay... Thanks...\" There was a light blush on his face as he leaned in, stumbling a little bit towards the bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ciel. I'm always here to look out for you, remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to be able to look out for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... Please, take care of yourself first, okay?\" You paused to look straight at him, a serious look on your face. \"Don't do anything to hurt yourself, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not... Why would you think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... It's been a week, and you've put on ten pounds. I know you want to look good, but not if it means you're taking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not!\" You looked at his expression, and while you expected him to be mad or upset, he had a worried look. \"I'd never do that!\" He had pulled you in tight against his body, and while it was a little uncomfortable, his voice was starting to panic. \"I know you'd hate it, and I'd never want you to worry about me even more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel, I believe you.\" He stopped as he heard you speak, letting go to try to look at you face-to-face. \"Ciel, you've never lied to me about something this important. I believe you, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you!\" His expression had brightened suddenly, squeezing against your sides and happily lifting you up into the air. You were a little surprised, but held still. \"I know it's fast, a-and I can't tell you why, but... But I promise, I won't do anything to hurt myself, okay? Y-you'd worry too much about me if I did...\" You were starting to feel a little uncomfortable, but your arms gently wrapped over his shoulders, returning the hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... Thanks. Really.\" You gently leaned in, your hand brushing against one of his ears. \"I'm... I'm really glad you're thinking of me.\" You couldn't resist leaning in as he looked back at you. He always looked so sweet whenever he was this close. You hesitated for a moment, but gave him a soft kiss on his forehead. His eyes widened as he held you, and he simply didn't know what to do. He simply held you there silently for a couple of minutes, blushing deeply before slowly letting you back onto the floor. Every motion of his body was clear as he moved, and being that close made it incredibly clear that he was really growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" He just blushed softly, slowly beginning to walk to his bedroom, holding onto you for as long as he could. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night was one like most others. You had climbed into bed rather early, getting comfortable in your bed. It didn't take too long before you could hear the sound of Ciel stumbling through the hallway and pushing your door open gently. It creaked open and you could hear a couple of mumbles coming from him as he slipped in closer. It always amazed you that he was so quiet in his sleep, even when he was creeping up that close to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel him move onto your bed, crawling in against you. In a few moments, he had his body close to yours, a small smile on his face as he shifted in. His thumb pushed up close to his mouth, and you gingerly held him as he seemed to relax. Your eyes gently closed as you felt his body in. At night, when he was inches from you, it was always clear how much he was growing. You could easily reach every inch of him, and even when your hands were a little firm, he barely shifted and moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently pulled him in, holding around and squeezing as you drifted off. His fur brushed lightly along, and he curled up in your arms, his body shifting to try to remain against your grip. His thumb was now pressed between his lips as he shook and pressed into your body, almost still as he slept in your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud bang suddenly drove your eyes open. Maybe a car had backfired somewhere nearby, or someone had fired off something. You didn't really have too much time to think about it when you saw Ciel's eyes wide open as well. He seemed to be confused for the moment, but with one of his arms pressed against you, there really wasn't that much else he could make of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did I... Oh, no...\" Ciel pulled his hand away, covering his mouth a little bit as he backed away from you. You tried to sit up as you saw him moving to the doorway, his confusion quickly turning to horror. \"I-I'm sorry! I never meant t-to... I-I'll leave you alone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel, wait!\" Before you could say anything else, he quickly dashed out of your room, the door almost slamming shut along the way. You sighed, clenching your fist and cursing to yourself. Ciel always came in his sleep without any bad intentions, and somehow, because of some accident, he was forced away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed as you got up, trying to shake the last remnants of sleep off of yourself. It was clearly something that you had to talk to him about. It seemed as though he was worried about what had happened, and that was the last thing you wanted. You did your best to keep him in the dark so he wouldn't worry, and even if he knew, you still didn't want him to worry. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed a little bit as you stood up, opening the door quietly. The hallway was still dark, but it didn't take long for you to fumble your way towards Ciel's room. The two of you called it his, but all it really had was his exercise equipment. He had always slept in the same room as you, and until today, it had never been a problem. However, now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, trying to suppress your worries as you approached. It was the only place he would run to right now, and as you got closer, it became clear that he was in it. It became easier and easier to find your way to him, a soft, rhythmic noise coming from his direction. You moved to his door, but the noise seemed quiet muffled even when you got that close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed a little, trying to keep yourself calm as you knocked on his door. You heard a slight gasp and the noise seemed to stop as he heard it. \"I-is that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me. Can I come in, Ciel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't... I know that I was making a huge mistake, but p-please, don't c-come in and yell or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel, you know me. You know I'm not mad, don't you?\" You did your best to keep your voice straight. It was hard enough to do when you were worried about him, and hearing him as worried as he was did nothing to reassure you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn\u2019t think so, b-but this...\" Your heart sank as you heard his voice. No matter what happened, you certainly didn't want him to be depressed at it. \"This might be a-an exception... I n-never meant...\" He paused for a moment, and you heard the noises resume. \"I-I'm kind of distracted working out... Can we talk about it later?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... Will you please open the door? I want to talk face-to-face with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no noise for a minute, but it was all you could do to wait there. You were about to speak again, when you heard the doorknob slowly turning. Ciel's eyes were a little watery, and he was sweating a little bit. It looked as though he was trying to work off his feelings, but he wasn't having much luck with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the door was open, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately reached your arms around his chest, stepping in to hug him tight. He nearly jumped back, but you kept your grip on him, closing your eyes as you leaned in gently. \"I didn't want to say anything until you were ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel his pulse racing, and he seemed to hesitate before letting a hand pull you away. You didn't do much to resist him, and by now, it didn't feel like there was too much you could do. He easily managed to get out of your grip, and looked right at you as he spoke. \"B-but... But I'm not ready... N-not for this...\" He blushed as he sat down on a bench, and you quietly took a seat next to him. \"Y-you mean the world to me... But I don't want to... I won't push that on you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... \" You moved your hand onto  his, holding it firmly. He took a breath as he tried to keep speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you said you weren't ready yet, and I don't want to force you... I t-thought I would be able to c-control myself, but... But even while I was sleeping...\" He tried to lean into his hands, shaking a bit as you felt it rising. \"I... My body didn't want to wait... I... I really wanted to be with you at night...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy it?\" He had a surprised expression as he turned to look at you. Whatever he thought you'd say, that certainly wasn't it. He stared for a moment, but you cleared your throat before repeating yourself. \"Did you enjoy sleeping there with me?\" Your voice was steady as you spoke, and you gently held against his hand as you waited for his response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" He lightly blushed as he looked at you, shifting a little awkwardly. \"To be honest, when I was there, I was... I was dreaming about it...\" He blushed deeper, doing his best to keep speaking as his voice continued shaking. \"About when I would be able to really be with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" You chucked softly, letting a hand shift over his shoulders, thinking quietly to yourself. Ciel was definitely calming down, and you had to wonder if it was time to let him know. Now was as good of a time as any, but you certainly didn't want to put more pressure on him now when he was already so nervous. However, in the end, you quietly asked. \"Was it the same dream you've been having for a long time now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes opened wide as he heard you say it. His blush was completely red, and he barely managed to stammer out a few words. \"H-how d-did you... Oh, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... This isn't the first time.\" You felt him trying to back away, but this time, you kept a firm grip on his hand. You knew he could easily get loose, but he seemed hesitant to let your grip slide off. \"You've been sliding in with me for a while now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I can't believe-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed a finger to his lip, quieting him down as you moved in close. \"Ciel. I know you. And I know you have the purest intentions when it comes to something like this.\" You moved in closer, his pulse racing as you pressed in. \"I trust you. Completely. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry about it. I don't mind. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears seemed to stand up a little as he heard those words, and he slowly straightened up from his slouch. \"Y-you don't?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... I've seen you coming in a couple of times. You always looked so cute and peaceful in your sleep...\" You took the time to lightly brush around a bit of his fur, his body finally relaxing as you remained close to it. \"I know right now, you're just my friend, but... I've never had a problem with you being close to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even with... Sleeping with you?\" He seemed lost for words, but you gave him a small nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you, Ciel. Even when you're sleeping with me... I know it's okay. I'm always safe and warm with you... And I know you wouldn't ever do anything extreme without letting me know. So... It's okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his face close to yours, his breaths pushing against you. His every breath seemed to be a little slow, and his body shifted as he finally let his arms hold against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is this okay, too?\" He blushed and nuzzles against your cheek before finally planting a kiss there, his arms gently wrapping around you. His fur seemed a little wet as he held you, a little sweat along his body as he held around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to hesitate a little bit. But, seeing his weak smile and his waiting eyes, you couldn't help yourself. \"Yeah... It's okay.\" You just held him tight, before slowly leaning in and returning the kiss. He seemed to be content, and you could see his tail shifting and wagging a little as he held you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm really glad... I've... I've wanted to do this for a long time...\" He slowly leaned down along the bench, keeping you tight in his arms as he fell. You were a little surprised when he did it, but you did your best not to let it show. Despite his strength, his arms were still warm and gentle as he held you against his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you can.\" You let your arms shift over his shoulders, lying against his body. He rubbed over your back softly, and you were content to rest against him. You couldn't help smiling as you saw him curling up a little bit, turning sideways to gently hold to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... For telling me everything...\" He blushed softly as he held you in. \"I've always been so worried... I mean... It's always been enough that you've been living with me, and taking care of me... I'm... I'm going to do my best to take care of you, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... I told you before... Take care of yourself, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. But... I want to be strong enough to really take care of you, no matter what happens. So... So I have to be able to say everything to you...\" He blushed a little bit as he held you, his voice quieting down as he barely managed to eek out a whisper. \"Y-you told me things that you were nervous about, so I have something to tell you, too...\" He tried to keep calm, but you could see the excitement in his face. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You mean, more than you are now?\" You tried to keep calm as you heard him speak, but the idea was a bit much for you. You were a little concerned for him, worried about how things might turn out, and you had to admit, you were a little excited at the idea. He seemed to only notice the last, giving an eager nod as he held tight against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm part of a... Well... I still can't say...\" He shifted a little awkwardly, but you shook your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Just tell me what you can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and nodded softly, giving you another small kiss as he held you. \"Thanks... Anyways, part of it is... If I'm with you... If I really stay close to you... I'll grow more. I know it sounds crazy, but I've been growing so fast because... Well, partially because you've been so close and so kind to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head as you give his arm a gentle squeeze. He jumped a little at the gesture, blushing as he tried to flex a little bit for you. You had to struggle a little to try to make it give, and he seemed to blush deeper as he watched you try. You couldn't help but smile when you settled on squeezing it firmly, holding against him. \"Ciel... You've definitely earned this. You've always worked your tail off when it comes to this, and I'm always happy to help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted lightly as he held you in, blushing as his other arm rubbed down his body. \"I'm really glad you like it... I know I wanted to get stronger, but... But I was afraid you'd think I was a freak, or that I was trying to be a jock or something...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently squeeze him in, trying to reach around him. \"Of course not. I know you're the same, sweet guy I've always known, at this or any size. I want you to be happy, Ciel. So, grow as big as you want to get...\" You chuckle and give him a firm squeeze as your body presses to his, feeling him just shift and curl up a little. \"I promise, I'll still find you handsome and wonderful every step of the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just gave a firm nod as he snuggled in, holding you close as he curled up a little. His eyes were drifting off now, and it seemed as though he was moments away from sleep. You simply did your best to keep your arms around him, even as he stretched out a little. You smiled to yourself as you saw his hands shift up, knowing he was off in his dreams as you held around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Ciel...\" You gave one of his ears a gentle kiss as you held him through the night. You saw him smiling in his sleep, giving the slightest of twitches as you hold him. It wasn't the most comfortable spot to sleep, but with him tight in your arms, you couldn't complain. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were a little awkward between the two of you. It certainly took some getting used to for him. Waking up in your arms was a whole new experience for him, and he always seemed hesitant to leave. You had considered getting up before him like you used to, but now that he knew, it simply seemed better to stay with him for as long as you could, enjoying the feeling of your fuzzy friend tight in your arms. You only left after he had risen in your arms, and had given you a firm squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always took care of breakfast after you got out, but he seemed to take longer to get out. He seemed hesitant to leave the sheets, and would only manage to pull himself out after you were already done cooking. He ate rather quickly before the two of you had to leave, but you didn't mind too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he was always there by the time you got back from work. He seemed fond of working out more than ever, and it was getting quite clear that he was growing at an incredible rate. You could swear he was visibly bigger each time, and when you checked the scale, he had gained another 8 pounds in a matter of days. He was easily up at 215 pounds by now, and would make quite an impression whenever someone saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did present its own challenges. You had heard that by now, even though he was acting a bit calmer, people were getting scared of him simply because of his size. It wasn't bad for anybody that knew him, but people he had met before were nervous of him, and that tended to put him in a bad mood. He had apparently broken a few things at work, and when he got back some days, he needed help cooling off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, nights were much better for you two. You would often be in bed first, and he would always try to get in a small workout before bed. As a result, every day, when you were about to drift off, he would lightly step in, and try to sneak in under your arms. Although he was quiet, you'd always find yourself wide awake when he entered, his body pressing and rubbing along yours. He didn't say a word, and simply let his hands hold your sides loosely. Even with his increasing bulk, he would always manage to find a way to curl up in your arms. And whenever you saw him sleep, you would always relax, glad that you were able to keep him close that way. He always seemed like a fluffy little rabbit whenever he was resting close to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings finally seemed to settle down again after a while. Despite the oddities, both of you had gotten used to the new development, and were content with each other. However, another event would soon weigh on both of your minds...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought it'd be another normal day when you set out. It certainly seemed like it when you woke up, Ciel right next to you with his eyes fluttering slowly. You had to chuckle as you saw him still deep asleep, shifting out to try not to wake him. It was breakfast, then class, then work. You had gotten into the routine quite well, and had even brought a bit of extra food back for Ciel this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you arrived back at your place, he wasn't home. It felt a little bit odd to you, but you thought he might still be late at work or something. You had tried to give his phone a call, but it seemed as though it was either off, or couldn't get a signal. He usually just kept it on vibrate, so you couldn't help but worry a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to think too much about it while you ate, but you couldn't help worrying a bit. Ciel certainly hadn't been the best off when he was with other people, and unless he trusted them, he had gotten rather short-tempered. It was all you could do to hope that he would be back soon, and it was difficult to resist the urge to call again by the time you were done washing up the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly jumped as you heard your phone ringing from your pocket. It only took a moment before you had checked the number calling, a relieved tone coming from your voice as you answered. \"Ciel? That you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed out of breath, but it was just good for you to hear his voice. \"Yeah... I'm okay... Just stuck on campus... Do you think you could meet me out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel? Is something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed hesitant to respond, but you could hear him speak after a little while. \"I'm okay. I just... Got into a fight. P-please don't say anything right now... I-I'll talk to you after we get home, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Your throat was a little dry as you heard it. You had to work hard not to shout, but you could practically hear him wincing over the phone. Swallowing your worries for the moment, you tried to speak. \"O-okay... Where are you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at the health station on campus. They already said there's nothing major... I just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I'll be there soon.\" You were already starting to run out the door by the time you had hung up. It was close to the same path that you travelled every day, but you had never made travelled the distance as fast as you had now. Even when you were late, it didn't have nearly the same urgency that Ciel did right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you made it, you were exhausted and out of breath. Your legs were burning and your vision was a little blurry, but you kept pushing yourself to get there in time. You were trying to push through towards the door, and had almost missed Ciel, who was waiting near the entrance. You had nearly tripped into him, barely managing to stop your mad dash when you saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're here...\" He was looking at the ground, trying to shift a little awkwardly. \"S-sorry to bother you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel? What's wrong?\" You were doing your best to catch your breath, your hands on your knees as you tried to relax. However, it only was a moment before you looked up at him, your hands slipping a little when you saw his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still in decent condition. There didn't seem to be anything broken, and he was still in one piece. However, he had numerous bruises against his body, and his fur was dirty and bloody in a couple of places, the mess showing through the tears in his clothing. He had gotten a black eye, and while it looked like he had tried to clean himself off a bit, he hadn't gotten the chance to do it very well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really not that big of a deal...\" His voice seemed a little tired as he spoke, and it did seem shaky. However, he still managed to put out a small smile as he saw you. \"They had a chance to look at me, and said my wounds were minor... I've got a couple of minor internal things, but I'll heal up fine in a couple of days...\" He tried to sound convincing, but his voice was a little quiet, and neither of you really bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but you sure can't work looking like that...\" You sighed and shook your head a little. \"I'm just glad you're in one piece. I was worried you couldn't walk home on your own or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that serious. Just a little sore when I try to move. Little bit tired, too...\" He tried to step towards you, his body still moving, but shaking a little. \"I think I could probably make it if I tried, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing finally calmed down as you held against his hand. He suddenly looked directly at you, and you managed to give him a small nod. \"I'm just glad you're okay. The cuts and scrapes will heal alright, and we can get you cleaned up properly.\" You firmly squeezed his hand as you held on, before shifting him so he could lean on your shoulder. \"Come on... Let's get you home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see him blush out of the corner of your eyes, but you ignored it. He was probably nervous enough as it was, and the both of you knew you'd have to talk about the fight when you got back. You didn't see any reason to make it worse by saying something now. You just focused on moving forward, one step at a time. You tried your best not to rush, even as you felt his weight pressing into your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to make you do this...\" He tried to speak as you moved, although it sounded like it was a little rough. \"I think I was doing okay, but by the time you got here, the adrenalin had worn off... Just feel really off now...\" He sighed a little bit as he kept moving steadily, leaning in against you. \"Must seem ridiculous... Big guy like me, and I still have to ask you to help... I just didn't want anybody to see me in this shape...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow more than ever, you had realized just how much he had grown. His body was pushing firmly against you, and though he wasn't moving much, you could still feel his weight pushing you forwards and his body brushing into you. Though his fur cushioned him a little, it was still quite clear that under it all, he had gotten quite tough. But despite that, he was more worried about appearing weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous. I'm always here to help you, Ciel. Always. And I'm glad you called. If you had tried walking back alone, I would've probably called the police by the time you got back.\" You shifted a little, trying to adjust his position a little bit. \"Besides, being tired isn't being weak. I'd much rather do this for you than have you collapse in the middle of the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It had taken a while to try to walk back. You didn't want to force Ciel to move that fast, even with help. He had managed a decent pace, but he seemed like he wanted to keep you from seeing his face while he still had the massive bruise over his left eye. You didn't know what other people would think, watching you help your friend along as he leaned in against you. But you just wanted to get him home, safe and sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour place was finally in sight when you felt his body pressed in against you. You had done your best to catch Ciel onto your back, a little surprised when it happened. \"Ciel? You okay?\" You asked, the concern clear in your voice as you tried to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... Just a little tired...\" He tried to smile, but his face looked a little off. It looked as though even the walk had drained what little energy he still had left. You just gave a nod, and quickly made up your mind. With a bit of effort, you put your arms around him, giving a bit of a heave before pulling him onto your back. He gave a small gasp as he felt it, before trying to speak. \"W-what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me do this, okay?\" You turned to him, looking back into his clear eye as you held him. \"We both know at the rate you're growing, I won't be able to lift you around that much longer. I want to help you every way I can, and right now, that means carrying you while I'm still able to.\" You managed to walk a little faster as you held him tight. It was certainly tough for you to keep a steady pace, but you didn't want to let Ciel slip from your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... I-I'm supposed to...\" He blushed a little bit at the thought, shaking a little bit. You tried to adjust your grip to hold him steadily, but you could feel him shivering a little bit. \"I... I want to be stronger so I can take care of you... You shouldn't have to do this... I don't want to keep doing this... I want to be strong enough so you don't have to keep protecting me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll always be here to take care of you. I promise.\" You shifted a little to get your door open, having a bit of trouble keeping Ciel on your back. You could've placed him on the ground, but you didn't want to let him go until you had to. \"No matter what, whether I need to or not... When you get too heavy for me to carry, you can still lean on me.\" You managed to swing the door open, gently climbing the steps into your place and moving to the bedroom. \"And even when you get stronger... You could be the strongest guy in the world, and I'd still be here to help take care of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally managed to lean back into the bed, laying him down. You turned to see him, and while he had a light blush on his face, he was relaxed as he looked at you, closing his eyes. \"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed quietly as you saw him finally resting. His breathing seemed okay, and while he was worn out, he didn't seem to be in any danger. You just laid your arm against his body, giving him a soft rub as he relaxed. There were still things on your mind, but they could wait the night. It was better to let Ciel have a night of peace, first. </span></div></div>",

How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less the same.\" You smiled as you peeked at him through the doorway. He was still quite a mess after the last night, but he seemed to be doing a whole lot better after a night of sleep. A couple of the bruises were a bit lighter, and as you watched him stretch and yawn, it seemed as though his body was recovering nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw him stretching and scratching at himself as he slowly pushed out of bed. His nose gave a small twitch as he moved, smiling a bit as he looked at you. \"Do I smell breakfast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch. You slept in late.\" You saw him give a little jump, turning suddenly before you spoke again. \"Relax. I already called the school and work for you. Considering the condition they saw you in, they didn't need much convincing to let you off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" He shifted a little bit, pulling at the tattered remains of his shirt. \"Then... What are you doing here?\" He blushed a little bit, trying to move a little as he tossed it into the laundry basket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked for some time off, too. And before you say anything, we both know you'd probably try to 'work off' this injury, with the way you've been acting. I'm here so someone's got their eye on you.\" His mouth didn't get to remain open for very long, but all he could do was give a feeble nod when he looked at you. \"Come on. We can get some food, then get you into the bath.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was halfway through changing his clothes when he realized that he was still a huge mess. He blushed and nodded as he started to walk out of the room. \"Sounds good...\" You chuckled as you took his hand, only lightly pulling him along as you helped him into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled as you watched him eat, only lightly munching on your own food. His meals had grown a fair size lately, and while it was manageable, you had gotten groceries a couple of extra times in the last few weeks. It was a little tricky trying to think of food that he'd be able to eat and still like, but he usually wasn't very picky. He was always a little noisy, and he had enough to go through that you could always take your time with your meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a few minutes in, you had to ask him. \"So... What happened? I called the school and all, but they said that you had arrived with those injuries.\" He looked ready to answer, and his chewing slowed down for a moment, but his voice was quite clear when he finally swallowed and responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... I told you before, I got into a fight. A couple of guys followed me after work.\" He took another bite from a bit of celery , taking his time to chew through it as you spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would a couple of guys pick a fight with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't... Not exactly...\" He gave a small sigh as he shook his head. \"Okay. Originally, it wasn't bad. They recognized me from what I do, asked to see me pose a little, nothing too big.\" He gave a small smile at the idea, shaking his head a little. \"They asked for a feel, and I let them see my arm. It seemed pretty good up to that point. After, they said that they knew someone bigger. Bit irritating to be compared, but nothing huge. I think I got a little loud, challenged the guy or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say you'd fight him or something, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, the thought had come up, but no.\" He took another bite, looking a little thoughtful as he looked back. \"It was Jerik. You know, that one bear on the hockey team?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a small \"tsk\" as you nodded to him. Jerik was a heavy polar bear, and was fairly well known around school for being a bit rough, but as far as you knew, he had never done anything major. He didn't really seem to pay attention to anybody who wasn't already on a team, and you heard that he had his pick from a few girls on campus. However, this was the first time you've ever heard of him getting in a fight outside of a game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, met him. Wasn't too bad at first. Think he was surprised to see someone my size and not recognize me before. I think they were just joking around about everything, and we were just going to arm wrestle to prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound too bad... How'd it get to a fight from there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, both of us were a little... rough.\" He seemed to flinch a little bit as he looked at you, half-expecting you to get upset when he mentioned it. \"First couple of times, it was just back and forth, and neither of us really took it too seriously. But somewhere along the way, I think it escalated a bit. Neither of us really wanted to lose, and I think by the end of it, he had made a bet he really didn't want to pay up on. The end of it's pretty blurry for me. There was some shouting, and I'm really not sure which one of us threw the first punch. All I remember is that the other guys had decided to stay out of it, and it ended after the table we were wrestling on broke. The fall really hurt, and I think we sort of snapped out of it when we were both getting up. After that, I ran out before anything else happened. I made it out okay, and that's when the injuries really started to smart. And... Well... You remember how you found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed gently as you saw him staring into his plate of food. He seemed a little nervous and shifted in place before taking another big bite of food. You weren't quite sure what to make of his story, but you were just glad he didn't snap at someone random. With the way things were, you were a little worried that it would've been the case. You were going to give him some time to finish eating before speaking, but he seemed to try to keep something in his mouth, trying to avoid the pressure of giving a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long as you're both okay... Honestly, after the last fight you were in, I'm just glad you're in one piece. I know it can get hectic sometimes, and... Well, I'm just glad you're okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly swallowed, nearly choking as he tried to free up his mouth. \"T-thanks...\" He gave a small cough before shaking his head. \"I know I've been a little... on edge lately. I think your name got mentioned somewhere, and I got a little worried. I don't even remember the whole thing now...\" He shook a little bit, but you smiled and shook your head. \"I just... I don't like it... Sometimes, people just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" You didn't say another word, just letting him get the rest of his food down in silence. It took a couple of awkward minutes before you quietly stood up. \"I'll get the tub ready for you, okay?\" He seemed too distracted by his food to really realize what you had said, and simply nodded as you walked into the bathroom. </span></div></div>",

It took him a couple of minutes to finish eating before he arrived. He was a little surprised to see you still in the room, shifting a little awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I guess this'll keep me out of your hair for a little bit.\" He shifted a little bit, trying to move out of your sight at he started to remove the only bit of clothing he still had on. You smiled as you saw his tail wiggling a bit, trying to pull everything from the boxers he had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood for a moment, a little uncertain as you looked at him. Although he had his back turned to you, it was pretty clear that he was still a little nervous about exposing himself. Still, things weren't going to get any easier if you gave him more time. You just swallowed your fear as you asked him, \"Ciel... Want me to help you wash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather loud rip sounded as you saw his hand slip, his boxers tearing clean off of his legs as he pulled them. You knew he might've gotten caught off-guard your comment, but this was certainly a new one. You saw him turn a little bit, and if he wasn't blushing before, he certainly was now. He did his best to awkwardly cover up a little as he only turned his head to you. \"R-really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I don't think you can really reach your back by now, and I don't mind helping.\" You were trying to sound cool about it, but your face felt a little flushed, and it wasn't hard for him to see that you were a little embarrassed by the idea, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'd like that...\" He could only give a meek smile as he shifted a little bit, still trying to keep both of his hands firm over his crotch as he moved towards the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Ciel... We're not in a rush or anything...\" You smiled as you saw him move closer, most of his body exposed to you, his fur a little bit on-end as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... If y-you don't mind...\" He seemed to blush deeper as he spoke, sitting on the rim of the tub as he looked at you. \"I don't want to be the only one like this... I-I want to see you, too... D-do you mind taking off your clothes? J-just your shirt is okay!\" You heard him stammering out the last sentence, clearly flustered at the idea of asking. However, you gave your shirt a pull, tugging it off without a second thought. He seemed relieved, but that soon became closer to alarm when you slipped your pants down, leaving only your undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. This okay for you, Ciel?\" You didn't really know what he expected to see, but it didn't feel too bad doing it. It wasn't more than anything you'd show if you were going swimming, and you were certainly comfortable enough with Ciel to show a bit of skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than enough!\" He was bright red by now, and you were honestly a little bit amazed that he could even blush that much through his fur. He slowly sunk into the tub, jumping a little bit as he tried to get used to the heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Long as you're comfortable.\" You smiled as you stared at him, just letting him soak for a while. His eyes seemed to linger on you as the water slowly streamed into his fur, and the way he was looking, you couldn't tell if the water or his face was warmer. He seemed content to just stare at you as he slowly lowered himself in. The bits of dirt seemed to clear up a little bit, and you watched him sink deeper and deeper. It was pretty clear that he was going to need a bit of help, and both of his hands were firmly placed over his crotch, shifting a little bit. You couldn't help but chuckle a little bit as you picked up the soap, finally starting to get a light lather onto your hands. \"I'm amazed. I thought you were used to exposing yourself by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not like this... I can pose for pictures and stuff. That's easy to do now. I-I mean... I know that plenty of people think I look good.\" You gave a nod, and he seemed to relax the smallest bit, his body releasing a little of its tension. \"B-but I've never done anything like this before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I've seen your work, remember? It's never been this much, but you've still done plenty of...\" You pressed your hands against his shoulders, starting to work there. He sat up, turning around to give you better reach. \"Well... I remember that one where you weren't wearing anything but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" He gave a soft cry as you spoke, clearly trying hard not to let you say it. You had to give a small chuckle as you moved along, letting your fingertips slip and press over his broad shoulders. You leaned in a little closer, watching him slouch forward and relax as you worked. \"T-that's not what I meant, though...\" He sighed a little, wiggling as he tried to straighten up a bit. \"I-I don't mind other people seeing my body... I mean, I've really worked hard for it! I think I deserve to show off a little bit...\" His tone had a bit of pride in it, and you couldn't blame him for that. Though his fur was soaked and his body was still messy, he had a strong frame, and he gave off a very forceful feeling when he was into things. \"B-but... I w-want you to see all of me. Nobody else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear him breathing a little hard as your hands moved down, digging through his fur as you tried to clear it of the specks of dirt and blood that lingered there. \"Really, Ciel? I know that... That I matter a lot to you, but you could probably get anybody you wanted. Quite a few people would jump at the chance to see you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anybody else...\" He blushed deeper as you worked, a light moan coming from his mouth as you pushed in. You had to work a little bit to get a good grip on his back, your hands slowly pressing and working down as you scrubbed through. \"Y-you're the one that... That's always been around me. If anybody's going to see me, it'll be you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to swallow a little as you worked. Things had certainly progressed much further than you had thought they might. Living with Ciel had felt completely natural to you, and you had to admit, you wouldn't mind sticking with him. But more than that, he was always working so hard to try to please you. Even with all of the worries of what might happen, you had to admit that you truly loved Ciel. \"You... You deserve anybody you want, Ciel... But... But I'm glad I'm lucky enough to...\" You swallow a little, your hands pausing as you lean in enough, looking right at his eyes as he turned to see you. \"When you're really ready... I'll enjoy seeing every bit of you. I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his blush, he finally broke into a deep, wide smile as your hands began to move again.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You blushed as you saw his arms slowly move away, shaking and splashing the water around. However embarrassed you were at the idea of seeing him, it was quite clear that he was more embarrassed at the idea of exposing himself to you. However, despite both of your inhibitions, his voice was quite clear when he spoke. \"I'm ready now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only give a small nod to him, your gaze slowly turning down his body. He was completely soaked by now, and you could easily see every curve of his body. It was incredible to see how cut and heavy he looked now. You knew he was mostly relaxed, but every inch of his body was pushing out a little, clear and defined. You had known just from the way his body felt, with your hands lightly pushing against him. However, his chest clearly pushed out, and you could see each section of his six-pack as your eyes moved down, eventually settling on his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You really have been taking good care of your body.\" You blushed as you spoke, and you couldn't help staring a little bit. He was still soft, but his shaft laid against his legs, a good six or seven inches long. His sack hung down a little against it, his balls shifting a little as he tried to adjust himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... I told you...\" It was his turn to try to sound calm. However, he clearly wasn't doing a very good job of it. You could see him shift around a little bit, caught between trying to cover himself up and trying to really show off for you. Your gaze slowly turned away as you pulled back a little bit, just focused on taking care of the sizeable space you still had to clean. His shaft seemed to twitch a little bit as you worked along, and he certainly seemed to enjoy the feeling. However, he simply didn't know how to react, and he was clearly nervous about you noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Ciel... It's okay if you enjoy this.\" You smile as you washed, and blushed a tiny bit as he nodded. He kept still for a while, before getting a little bit of soap as well as he gently started to move down, working along his legs and down to his paws. He shifted around a little bit, but both of you really didn't have too much to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you had finished cleaning through his fur and back, he had gotten a good bit of his legs done as well. You were done with his back, and he was still working down slowly, so you just got a bit more soap on your hands as you prepared. He seemed to sigh contentedly as you let go of his body, but his eyes widened again as you placed your arms onto his chest. \"W-wha...\" He stared at you, open-mouthed, his head so close to your body as he gazed along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done with your back... I think that I can help with the rest of you, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it was unmistakable. His shaft was slowly rising as you squeezed along, digging against his chest. You could feel his pecs push out a little against your hands. It was a bit of effort to get all of the dirty bits out of his fur, and you certainly couldn't be gentle trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear him calling your name with a bit of effort, a few soft moans coming from his mouth as he released his legs. It seemed as though he was really enjoying it, and you couldn't help but blush when you heard his tone. It took you a while to finish, with him shifting around in your grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensitive there, are you?\" You lightened up a tiny bit, but you heard a sharp gasp as your fingertip brushed against the point there while you pulled it away. \"Didn't know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... I don't usually let people put their hands there...\" He blushed deeply as he turned his head down, looking nervously at his crotch. He was completely hard now, his cock standing almost straight up as you looked as well. You had to be amazed at it, the length easily eight or nine inches as you held him close. \"B-but you're...\" He slowly turned his gaze up to you, blushing as he spoke. \"You're really firm... It's nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" You tried to turn your eyes away from his, but all it did was make you focus on something else. \"Wow... I thought you had something to hide, but... You really are massive, Ciel...\" You could feel his body getting warmer as he moved, his head turning down as he tried to hide his feelings. You slowly let go of his chest, not wanting to make things worse for him as he just stared down his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awkwardly shifted, turning to look at you as you slowly stood up. He seemed to want to say something, but he couldn't force a single sound out from his mouth. You looked at him for a moment, before quietly speaking. \"I... uh... think I've done enough...\" You awkwardly shook the water from your hands, trying to laugh it off but only managing to put out a feeble gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still blushing deeply, and despite the awkwardness of the moment, his shaft remained stiff, poking a bit out of the water as he stared at you. He managed to give his head a little move, before asking quietly...</span></div></div>",

You had supposed that he had beat off sometime, but you never really gave it too much thought. It seemed the same for him, and he only managed a slight nod as you walked out, closing the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and closed the door behind you, a little grateful that Ciel hadn't gotten a better look at you. Although it wasn't really noticeable, your cock had shifted and stiffened a little while you were washing him. You had never really given it much thought before, but it was becoming increasingly apparent that you enjoyed the chance to really get your hands over him and squeeze him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head a bit as you leaned against the door. \"Come on... Get it together... You're sleeping with him already... You know you can't think like that... Control yourself a bit more...\" You muttered to yourself and shook your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to jump a little as you heard a rather loud splashing from the tub. You weren't sure what Ciel was doing now, but he certainly wasn't being subtle about it. You had to blush and chuckle at the idea of the massive guy trying to do something in the tub, both of his hands moving down as he tried to grip his eager-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough.\" You tried to keep yourself calm, adjusting yourself a little bit as you moved back into your room. You wanted to get some clothes on before he came out, and you couldn't interrupt him while he was busy with... things you couldn't think about right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked out a rather heavy shirt and a pair of jeans. After the two of you had almost completely exposed yourself, you didn't really feel like trying to flaunt it more. There was already enough on your mind, and you certainly didn't want to put more pressure on him. You tried your best to make yourself look presentable, before returning into the living room to wait for him. You could still hear his sounds, and were honestly a little surprised that he was still in the bathroom. You hadn't exactly tried to change very fast, and your thoughts had distracted you every step of the way. You simply moved into the living room, sitting down on the couch, before trying to lay back and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear a muffled yell from the bathroom, and honestly had to jump a little bit. You guessed that Ciel had just finished, but felt like there was simply no way he could make that sort of noise all the time. It wasn't something you felt like you'd miss. It made you shift a little awkwardly, and it was difficult to avoid imagining him after all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done...\" His voice was a little bit quiet as he poked his head from the bathroom, looking around for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Enjoy your bath, Ciel?\" You do your best to keep your voice calm, and were honestly amazed that you were able to do so. Whatever you felt right now, it clearly didn't hold a candle towards the intensity of his blush. He gave you a large nod, before moving out, a towel wrapped around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. It was nice.\" He blushed and started to move, walking towards you slowly. \"Um... Thanks for... Ah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say any more...\" You do your best to relax, nodding as you see him approach. \"It's kind of an... odd topic to talk about, right? So... so I won't say anything if you don't want to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay... I wanted to... To thank you properly. I know it must be pretty crazy for you... I mean, I know you're still thinking about things, a-and that you might not be into guys, and all that, so... So thanks for being with me when I'm... You know. Taking care of my own urges...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow before speaking, your throat feeling a little off as you do. \"It's okay... I think I can.... erm... bear it. I mean, to be honest, I kind of... You know... Got an idea of what you were doing...\" You saw him blush deeper as he sat close to you. \"To be honest, I... I think I enjoyed the idea of... of you... You know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you... You liked... thinking about me? \" He seemed a little dazed as you spoke, his mind trying to process what you were saying. You were being extraordinarily vague, and you swallowed as you tried to clear things up, for him and for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how else to put it, but...\" You swallowed, trying to stay calm. You knew you had to be honest with him about it. The way things were looking, you wouldn't be able to keep it a secret from him for very long. Even if you could, you wouldn't want to. You had to be honest with him now. \"I sort of got... a little turned on when I saw it.\" His expression seemed to linger, but his eyes stared straight at you as you spoke. \"I think by now it's pretty clear that that I find you... Appealing. In a lot of ways.\" Your mind kept going over your choice of words, but there didn't seem to be any better way to put it. \"So, when we're ready... We can... You know. Try going out or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost see his heart rise in his expression. He was positively beaming at you as he nodded, eagerly sitting against you. You didn't even have time to sit up before you felt his body lightly pressed to yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea what it means to hear you say that!\" You could feel his tail wag and push, gently wiggling against your belly as he happily sat against you. You were about to say more, but he seemed to take the words out of your mouth as he kept rubbing up close. \"I know this doesn't really make us boyfriends or anything yet, but... But I don't want to rush it. I'd rather do this the right way with you.\" He just smiled as he kept pushing, the towel starting to slip from the constant movement of his tail. \"I'm just... I'm just so happy that we can try this together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to pull yourself up, your body shifting and pressing against his while you move. You sigh and relax when you finally manage to sit up, seeing him turned to you as you gently hold onto his hand. \"Yeah... We might just be friends right now, but... I'm willing to see where things go with you.\" You lean in before giving him a lingering kiss on his cheek, feeling his tail move faster and faster, his body shifting as you held him. You could almost swear that you could see feel his pulse racing against you, and you felt the towel slipping down as he moved. The discomfort of the moment had gone, quickly brushed away by his simple happiness. Things simply seemed to return to normal as you saw him happily moving in, both of his arms wrapping firmly around you. \"Hey, easy! Unless you want me to get another look, you'll want to get something on, fast!\" You couldn't help but laugh as you heard him yelp a bit, his hands reaching down to grab at the towel. He shifted a little bit, turning to you, looking momentary distracted. He kept his grip tight, just barely keeping it on as he looked at you, before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually, I wanted to ask... W-would you mind if I stayed like this?\" He had a deep blush as he moved away, his grip loosening and the towel slowly slipping down. \"I... I think it would be more comfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this? I can't imagine wearing a towel everywhere would be very good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... B-but my fur's getting thicker in this weather, and it's getting a bit harder to keep everything on.\" He slowly let the towel drop, trying to stay calm. \"A-and most of my clothing doesn't fit anymore, anyways, so I'd rather keep it for when I need it. You've just seen a-all of me, so I'd... I'd like it better if I could keep... Keep showing you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" You only manage to make a small sound as the towel falls to the floor. You never imagined that Ciel would ask for something like this, and from the look on his face, he couldn't believe it, either. However, it looked as though it was too late for him to turn back now, and he only nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... I know I'll need to put something on when I go out, and if we ever have a visitor or something, but... But it feels more natural like this, and... And I think it's okay if it's with you, I-I'd like the chance to show you m-more...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow, doing your best to try and understand it. He had certainly complained about his coat when the weather got cooler, and his clothing choices in the wintertime were always thin compared to yours. But this was far beyond that. Although he didn't say it, you could pretty easily tell that he wanted to show off a little bit for you. \"Um... yeah. I think it's okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? You don't mind me being in the nude?\" He seemed to jump a little, but you pulled his body tight against yours, finally managing to settle him in your lap. He certainly was heavy now, but you kept him close as you hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it a little while ago, right? That you wanted to show off for me...\" This time, there was no mistaking it. His pulse was racing, and his entire body seemed to tense in your grip. \"And... I think I'd enjoy seeing you.\" You smiled as you leaned in, giving him a firm squeeze. He shifted around in your grip, but he didn't try to move away from it. Though he didn't say a word, you didn't need him to. \"Really, now... Even when you're this strong, I'm glad you're still the same cute, innocent bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Despite what he had done, despite the fact that he had clearly masturbated right after you left, despite the fact that you had just announce you'd be okay with being his boyfriend, there didn't seem to be a hint of seduction in his tone or his movements. It was obvious that he had enjoyed himself, but more than anything, he simply liked the idea of being able to show off for you. And, you had to admit, you certainly didn't mind seeing him like that. You were honestly more worried that you would do something before he was ready than the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently ran your hands along him. His breathing was a little unsettled, but he slowly closed his eyes, laying back into your body. \"T-thanks... it really feels good to be like this...\" His voice was quiet, but you heard it clearly. Though he had only been awake for a couple of hours, he was already curling back up in your arms. His body was tensing and flexing for you, but his mind was off somewhere else as you simply held him close, letting your hands stroke through his fresh fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really felt amazing. How that he was dry and clean, your hands easily slid against his fur. It was almost effortless for you to press your hands into his body. And wherever you made contact, he seemed to tense that exact part. Wherever your hand shifted, you could feel his strength. You could no longer even make a dent in his body when he was flexing for you. \"Mmm... You really have gotten big...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard him murmuring as his hand moved to his mouth, and you had to chuckle as you saw his thumb lightly move to his lip. He seemed halfway to sleep, and though he hadn't been awake for long, you were just happy for the chance to keep him resting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly pulled his body in gently, brushing down his front. You were careful to avoid his chest, simply moving down and hugging over his abs as you pulled him in. He certainly felt warm in your grip, and you were glad to keep him close as he drifted off. </span></div></div>",

You could feel his body moving as he lightly nibbled on his thumb, his other arm moving around and holding you close. You had to smile as you faced him, snuggling in, letting every bit of his body touch to yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the events of the morning, you had to admit, you were a little close to drifting off. Taking a quick nap with Ciel didn't seem like too bad of an idea. He certainly was drifting away, and as you gently shifted in, your body pressed to his, you began to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your arms curl tight over his sides, feeling him gently shiver as your fingers worked through his fur and against his back. Your head lightly tickled along his neck, and you could feel him shift around, bending his head onto yours. Your legs shifted around his, gently trying to keep his curled form against your body. You could feel his firm abs rubbing up against your body, his arm bent and shifting against you... You had to chuckle a little to yourself as you felt his hard, pumped chest pressing against your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head a little bit as you thought about it. It was true that Ciel was a lot stronger now, but it still didn't make sense. All he had done today was just eat and take a bath, then curled up with you. He was sleeping right now. There was absolutely no way he could've had the time to work out. Yet here he was, pressed against you, his entire body as pumped and hard as if he had spent an entire morning at the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly shifted your hand along, moving to try to take a grip on his arm. You did your best to try to hold completely still as you held him, just gently squeezing his arm. He gave a smile and a small mumble, but he didn't seem to move as you quietly held him, letting the minutes pass slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was subtle, but you could feel it. Though he didn't look like he was moving, you could feel his arm tensing and flexing under his skin. He might've been asleep, but it felt like his body was still active, still eager to keep working and growing. You let your hand slide against his shoulders, over his back... You even risked letting one of your hands press lightly to his rear. He certainly seemed to notice, and you were a little worried when you saw him blush, but he managed to sleep through it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time, you felt the same thing, no matter where you held him. Even his chest seemed to move and shift as you pressed against it. And, you couldn't help but notice, his shaft was stiff once again, lightly brushing against your body as he pressed in, so close to you. It seemed that, despite the fact that he was sleeping, most of his body was still completely active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were wide open again as you tried to think about what was going on. Was this happening every night? You had Ciel in your arms plenty of times, and you had never noticed something like this before... It was minor, but you certainly thought you would notice something like this. Sure, you weren't awake all night long, but it was still a noticeable change from how he usually slept. Besides, if his body was always active, he would've burned himself out. He needed enough time to rest after exercise, and from the way he was growing, you were sure that he was getting enough. So why was his body still so pumped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to be too concerned with it, but you couldn't help it. Whatever was happening, it certainly wasn't normal. Yet, despite that, Ciel didn't seem to have a care in the world as he slept. His arm was holding you in, too firmly for you to simply slip away. It was hard to believe that there might be something wrong when his face look completely innocent, brushing right against yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there really was something wrong, you couldn't let it keep going further. But it seemed like a bad idea to interrupt Ciel when he was finally relaxed. He probably had a lot to think about, and he was probably deep within a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of hours of it couldn't hurt... right?\" You quietly spoke to the room, not really expecting a response. Ciel's ears gave a small twitch, but he remained deep within his dream. You just did your best to keep his body close to yours as you tried to make a decision. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite your worries, you couldn't bring yourself to interrupt Ciel's rest. Though you might've been a little worried, he still had the same innocent, relaxed expression on his face. It just seemed impossible for him to be feeling bad when he looked like that. You simply pulled him in, letting his body rest against yours, letting your hands slowly rub against his back as he slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes seemed to pass by, but after a while, you could finally feel relief. His body was relaxing completely this time, and you could feel your hands gently sinking in against him. His entire body seemed to push in lightly, and you simply took the chance to hug him in as tight as you could. You could feel his heavy muscles give against you, hearing a soft murmur coming from him as his fur pricked against your clothing and as his body pressed to yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness...\" You glance at the clock. Though it felt much longer to you, the oddity only seemed to have lasted half an hour or so. If that was it, then even if it happened every night, Ciel probably wouldn't even notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe certainly didn't notice now. His body was shifting slightly, but he was clearly too distracted with his current position. He was pressing up tight against you, and seemed eager to pull even closer if it was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph... Easy there, big guy.\" You had to say something as he rolled over, almost laying on top of you now. He certainly felt heavy, to say the least. His body lightly pressed and pinned you down, your limbs free but most of you stuck under him. His fur gently cushioned him, and you could feel him working in against you, his arm now laying across your side as he gripped you. His cock had thankfully gotten soft, though it was still difficult to ignore it when you felt it slapping a little against your leg. You had to do your best to control yourself as you tried to get him comfortable in your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slept like an angel. He seemed to rest without a care in the world, and even though he was keeping you firmly pressed against the couch, it still felt as comfortable as a light blanket to you. His ears tickled against the side of your head, and you had to laugh a little as you gently nudged it. He made soft, slight sounds as he relaxed, and his fur seemed to shiver about when you placed your hand against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the events of the last week, a lot had seemed to go on. But even so, you were just glad Ciel could still sleep like this. You were happy he could innocently rest with you, not a care in the world. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   The days went by uneventful and pretty common. Ciel would be home working out by the time you came back from work and you would fix up diner for the both of you after a long day. Nights were what to look forward to since you rarely got to see Ciel throughout the days and the last few hours of the day just didn't seem long enough to spend with him. Despite this, you treasured every moment you spent with him. You never did get more 'personal' with Ciel since you wanted to take things slow with him and wait for the proper moment to get more intimate. There was one day in particular that seemed off, the day went by and you went to bed in the night about to fall asleep when Ciel walked into your bed room and hugged you from behind. This didn't surprise you, he did this often, but then came something unexpected from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"S-sorry if I woke just now, b..but I've been wondering..I-I mean if it's alright to bring this up.\" He was highly nervous and you could feel his whole body shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Come on Ciel, if you have something to say don't get all nervous about it. You know that you can tell me anything, I'll always be here for you after all.\" You say, wanting your friend to feel comfortable about the sudden subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A-actually it's about that. You have no idea how much those words mean to me, but I feel like I haven't been doing enough for you. Even though I have become strong I still ain't able to do much, it seems like I'm always holding you back and am a burden.\" There is a slight tone of depression in his voice and it sounds as if he's about to break down. He then hugs you a bit more tighter while still shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Don't be thinking like that, I don't expect any repayment for what I've done. You're my friend and I don't mind if you don't do something for me. In fact, you never have to because I will always be there for you, I don't think that you're holding me back or anything so stop worrying, OK?\" You say as you slowly move your left hand and gently place your hand on his shoulder. You can feel him tense up and then feel a cold liquid run down your back, it is then that you realize that he is crying and begin to get worried. You try to move away and look at him face to face, but find that he is holding you very tightly to prevent you from getting away, it's not like you could since he easily is way stronger than you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"P-please don't go, don't leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What are you talking about Ciel? Who says that I'm leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's just that I'm afraid to be all alone again, you are the only one who stood up for me and accepted me for who I am. You never saw me as a freak, but welcomed me with open arms even though you would be made fun of as well. I know that graduation isn't far from now and feel like I might loose you forever!\" This caught you by surprise, you didn't expect Ciel to be thinking about graduation and what's to be after. Come to think of it, you haven't thought about what is to happen between both of you after graduation, after all you both are heading down two different paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now Ciel, what's gotten into you? Just because we might go our separate ways doesn't mean that we can't live together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What do you mean?\" He asks and stops with his sudden tears. His hold lessens and you turn to look at him in his watery eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You're thinking of the worst case scenario, instead of thinking about the future you should treasure the moments we have with each other now. What's important is what's happening now and that is that we're together, plus we can always move in together after graduation, just because we has separate jobs doesn't mean that we have to part ways.\" Before he could anything, you give him a warm and reassuring smile then lean in and kiss him in the lips. Ciel blushes and is surprised by the kiss, you then move your head back and speak again. \"So you see, don't worry about it too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Y-you're right. I shouldn't have worried, s-sorry about that...\" you look at Ciel and can't help but feel happy that he still seems so innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ciel, promise me that you won't change...\" you say as you begin to drift away to sleep and wrap your arms around his body. Ciel wraps his arms around you as well and pulls you closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I promise I won't...\" he says before falling asleep at the same time as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After that night a few days pass before something strange begins to happen...<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The life of an adventurer was never dull. That's what you were told, and ever since you were young, you believed it. From the first time you had heard the stories, becoming an adventure was a dream of yours. You had come from a small family in the city, but it meant here were plenty of opportunities for you to train and learn. Many seemed to pass by, and your hometown, Ganecia, always seemed to be a busy hub for them. You got to see many stopping, some fresh out from their first days and others clearly more experienced and toughened. You heard their stories, and you couldn't help but dream about it as you were growing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took every chance you had to try and train, as a result. A bit of swordsmanship here, a bit of archery there, some time out in the woods nearby... You had even managed to learn a small bit of magic from the mages who liked to show off. Although you couldn't do anything nearly as flashy as some of the people you had seen, you had gotten comfortable enough to do a few small tricks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when you had come of age, one of the first things you did was set off on your own. Your parents had worried, of course, but you had made your mind up, so they chose to send you off well instead of having you run off on your own. As a result, when you had decided that you would start looking around at the list of jobs available to adventurers, you had their support. The one you picked was a few days away, and it was simply to investigate and report a possible group of unlawful slavers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem like that big of a job. It was purely investigation, and the reward for it was relatively small. However, it seemed to stick in your mind. While there was a small, legal trade for living creatures, the laws and regulations in it made it difficult to deal with. There was supposedly a much larger underground market, where even humans could be moved. Few people tended to worry about individuals suffering under it, and only traffickers had to worry a lot about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what you had heard. Ganecia was large enough to be fairly well regulated, and you could never remember seeing anybody like that. However, even though all you ever heard were rumors, the idea of it always unsettled you. Now was a good chance for you to start looking into it, so you had decided to start traveling immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have that much on you. It was only a bit of food and some traveling supplies, along with a small bag of coins. The only weapons you had on you were a light spear, a bow, and a hunting knife. They were the tools that you could afford to take with you, and while it wasn't much, you were comfortable with each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days were straightforward, and gave you plenty of time to get used to things. It was a fair amount of traveling, with a bit of hunting for small game when you had a chance. It really didn't seem like anything extraordinary, and quite honestly, by then, you were wondering how other adventurers passed their time like this. However, even though it felt a bit slow, you were happy to just be out on your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on the fourth day, you had made contact. It seemed as though the rumors were good. You had managed to catch a glance of something while you were trying to get dinner. You could hear a couple of quiet voices, and tried to take the opportunity to sneak in closer, listening in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... out of all of them. I mean, seriously? We were lucky enough to catch him, we should've gotten a better job. Instead, we're stuck out here, waiting for a guy that might take a week to show!\" The voice seemed to come from a rather burly-looking man, hauling a heavy iron axe and only wearing a few light bits of armor. He didn't look like too much, and seemed more like a wood-cutter than a slaver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the other man made the scene rather clear. \"Quit whining. You're getting plenty to sit out here, aren't you?\" He took a sip from a wineskin as he glanced around the area. His equipment was laying nearby, but he seemed to have numerous weapons within reach, and was wearing simple clothing to try to blend in with the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for <i>days</i>!\" You heard the clanging of a bit of metal, before the grainy-sounding voice spoke again. \"I told you we'd be early. Why would you think it's a good idea for us to be stuck, waiting in the middle of nowhere for days with something this valuable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you don't want to keep our buyer waiting.\" He responded in a slightly fearful tone. \"We were lucky enough to catch this guy, and the buyer's known to be reliable. And we both know how he is with timing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr...\" The sound of someone kicking at the ground passed through the forest. \"Meanwhile, we have to keep an eye on him like a couple of sitting ducks. The sound of metal hitting metal rang out, and you managed to move enough to see a rather well-armored man kicking a cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you looked into the cage. You couldn't help muttering to yourself as you took a good look. \"No way... A Krethid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, you had thought that it was a hawk. The head certainly seemed to fit, and you could see a light brown, feathered coat moving down from his neck, stretching into a pair of wings. However, it was far too big to be a normal bird. As you tried to get a better look, you could see his arms coming in from his shoulders, his talons bound together tight on the end. His wings were draped over his body, but you could see his legs against the ground. Enough though many of his features were birdlike, the majority of his body was shaped like a human, though he seemed worn and weak. Some of the feathers flowing down from his arms seemed to be poking at odd angles, and he had a hard time moving them about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed as the bird looked at the ground, trying to avoid his captors' gazes. He seemed to quietly glance around the area, but his eyes stopped moving when they moved into your direction. You tensed a little, and tried to mouth out a few words to him. However, before you had the chance to say any more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! There's some guy over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly jumped as you heard one of the men shout. You tried to get free and pull at one of your weapons, just grabbing for whichever you could reach. However, the brush you were in caught against your arm, and it took you too long. By the time you had managed to get your bow out, the big guy had managed to get close, smashing it into two pieces with his axe before pinning you onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... What have we here... Looks like a little kid decided to try to spy on us...\" He had a rather amused grin as he sat onto you, holding you tight against the ground. \"Who are you, little boy?\" He asked with a condescending tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot him a quite glare, but you weren't going to say another word. There was no point in giving anything away to them. You gasped as you felt him giving your face a firm smack, knocking it against the dirt. \"Idiot.\" He looked up at his companion, yelling a bit. \"Hey, what should we do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toss him in the cage, too. We can deal with him after our sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted as you felt him pulling you up, yanking your pack and weaponry from your body and tossing it onto the ground before moving. \"Looks like he's only got cheap stuff... I doubt anybody will be looking for him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed as you saw him working on opening the cage door, trying to think of a plan. The avian was looking at the ground again, his talons bound by a few ropes and his wings awkwardly bent as he seemed to move a little bit.  </span></div></div>",

You land with against the bird, giving a grunt of pain when you do. He seems to give something like a wince, but doesn't make any noise after. The cage door slams shut, and before you can move again, it gets locked as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. You don't want to damage the Krethid.\" The second man quietly watched the scene, taking another sip from his drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah. He put up enough of a fight when we were netting him. He can stand having a kid tossed at him.\" The man grunted as he sat back down, glancing at the cage before looking around again. \"Least it broke the monotony some. I was hoping the kid would put up a better fight, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their conversation for a while, but you only looked up at the bird. His eyes seemed faded, an odd shade of grey softly looking back at you. You tried to get up slowly, but only manage to roll off, stuck on the ground and looking back up at him. \"Sorry about the rough landing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his eyes followed you, he didn't seem to speak. He just looked at you blankly as you spoke. You looked back at him, uncertain of how to react. However, neither of you could really say another word. He seemed to make a quiet, chirp-like noise, but you couldn't make heads or tails of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll... figure something out. Try not to worry.\" You try to smile a little at him, though you have a bit of a time trying to convince yourself of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed as the hours seemed to pass by. With night falling in a matter of hours, and nothing of note happening, there didn't seem to be anything else you could do. You kept your eyes on the one confined with you, but tried to spare a glance at the slavers nearby. Your bindings were tight, and there didn't seem to be much you could do but wait and hope. As night fell, you saw the two of them starting a fire, before starting to drift off for the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of them are sleeping at the same time?\" You muttered quietly to your companion when you notice it, your heart starting to race. It was clear that one of them was enough to catch you, but if they didn't even bother posting a guard, then you might be able to get away. You were tied down pretty tightly, but if you were careful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a hand.\" The Krethid quickly raised his head, looking for a moment before turning back to you. You try to roll a little, worried he would wake them when you moved on. However, he managed to remain completely silent as you shifted. You tried to raise your arms enough, his beak tapping against them. He seemed confused until his beak made contact with the ropes. His eyes widened, and he gave a sharp nod before starting to peck and bite, only taking a few moments to tear through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad they didn't use anything stronger than that... Hold still.\" You quietly move, your hands able to work on the knots wrapped around his arms. While they were tight, you just worked quietly and eventually managed to pull his talons loose. From there, it only took a moment before he had slashed the rest off. \"Okay... We're loose... Now for the cage...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see him raise his arm, ready to cut at the metal cage. However, you quickly grab his harm, shaking your head furiously. He seemed surprised by the gesture, and tried to follow through on his strike, but you held him tight. \"You can't wake them,\" You hissed at him. Although he didn't seem to get it, you simply held him tight, preventing him from moving until he relaxed his arm. You sigh and nod. \"I want to get out, too... Don't worry, okay? I've got another idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes as you move your hand to the lock, and mutter something quietly. You gently drag your fingertips along the hole in the lock, letting your mind relax. You muttered quietly under your breath, and slid your hand a little, almost shaking at it. You grinned as you heard something click, slowly swinging the cage door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... Lock like this doesn't take much.\" You grin as you step out, glancing around for your things. It seemed they had just left them in the bushes where you were found, so you started to rush towards it. However, you paused as you moved, feeling the Krethid's talon catch on your arm. You paused to look at him, doing your best to figure out what he wanted. He only managed to convey it from where he was looking, but it seemed like...</span></div></div>",

You gazed around for a bit, uncertain before you quietly looked at him. \"Do you... Do you want to come with me?\" You pointed at him, then at yourself, doing your best to indicate it. He gave a small nod, glancing back at his captors before his hands held tight to yours. You winced as you could feel his talons poking a bit at you, scratching you like fingernails as you moved. \"Right... First things first. Let's just get out of here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully held on to his hand, holding it and pulling firmly as you picked up your things. Your bow was useless now, but it looked like most of your other things were intact. The two hadn't even bothered digging through your pack. You didn't have time to check, so you grabbed what you could before nodding to your companion. You firmly held on as you tried to lead him through the brush, hoping to get out fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you managed to get out of range. Your heartbeat was still a bit quick, and the stress of it had caused your breathing to get a little loud. However, you were out and away from the slavers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your help.\" Your companion was still next to you, but he seemed oddly calm. He looked at you quietly, but gave a small nod to you when you stopped to try and catch your breath. \"We should try to get far away enough that it's safe to rest... I don't think we can travel during the nighttime that well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you with some momentary confusion, but seemed to wait for you to start moving again, quietly following along. You were a little nervous with the way he moved, and though he tried to keep his eyes out, he seemed to stare at you a fair length of the time. He made very little noise as you walked together, and it felt a little weird to try to guide him when it felt like he might take off at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of traveling, you had finally just sat down and put your pack down. The Krethid seemed to catch the idea, stopping and looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to try to get some rest, okay? I don't know about you, but I don't think I can do that much right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to vanish from your view when you began to set up your tent. You were a little disappointed at losing the company, but there wasn't that much to think about. Perhaps you had just misread his intentions, and he only wanted to get far away enough to be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case was, you didn't think too much about it. You quietly worked, trying to get a fire going and taking care of a few things. It didn't take too long, and you were already feeling like you might collapse. By the time you were ready, you simply took out your blankets and tossed them onto the ground. You didn't care too much about if it was comfortable, since you simply wanted to go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned and looked at the sky, you could barely catch the Krethid's body perched in one of the trees. He seemed to just be leaning back on a branch, his eyes half-asleep, but gazing quietly at your campfire. You smiled a little bit as you saw him watching, his expression a little lighter than it had been hours ago. <br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a yawn and pushed off your blanket as you woke up. The sun was only beginning to peek out, and while it wasn't a full night of sleep, you were too used to getting up at the break of dawn. You looked around quietly, stretching out a bit as you did. It seemed as though the night had passed by without incident. You glanced around the area you packed up your blankets, and it seemed as though nobody else had been in the area during the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced upwards at the tree that Krethid was still resting in. You had to smile as you saw him leaning back, the sun only starting to show. Now that things were a bit more peaceful, you had a chance to get a better look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms were laying at his sides, his wings folded in as he slept. His body had a thick, feathery coat, and his muscles seemed to curve around, his build clearly stating that he was constantly active. His hands were pressed into the branches, a few yellow, extremely sharp nails held at his sides. His body was slouched over, and his legs seemed a bit thicker than you had expected. A few, thick talons topped off the ends of his legs, currently clinging against the branch as well. Most of his feathers were brown, but in the light of the rising sun, you could notice a few topped off with a bit of grey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was tilted back against the trunk of the tree. His eyes were closed, but they seemed to flutter around in his sleep. His beak projected sharply from the lower half of his face. Even in his sleep, his expression seemed sharp and aware. His body seemed tense even as he tried to rest, and his feathers seemed to hold tight against him as a breeze caught the space you were in. </span></div></div>",

You waved at him before indicating the space you had camped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done packing up, and I'm about to head out. Are you okay with traveling again now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave you a confused look, but jumped down onto the ground quickly. A couple of feet before the ground, he gave a couple of quick flaps, landing without a scratch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow... Guess you really are like a bird sometimes...\" You nod as you pick up your pack and haul it on. He seemed to get the idea, following you quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, then. I think the road is the fastest way back to town.\" You make your way towards it quietly, seeing him follow a short distance away. He seemed amazingly good at staying close to you, even through the rough terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning of walking wasn't too bad for you. He seemed content to follow close by, glancing in every direction as he walked. He could've been a little bit paranoid, but after what he had been through, it was at least somewhat justified. You couldn't help turning back every minute or two, sometimes to keep an eye on him, and sometimes just to make sure that the slavers or something didn't catch you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly jumped when you heard a loud rumbling, and were fumbling for your spear as you looked around. However, all you noticed was the Krethid, holding his hand to his belly. He paused for a moment, but continued walking without a word. \"W-wait a minute... You're hungry, right? You could just let me know...\" You have to dash a little bit to catch up with him, trying to get your spear back into place before pulling your pack off of your back. You had packed enough extra for one extra day of traveling, so you could certainly spare a bit. You dug through, trying to figure out what he would be able to eat. \"Hang on, let me get some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowed down a little when he heard you speak, but he was still walking fast enough that you couldn't really stop to think. Holding your pack as you moved made it incredibly awkward for you to try to stumble around, so you simply pulled out the first think you could, a piece of dried rabbit meat. \"Here. Can you eat this?\" You pushed your pack back on with a bit of effort, poking his hand with it. He seemed a little surprised when he noticed it. He pointed at it, then at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's for you. I've already eaten, and you've probably gone a lot longer than I have without any real food. Here.\" You place it in his hand, but before you could even blink, it was already in his beak as he tore at it quickly. You were amazed by how he had reacted to it, but were more impressed that you could now make out a real smile in his face, despite not really being used to his beak and expressions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow. Guess you were hungry, huh?\" You took up the lead, a little uncertain on how he would act after he was done. He continued walking behind you, his expression a bit stoic again, but you couldn't help but notice the slight spring in his step as he moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another few hours before he suddenly paused, quickly moving away from the road without warning. You wanted to speak to him about what he was doing, but suddenly stopped. A few merchants seemed to be traveling down the road in front of you, and were quickly approaching. He had clearly done his best to hide, but you weren't sure if it was soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, there, traveler!\" One of them shouted and waved at you as you walked. There really wasn't much else for you to do but to return the greeting. The few coins you had left with you weren't very much, but it should've been enough for some extra food which you gladly paid for. It didn't take very long before you were on the road again, a new bit of information...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was only a few minutes down the road before your companion had returned. He was back next to you without a word, and as you walked, the silence was starting to wear at you. You couldn't help but get a little nervous as you spoke, before turning, walking backwards and trying to figure out how to express what you wanted to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that?\" You took your fingers and pointed a couple of them at your eyes, before indicating the road he had traveled. He gave you a confused expression, shrugging his shoulders when he couldn't figure it out. \"Never mind, then... I'll have to ask later.\" You sighed and shook your head as you re-packed your things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by uneventfully. It was simply a full day of travels, and while you walked, he followed. If there was any sign of anybody else, he would vanish within seconds, but he would always reappear after they were out of sight. You weren't really sure what he was planning on once you had reached the city, or if he had even thought about where you had lived. You had to try to get the point across somehow, before it was too late. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chance came in the evening, after you had already set up a fire and found a few fruits to eat. You had offered some to him, and though he didn't have the same reaction as on the road, he seemed grateful when he accepted them. He seemed to move towards a tree again when he finished, but you lightly held against his shoulder to try to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on a moment... I want to discuss something with you. Well, sort of.\" He looked at you in confusion, but paused and held in place when you let go of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around before picking up a fallen branch, trying to draw something in the dirt. While you weren't exactly the most skilled, it didn't take too much for you to end up drawing a lot of buildings together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading to the city right now.\" You tried to prod the image as you spoke, repeating yourself as he looked at the image. \"I know you wanted to come with me, but I don't think we can get you inside very easily.\" He looked at the image in confusion for a moment, before giving a clear nod. He quickly dug one of his talons into the dirt nearby, easily scratching out a few trees, trying to indicate something at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.... I think so? There's a small bit of forest nearby, yes...\" You draw an arrow between the two, doing your best to communicate it. He nodded, simply pointing at himself, then at the image he drew.  \"So, you'll just stay nearby, then... Okay, I guess that's something.\" He nodded, gave you another curious look, and quietly resumed climbing up into the tree. His talons gripped the trunk easily, and he pulled himself up within the minute. You had to wonder why he didn't simply fly up, but you just quietly prepped your bed, knowing you probably wouldn't get a response. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you had arrived back at Ganecia, things were a bit clearer. After all, when it had come into sight, the Krethid gave you a small pull. You only had to nod at him before he understood. He glanced around, looking for the woods that you had indicated before. Upon spotting them, you saw him make a dash towards the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Hang on!\" You tried to follow, a little surprised by his speed. Except for the times you had met others on the road, he had always walked with you, and followed your pace. You had to be a bit impressed when he arrived, panting for breath and having a bit of trouble spotting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you knew he hadn't gone very far in, it was still rough. He had left very few prints, and even though he wasn't done climbing, it was still difficult to make out his figure through the leaves and branches of the trees that obscured your sight. \"Hey! You here?\" he seemed to ignore you for a minute, heading to the top and just glancing around the area before descending again, carefully dropping through the branches before lightly landing on the ground. He gave you a swift nod, before scratching something into one of the higher branches of the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're... marking that tree? Or claiming it? Something like that... You'll stay here, then?\" You point at him, then at the tree. He gives a quiet nod, looking at you as you spoke. \"Okay, then... I guess that'll cover things. I've got to head into town. I think I can turn in information regarding the slavers. I'll come back and bring a bit of food, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only looked at you curiously, and you simply weren't sure what else you could say. You just tried to motion through, indicating yourself and the city nearby, before pointing to the ground afterwards. He nodded, and quietly moved back into the tree. You were about to turn away, when you heard a voice speaking, deep but quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned suddenly to try to look up at the creature, surprised by the sound of his voice. You had expected a chirp or a squawk like what you had heard earlier, but nothing like his voice, and certainly nothing in a language you could understand. \"Y-you can speak?\" He only looked at you with a slightly uncertain look, but you shook your head as you spoke. \"Sorry... You probably don't know too many words... Erm... Something simple, then...\" You just take a step closer, looking up right into your eyes. \"My name is Fermik. What's yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fermik?\" He quietly looked at you, before nodding. \"Name is Blit.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were prepared for a lot when you had decided to become an adventurer, but things certainly had taken a turn for the unexpected. When you had rescued Blit, you didn't think much about it. Even when he asked to follow you, you had assumed that he would wander off as soon as you got into town. However, it seemed that there were other things in store for the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days after, you had done your best to try to visit and bring a bit of food with you. He certainly seemed to enjoy when you could bring him a bit of cooked meat, and though a good chunk of your first payment was spent repairing your bow, it seemed right to give him a little help. However, he seemed content to fend for himself. He was more than capable of getting his own food, and usually gathered or hunted something for himself. You were more than a little surprised the first time you had seen him chomping down on chunks of raw meat, and although he had offered you some, you had to pass on it or risk losing your lunch. He seemed to easily settle in at the spot he had found. While he didn't have anything with him, he was fine with just sleeping in the branches of his tree, even in the rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days were okay, but by the time half a week had passed, money was running short. Since you didn't really feel the need to mention Blit, all you could report on was the slaver's appearances and equipment. As a result, it was considered a simple job completion as far as anybody else was concerned, and your payment was only enough for a couple of days. It didn't take too long before you started to consider taking another job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your encounter with the slavers, you were a bit more confident. Although you had been captured, you had managed to sneak out without notice. You had even managed to get their captive out. As a result, you felt like you could handle another similar job. It didn't seem too bad when all you had to do was make a report on one of the many wild goblin tribes nearby. All you had to do was keep an eye open, and try to see if they were gathering any equipment or the like. The payment was a good deal better, and the distance you had to travel wasn't that far. So, you packed enough for a couple of days, gave your parents a quick visit, and let Blit know you'd be going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, you could've thought more about the job before you left. Before you even got close to their settlement, you had almost been discovered by a couple of patrols. It took you a good fifteen minutes to lose them. After that, when deciding to try and sneak in, you decided to leave most of your heavier equipment behind, hiding it in a tree before trying again. Even with a lightened load, it was difficult. It had been mid-afternoon when you originally arrived, but it was dark before you had managed to get close enough to really scout out their camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though you were close enough, the darkness wouldn't let you get a good look. You could barely make out things that were twenty feet in front of you, and while there was a little bit of starlight, it wasn't nearly enough. However, the goblins still seemed quite capable in the limited light, and it was only half an hour before you had been discovered. It was difficult to try to make your way out of the area, and you were quite worried that you'd end up getting captured again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason you made it out was because you had help again. You were as surprised as the goblins when you saw a few of them falling, taken out before there was any chance for retaliation. You could barely make anything out in the dark, but you could notice someone nearby...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blit!\" You gasped out your surprise, too busy running to say any more than that. You could barely make out his figure, but you were confident that it was him. He seemed to follow you easily, moving between the trees and striking at the goblins before they realized what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much of a chase after that. The numbers following you quickly died out, some taken down and others stopping in the confusion. In the end, you were a fair distance away, panting for breath, and looking around for where the Krethid had gone. \"You need practice.\" You nearly jumped when you saw him above, giving your bag a nudge from the tree he was in.You fumbled a bit trying to catch it. It was difficult to read his expression, but you could only nod, a little annoyed but thankful for the help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... know that...\"  Your words were punctuated by your gasps, doing your best to catch your breath as you looked at him. \"Thanks for the help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome.\" He lightly slid down from the tree, landing next to you. \"We even?\" He tilted his head as he asked, looking at you even as you tried to pull yourself up, and as your breath slowly returned. It still took you a moment to understand him, and you had to pause and blink a couple of times, surprised that he had followed you just because he thought he owed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even? You never owed me a thing!\" You shook your head as he listened, it taking a moment before he seemed to give a little look of surprise. \"I only could escape early because you were there to help me with those ropes, and after, we just traveled together a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to dig for the right words as he spoke, looking at you with curiosity. \"But... Food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me for the food? Food's really not that big of an issue. You never really had anything expensive, and I just had a couple of small things for travel to begin with. That's not something I'd keep track of. Really, Blit. It's not a big deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head a little, confusion still lingering in his expression. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Actually, I think I owe you dinner for saving me now... But I'll worry about that when we get back to town. I still have a job to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What job?\" Blit tilted his head a little bit, glancing off towards the location you had just been at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing too big. Supposedly, anyways. It's just scouting out the settlement and reporting on it. Just making sure there isn't any possible raid or attack planned. Check out their equipment, that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a job?\" Blit glanced back in the direction the goblins were at, shrugging his shoulders nonchalantly. \"I can do it, easy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Shame you couldn't just take the job, then...\" You paused, doing your best to keep your eyes on him in the dark. \"Or maybe... Blit? Do you mind partnering with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partnering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, on jobs and stuff. I mean, it's pretty clear you know what you're doing, and I'm still new to this... I could sure use the help, if you don't mind giving it. If you want, we can split the pay for it. I think it'd be worth it if I had your help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to close his eyes, a little lost in thought as he tried to consider the idea. \"So... Help each other?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's okay with you, yeah... I mean, I don't know how I can do, but I'd be happy to help you if I could.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the trouble you had seeing him in the darkness, and with the difficulty you had reading his expression, it was clear that he was glad for the invitation. He nodded eagerly, moving close and nuzzling against your cheek for a moment before pulling back. \"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped a tiny bit, but managed to hold still enough to avoid a scratch. Blit seemed puzzled by your startled reaction. \"Did I do... odd thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Sorta. Cultural thing, I guess... Just surprised. It's no big deal.\" You just shake your head as you sit down, reaching into your bag. \"I guess we can try to scout tomorrow morning. For now, do you want some food?\" Blit happily sat down next to you as he watched you dig through, nodding enthusiastically as you started to pull out food and settle for the night.<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat job ended up being much easier than you would've expected. Blit's eyesight was quite good, and although the two of you had trouble communicating, you had managed to get a full report down without getting too close. The reward for it was decent, and although you had offered to split your payment with Blit, he had you keep his share, not having any good means to carry it on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of those odd things that you had to get used to. After a couple of jobs, it became clearer and clearer that there was a large cultural gap between you two, even if language wasn't enough of a problem. For one, he tended to be a lot more hands-on with his greetings. You would get his beak pressing up against you or feel him patting your back fairly frequently. He was careful to never poke or scratch you, but it still took a little getting used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also became clear why he couldn't carry anything with him. The one time you had brought him an old set of clothing to try on, the entire thing had been reduced to rags. His wings couldn't fit in, and with his talons always pushing around, Blit handling any fabric tended to result in rips and tears. You had managed to find a sturdy belt that would stay on him, and the pockets on it let him carry around a little, but it seemed impossible for him to wear much more than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still quite a number of things that you had to get used to, and the same went for him. However, as time passed, things were quickly growing more and more comfortable between the two of you. He had gotten a bit better at speaking, and you had grown used to the eccentrics that a Krethid might have. And, after the first few jobs you took together, even when combat was a relative certainty, you felt fairly secure knowing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a little surprising for you to learn that when he had saved you, Blit had pulled your bow and quiver from the tree and taken out the goblins before they had gotten too close. It amazed you that he would still be able to shoot as he ran. Although you hadn't gotten a good view of it in the middle of the night, he was happy to demonstrate during the middle of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was good. Surprisingly so, considering the fact that your bow certainly wasn't designed for Krethids. He took a couple of seconds longer than you did handling the string and the arrows. It was understandable, since he had to be careful whenever he moved just to make sure his talons didn't snap anything. However, he was precise. Most of his shots hit their mark by a matter of inches, and even in the middle of a full-speed run, he didn't seem to lose any of his accuracy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it helped that most times, your enemies didn't even realize he was there. Even though he had agreed to help you, he usually kept a fair distance away when anything major was about to happen. You could travel together and talk a bit, but the moment anybody else was nearby, he went a distance away, usually taking your bow with him. Even if you couldn't see him, it always felt like he was watching your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first few times, the two of you had grown rather confident together. Although you weren't the best in close combat, you could usually stall long enough for Blit to take someone out. The jobs you took never had too much serious combat, so you always managed to finish with no more wounds than a few scratches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as a result, for a new adventurer, you were doing extremely well. Your equipment was generally in good shape, you had gotten used to the constant travel, and you had enough to spare to get a bow and quiver made for Blit, along with some tweaks and to make it easier for him to carry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Blit was quite surprised to find out that you had spent a bit on something like that. . \"Are you sure this is okay?\" He accepted the bow, but seemed to tilt his head on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you could try it, anyways. I tried to get some minor magic on it, so it shouldn't interfere with your wings. It'll just sort of cling against you, so it shouldn't limit your mobility. I don't really understand why you don't want to carry around too much, but this shouldn't be a lot. I mean, I understand if it's too much, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I like it.\" Blit smiled as he tried to adjust himself, feeling the wood barely touching his back as he had it on. \"I'm just ... surprised. Most Krethids rarely run into magic, but you don't really treat it like a big deal here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... I think Krethids generally aren't capable of using magic well, so it would seem rare to you... But around this area, there are a lot of travelers, and plenty of races who can perform it fairly easily. You can usually find some minor things for pretty cheap around here.\" You smile and glance at Blit, watching him adjust the quiver to easily be within reach. \"I'm glad you like it, though. You've been a huge help, so it's the least I could do for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, his forehead touching yours as he gave your cheek a slight press. You had gotten used to it by now, and managed not to flinch. You shifted your hand, patting his back firmly before he pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you get used to it for now. I'll let you know what jobs are available right now.\" He smiled and nodded at you, watching you start to move away. However, out of the corner of your eye, you could see as he took the bow quietly, tensing it gently and testing it out, grinning widely as he pulled out an arrow. It seemed to fit him well, and it only took him a second before the arrow embedded itself in the side of a tree. </span></div></div>",

Although there were jobs available, nothing really seemed like a good fit. There were always a number of small jobs, but they were the equivalent of chores and the payment was rarely worth the effort. They were often used for people who were in desperate need of cash, but you were hardly at that point. Even after your recent expenses, you had more than a couple weeks worth left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all the other jobs were way over your head. There were always a couple of major ones that remained untouched, from things like demolishing an inhabited castle to retrieving a relic from a dragon's hoard. These always remained for the people brave or foolish enough to accept them, but throughout your life, you had only ever heard of one or two of them getting completed. It was certainly possible, but you weren't stupid enough to try something like that so soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when you went back, knowing it might be another couple of days before you had a task. Although you didn't think Blit would mind the rest, you still felt a little disappointed that you were heading out again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fermik? Something wrong?\" He spotted you long before you noticed him. The bow and quiver were now both firm on his back as he stood in his perch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could tell?\" You turned up to look at him, before shaking your head and smiling. \"It's nothing big. I just couldn't find a good job for us. It's not too bad, though.\" You managed to keep cheerful as you saw Blit moving down, testing his arms as he let the bow remain against his back. It bounced around a little as he landed, but remained stuck against him. \"I mean, after the last couple of times, we've got a fair bit extra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we have some time off?\" He lightly shifted his shoulders, one of them bumping against the quiver. He seemed relieved that it was still on as he moved towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could say that, yeah.\" You shrugged a bit as he walked up, a little surprised when you saw him drop down onto his knees. \"Blit? Something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have the time, I would like to ask for your help in a more personal matter.\" He nodded his head, bowing it down for a moment before looking back up at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... Is it serious? What is it, Blit?\" You tried to keep steady, assuming it was something normal for Krethids. However, he kept his tone calm and clear as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there are no official jobs available for us, then I would like to formally request your help in the investigation and possible acquisition of an artifact that may be held nearby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want my help, sure...\" He seemed to grow a small, relieved smile when you answered, but he remained on his knees as he kept speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" He shifted a little before speaking again, his tone a little lighter, but still stiff. \"I will try to fully explain the information I have. I have heard-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Blit...\" You cut him off, a little uncomfortable with his sudden shift in tone. \"Just... Why were you being so formal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not proper procedure to be formal when asking for help?\" He hesitated for a moment, almost staring as he spoke.  \"I mean, I understand there is an exception when you need to move fast, but for something like this, I thought it was proper.\" He hesitated for a moment, before getting off of his knees, standing up to look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, I don't think it's necessary in this case... We're partners here, aren't we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I am not asking as your partner.\" He shook his head as he let go of you. \"You have invited me to an equal position, and while working, we are equals. But right now, I am asking for help as someone who is unable to offer you anything in return, and I must-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous.\" You manage a small, awkward laugh before putting your hand on his shoulder. Although it felt a little weird to you, you bumped your nose in against his cheek, watching him visibly jump a couple of inches. \"Blit, I don't care what the situation is. We're equals, okay? So if you want me to help, there's no need to jump through any hoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If... If you say so.\" Blit seemed to stiffen for a moment before finally loosening up, sighing quietly as he looked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blit, really. What are you so nervous about?\" You smiled as you gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze. He shifted a little awkwardly before he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... It's sort of a habit. How to explain it...\" He sighed again and looked at you. \"You ever wondered why you've never seen me flying?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate a bit. You knew that Krethids could fly. It was the reason they were always hard to catch, even on the odd instances when they were seen in open territory. However, out of concern, you've never asked. \"Yeah... I've wondered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... wings are a bit damaged.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? But I've seen you use them before...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not completely useless. I can sort of flap, and I can glide with them. They're just not...\" He raised an arm, sighing as his wing gave a half-hearted flap. \"They just don't work well enough for me to really fly on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Blit...\" You swallow, carefully giving his shoulder a gentle rub. \"Couldn't you find a healer or something, though? I mean, if you've been injured, then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple.\" He sighed as he looked at you before his eyes slid closed. \"It's something I've had from birth. I'm not too sure about the details, but as far as most healing magic is concerned, my damaged wings are 'normal'. Treating them would take something a lot more specialized, and there's no guarantee they'd stay fixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew...\" You sighed as you held his shoulder. \"So... So you've had trouble since birth?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I've...\" He hesitated before his eyes opened again, staring straight at you. \"It means I've constantly had to ask for help whenever there was long-distance travel involved. It puts me in a weak spot whenever I'm dealing with anybody else.\" He gave a small sigh, his gaze turning down to the ground. His voice sounded a little bitter, but more depressed than anything else. \"I've done my best to keep up, but it's rough. You already know that magic's a rarity for us, right? So, the only thing I could really do was improve my body and my skills. I can climb and run better than anybody else I've met. It's helped, but... it's not enough to let me keep up. It's... rather rough. \" He seemed to try to figure out how what to say to you, but in his efforts, he silently stood there. It was after a minute of silence that you moved in a little closer, seeing him jump higher when he felt you nudge into him, your body close to his. \"F-fermik?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and lightly hugged him. Even when he was social, the two of you had never really gotten this close, even with his beak frequently brushing against you. But, at the moment, it seemed like the right thing to do. \"Blit, that doesn't matter, okay? I really don't know too much about your species, so I don't know everything that you've been through, and I don't know what other Krethids might be capable of. But you're here as my adventuring partner. I don't really care if your wings are a little weird.  You're still able to do a lot that I can't, and you're a reliable guy to have around.\" You let go of the hug, chuckling a little as you see his startled reaction. You smile as one of your hands remains on his shoulder, speaking firmly. \"So, no matter what happens or what you want to ask for, we're equals with one another, okay? If you have something you need to ask me, go ahead and ask.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fermik... Thanks.\" He just smiled, doing his best to hug back against you. When he tried to reach over your shoulders, his wings pressed against your arms and chest, and it only took a second before he settled for reaching underneath your arms. He only held it for a moment before stepping back. \"Did I do that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do whatever feels natural for you.\" You smile before letting go of his shoulder. You glance around, before sitting on a nearby log and looking at him. \"Anyhow... I guess we shouldn't get too distracted. What did you want to ask me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. I guess I got a little sidetracked.\" He tried to shake his worries of, his expression returning as he took a seat next to you. \"There's a place that I wanted to take a look at, a couple of days from here. It's supposed to be a sealed ruin, but I think we'd probably be able to get in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sealed ruin? Are you sure about that? If it's really that close, I would imagine someone else would've opened it up already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit shook his head as he spoke. \"It's supposed to be tricky to find and to reach. I think I could probably carry you and keep airborne for long enough to get us in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Airborne? You mean it'd be necessary for you to f... to glide?\" You pause as you speak, hoping he didn't notice. He just shook his head and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Call it whatever comes naturally. But yeah, I don't think most people can even get close enough to examine it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it's hidden? Or is there something else protecting it? Even if it's a little bit hard to find, I can't imagine it getting passed up when it's that close to a town. And I know that most people wouldn't be able to fly in or anything, but someone with some magic might manage it. How can you be sure that nobody else has gone there already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit shook his head quietly before responding. \"There's no guarantee that we'll be the first ones. Still, I'm fairly confident that we'll manage something, since...\"</span></div></div>",

How's that work out?\" You jerked a little as you looked at him, uncertain how something like that could've come into existence so far from the mountains that they usually dwelled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. I think it used to be an outpost or a vault or something, back when the Great War was going on.\" He lightly scratched at his head, a few feathers shifting about as he did. \"Anyways, there's supposed to be a special lock near the entrance that ensures only Krethids could get in.\" You tried to think back, only bits and pieces of history falling into place as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it'll hold something that was used against the Ogres? Do you know what's supposed to be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what interests me. I heard about it a while ago, and since it's something for Krethids I can actually use, I came out to look for it.\" You were a little surprised as you saw his expression change, holding what you could only describe as a wide grin. \"I haven't found out any details, but there's supposed to be an old amulet there, capable of enhancing a Krethid's body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, something to make you stronger?\" You raised an eyebrow as he nodded, a little surprised. \"Huh. I... suppose that would work okay for you.\" You chuckled as you saw him turn away for a moment. \"Hey, if it's something that'll give you an edge, I won't complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just eager to make the best of it.\" He seemed to hold a momentary look of longing, but quickly hid it as he gave his chest a firm pat. \"My wings might not work quite as well, but every other bit of me's just fine. I might as well take advantage of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Well, if you want to take a look around there, I certainly don't mind.\" You stood back up, brushing the bits of bark from your pants as you did. \"I'll take a couple of hours to pack, and then we can head out. That sound alright with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure.\" He seemed a little surprised to be leaving that soon. Still, he had a wide smile as he watched you walk off. \"And, Fermik... Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, Blit.\" You gave him one more glance before turning away, hoping to move out soon. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit was certainly excited this time. He was rushing faster than you could keep up with. Although he never ended up in a full run, he was always keeping ahead a fair distance, and you had to give him more than a few reminders to slow down. Even when he saw other people, he went around and tried to run ahead instead of waiting for you. Keeping up with him was tiring, but you didn't want to dampen his enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at a certain point, you didn't have too much choice. Even after the sun had set, he was still trying to race ahead, and you had to keep your grip on his arm just to not risk losing him in the darkness. Although you had done your best to keep up, the trek had been tiring, and you needed a chance to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Blit...\" Your breathing was a little hard, even as you tried to keep marching forward with him in your grasp. \"We need to take some rest. This isn't something you want to try while you're exhausted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, though! I can still go for another few hours, and you're... You're...\u201d He paused as he looked at you for a moment. \u201cYou're... right. Sorry...\" His face had dropped when he paused, your fatigue a little clearer when he stopped to look. \"I forgot I tend to go a little fast...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... Come on, let's try and find a place to set up camp.\" You gently pulled up your sack, scouting through the area. Although the space was pretty open, it didn't seem like there would be a problem, without any sign of life as far as you or Blit could see. It didn't take too long for you to set up a campfire, and since there weren't any trees around, Blit ended up laying on the ground near you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was a quiet affair. It would be difficult to try to hunt in the night, and though Blit had wanted to, you had managed to get him to settle for a few pieces of fruit. Although you had finished rather quickly and tucked yourself into your bedroll quickly, Blit was still awake, his eyes gazing at the fire as he ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a loud yawn and felt yourself drifting off when you heard Blit's voice coming from beside you. \"Hey, Fermik... Are you still awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely...\" You turn over a little, your eyes half-closed as you looked at him. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for the long walk. It's really one of the few times that I've ever really... Been in charge, I guess. Most times, when I was with other Krethids, my wings dragged me down a lot. I could only do a few things most others could do, and people had to manage around that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blit, you've already apologized for that. Once is enough, you know.\" You manage a weak smile, your eyes slipping closed as your mouth shifts into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know that. But I don't want to risk messing this up. Most times, other people didn't want to risk letting me plan things out. I mean, I can be a little scatter-minded at times, and I can forget to take flight into mind when things happen. So, if I act foolish, or ignorant, or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bird-brained?\" You grinned a bit, unable to resist the comment. He seemed caught off-guard for it, and fell into a momentary huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to be serious, here! No need to say something like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" You just smiled as you turned onto your back, a few bits of starlight managing to sneak between your eyelids as you spoke. \"And I understand, Blit. I'll be the first to let you know if something's off. So don't doubt yourself and don't worry, okay? You were excited about this entire thing, and if I wasn't able to keep up, I would've told you earlier. As long as you keep an eye on me, I'll let you know if there's something you don't notice.\" You just gave a quiet little sigh as you shifted in. \"It's funny, though... I thought you were a lot more experienced than me, but... I guess we've both still got a lot of learning to do, don't we? Still... I'll watch your back if you're around to watch mine. And if I ever need your help, I'll ask, so let me know if you ever need a hand, okay? Even if we're learning, I think we can manage it all together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his beak nudge in, but your eyes didn't even open this time. It was a moment before he pulled away, and though he still had a bit of worry in his tone, he seemed a bit more relaxed. \"Yeah... I guess we can. Thanks, Fermik. I'm glad that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fast asleep before he had the chance to say anything else. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You weren't sure how Blit had managed it, but despite sleeping later than you, he already had breakfast ready and waiting when you woke. Or, at least, he had tried to have it ready. Although he had managed to catch and skin a couple of rabbits, his attempt at cooking one had left the thing an uneven, burnt mess. He was already eating it when you woke, although there was a slightly pained expression on his face as he tried to nibble it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Blit. You... need practice cooking, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed a little ashamed, his head hanging down as he chewed. \"Since most Krethids eat food raw, few of them see the point in cooking, so it's never really taught.\" He took another bite, an odd crunching coming from his mouth as he chewed. \"I've watched you do it a couple of times, so I thought I could manage, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the picture.\" You just nodded your head as you took the rabbit still remaining. Even if he had trouble cooking, he had done a good job of skinning and cleaning it. \"We can split this one, then. I've brought more than enough food for the entire trip, so I don't mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Blit's eyes sparkling as he swallowed, nodding eagerly before he stood up. He seemed to stretch his arms and wings as he waited, but you could tell that he would probably jump at the food the moment you were done. Although he waited patiently when you pulled the meat from the flame and split off a large chunk for him, the moment your voice sounded, he was right next to you. \"It's rea-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already taken it from you and was happily eating before you had time to finish speaking. It looked as though the burnt bit he was eating had been left aside, forgotten in the dirt as he happily chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gheeze, Blit. Is it really that good for you?\" You chuckled as you quietly pulled a piece off for yourself, nibbling contentedly. Blit only gave an eager nod, his mouth too preoccupied to speak. It took a matter of minutes before he had finished, and while he watched you eat when he was done, he seemed contented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About ready to go, then? I think we can probably make it before nightfall if we hurry.\" He carefully began cleaning up as you finished, taking a bit of time not to damage anything as he worked on your bedroll. You gave a nod as you stood up, a leftover piece still in your mouth as you finished. It wasn't long before the two of you set off again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe travel today seemed a little lighter. Although Blit was still eagerly moving around, he kept a close eye on you, and did his best to regulate his pace so you could keep up. It didn't stop him from rushing ahead every few minutes or so, but he usually managed to catch himself in time to wait for you, without forcing you to constantly dash after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with that, you had made good time. Although he had estimated a couple of days, you had arrived in the general area after lunch. Blit was eager to make use of the extra time, and while he had asked you to set up camp and rest, he had spent a couple of hours scouring the area and searching for the ruin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had finished a snack when you had heard a loud, brief chirping, followed by an echoing caw from a distance away. You jumped up automatically, rushing towards it. While there were normal birds around, you had spent enough time with Blit to distinguish his voice. It was tough to do so, but you could usually manage to figure it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blit? Is something wrong?\" You could see him standing near the edge of a cliff. He seemed to be looking forwards, a raised ledge a fair distance away. Although there was an unusual amount of brush over it, you couldn't make out anything through the distance. \"Is... is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a quick nod, shifting a little bit. \"It's definitely there. It might be hard to get there while holding onto you, but I'll do my best.\" You swallowed at the suggestion, but nodded. The distance was a couple hundred feet away, and while you were fairly sure Blit could make the distance, the platform was still hanging in the air, and a rocky shelf was near the base of it. It was a nearly impossible climb, but if he couldn't land well, it would end up badly for the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can carry me?\" You swallow as you pulled your bag in over your arm. Most of the heavier things were already unpacked at your campsite, but you weren't exactly the lightest person around. However, you felt him moving close, turning his back to you and motioning as he nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think so. Just hold on tight against my shoulders, and be careful not to grab my wings. I should be able to fly like that.\" You swallowed, but nodded. Even if you could land safely, getting back up would take another hour, and you had at least tested a short flight once. Swallowing your concerns, you move in close, carefully shifting yourself onto his body and holding tight. He seemed a little unsteady, and his hands were unable to help keep you balanced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to even jump, he moved forward, doing his best to pick up speed with you tight against his body. You had to suppress the urge to shout as you felt the wind suddenly blasting against your face, almost falling into a dive the moment he launched himself off the cliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind kept pressing into your head and shoulders as he fell, and kept pounding in even as his position stabilized. He managed to pick up enough speed and steady himself, his eyes almost closed but looking ahead as he pulled up a bit, smoothing out his flight. His speed seemed to slow, and you finally managed to breathe a little when you saw the steady motion forward he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings seemed a little easier when you saw the ground close in under you. You had managed to get to the shelf with plenty of room to spare, and as you felt his wings flap, you thought you had managed it. He was slowing down a little, and as the ground approached, it looked like the two of you had arrived without a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! H-heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, up until the landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had managed to slow himself down and land on his talons, he clearly wasn't used to carrying a passenger. He had tried to ease into his descent too late, and although it wasn't enough to cause any serious injury, he had been caught off-balance and fell onto the ground with you on his back. You were still clinging tight against him as you tried to recover your breath, and it took a few seconds before you let go, sliding into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking so nervous for? I told you I could make it!\" Blit managed to pick himself off the ground and brush himself off. Although he had a few feathers dis-shelved, he seemed to be in one piece. Your breathing was slowly returning to normal, and you shook your head, trying to shake the worry off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dive really threw me off... I thought we were going to crash!\" You shifted, pulling your bag firmly against your shoulder as you spoke. \"We almost did, too... Your landing was pretty rough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me twice...\" He winced a little as he brushed himself off, a couple of slight scrapes on his knees. \"I've never really carried anything like the weight of another person. I think I can fly okay, but I need to work on a smoother landing...\" He winced a little before standing back up. \"Still, it's nothing major... We've gotten here in one piece, and we can check the place out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just give him a small smile as you tried to pick yourself up. Even after your rough flight, he was still in a good mood. You followed as he started to move in through the bit of cover that remained, unwilling to bring Blit down from his cheerful state. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took you a short while before you were back onto your feet and capable of moving without a bit of stinging. Still, soon enough,  the two of you were both up and around again. Blit quickly took charge again, pushing through the dense brush that still remained between him and his destination. By now, it was clear that his eagerness had overtaken any soreness that he had felt, and he was easily moving and glancing around for his destination. It only took you a few minutes before you found out that Blit's information was good. As you approached, you started to see fewer and fewer trees and brush. The area slowly but surely cleared out, and as you got a view of the place, you gasped a little. You had finally arrived, but what you saw was a surprise to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building there wasn't as tall as the trees, but it stood steady a rather firm bunker a couple of stories ahead. However, its construction was somehow built into the surrounding trees. It seemed as though the wood of the building almost blended in with the taller trees in the area, several supporting the main structure and more than a few trees almost piercing straight through the center of it, the canopy of the trees covering the structure from view. It seemed as though the trees were much thicker than normal, with the branches in between one another connecting and weaving in through each other, forming a nearly complete ceiling over the space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... a lot bigger than I thought a ruin would be.\" You swallowed as you tried to get a better view of it all, walking forwards with Blit. \"How is a wooden building still up for that long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they actually imported some trees for the base, and then had one of our allies work on the construction. The building's part of the tree, so it can stay in good shape as long as the trees are healthy.\" Blit walked forward steadily, only focused on looking for an entrance near ground level. \"I've seen a few buildings like it back home, but they're mostly for travelers. The terrain isn't really suited for something like this.\" <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\"Okay, then... What are you looking for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to figure out where the main door is, as well as where the... Aha!\" He paused as he turned up, pausing at an archway four or five feet up in the air. There were barely a few inches in front of it that you could climb, but it was clear that it had been designed for fliers. A sealed door seemed to be right in front, several foreign marks clawed out of the wood and a single crack running down the middle where it would open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it? It doesn't have a handle or anything. How is it supposed to open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By voice.  During the war, it was the easiest way to check if the person opening it was a Krethid or someone accompanied by a Krethid. It could be faked, of course, but for outposts like this, it was enough.\" He tried to cling on against the ledge, his talons managing to slide against the wood. Even as he tried to squeeze, he had trouble making a good scratch for him to cling to. \"Sturdy stuff. Could you give me a boost?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as you moved in, bending a little as you moved in. \"So, should I try to raise you by your feet... talons... whatever?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Try to get a good grip.\" You shifted and put your hands in place before you felt him stepping on, careful not to pierce you as he moved. You quickly tried to push him up, and with a bit of effort, he managed to climb onto the ledge, clinging firm against the door as he took a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" You watched with curiosity, but his thoughts seemed to quickly drift from your comprehension. Even as he muttered to himself, you could hear a quiet chirping and clicking. You couldn't tell if he was just talking to himself, or if he was trying passwords, or even if he was just blabbering on. All you could do was wait for a  few minutes before you suddenly heard the door shift open, sliding back and brushing up dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it! Come on up!\" You could see Blit's head leaning down from the entrance, his arm reached down to try to extend his grasp to you. You reached up to grab at him, and while it took a couple of minutes, you eventually managed to climb up using his arm and the wall in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot more room now that the doorway had opened. There seemed to be a long hallway in front, with multiple doorways leading around to various rooms. However, you couldn't get a very good view through the few cracks of light that seemed to scatter from the ceiling. Despite the roof that the tree branches provided, it seemed as though the floor and ceiling here were both at least partially manufactured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha'd you do to get it open?\" You were a bit curious as you stepped in, trying to stand back up. Blit had an eager expression on his face as he looked behind you, watching the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tried a few of the common passwords. Most of the war ones are pretty straightforward. The one that did it was something like, 'For the good of all, I shall guard this place as my home.' A little stuffy, but I can see why they'd pick something like that.\" He seemed to be a little jumpy, his enthusiasm clearly taking over as he held on against your hand. The door behind you seemed to slide closed a moment after, making you swallow as the darkness surrounded you. There were a few dim beams of light, but the darkness seemed complete. \"So? Can we look around?\" Blit seemed to remain eager, the darkness not enough to make him pause for a single moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, let me get a better light.\" You sighed and closed your eyes, muttering to yourself under your breath. While you had a lantern in your pack, trying to get it lit seemed like it could be a bit of an affair in the near-darkness. It was much simpler for you to mutter something, a small orb of light appearing in your palm. You touched your fingers to Blit's side, before the seemed to emanate from him. \"That should be enough...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, cool... I thought magic wasn't supposed to go through our feathers very easily, though. How'd you manage that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making a light is pretty basic, so it's not too hard to mess around with it and do fancier things. I tried to tweak it a little so it sort of surrounded you. Basically, it's like you're wearing it like a piece of clothing. As long as magic doesn't really have to go through your feathers, it works... well, reasonably well, at any case. It's the same idea behind the bow, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never knew you could do things like that with it. Magic isn't studied too much back home.\" He smiled as he tried to move, taking a couple of steps around and testing it, the light moving and shifting with him, though his limbs would often end up casting a shadow on the walls. \"Is this enough light for you as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We should stick together while we take a look. So, go ahead.\" You smiled as you followed close by, watching as he quickly darted into the closest room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you explored, it soon became clear that the place had been designed as a small bunker for a variety of different creatures. There were a few areas that were tricky for you to identify, but it was easy enough for you to find a training area, a small kitchen, and a sleeping space. It seemed as though it had been designed to support a variety of creatures, though it was still clear that Krethids were first in mind. There were even a few rooms that had numerous branches and fallen leaves scattered about. Although you weren't quite sure as to the purpose of every space, Blit seemed to acknowledge the rooms one by one, sticking his head in and looking for a couple of minutes, but never spending the time to do any more than a cursory search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that eventually changed when he stopped, pointing at a trapdoor in the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <i>has</i> to be it!\" He gave a firm jump and managed a slight flap, pounding at the door and feeling it slip open before slamming back down. \"That's the only place that's tougher for non-fliers, which means it has to hold the storage for Krethids! Fermik, give me another hand here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly dragged you with him when he spotted the hatch, and it didn't take too long before he was trying to climb up again. It was difficult to keep him up on your hands when he was doing his best to push the door open, but you managed it. With a bit of a boost, he managed to climb all the way up. Then, for a couple of minutes, you could only hear the sound of his talons clicking against the wooden ceiling above you. However, this time, you couldn't wait quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Blit! Everything okay up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis footsteps paused for a moment, followed by the sound of what seemed to be a loud thump. You heard a rather clear \"Ow!\" from above, but only a moment after, his head soon pushed down from the ceiling. \"Y-yeah... Sort of...\" He seemed a little off as he spoke, looking down at you. \"There's definitely something up here, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"</span></div></div>",

I kind of figured that out the hard way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blit, please tell me you aren't injured.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! I'm okay. Got a bit of a bump, but I'm okay. It was just an odd tree branch or something.\" He swallowed as he looked at you. \"But... But I'm fairly sure that it wasn't natural, so... so there's more than just one trap.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get me up, then? I want to take a look, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Just... just be careful, alright?\" Both of his arms reached down to grab at you, pulling with an effort. It was difficult for you to reach him, and even when you managed to get a grip on the entryway, you had trouble pulling yourself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was a vault, it certainly didn't look like it at first glance. The nearby branches and the slight bristle in the leaves seemed to indicate that you were higher up in the trees. Their branches were thick enough to effectively form a ceiling right above your heads, and the two of you both had to crouch just to keep from bumping into it. There were traces of a large scratch in the ground, a tree branch cleanly cut from the trunk of the tree as it lied nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that almost hit you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think I tripped a wire or something. It didn't hit me directly, but I bumped my head into the ceiling when I saw it passing by. I'm surprised the trap held after so long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take a closer look, then.\" You shifted and bumped your head against the ceiling as you stepped forwards, looking at the remains of the branches. You followed it quietly, letting your fingertips brush over it before getting a grip on something. And as you moved, you could see another wooden door at the other end of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think it's string. I can't see how they'd set up any other types of traps here, though... I don't think there's enough room for anything more mechanically complex. There are probably more traps on the way to the door, though. As long as we find all of the strings, I can probably trip the traps before we get close enough to be in danger. It's a messy way to do it, but it should work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Let me try to look, then. If I'm keeping my eyes open, I'm sure I can manage it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProgress was slow. Even though there was only 100 feet between you and another doorway, the two of you both had to step forward slowly, taking minutes at a time just to be sure you could safely move ten feet. Each time you found a new wire, you would do your best to use a bit of string to get a good distance before tugging and tensing, watching a new branch crash from above you. It was amazing that despite the half-dozen branches that had fell, the ceiling seemed to still remain intact, only small cracks forming in it. It was easily half an hour before you had managed to reach the doorway, but you had done so with nothing more than a couple of scratches from trying to dig through the fallen branches in the cramped space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made it... Do you think this door's got the same type of lock as the front door?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.  If this space is just for Krethids, then it'll have another lock that's tougher for people to open.\" He swallowed as he walked up to it again, testing it with a push. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it's got the same scratches, as the front door, too... I guess they'd use a different passcode, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, and surprised you when he responded with a bit of chirping. It only took you a few seconds to understand what was going on again as he tested a few words. However, more surprising was the fact that it only took him half a minute before you could hear the door grinding open. A look of wonder appeared on his face as he watched the door move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed as he looked in, his eyes gazing upon the prize as he spoke quietly. \"Grant me the strength to protect the ones next to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prize in front of him certainly seemed like it had been for such. The room inside was formed into a small dome, with numerous interlocking branches and vines forming the domed roof around it.  The light coming from Blit's body seemed to illuminate the entire room as he walked in. Numerous weapons seemed to be strewn about the room, most of it slightly worn with age. A few things looked to be in usable condition, scattered among the shelves and racks in the room. However, despite all of the potential treasures you had found, Blit's eyes were focused on one side of the room. A simple pedestal seemed to have a small pile of medallions on top. There were no strings or straps visible upon them, and they seemed to have been shaped into a variety of different birds. However, Blit quickly dashed towards the shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to be it!\" He was nearly jumping for joy as he approached it, his goal well within his grasp. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pedestal was only a short distance away, and he was happy to quickly approach it. It seemed like the temptation was extremely distracting for him as he moved in closer. Although you could barely notice it, by the time he had gotten within a few feet of the pedestal, there was an audible \"click\" from nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blit! Watch-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even have time to finish your warning. A large, dense bundle of branches and stones had crashed through the ceiling, smashing directly into the pedestal. The amulets were shattered into pieces, the pedestal following soon after. Blit was caught in the scattered debris, automatically raising his arms and wings, splinters and shards of wood catching through his feathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed forward the moment that you saw it. There was simply no time to act, and Blit had fallen backwards onto the floor. \"Blit! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only managed a small moan as he lay there, shifting himself up. He had several deep gashes over his arms and sides, and numerous fragments had managed to dig in against his feathers. \"O-ow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You're not in any condition to move.\" You grunted as you reached into your bag, digging through. \"Damn it... I've only got a couple...\" You dig through your pack for the two healing potions you had managed to afford, and tipped both of them into his mouth. Although the major gashes on his body lessened, he was still dripping blood in places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached in for some bandages and tried to tend to his remaining wounds the best you could. Although he wasn't losing too much blood, there were simply too many pieces of wood. You did your best to get all of his wounds dressed, but he looked like a mess even before you had finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was silent as you worked, and though his eyes were closed, his pulse and breathing both seemed to steady. He didn't seem to be in any danger of dying, but he certainly wasn't in any condition to be moving around. It took a while before you had finished patching him up, and you had his arms, wings and chest in a large sling. Thankfully, he had managed to cover his head when it all happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what you could do but wait for him to wake. Although the ground here was a little rough, you weren't going to move him on your own. You laid your bag under his head so he could rest upon it. All you could do was try to keep him his wounds clean and try to keep him comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hours before he woke up. You saw him shifting around, but tried to hold his shoulders. It was difficult to avoid the scrapes he had along them, but you held him carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep still, Blit. You were injured pretty badly, and I don't have the supplies for any better treatment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a small cough, his arm trying to hold his chest as he did. However, with all of the bandages on, he could barely move. \"Fermik? That you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It's me. You feeling any better?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed shook his head quietly as he sighed. \"I took a few dozen pieces of wood all over my front. I don't see how I'm going to be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blit.\" You spoke with a serious tone, causing him to stop. He slowly turned his head towards you, looking quietly. \"Just rest, okay? This type of lifestyle has risks. I know it, and you know it. But as long as you're still alive, you can always patch yourself up and try again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he nodded, his eyes sliding closed again. \"I know... I just... I'm disappointed. We had gotten so close, and then I just had to go and mess up right when my goal was in reach. I... I wanted to be able to do more. This was my first time, and it ended up just being a huge mess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed quietly as you carefully lifted his hand, holding against it. \"There'll be other chances. We've got plenty of opportunities to explore the place, and even if you didn't get an amulet, there's probably plenty of other equipment here that you could use. Don't worry, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll... try not to.\" He sighed quietly as he tried to get up. You held him steadily, but didn't really try to keep him still. This was hardly the best place for him to be resting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get you back downstairs. I think you're stable enough to move right now. It may not be a normal sleeping spot for you, but I'd like to get you into a bed so you can rest properly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and nodded as he carefully leaned into you. The two of you moved slowly and carefully as you tried to get Blit back down onto the main floor. It was an effort to try to move down and somehow catch him gently, but you managed it with a little bit of magic and a fair amount of rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fermik?\" You head Blit's voice as you finally reached the living quarters, gently laying him down on a bed. He seemed a little awkward as he sunk back in to the only bed with fabric remaining. \"Thanks. If you weren't here, I'd be a whole lot worse off right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not about to abandon you, Blit.\" You chuckled as you carefully let go, sitting next to him. \"Even if you're injured, I'd rather stick with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a small chuckle as he looked at you, nodding softly. \"Lucky me... I didn't think that I'd end up getting this much help from a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, before leaning in, giving him a gentle nudge. \"Hey, don't lump all humans together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. At least... I don't think I can lump you in with the rest of them.\" He gave another small smile before closing his eyes and drifting off again.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waiting around didn't sit well with either of you, but you didn't have much of a choice. Blit's injuries didn't seem life-threatening, but he certainly wasn't in any condition to move on his own. It was days before he was ready to try walking again, and he still couldn't push himself too hard after what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you did your best to take care of him. There wasn't too much else you could do. Even so, he seemed to be reasonably cheerful, despite his injuries. Though Blit was confined to bed rest, the two of you were comfortable. You managed to clean up enough that you could use one of the other beds, and you found enough spare tools in storage to survive with. Most of the first day just involved you trying to strain your voice to imitate the noises necessary to open the doors, but by the evening, you were able to leave the ruin on your own, even if you couldn't go far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing, too. You were running low on food, and there wasn't any way you could leave the shelf you were on without Blit to help bring you down. You couldn't find any animals within the nearby forest, and the height of your location prevented you from leaving without Blit's help. All you could do was try to gather a few fruits from the forest and hope it would be enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis appetite actually seemed to have ramped up a little bit. Although he was injured, he happily ate whatever you found, and you had to cut back a little on your own food. It seemed a little odd, but you weren't going to argue with him too much when he was injured, and it didn't seem to be harming his recovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, it was another few days of rest. While you had gone on jobs together, it was the first time that the two of you had spent time together off the job. Although the two of you were always quite casual when you were talking, Blit was usually off in a tree, or frequently dashing off to hide. It was the first time that you two really had a chance for a long, unbroken conversation. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on. It's been four days! Even if I'm not completely healed, I can move without bleeding or injuring myself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit was sitting in the bed, the sheets tosses over his legs. They had numerous scratches and tears from Blit's use, but they had been intact enough to keep him warm. However, it seemed as though just tucking in was uncomfortable for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't want you pushing yourself. I don't know exactly how long it takes for you to fully recover, but until then, you should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fermik, as much as I might like this place, I've had enough of this room.\" He gave his wings a flap and bent his arms around, trying to stretch out a bit. \"If I stay here any longer, then I'm going to go stir-crazy. I mean, the place is nice to stay in and all. But I can only stare at the inside of a room for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine... You can go outside... Just take it slow, okay?\" You sighed as you picked helped him onto his feet. Despite the scratches and bruises that still remained, he seemed to be in good condition. His body hadn't deteriorated during his time off, and he even seemed to be able to stand and walk without too much help. Still, you weren't about to let him off on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the front door for the two of you, and took a bit of time to just walk through the forest nearby. Although you didn't spot anything, he was apparently able to see a few animals, and found a good deal more fruit than you did when you were looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Place actually looks liveable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liveable?\" You turned a little as you held Blit in, watching as he quickly downed a piece of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I mean, it's a bit hard to catch, but I can spot enough wildlife here. I'd probably be able to survive if I'm stuck here. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuck here? Why? Once you recover, you can go down, and...\" You paused, turning to look at him. \"Blit... This is... about you going home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to hesitate when you spoke, and he seemed quiet for a moment. However, he seemed to nod to you as he looked up. \"Yeah... I'm not going to be able to go back anytime soon, so I figured I might as well make this place my home for now.\" He had a small smile on his face, but it quickly changed when he saw your worried expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... You can't go back? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit gave a small sigh, turning to look at you quietly. \u201cYou know that I came here to look around at this building, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I never really understood why you came to primarily human lands. I mean... In the beginning, I thought it was just best for you to get into town fast. But after... I guess I never really wanted to bring it up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left the mountains months ago to look for this place. I was hoping I'd be able to find this old bunker and head back quickly.\" He seemed a little depressed as he spoke, quietly shaking his head. \"But... things came up. I had asked someone for help to drop me off and pick me up when I was done, but my capture...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It messed things up a bit, huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit nodded softly, staring into the ground. \"The entire trip was only supposed to take a month. I was supposed to get dropped off, explore the place, and then head back. I had to pay someone to make the long journey close to here, and they were supposed to pick me up in the same place a month later. But... I missed that chance.\u201d He quietly sicked at a stone on the ground, watching it roll forwards as he stood there. \u201cI was in a cage when he was supposed to pick me up, and I doubt that Lenken is the kind of guy who'd wait a day for me, never mind a few months. So, unless another willing Krethid shows up, I'm stuck here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I see...\" You gently leaned in, carefully wrapping your arms around his shoulders as you hugged him gently. He seemed to relax a little in your grip. \"I... I hope I can make things easier for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already done a lot.\" You could feel his beak lightly pushing against you, poking softly. \"I mean... You helped me get free in the first place. And then, you tried to check on me after. That's more than some people would... Not to mention letting me join you in adventuring. Even if your job... Heck, even if everything's been dangerous... It's been a good time for me.\" He sighed a little as he returned the hug, wincing slightly but determined to hold you tight. \"And... And you came here to help me... I think my family's the only one who's gone out of their way to do that... So... Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly let go, your face brushing against his before you settled down. \"Blit... Don't worry about it, okay? That's what friends do.\" You let go slowly, letting your hand slide down and off his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... Thanks. I'd still be stuck in a cage if you didn't come. And now, instead... Even if I'm a little beaten up, I've found a place that I can stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're really going to try to live here?\" You were a little surprised to hear it come up. You had assumed that he would've returned to town with you and picked out another spot in the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's not a bad place, and there's a much lower chance that other humans will spot me here. There are plenty of animals nearby, and I can always head out and come back if food gets sparse or something. But... I know it might be a little far away, and that'd make it tough for you, so... So I underst-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, okay?\" You gave him a light bop on his forehead, just enough to nudge him backwards a little. \"I told you already, I'd much rather keep doing this with you. And from the sounds of it, you don't want to give up the jobs we've been getting. I know it's further away now, with the couple of days of travel to town and all. And if you think this place works for you, I sure won't argue. So...\"</span></div></div>",

It'd be bad if I had trouble getting in contact with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... Getting jobs... You'd need to go to town for that, right? It's fairly far away, and you'd have to make that trip every time... Not to mention the fact that you wouldn't even be able to travel without me...\u201d He shifted a little awkward, his gaze falling down to the ground and his hands clenched a little as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't mind the walk. I mean, we might have to take jobs that are a little tougher, but I'm sure we can manage it. After all, we've been doing extremely well lately.\u201d You just give him another pat as he stares a bit. \u201cI mean, we've got enough cash to spare. The walk might be a bit much, but I don't think that it's bad enough. And even if it gets too bad, there's enough fruit and enough animals to hunt, right? I'm sure I'll manage okay. Besides...\u201d You give him a gentle squeeze, his eyes moving up to meet yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, yes... But during the colder seasons, it might-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlit. Calm down, okay?\u201d You just shake your head a bit, keeping your grip firm against him to try to comfort him. \u201cI might not be the best off, but I'm sure we'll make it.\u201d You manage to say everything with a calm face, holding him firmly as you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite frankly, you weren't sure. You were well aware that plenty of adventurers had trouble supporting themselves once they had moved a bit further away from the central job hubs. However, it was a risk that you were willing to take, and you didn't want Blit to be the one worrying about your decisions. If things went badly, then you'd take responsibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're... You're sure?\u201d His grin was quite obvious now, and seeing it removed all hesitation from you. He stepped forward, wincing a little, but his arms wrapped tight against you as held you in his arms. \u201cThanks, Fermik...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's' not a problem, Blit. You're my partner, right? I have to make sure that we can manage it all together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.. I am?\u201d He seemed to shift a little bit, his grip against you releasing as he looked at you. He seemed a little surprised at the idea. However, it only took him a moment to accept it, a clear smile appearing on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. So just relax, okay? We'll give it a couple more days before we try to find another job. In the meantime... Well, I'm not going anywhere.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...\u201d He just smiled for a moment before slumping over a bit, his body stumbling forward into yours. You barely manage to catch him, but manage to get a hold on him before he fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlit... You okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust... A little tired...\u201d He managed to push himself back onto his feet, but you kept your hands against him to try to keep him steady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you before, you don't have to push yourself. It'd be much better if you were healthy before we tried anything else. I wouldn't want you to push yourself too far and up getting yourself killed...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed a bit, but nodded as he stood back up, beginning to walk back to the shelter. \u201cYeah... I guess I can't...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can consider leaving here for a job when you can fly again. Until then, just take it easy, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright... Thanks, Fermik.\u201d You just slowly help guide him back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a few more days before he would be in any condition to travel. However, by that time, he was able to move and fight without worries. The two of you could finally leave the ledge that you were stuck upon, and you were eager to get back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to town was actually quite uneventful. It took a little longer than you would've thought, since you tried to take it at an easy pace. However, Blit didn't seem to want to rest, and you actually had to force him to take it easy whenever night fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you arrived, it was clear that his injuries wouldn't be any problem. To try to make up for all of the lost time, you accepted a few jobs that wouldn't require too much travel. Three days and four jobs had gone by, and while it was clear that Blit was still doing fine physically, there was something else posing a problem for the two of you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Settling in to the new place was a bit of an experience. You only had a few things from home that you wanted to take, and you only needed a couple of trips to bring everything. So, while the two of you were in town, you simply picked up what you could, do whichever jobs you could find, and then haul a few of your things back to base. It was a bit inconvenient, and after the first couple of trips, you were quickly deciding to look into a faster means of transportation. Still, you were quickly settling back into the swing of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't exactly doing too badly in terms of work. You were worried about Blit the first few days, but he didn't seem to have any issues traveling. He seemed able to keep pace with you without any issues, and his appetite was quite healthy whenever you stopped for food. He had practiced his archery by hunting for whatever he could along the way, and by the time the two of you saw any combat again, you had no problems with letting him watch your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, by now, you didn't have any issues clearing out small camps of bandits or raiders. Somehow, your tactics had shifted to letting Blit take care of most of the enemies, and making sure to keep him safe from their range. You had to admit that you were a bit disappointed with the idea of letting him do most of the heavy lifting, and you never seemed to get too much practice with your blade. But it worked, and it the two of you safe. Blit was glad that he was able to do that much, and you weren't going to complain about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was quickly becoming clear that you weren't earning enough. Although you were earning the same amount that you had been, Blit's appetite had sharply spiked ever since the two of you had resumed adventuring. He had never asked for any more food, but the sound of his stomach constantly punctuated your travels. By the first night out, you had picked up on the hint, and given him twice what he was eating before. That seemed to be enough to keep him satisfied for the week, but you couldn't help noticing him looking a little disappointed whenever he finished a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the day you were returning back to the base, it has become a little worrisome. Blit was easily eating through three times his meals, and there wasn't any way to avoid bringing it up anymore. Most of your budget had gone into buying food, and he knew the reason you were hauling back a heavier pack and a second bag in your arms. The walk back to the base was slower this time, and after a few minutes of awkward silence, Blit finally spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's okay to get this much food, Fermik? I mean, I can go without that much... I don't want to be a burden on you, and if it costs too much, I can cut back some.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're only going to be able to keep up the pace if the two of us stay in good condition. Part of that's getting enough to eat. I'd rather spend a little more on food than have your stomach distracting you in the middle of a fight.\" You turned to look at him while you walked, and his downtrodden expression made you pause. \"Blit, really. It's fine. Honestly, I was more worried that I'd have to take a job on my own if you needed more time to recover. You might be able to travel and fight and everything, but that doesn't mean you're at a hundred precent right now. I want to be sure that my partner's in good shape, after all.\" You smile and reach your free hand to his arm, holding it lightly. \"Besides, if you want to get stronger, then you'll have to eat a bit more, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit's gaze suddenly turned from you to the ground. You let out a chuckle and gave his back a pat while the two of you walked, his embarassment a bit obvious this time. Even as he spoke, his eyes didn't pull back up. \"Y-yeah... The amulets are gone, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are other ways of getting stronger. If you're really that eager, then do some exercise. And if you're going to worry that much about the trip, then just help me haul some of this stuff.\" You just give him a prod with one of the bags you were carrying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlit finally broke into a smile as he took one of the bags from you, nodding as he held it. \"Yeah... I'm lucky enough to still be alive after that trap, so I can't complain. Besides, you'll s-still help me when the next chance comes... right?\" He stammered momentarily as he spoke, sounding like he was asking for your help again. But you just gave a quick nod to him, your hand gently pushing his head back up so you can see eye-to-eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We're in this together.\"</span></div></div>",

He was clearly aching to tell you something, opening his beak and then shutting it once you looked. You decided to ask him about it, as he clearly wasn\u2019t wanting to talk about it just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is there something you\u2019re trying to show me? I can tell you really want to, I won\u2019t judge.\u201d You asked him, noting him jump a little once you brought up the subject at hand. He turned around, looking at the floor and blushing, \u201cI-I\u2019ve been... practicing... flying...\u201d he said, getting barely audible. \u201cNo, Blit, that\u2019s amazing! Sure, the amulets were a setback, but I\u2019m so happy to see you\u2019re trying to get stronger. How much of an improvement is there?\u201d You said to him as he tucked his wings in, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m better...\u201d he said, clearly wanting to change the subject. \u201cI tell ya what. Tonight, let\u2019s see if you can fly me up into a tree. Not that far, maybe just 6 or 7 feet up high. I can show you an amazing spot to see the stars!\u201d He perked up as soon as you said stars, and said with poorly masked excitement, \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day came and went, and the two of you talked about your times together. Mostly just banter, but it was nice to relax and talk with each other on a personal level. As the sun went down, you followed Blit to a tree. \u201cI really hope I can do it,\u201d he nervously added, to himself more than you. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing Blit, you can do this,\u201d pulling him in and nuzzling him the same way he did so long ago. \u201cHold on tight, it\u2019ll happen pretty fast.\u201d He started flapping, and slowly moved off the ground, getting faster. He was focused on staying in the air and keeping you safe, so you had to step in when he was near the top of the tree. \u201cBlit, we\u2019re 30 feet off the ground.\u201d you choked out, terrified as you looked down. \u201cI guess we are.\u201d He said, seemingly not tired. He slowly flew the 2 of you down, touching down way better than the previous flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI delivered on flying, show me the stars.\u201d He said, with overflowing excitement. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a bit of a walk, nothing too bad though. Probably 15 minutes.\u201d You told him, as he took off the moment you pointed in the direction you were headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlit... don\u2019t ever... do that again.\u201d You panted. He completely left you behind. Jerk. \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later, you\u2019d gone through all the stars you knew. This was the first time you\u2019d really seen Blit at night, and it was a crime you hadn\u2019t seen it before. The starlight seemed to glow on the grey tips of his feathers...<br>\r\nWait a minute.<br>\r\nBlit is 19 years old, and Krethids age at the same rate as humans. There\u2019d be no reason for him to already be greying already, and that\u2019s not how greying works for them anyways, it\u2019s whole feathers that turn grey, not tips. And the way the starlight glowed on them wasn\u2019t a reflection, it still glowed even when your hand was making a shadow over it. \u201cUm... Blit? Why are your feathers glowing?\u201d you asked, concerned. \u201cWhat? Woah...\u201d he said, as confused as you were. No sooner had he said that then it stopped. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Both of you said in unison. You walked back wordlessly, and both went to bed, the first night in a while Blit slept through the whole night. Later the next morning...</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s more to this temple that we haven\u2019t picked up on yet...\u201d Blit said, looking to you for advice. \u201cShould we go back there? Those traps are all single-use.\u201d You told him. \u201cEh, why not. I can fly us there now, somehow...\u201d he said. <i>How is he able to fly now? He couldn\u2019t progress that much that quickly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you arrived back at the temple, the locks having been resealed, but with the same passwords. You made your way back to the room, Blit pulling you up through the higher hatches, and made it to the room with the smashed amulets. \u201cKrethids are smart. However, if we see a prize, we\u2019ll go straight after it. We know this about ourselves. A thief would stay sneaky and get to these, because they wouldn\u2019t be calm until they were gone. So if my theory is right...\u201d Blit said as he dug through the rubble, \u201cThere we are!\u201d It wasn\u2019t an amulet, but it was a map of these woods, with very noticeable marks. \u201cThey\u2019re all labeled different numbers, maybe we have to collect all of them to make the true amulet?\u201d You said, knowing what you were getting yourselves into. As you said that, Blit collapsed as he tried to fly down through the hatch again. His wings may have improved, but he was pushing himself too hard, and he hadn\u2019t allowed enough time for them to get better. Judging by the blood, he tore a tendon in one of them. Now what?</span></div></div>",

Or rather, something inside of it. You tore away at the rocks, trying to ignore the image of Blit\u2019s bloody mess of a back, when you finally reach your prize. It seems to be a golden feather, but it\u2019s hard to tell because of how bright it is. You drop down through the hatch, feather in hand, and start trying to tend to his wound. The feather has a mind of its own, as the blood is drawn out of his feathers, and the wound slowly stops bleeding. The feather turns red, then white, then gold again. You tentatively place it to the would, and watch as the wound slowly shrinks away, and the wing is set back in place. This seems to snap Blit out of his shock, now that his wing is healed again. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d He asked, somewhat dazed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, once you fell the debris started glowing and I found this.\u201d You told him, handing him the feather. \u201cWoah... This can\u2019t be what I think it is,\u201d he said, \u201cOnly the strongest Krethid warriors are able to use these. Anyone else would be rejected by it. And I think it fixed my wings, for real this time.\u201d \u201cAlright, but I\u2019m not letting you fly us back out of here until we know for sure they\u2019re safe. You just proved yourself wrong when you told me they were better the first time.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The story starts out one average day at an average grocery store. You had just finished shopping and walked out of the store with a paper bag full of groceries. You turn left and begin making your way down the street and towards an intersection. You're an average and optimistic type of guy. In fact the kind of guy who would continue his daily routine disregarding any kind of sudden change in plans. I guess the best way to say it is, 'if something happens, it happens'. You stop and wait patiently for the light to change. You take a deep breath, \"Ahhh... And to think I only came to the grocery store for a loaf of bread. Hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple seconds later, the light changes, and you make your way across the street without any harm. You continue your way down a couple more blocks, and then head straight into a long alleyway. It's a bit odd, but it's the way you always go in order to get home, which is located in a forest just behind the other end of the alleyway. Upon entering the alleyway, you come to a stop once you overhear some low yelling. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen some more, the yelling starting to get a little louder the longer he listened. \"Uh-oh. Sounds like a group of people are mad at someone. Or something! Probably someone's antenna making things blurry on someone's TV screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET BACK HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!\" You look straight up to your left at a window on the second story of a two-story building. You stare intently at the window for a moment longer, and then 'Crash!' An unknown figure jumps out through the glass. You quickly turn around and lean your upper body in so you wouldn't get glass in your eyes or face. The figure then falls towards the ground beside you with a loud 'Thud!' \"Ah! Huh?\" You take a closer look at the unknown figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, it's one o' dem furry beings. Or in this case, feathery characters.\" The figure was a male blue-feathered hawk with a humanoid body. It didn't have any wings and wore a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and white tennis shoes. \"Wow! I knew those from The Other Side were peaceful, I didn't know they dressed like us too!\"  You stare at the poor thing for a while, noticing how hurt and bruised up he was. You sighed, \"I can't just leave this poor thing here in its condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your bag of groceries down. The avian slowly begins to open its eyes, but only enough to see his shadow being picked up by yours. The avian thinks to himself as you start running off home, \"Wha...? I'm being helped...? And by...a human? ...... Mm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avian passes out once again on your shoulders, but you don't notice. \"Six months of working out in my home gym, don't fail me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, another unknown figure pokes his head from the part of the alley you entered through to see you run off with the injured avian being carried on your shoulders. The figure looked like a masculine anthro, with raccoon ears and a raccoon tail. He holds right arm up to his mouth to speak to a type of wristwatch walkie-talkie, \"Guys, looks like some human picked up our feathered pal. He doesn't look like any one of those men in labcoats. Should I chase after him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male voice speaks through the raccoon's watch, \"Not one of those lab-coated jerks? Well, yeah, stay on his trail. But DON'T try to stop the human unless he harms our friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"  Suddenly, the raccoon overhears a couple police sirens coming his way. \"Crap! Better get outta here at least.\"  The raccoon uses his claws and climbs up the building to the roof and sprints off in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour, you were now walking up a fairly steep mountain towards a log cabin that lay ahead. You feel the hawk's body starting to weigh down on yours as you begin panting under your breath. In a matter of minutes, you finally make your way up the porch and up to the front door. You kick the door open with your left foot. Upon entering your home, you turn on the light to your living room and lay the poor thing on its back on the green couch. You sit on a small green sofa beside your couch and set your bag of groceries on a small table. You reach into the bag with your left hand, \"Ow!\"  You pull out something from the bag, \"Darn it! There's broken glass on my cabbage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the winged figure with injuries all over, and then let the cabbage fall to the ground. \"Mm... I guess that's not really important right now, huh?\"  You reach into your grocery bag and took out a 500-piece first-aid kit, which you placed on your small table. \"Good thing I was planning to go hiking tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now on your knees in front of the injured hawk. You scan his entire body, noticing a couple scraps and cuts all over his body, along with a few pieces of broken glass. His left arm looked like it was the most injured, looking as if it was popped out of place. \"Mm... Maybe I should pull these pieces of broken glass out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one you reach for is jabbed in the avian's hind wrist. You slowly grab a firm hold of the end that stuck out with your index finger and thumb, and then with a quick flick of the wrist, you pull it right out. This causes the avian to flinch as he opens his eyes wide, \"!!\"  With great agility, the hawk jumps right out from the couch and lands on his feet a few feet away. He was panting heavily as he grabbed ahold of his left arm. \"Don't you touch ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, \"Hey, he can talk! What am I saying? I already knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you!?\"  The avian grips his injured arm a little harder, \"Urrrgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step closer to him, \"Hey, easy pal! You're arm's not well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk looks at his arm, and then glares back at you. \"!\"  He notices the first-aid kit that's sitting on the table, and then looks back at you. \"...You're...helping me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. Why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk lowers his injured arm a little, \"It's just...I never thought I'd get assistance from a human before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy, to me, this isn't about a human helping an anthro. You were hurt, so I felt I should help you out.\"  The avian stares at you, still filled with doubt in his expression. \"Look, whether or not you trust me, I want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him blankly. \"So!? Do you trust me or not!?\"  The avian glares back at you, and then you bow your head down. \"Sorry.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear the avian give a small sigh before turning your head back up, a little curious. He seemed to shake his head to himself, but spoke out quietly. \u201cOkay. Sure beats sitting here with glass all over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're lucky enough you only got some glass in your arm. If it went in any other place, or it went much deeper than the surface, and you'd need a hospital. I'll try to be thorough, but not a surgeon, r'member.\u201d You just nod at the couch, the bird slowly walking back towards it. You brush off his seat before he sits back down, his arm hanging loosely in front of him. \u201cLucky for you, I can't see any cuts on your clothes. Don't know how you avoided glass in your body... I wouldn't be able t'do squat about that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird nods a little bit as you reach forward again, picking up his arm and getting back to work on it. He gave a sharp sound each time you get another shard out. You're quick and precise as you pull, but some of the glass has pierced him deeper than you expected. Disinfecting and wrapping the wounds also took a bit of time, and though he said you could take care of him, he certain didn't want to sit still. The noises distract you a bit as you work, but you're quick and steady with your job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere... I think that should be all of the glass.\u201d You carefully look over, making sure to disinfect any other scratches you can find before you finish banding up his arm. \u201cYou're still pretty banged up, though.\u201d You drop the last shard you could find onto the table. \u201cYou're probably a bit more injured than just that.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI'll take care of it myself. Mind if I borrow the kit?\u201d You see him tugging his shirt off, wincing a little as he moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. You need a hand, or something?\u201d He pauses as he looks at you again, as if gauging you somehow. However, he gives his head a small shake. You just stand up and shrug. \u201cIf you think so. Shout if ya need help.\u201d You stand up and get a dustpan to try to clean up the shards of glass littered on the table. The hawk sits a little awkwardly as he starts to try to work on himself. It only takes a minute before you've cleaned up the mess, carefully sweeping up all of the glass you could find before carrying it to your kitchen.\u201cJust glad that you're feeling alright. Second story fall through a glass window... Surprised you didn't break anything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm... resilient.\u201d He hesitates as he speaks out, probably trying not to make too much noise. You don't see very much as you dump all of the glass into the garbage. You head back for your groceries, noticing the hawk stop when he sees you approaching. He seems to relax a little when he sees you taking the groceries to the kitchen, and you can hear him moving again when you arrive. You start to pull out your things, hoping to figure out which items were still safe to work with. You slowly pull a few packages of food, as well as a bit of the fresher fruits and vegetables. It looked as though almost everything that wasn't in a separate container had gotten glass on it in several places, but most of the packaged foods and tools were still in one piece. You just try to put what you can into your pantry, wondering if you should bother trying to remove the glass or if it would be worth to visit the store again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlight grunts of pain come from the other room, confirming that the avian is still there, and apparently still tending to his wounds. It sounds like he was trying to keep quiet, but he must've had a lot more injuries than just what you saw. \u201cWhat exactly happened to you, anyways? Looked like you were trying to jump through that window. Why'd you need to do that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was... in a tight spot,\u201d He responds evasively. \u201cIt wasn't the stupidest thing I've ever done, but... Thanks for taking me...\u201d He pauses, glancing around the room a few times. He spots the window in the room, squinting his eyes a bit to try to look through it. \u201cWhere are we, anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy place. A bit deep in the forest near town. Afraid it's the only place I could take you. Not so familiar with the streets.\u201d You leave the glass-ridden groceries alone for now, just walking back to the living room. You could see the bird standing by the window, a number of healed cuts and the remnants of bruises scattered over his body. His eyes seem to widen a little as he turns his head, one of his hands still applying a few new bandages to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou carried me into the forest? That's... not exactly a short distance...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I make the trip all the time. Bit of a run's not gonna stop me.\u201d You smile at him as you approach. He's a little on edge, but you just stop nearby, looking out the window with him. \u201cMore surprised at you. Thought that a bird would be lighter than you are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at his feet a little awkwardly, stepping back as he just sat back onto the couch. \u201cMmm.\u201d  He seemed a little lost in thought as his eyes turned away. You turned to look at him, just shrugging your shoulders. \u201cSo, do you know what you're going to do after you recover.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes him a moment before he turns his head a little, looking at you curiously. \u201cA-after?\u201d He swallows quietly, his eyes looking right at you for a few moment. He shakes his head a little more violently than you expect, before speaking again. </span></div></div>",

I understand. ... But hey, let's change the subject then! Why don't we spend this time to ask questions and get to know each other better.\", you say with slight anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avian glances at you. \"... Sorry. You may be providing a place for me to stay and got me out of trouble, but I'm not comfortable enough to be talking about my personal life to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! I want you to be comfortable with me and where you are. You can ask me anything! And I'm not gonna force information out of you. If there's anything I ask, you don't have to answer it.\", you say happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk looked away towards the ground, still skeptical of the idea. \"Mm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, why don't you ask me some questions first.\"  You fold your arms, \"Go ahead. Ask me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay.\"  The hawk looks away, and then looks back at you while squinting his eyes. \"Do you have any affiliation with the police, FBI, or CIA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\", you say with a smile. \"Well, I have thought about it at one point in my life, but, it didn't really stick out to me.\"  You grin, \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" The avian sighs once again. He looks out the window towards the city, which was sitting a few miles away from where they were. The avian turns his head towards you, \"Why're you living all the way out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Provides a great view of the sky, mountains, and the city. Well, I guess mainly at night. Plus there's not too much pitter-pattering and city noise out here.\" You take another sip of your water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just you? I mean, how was this place built up here?\", the hawk asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place was mainly my father's idea. I helped built this place from the ground up three years ago.\"  You sigh. \"We sure used to spend a lot of time out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk grew a bit concerned. \"'Used to'? Where is he now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"He, got arrested two years ago after participating in a rally that was about bringing humans and anthros together. After he was put through trial...\" You lower your head a bit. \"All I can say is, I won't be seeing him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk's expression grew a bit saddened. \"Oh... I'm, sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I still receive calls from him every now and then.\", your expression brightening some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"  The hawk notices something, and looks up at you. \"Wha-, wait, how can you receive calls from him if he's dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him with an eyebrow raised, \"Huh? Oh no! He wasn't put to death. He was exiled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk felt a bit awkward. \"Oh. ... And you have mom too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh! Otherwise I wouldn't be alive helping people like you from falling out of two-story windows.\" You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk squints his eyes at you, \"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-hi'm sorry. You may need to get used to my personality. But on a serious note, my mom couldn't bare to be away from my dad so long, I said it was okay if she wanted to go with him. And she did.\", you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk grew a bit concerned again, \"And, you're okay with staying alone up here all by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift the bottle of water in your had around a few times, \"It's got its downsides. But I've got a working job and unlimited long distance talk, so it's not all bad. Plus I'm enjoying the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" The avian looks away and then blinks looking back at you. \"So, am I really here just because you wanted some company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly at your water bottle for a moment, and then shrug your shoulders, \"Well I, um...well... Okay, yes. The moment I saw you were hurt on the ground, I thought of it as being the perfect moment to bring someone home with me to take care of and to enjoy their company.\", so say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk is staring blankly at you. You still had the same expression on your face. The hawk is still staring blankly at you. Still, you had the same expression on your face. The hawk felt weird, but then gets you, \"...That's just your personality talking, isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"See? Now you're starting to get used to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk grins, \"Heheh. I guess I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow, \"Whoa. Did you just giggle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" The hawk pouts a bit as he looks away. \"Y-yeah. So? ......\"  The hawk looks at you, not trying to look silly, \"Okay, you said you wanted to ask me a few questions. Well, what do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the roof, \"Wow... Where do I even begin? ...\" You place a hand upon your cheek, \"Oh yeah! Your name! In fact, I haven't gotten to properly introduce myself either.\"  You hold out your right hand, \"My name's Allen. It's really a pleasure to meet you.\"  There was a fairly long pause, for the hawk was a couple feet away from where you were holding out your hand.  \"...... Okay, I guess it's fine if you just tell me your name right off the bat--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your hand to feel a soft, feathery palm grabbing ahold of your hand. You look up to see the avian standing right in front of you. \"The name's Morgan. I guess I should thank you at least for helping me out and letting me stay. Heh.\", Morgan grins warmingly as he tilted his head off to the side a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks start to turn a bit red by the feel of Morgan's soft palm shaking with yours. You also notice Morgan is actually a foot taller then you, and you're 5'6. But then you shake your head to shake it off. \"Uh, yeah. Sure thing.\", you say with a warm smile. It was strange. You and Morgan were just staring at each other, and for some reason, you just couldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan speaks up to break the moment,..</span></div></div>",

Do you have anything available to eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small laugh, you just grab his hand again, tugging him towards the kitchen. He's a little surprised, but he doesn't seem to put up much resistance as you bring him over while you speak. \"Should at least have enough for a few days, yeah. Any requests?

Right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were asking for it, you know!\" You just smile as you open your pantry, glancing in. \"Afraid all I've got for now is a few fruits. That should let you settle in okay until I can cook something a bit more filling.\" You just grab a couple of apples, giving them a loose throw at the table. One lands near his head, but the other bounces off his shoulder before falling into his lap. The sudden bump makes him dart up and look around for a moment. However, he smiles slight when he notices what hit him, picking up the apple and munching into it quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be a bit too jumpy, if an apple's gonna make me panic...\" He looks right at it, his eyes a little curious as he munches it down. \"Hope a bit of rest does me some good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to take out a couple of small pieces of meat, getting the heat started as you spare him a glance. \"Really, though.

Once the steaks were fully cooked, you turned off the stove and placed them on a large plate. You also stuck a fork into the one that was on the top of the pile. You turn with the plate in your hands, but stopped before even taking a second step. It was because you noticed Morgan, resting his head in his arms on the table. \"He was resting this whole time, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of the cooked meat was starting to snake through the air, and soon ending up into Morgan's nostrils. Morgan's eyelids immediately rose up along with his head, \"Whoa! Something smells good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" You hold out the plate of meat, \"I made steak.\" You set the plate on the table in front of Morgan's beak.

You stare at Morgan for a short time, then begin to pout. \"... Hrm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan let out a few more laughs, and then wiped a tear from his eye as he regained his composure. \"Hey, you're not the only one who likes to mess with people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan, \"...\" You then turn and look away as you fold your arms, \"Hmph.

You think to yourself a bit, and then decide to sit at the table next to him. You were about to say something, but couldn't help but keep staring at Morgan and his table manners. He wasn't too messy, but he seemed too fixated on eating than talking. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stops, as if pausing for a moment. \"Hm? You were gonna say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Uh, actually, yes.\" You lower your head, and then glance up at him. \"If you don't mind talking about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grins, raising the fork with some meat on it, \"Sure. Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're looking down at the table for a while. \"Well...\", the fork was nearing Morgan's mouth, \"...I just wanted to know about what happened to you back there.\" Morgan's hand stopped right where it was. \"...\" Morgan closes his beak, and then lowers the fork on to the plate. \"Uh, if you're not interested still, I'm not gonna force you to...\" Morgan suddenly let out a loud belch. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan pats his stomach, \"Sorry. Kinda ate a bit too fast. But...\", Morgan stares at you a bit provocatively for a moment. You back up a bit on your seat, \"......do I have your word, that you won't speak a word of this to anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course! ...\" You pull out a saw and hold it against your left arm. \"I'll cut off an arm to prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! God, please don't!\" You set the saw down. Morgan sighs. \"Okay, here's what happened. It started out one normal day. It was morning time, I didn't have work, and I had the day to myself. I also wasn't planning anything important, 'cept to go to the park and relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looks at you, raising an eyebrow. \"This is surprising to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I mean, your lifestyle is so...normal. In fact it's a lot like mine. But please, go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stared blankly at the table for a moment, and then began scratching the back of his head, \"... The next part is kind of hard to explain... I was walking down the street, as I said, then somebody taps me on the shoulder. Once I turned around, I suddenly get sprayed with knockout gas. I'm pretty sure it was knockout gas because I passed out right after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You stare at Morgan as he paused for a moment, tapping the fork against the edge of the plate. \"...So, then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm not, entirely sure how long I was out, but when I came to, I awoke in a cage. It was small, so I wasn't able to stand up on my knees. My wrists were tied and I had awoken in some sort of lab. I also realized I wasn't the only one there. It was me, a dalmatian, a dragon, a ferret, and a shark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way......a shark?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They're around.\", Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just answer with a slight grin on your face, \"Kewl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyways, I was the last of them all to have woken up. We were caged up for over half an hour. During that time, we all got to know each other fondly, and mentioned how we ended up where are now. We realized we were each doing our regular activity when we each got gassed in the same way.\" Morgan begin to clench the fork in his fist even harder. \"Then HE showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You stare at Morgan with a worried look on your face. Morgan begins to shiver a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nng...that cold bastard...! I didn't know who they were, but they were both wearing labcoats. The dragon lost his cool once the guy came in with his assistant. He sounded furious, yelling loudly and making our eardrums pop. All of a sudden, he gets injected in the chest by a syringe filled with some sort of blue liquid. ... I don't know what's in it, but it seemed to have sedated our dragon pal. And then within a few seconds, he passes out.\" Morgan clenches the fork in his hand even harder, almost enough to bend it in half. Morgan was also starting to clench his teeth as he continued to speak, \"Gih... The dragon was the biggest of all of us. Almost twice my size and I was the second biggest of everyone else. We didn't know what to think. If something like that was enough to completely sedate a dragon as big as him, what in the hell would happen to us!? Grr... Before we even had time to think, the dalmatian was the next to get injected! He falls flat on the ground within seconds! The ferret was terrified... I know because he backed away as far as he could, shaking hysterically. The man closed in on our ferret friend, injecting him with the same weird stuff in the leg. And with that...he passes out in a minute. So now it was just me and the shark. The scientist walked up to the shark, but the shark said he would bite the scientist's arm off before the syringe would even reach him. The scientist didn't care though. He wasn't even phased by what the shark said, as if it were an empty threat. He just...laughs... And then says, 'You sound like a worthy...test subject.' Both me and the shark's eyes widened. Why the hell were we being used as test subjects!? And what the hell was it for?! What the scientist said must've really stunned the shark. Because before he knew it, he was already injected with the said substance. I screamed out to the shark, but then, I look down...to see the scientist's assistant injecting me with the liquid. With that, the shark falls flat on the floor, and then passes out. As for me, I tried my hardest to say focused, but I was too sedated to even try hard enough...and fell towards the ground. The last thing I saw was the scientist...and his evil grin.\" Morgan was still shivering from his encounter as he paused for a moment. \"I'm scared...but I'm mainly more pissed off! What...what the hell did he put inside me!?! !!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's tone suddenly calmed right down. It was because you were holding Morgan's hand, to show that he was safe now. \"......And then what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan closes his eyes, \"Mm... Me and the others were suddenly awaken. This group of five anthros walked up to us, breaking open the cages and untying us. The group managed to get the four to safety, but I almost got caught. I yelled for the others to run away without me. As for me...I thought of a last resort. I saw the window to my left. And without thinking, I just went for it, running towards the window and jumping right through it.\" Morgan paused for a short moment. \"As for the rest of the story, I'm pretty sure you've got it in memory. I don't know who that group were, but I hope to see them again someday, and thank them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... That's some harsh stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan just sat in your seats for a while, staring intently towards the table. Morgan speaks up...</span></div></div>",

Not tonight, at least...\u00e2\u0080\u009d With a small shiver, he shifted back up into his seat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust gives me the creeps thinking about it...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morgan's hand settles on his abdomen, holding himself a little bit as he looks at you. You give a small nod, still working on your own meal as you look back at him, before speaking again between bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if you don't sleep, don't push yourself too hard, okay? You still need to try to rest and recover. I don't know exactly what they did, but maybe we can find a doctor for you or something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pauses a little as he looks at you, before you speak again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, an anthro doctor. Can't say I quite know exactly how much is diff'rent between the two of us, so we might as well try and get a good look. Might take a while to find one, though. I can't say I've ever been to the fluffy part of town, so to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head rather firmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll pass. I'd... rather not get myself poked and prodded right now. Not yet, at least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He held himself a little tighter, visibly shivering this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you'll still want to figure out something. You get injected with something, and next thing we know, you wake up and find all your feathers fell out or something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You smirk a little as you take another bite, before seeing him with a worried look. However, it only takes a moment before you notice him glaring at you. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? You've got them now, and even if you lose them, you still got your clothes and all that, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's... not quite the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuit yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You shrug as you watch him turn, his eyes glancing over the scratches and small splatters of blood that were on his shirt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn't even know if anthros wore clothes to begin with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt varies from place to place. Heard that some are less reserved, but I always...\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hesitated for a moment, before he suddenly threw you a stern look. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear, if you make any naked bird jokes...\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho, me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You grin and drop your fork for the moment, leaning back in your chair and covering your mouth as you give a small burp. He sighs and shakes his head as he looks down at his lap, but you can still see the small smile that he has now. When his head moves back up, you notice that it's still glancing at the few remnants of your meal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, still hungry or something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I'm alright. Least, I think I am. Stomach just feels a little off at the moment. Not sure if it's hunger or something else...\u00e2\u0080\u009d His hand was still placed on his spot, rubbing over his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSick or something? Need to lie down?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot really... Maybe... I can't really tell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You nod as you stand back up and push your chair in, standing up next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on. Let's at least get you onto the couch. If you can't sleep, I'll just keep you company. Not like I have to sleep anytime soon. One good thing about living on your own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You reach out a hand, and he pulls it a little roughly as he stands himself up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, though... You okay? You look a little dizzy or something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll be fine...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morgan's other hand is still clutching his gut, but you're able to help him slowly walk to the couch. The moment he gets to it, he lets himself fall face-first into the cushion, giving a muffled sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, careful not to peck any holes in that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear another soft groan, and for a moment, you're worried about Morgan. However, he slowly turns enough to look back at you, lying sideways on the cushions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was terrible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, I can't help it if I don't really know what birds do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You grin and move, sitting on the armrest of the couch, close to his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, I haven't exactly seen a lot of furries. Featheries. Birdies. Whatever it is you're called.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthros will work fine for all of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His hand moves upwards, giving your side a firm nudge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you try to call every individual type of anthro by their own name, you'll probably spend way too long making a list of things to call fishes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and reach a hand down, pressing it to his back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNah, I've already got that one written. Give me five minutes and I'll go get it from-\u00e2\u0080\u009d You feel another, firmer push from his fist. He's giving you a sarcastic look, and you can't help but laugh as you see his reaction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFine, fine, I'm kidding, I'm kidding!\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turns again, still shaking his head as he looks up at you. You just look back at him, his expression a little calmer again. However, in the few moments of silence that follow, he slowly looks down over himself, a slight bit of concern. You try to get his mind off of it as you speak again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, where are you from, anyways? Close by? Or do you fly here regularly or something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He turns a little suddenly as you speak, before giving a small nod. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, right. Actually...\u0094</span></div></div>",

The world's largest forest that separates the humans side from the anthros?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world they live in is basically Earth, only with one huge continent on the North part of the planet, and Antarctica on the South. Think of it as the 7 major continents never breaking apart in the past. \"Sure, why not?\", you say with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you even manage to build a house up here in the first place? I heard you'd have to get a special message from both sides in order to build a place up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. We did. The anthro side's mayor was more than happy to give us one and we were shunned by the human side for supporting the anthro side. So our mayor agreed by ordering us to stay up here.\", you explain still with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan raises an eyebrow at you, \"You still being 'shunned' by the community?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say with a smile, \"Oh that was years ago. Most everyone's over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Most' everyone?\", Morgan questions once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin scratching your cheek, \"Well, I still receive hateful letters from people at least once a week. But it's nothing I can't handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan still felt a little concerned. \"Has it only been hateful letters? Or is it some other stuff too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, you sure sound concerned about my well-being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you helped carry me out of trouble, gave me a decent meal and am currently providing me a place to stay until I recover. Of course I'd be concerned about you. Urrrgh...!\" Morgan clenched his stomach once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, you don't sound well. Maybe you should get some rest.\" You stand up from the armrest of the couch, \"I'm gonna go head upstairs. If there's anything ya need, just call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!\" You were about to walk off, but Morgan grabbed ahold of your left wrist. \"Allen, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Morgan, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked down at the ground, but then up at you. \"Um, is it okay, if you sleep down here tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?\" You put your hands on your hips, \"What are ya? A big ba-...\" You realize and remember what Morgan has just been through. You felt now isn't as good a time anymore to be messing with him. It'd be nice for him to be with someone he can truly trust. That person especially being a human. \"Uh, sure. Why not? I mean, I am feeling a little tired myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down into Morgan's eyes, which were staring happily back at you. \"Thank you.\", Morgan said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... S-sure, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, it was already around midnight. Morgan had been asleep on the long couch, while you were sound asleep on the small couch. The light in the room was also still on since Morgan said he wasn't comfortable sleeping with in the dark just yet. Morgan remains sound asleep, his chest rising up and down with each breath. Suddenly, a dark hand with claws slowly crept up over Morgan's face, slowly closing in as its fingers crawled once. Just as it was about to grab Morgan's face, it instead reached down on to Morgan's shoulder, shifting Morgan from left to right to wake him up. The person whispers, \"Hey, Morgan! You awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being shifted a few more times, Morgan's eyelids open right up, \"!!\" Morgan quickly grabs the unknown person's hand and quickly turns around to throw the guy to the ground, Morgan's other hand now clenching the guy's neck. \"Oh no! You're not gonna perform anymore tests on me...! !\" The person who was waking him up turned out to be the raccoon fellow from before. \"Y-...you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon sat up, \"Yeah, one of the guys who helped saved your ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan let go the raccoon's neck, and then helped him up. \"Sorry 'bout that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't think nothing of it. You're just lucky you didn't break my back or anything.\", the raccoon said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan began rubbing the back of his neck, \"Oh, uh, I wanted to thank you properly for saving me back there, but I don't know your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon gestured a hand in front of his chest, \"The name's Vince. Me and four others were a team on a mission to help save you guys from being kept in an experimental lab. Sadly though, we couldn't make it in time before you were all injected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan squinted his eyes as he stared towards the ground. \"... Yeah...\" Morgan looked up at Vince. \"Would you guys happen to know what those bastards put inside us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Sad to say I can't. Least not yet. We currently have the others who were injected in a testing lab of our own. Just to see what we're dealing with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shifted his hands up, \"Please, I've had enough of labs already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say you have to be tested if you want to.\" Vince folds his arms, \"Besides, it's gonna take a while to get you back to Anthroside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, eversince we saved you guys, law enforcement has jacked up around here. Who knows!? They could be searching this entire mountain right now as we speak. It was a nice thing that kid did for you earlier, but I don't think staying here is such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"! That's right!\" Morgan turns towards you and whispers, \"Allen! ...\" Morgan just stared blankly towards you, seeing that you were wearing an eyemask and had cotton stuffed in your ears. \"...... Boy, you sure went through a lot of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, he was already wearing that. The kid sure likes his beauty sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turns his attention towards Vince, \"Hey, he's older than he looks. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince blinks his eyes at Morgan, \"Hm? Do you even trust this guy? I noticed you have been talking a lot since you were brought here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.\" Vince was staring back at Morgan with an eyebrow raised and his arms still folded. \"Well, okay, maybe not fully. But--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You barely met this guy about a few hours ago. You sure he's not plotting against you or anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, he went through the trouble of bringing me up here, didn't he?\" Morgan turns his head towards you, \"I'm sure he'd have notified the police by now if he really didn't give a crap about me.\" Morgan said in a low voice, \"And, it's strange, but, I think we're really connecting with each other in some sort of strange way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh--\", Morgan looked back at Vince, \"--n-nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if I were you, I'd high-tail it right out of here while we have the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you haven't noticed...\", Morgan lifted up his injured arm, \"I'm not in the best condi-...-tion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince was puzzled, \"? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked at his arm, which was still wrapped in bandages. He curled his fingers a few times with ease. He then quickly tore off all the bandages that were wrapped around his supposedly injured arm. But after shifting his arm around, up and down, left and right, and even throwing a swift punch at the air in front of him...his arm had completely healed. Morgan took another close look at his once-injured arm, \"My arm...it's all healed up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa! You mean to tell me you injured your arm after jumping out of that window, and it completely healed within a few hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lifted his arm up a bit and flexed it, causing his bicep to peak and bulge out pretty good. \"I...guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince begins scratching his chin, \"Interesting... Looks like whatever he injected you with causes you injures to heal within a few hours. Depending on the severity of your injury of course.\" Vince walked over to a nearby window. \"Now come on. Since you're all better, let's make a hasty escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan stared at Vince, and then turned his head towards you. \"...I'm uh...I think I'll just stay here for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\", Vince asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grinned, \"I kinda like this kid. He's one of the first few humans I ever got to meet who doesn't end up wanting to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince stared at Morgan for a moment, and then sighed as he put his hands on his hips. \"You sure about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan still had his attention on you, \"Yeah. I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince sighs again. \"Fine. But here, take this.\" Vince pulls out what looks like a business card from his pocket. He hands it to Morgan. \"It's a card with emergency contact numbers in case you're in trouble. Just call one of them and we'll arrive as soon as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Alright. I'll keep this in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince opens up the window. \"Well, good luck to ya--\", Vince leapt  out of the window, but ended up tripping on the window sill and falling to the ground, \"Ack! Dammit!\" Morgan stared towards where Vince once stood. \"Uh, a little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Morgan started walking towards the window, \"I'm coming.\"</span></div></div>",

You shift and turn, your blankets sprawled over the floor as you slowly pull off the mask you wear in your sleep. As your eyes opened, you jumped back, not expecting a beak right in front of you. \u201cGruh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Allen. Scare you?\u201d Morgan slowly pulled his head away, grinning widely as he sees your reaction. You reflexive throw the blanket at him, it falling in a bit of a pile as it lands on top of him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh... And I thought I woke up early enough... Didn't expect a bird in my face. Maybe one chirping on my windowsill, but not in front of my face.\u201dYou yawn a bit, stretching out as Morgan pulls the blanket off. \u201cYou sleep okay, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looks back towards the window for a moment, before turning and chucking the blanket back over you. \u201cBetter than I thought. Couch was warm enough. Thanks, though. For keeping me company and all.\u201d He looks a little shyly towards the ground, and you just smile, slowly standing up and stretching your arms out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. How's your arm feeling? Didn't end up sleeping on it or something, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitates again, before shaking his head a few times, shifting and nodding towards the bandages. \u201cBit stiff, but I think it's improved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d You smile and slowly stand up, reaching out and giving Morgan's good shoulder a small pat. He hesitates before rolling it a little and smiling back at you. \u201cCome on, now. I'll make some breakfast. Unless you've already eaten some worms while I was still sleeping or something. Bit of an early bird, aren't you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a hand place a slight slap against the back of your head. It doesn't do any more than catch your attention, and you can't help but chuckle as Morgan follows. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking of trying to make breakfast for us today. I can at least do that much for you. But if you're gonna make jokes about it the entire time...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I can keep quiet when I need to.\u201d You let him move forwards into your kitchen. \u201cI just don't need to right now!\u201dYou grin before he turns, and you duck under another slight bop aimed your forehead. He grumbles a little as he resumes walking, but you can still spot the slight smile he has. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you don't mind if I end up raiding your pantry a bit. I'm not completely sure what you've got to cook with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle bit of everything, really. I don't make the trip to town too often, so I usually try to make sure I have a variety of food that'll last me a while.\u201d You help pull open the pantry door for him as you watch him fumble for it with his uninjured arm. \u201cYou sure you can cook with one arm?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll manage something. Besides, I've got enough feeling back in my injured arm. I'm sure I can use it if I take it easy.\u201d He gives a small nod, and while you're a bit concerned, you just step back and watch him starting to pull a few things out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Just don't break anything, okay? It's a pain to try to replace any of my pans, and it'll be even worse trying to replace your arm or something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Morgan gives a small smile as he starts to work, speaking to you as he does. \u201cSo, you have any plans for today? I mean, I'm sort of just... here for now. Not sure what it is you usually do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? Well, originally, I was planning on going hiking today. Admittedly, there are only a handful of things that someone can really do to keep themselves entertained here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Morgan turned a little bit to look at you, the carton of milk in his hand slipping a little. He notices before it falls out, his attention going back to cooking again. Even so, he seems a little distracted when he hears you speak again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah. It's part of why I ended up shopping yesterday. I was looking for some extra supplies before I went out. I guess it was a good thing, too, or else I would've probably run out of bandages halfway through treating you.\u201d You pause a little at the thought, not sure what you would've done if that's the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you're going to be heading out after you eat?\u201d Morgan looks like he's struggling a little more trying to get a couple of slides of bacon into a pan properly. You just sigh and chuckle a little bit, moving up and holding the pan in place for him. He's a little surprised to see you next to him, but you give him a small nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to overdo it trying to repay me or anything, alright?\u201d He turns to look at you, before giving a small nod, smiling again as he looks at you. You start to move, helping him with the food before speaking again. \u201cAnd as for today... Well...\u201d </span></div></div>",

So long as there's no rock climbing involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You perk up your lower lip, and then say as you cross your arms, \"Aw man. And I was really planning on spending an extended period of time on it today.\" You shrug your shoulders, \"Oh well. If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glances back at you, and then sighs. He thinks to himself, \"I know he's probably just saying that to get to me again. But...maybe I should just tell him about my not-so-broken arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your bacon's burning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan hesitates, \"Ah! Uh...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand Morgan a spatula, \"Here ya go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan quickly flips the slices of bacon over, and then sighs in relief. Morgan looks at the spatula in his hand, \"?\" Morgan turns back to you, \"Hey, where'd this spatula come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Morgan...\" You turn away from Morgan, revealing an apron filled with kitchen utensils tied to your back, \"Some questions are best not being asked and you should just go with the flow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turns back towards the stove as he says in his head. \"Huh. Still can't get the thought of him pulling this out of his ass out of my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, you and Morgan we both sitting at the table, each with a plate of bacon. Your plate was almost empty. \"Mmm. Thanks for cookin' the bacon. It's a little burnt, but I like crispy food.\", you say with a smile. \"?\" You look at Morgan, was eating, but looked as if he had something on his mind. His plate was still half full. \"Hey Morgan, you, got something on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looks as if he wasn't paying attention to you at first, but then flinches and looks up at you, \"Uh, I-it's nothing. really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold your arms on the table. \"Morgan, if there's anything you'd like to talk about, you should talk about it now. I wouldn't want you still thinking about this and getting side-swiped by a low tree branch once we start scouring the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was looking down again, but then he raises his head up to look at you. \"... Alright. ...It's just...what happened the other day...it really got me thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking, you say? About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glances away, \"It's just, what he did to me, and how he treated me...he, made feel weak. Like I'm, less of a person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a hand on Morgan's, \"Oh come now! I know you're much more strong-spirited than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan raises his fists, \"I am! I mean, I know I am!\" Morgan lowers his fists, \"I just, I want to get back at that guy. I don't want to be treated like that again. I want to be strong! And I don't mean just mentally, but physically! I also want to do for the others who were kidnapped like I was\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into Morgan's eyes, which seemed to be showing a lot of strength and courage in them. \"So, is that why you want to go hiking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan calms down, looking at you, \"Not really. But it's a start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan for a moment, and then grin, \"Heh. Well whatever the case...\", you place a hand on one of Morgan's palms. Morgan looks and stares down towards it, \"...just be safe, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan just kept staring at your palms, which were still touching each other. \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing how long you two have been touching hands, you flinch and quickly pull yours away, \"Oh! Uh, Yeah. Hahaha...\" You get up from your chair, \"I guess I'll um...pack both our bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly speed off upstairs. Morgan grins, \"Heh.\" Morgan continues eating, \"Well...'Munch' 'Munch' 'Chew'...at least I got my appetite back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Allen prepared two hiking backpacks that were sitting on the couch. The last thing Allen had to pack were two water bottles, which he slipped into each backpack. You say as you zip them up, \"Alright. That's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was standing behind you. \"Oh. Okay, but uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt him by holding up one of the backpacks in front of him, \"Here. This is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\", Morgan turns around, \"...o-okay.\" You slip on the backpack on to Morgan's back. \"But, shouldn't we be on the lookout or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your backpack and slip it right on. \"Lookout for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan scratches the side of his head, \"I mean, can we really just walk right out there and start hiking on our own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I mean there are rarely any people hiking around here. Plus the only inhabitants seem to be a couple of forest animals.\" You walk over to the back window doors of your house and slide one of the doors open. \"Alright. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gih-!\" Morgan holds out an arm, \"Hang on! We're just gonna go!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop at the doorway to turn back at Morgan, \"Hm? Yeah. What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just, I just don't think it's safe! What if something happens to you? And I'm kind of in hostile territory aren't I--\", You suddenly place a finger on Morgan's beak, \"--...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you said you wanted to be strong, right?\" You set your arm down. \"If something does happen, I'd just let it happen. Okay?\", you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan stared at you for a moment, and then he thought to himself, \"That's right. I had that whole spiel wanting to become stronger. And now...I wouldn't even step out of the house because of a slight possibility of being spotted... Okay, I guess it still is a bit much to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly felt your hand pushing against his back. \"Come on. Let's go experience nature's...beauty.\" Morgan grins a bit, and then nods his head in agreement. You and Morgan walk out of the cabin, closing the door behind you. Suddenly, there were a few chimps screaming and yelling from outside. \"By the way, there are a few chimps out here.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCome on, then. Let's get going. We shouldn't waste time, now!\u201d You chuckle as you quickly help Morgan adjust his backpack, before dashing ahead a little, the squeaks and squeals fading off a little bit. \u201cLess I hear of these guys, the better!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey!\u201d He stumbles a little awkwardly before he starts to move after you, trying to catch up to your head start. \u201cThat's a bit more than a hike!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're the one who said he wanted exercise!\u201d You laugh as you slow down just enough to let him keep pace, your cabin quickly fading off as you move. \u201cCome on, now, and stay close. Otherwise, you're gonna get lost out here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I've got a decent sense of direction, you know!\u201d He grunts and shifts his arm a little before picking up, catching up to you, the two of you slowing down when he does. You chuckle and just move your hand over his eyes, giving him a slight spin as you hold him carefully. He shakes his head, his beak brushing your hand off as you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then, smart guy. Which way's the Cabin?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles and just nods backwards towards it. \u201cOh, come on, now. You didn't even get me dizzy, and I can still see it from here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and squint your eyes in the opposite direction, trying to take a look. \u201cReally? Because I can still-\u201d You suddenly feel him nudge into your head, pushing you an inch and tilting his head as he looks at you. \u201cOh, fine, fine. Spoilsport.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles before nodding. \u201cNice try. But you'll want to find someone who's got a hawk's eyes before you try that one again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint your eyes back in the direction he indicated, barely able to spot your home. \u201cNo kidding... I can't even make it out from here. Guess it really is a bird thing.\u201d You smile and take his hand before you start to move again. \u201cCome on, let's get moving. Long as you stay close, we shouldn't have a problem with someone getting lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm.\u201d He picks up the pace a little, glancing around the whole place as he moves. \u201cI've never really been this deep in a forest before. Didn't even realize how many animals were here.\u201d He turns a little as you hear the fluttering of wings, your head moving with his and just barely seeing a blur pass out of a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It's not a bad place. Most of the things here are protected, though. It's why I have to make runs to town. Only allowed to hunt a bit if you need to. Course, seeing as nobody ever really checks, I'm pretty sure I'd be able to get away with a few small things. Assuming I could catch them, at least. Too many squirrels have snuck into my place...\" You grumble a little, but Morgan just chuckles as he hears it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked quietly, and you were happy to help guide him through the path. There was barely a dirt road, and the plant life seemed to be overwhelming the path every once in a while. It takes him a fair bit of effort to try to get around some of the denser parts with his arms still bandaged up. But you help him through, even holding his hand occasionally as you help him along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are we going, anyways?\u201d He tilts his head after about half an hour of walking. You're still in good shape, but it looks like he's the slightest bit out of breath. \u201cI mean, I know we might be gone most of the day and stuff. But I'd like to know if we're going anywhere, or if we're just wandering for the heck of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, tired already?\u201d You laugh quietly as he huffs a bit, doing his best to cross his arms in front of him. He just shuffles his good arm a little as you stop for him. \u201cTake it easy, alright? It's already a lot for you to be walking around after yesterday.\u201d You dig through your pack, just pulling out a bit of water and taking a sip of it. \u201cBut yeah, got a bit of a plan.\u201d You move a little closer before pulling his hand from in front of him, tugging lightly and sitting down against a tree, pulling him onto the ground with you. \u201cActually...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Morgan holds a hand up against his head. \"So, you're telling me we're just exploring the forest, without any knowledge of where we'd be going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pout, \"Hey, don't look at me like that. I wasn't expecting to bring an injured hawk along you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Mm.\" Morgan crosses his arms, \"So then where ARE we heading? Have you even pinpointed any area around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one place I go to all the time.\", you say with a smile. You walk off, shifting you hand for Morgan to come along, \"Come on. It's not too far from here.\" You and Morgan begin walking deeper into the force. After a few minutes of walking, you both were now walking through a less tree-filled part of the forest. Morgan couldn't help but take a look at the gorgeous scenery. The sun was glistening through the tries, blinding Morgan's view a bit, but it wasn't anything Morgan can't handle. You turn your head back a bit to glance back at Morgan, who was turning his head around a few times to take in all the beauty nature had to offer them. You grin and turn your head forward, \"Heh. Hey, we're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turns his head forward, then slowly, his eyes widen. \"......\" What you and Morgan were walking towards was a large lake that seemed to be stretching out over 25 miles. Surrounding the back of the lake was a large mountain that stretched up to a hundred stories tall. \"What is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan come to a stop on the shore of the lake.. You then put your hands on your hips. \"This my friend, is known as Riverbank Mountain.\" Morgan walks a few steps ahead of you. \"It's the largest mountain here. Plus it supplies the largest lake here as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked right up at the top of the mountain, where a waterfall was streaming and falling from. Morgan couldn't help but stare at the fantastic view, mouth agape a bit. \"I...never knew there was such a beautiful place on this planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It's got its sights. I'm one of the lucky ones, because I can experience this amazing site everyday. If I wanted to.\", you say with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your backpack down, and then start to slip your shirt off. Morgan glances at you, and then flinches, \"What're you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Morgan, as if he asked a dumb question, \"Uhhh, undressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan straights his posture. \"Oh.\" Morgan looks away, scratching the top part of his beak, \"So, you swim here every so often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the ground and start to take off your shoes, \"Well, about 2-3 times a week. Mainly so I can shower off a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looks back at you, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to take off your pants, so you were now only wearing a pair of black shorts, \"Yeah. One of the downsides of living in a log cabin is that you can't have your own waterline. So I pop by here to wash up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's feathery cheeks started show a little red in them after looking at your almost naked frame. He quickly turns his head away, putting a hand on against the right side of his face, \"I, was actually more concerned about you contaminating the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up towards the edge of the water, running your hand into the water, \"Oh no worries. Me and my dad used to shower here all the time too. He told me there's an underwater drainage hole that acts as a recycling system for the water.\" You look back at Morgan, \"Besides, I don't think I alone am able to contaminate enough of this lake to deem it unsafe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinks once, \"...\" Morgan glances away, \"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to take a swim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan slips off his backpack and sets it on the ground. \"I guess. I could wash off a little after what I've been through.\" Morgan walked up besides you, and then rolled up his sleeves. Morgan was about to kneel down, but caught the unhappy look on your face before he did. \"? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Morgan. I'm pretty sure you need to wash off a little more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinked once again, \"... What? You want me to strip for you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile without realizing it, \"For me? I-I-I mean, you're just so dirty, and I just thought maybe, if you could undress a little more, you would be able to clean yourself off after a long day at work...\" You stop yourself. You turn your head towards Morgan, who was staring back at you with a an awkward look on his face. You turn your head back towards the mountain. \"I...think I just hit head against something. ......Just now. ...By some bug.\" Your face quickly turns red. \"UGH!\" You shield your face with your right arm, \"I'm sorry! I don't know WHAT is wrong with me... I think there is seriously something wrong with me.\" You lower you head in shame, \"Sorry if I completely weirded you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Allen.\" You raise your head up and glance at Morgan. Your eyes widen. Morgan's tattered shirt and pants were set beside him on the ground. Morgan was kneeling on his left knee in only his red, white polka-dotted boxers. \"I suppose taking a full-body swim wouldn't be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare intently at one part of Morgan's muscular form. \"...Polka-dots...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really the only thing you notice?\" You face quickly poofs red again. \"Well it was either this or the one with heart-shaped polka-dots, but I don't think it matters.\" Morgan glances at you, \"?\" Your cheeks were still red, as you tried not to take another glance at Morgan's handsome form. Morgan reaches an arm around your shoulders, \"Hey, snap out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to look up at Morgan, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly leaps up into the air with you in his arms, \"Come on! Let's go for a swim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAHHH!!\"</span></div></div>",

It only takes you a moment before your head makes its way above, the water flowing around your neck as you try to stand up steady. You can see the grin on Morgan's face as his head pops out in front of you. \u201cYou just had to jump, didn't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you were the one who insisted I get in here!\u201d He grins as he splashes you a bit with his arms. The water drips off from his feathers as he gets you, and you grunt before trying to move, pushing at him playfully and nearly diving onto him. He twists away, laughing as he kicks through the water. You can't help but grin and stare a little, the water sliding off of his feathers as he gets a short distance away. With a quick stroke of your arms, you quickly catch up, doing your best to grab around his waist and keep him in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna get you for that!\u201d You grin and take a quick breath before playfully pulling, managing to drag him under for a couple of moments before you feel him pushing his head back out, the two of you both trying to catch your breath. After a few moments, you grin at him and nod a few times. \u201cHehe. Thanks for coming in, though. I wouldn't want a stinky bird in my place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut it.\u201d He just grins and gives you a push with both arms, you just laughing as you fall back, floating on the water for a few moments. You shake and shift a little, letting the water stream over your body. You tilt up a little to see Morgan working through his feathers, trying to get a bit of water in the tough-to-reach spaces. However, it takes you a few moments before something registers in your mind. \u201cHey, Morgan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? What is it?\u201d He turns a little, a slight blush on his face as he glances over your body. You shift and try to stand back up, the water reaching up to your shoulders as you look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs your arm okay? I mean, you almost picked me up with it earlier, and it looks like you're using it okay right now.\u201d The bird blinks a couple of times, before letting off a couple of uncertain sounds. It takes a moment before he speaks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah... About that... It kind of... Healed last night.\u201d He turns slowly and cautiously, tugging the bandages loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Let me see...\u201d You move up close as you watch him loosen the bandage. He does his best to toss it back onto the land. He bends and turns his arm a few time as you examine it closely, trying to look for any trace of the cuts that he had. However, you can't find any sign that he had ever been injured, not even the slightest edge of a scar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... Honestly, I have no idea what happened. It's weird...\u201d He turns, lowering his arm and testing his hand a few times, opening and clenching it. He looks a little more distraught by it than you would've thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird. Yeah, that's one word for it. Still, it's not like that's a bad thing, right? As long as you're feeling better now and all.\u201d You smile and give his arm a light squeeze. You watch for his reaction, noticing that he doesn't wince or really react to it. He's more surprised that you're holding him as he shifts a little, blushing as he mutters out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, come on, now. You trying to get a feel?\u201d He chuckles and just playfully flexes his arm. You can't help but blush for a moment before just splashing a handful of water onto his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shush, you. You aren't <i>that</i> big.\u201d You grin as you give him another squeeze, a little surprised at how firm he felt. Still, you didn't really have that much to compare it to. You couldn't help but glance over his body again, admiring it a bit as you hold him. You're not sure how long you're holding him, but it must be a little bit too long. You hear a slight noise, almost a cough, coming from him, and you blush as you pull back suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry. Just a little distracted. I mean, you look good is all. Better than I thought a wet bird would've looked, that's for sure.\u201d You chuckle a few times, but he just nods and shifts a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d It's his turn to blush now. He looks down at his own body, shifting a little as he tried to scrub through a few more of his feathers, making contact with his chest. He pauses a little, almost looking slightly surprised before he turns back up, glancing right at you. \u201cUm... Uh... T-thanks...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d You just shake your head a few times before putting on the calmest smile you can manage. \u201cThink you still look better dry, though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll either need a towel or a bit of time sunbathing if you really want to see that.\u201d He chuckles awkwardly before he dives under the water for a few moments. You see him almost jumping as he splashes back out. \u201cThink I'm mostly set, though. You got yourself clean?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, good enough, I think.\u201d You grin for a moment before diving back under the water for a moment. You do your best to stay under for a bit longer than usual, swimming as quickly as you can manage. You can almost hear him gasp when you pop up behind him, grinning as you're holding his shoulder. He flails a little before you just jump lightly onto his back, holding on tight. \u201cHehe! Gotcha!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck! What's the big idea!\u201d His voice is a bit loud, but he doesn't sound upset at you. He's more panicked than anything else as you hold on tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Just a thought. You said you wanted to be a bit stronger, right? And we're right here now. So...\u201d You grin a little more, the edge of a blush noticeable from where you are. You're blushing a little as well, but you manage to keep your voice even as you make your suggestion. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were sitting on a rocky shore of the lake, drying yourself off with a bath towel you brought along on your hike. You were nearly dry, wiping off any water droplets you had left on your cheek. You suddenly hear a loud splash, lowering the towel you were using to see where it echoed from. Upon staring at the open waters, you spot Morgan doing backstrokes on the water. Morgan has actually been spending a couple minutes doing multiple different swim exercises. Morgan even leaped in and out of the water a couple times like a dolphin would. You could surely tell this wasn't the first time Morgan has ever been in the water. Morgan does one last leap, stretching his wings and leaping higher into the air than the previous times he performed his great move. While still in the air, Morgan flew back down while doing a backwards summersault in your direction. You brace for impact by covering your face with your arms, \"Ah!\" Morgan actually lands in the water right in front of you, splashing a wave of water all over you. \"... Hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan pops from out of the water, shaking his head a few times and splashing water from out of the feathers on his head. Morgan crossed his arms as he rested them on the rocky shore where you sat, \"Ahhh. It's always nice to go for a swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dripping water from all over. \"Dammit Morgan, I just dried myself off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grinned, \"Oops. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your towel around your shoulders, \"Hmph. Well anyways, those were some impressive swimming moves you did there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just happen to be a natural-born swimmer. Loved it ever since I started at the age of 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk, \"Heh. And here I thought you having blue feathers had something to do about it.\" Morgan just stares at you, leaning his head against his left hand. After a moment, Morgan just grins, still staring at you. You just stare back Morgan, looking to your left, to your right, and then back at Morgan awaiting a response. \"...What? You're not, you're not gonna say something back at me? Slap me on the back of the head? Say something back at me WHILE slapping me on the back of the head?\" There was still no response from Morgan. He finally makes a move, carrying himself out of the water. He walks right up to you, kneels down on both knees, and than wraps both his well-muscled arms around you. In a matter of seconds, you flinch, \"Hih! Wha-wha-wha-, what uh, what, what, what's goin' on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan moves his head in closer to yours, enough for his beak to be about an inch away from your nose, \"What? This isn't enough information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks start to turn red as you blink your eyes once, \"... Sooo...I'm guessing you swing that way, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan begins nuzzling his beak a bit with your nose, \"You got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, what gave me away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. Of all the guys I've been around, you were the one who has been staring at me the most.\" You blink. \"Yeah. I noticed.\" Morgan grabs your right hand with his left, and then whispers into your right ear, \"And, I'm pretty sure it wasn't really the polka-dots you were staring at earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire face begins to turn as red as a tomato. \"Mm... Alright. ... You got me.\" Morgan slowly wraps his arms around your back to bring you in for a warm hug. You simply smile, and then give Morgan a hug back. \"I'm, actually glad...that we both met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?\" Morgan chuckles, \"Heh. You, you're one of the most stubborn guys I've ever met. But, I feel the same way.\" Morgan lightly pushes you back from you hug, and then grabs your towel to hand to you. \"Care to dry me off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You smile, and then take the towel Morgan handed you. \"Sure.\" You stand up, walking behind Morgan and start drying off his head with your towel. You then move down to Morgan's neck. The moment you start drying off Morgan's neck, you can feel just how tight Morgan's neck muscles turned out to be, along with his trap muscles. After drying off his neck, you start moving down to Morgan's fairly wide back. \"Ooh...\" Upon drying Morgan's back, you liked the feeling of many muscles that rippled on his back. You continued wiping down his back, but you were really taking your time so you could feel each muscle that stuck out on his body. Morgan on the other hand, had an eyebrow cocked, well-aware of what you were doing. After a few more minutes of unnecessary drying, get up and kneel down in front of Morgan's left arm. You start out by drying his broad shoulder. You move on down to his large bicep and tight bicep, and then you went on to Morgan's left forearm. Even though you were drying Morgan's forearm, Morgan could clearly tell you were keeping you attention on his bicep. Morgan grins, and then pretends to look away while stretching out his left arm. Upon doing so, your eyes widen at the sight of Morgan's pumped arm. The muscles on Morgan's arm started to stretch and swell out a bit, while being surrounded with a few veins. You can't seem to keep your eyes off the sight of his arm. \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glancing back at you. He could surely tell you were impressed with what you saw. Morgan smirks, and then snaps a finger in front of your face, snapping you out of your funk. \"Hey. I think that arm's dry enough. You should move on to the other one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!\" You slap yourself. \"Yeah, sure!\" You walk on your knees to the other side of Morgan's body. Morgan then raised up his right arm, which looked wet, but not dripping wet. You blink your eyes once, \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk cocked his head a bit, \"Hm? What?\" He grins, \"I figured you'd be all over my arm by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan. \"...\" You glance away, \"I'm not THAT desperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grins, \"Heh.\" The hawk gives his right arm a flex, right in front of you. Your eyes lock straight on to the 5-inch peak. Morgan began slowly pumping his arm up and down, letting you watch his bicep flex down and raise down, as well as watching his tricep tighten up and lower down. Morgan smiles, \"Hee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cleary able to see what was going on. \"...</span></div></div>",

You hold your breath a little, just turning your head to look into his eyes, the slightest twinkle in them as he holds you. \u201cOh, who am I kidding. C'mere!\u201d You grin and just reach forward, one hand pressing onto his arm and the other pulling his body in close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towel presses on him for a few moments before sliding onto his lap. You blush slightly as your hand makes contact with his body, but he doesn't argue. You try to press a little more firmly, surprised at how firm and hard he feels as he flexes. He gives off a quiet laugh, his beak softly pressing in against your cheek as you grab at him. \u201cThought you'd like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you were the one teasing... You shouldn't be surprised when it works!\u201d You grin and slide your hands down against his arms, holding his waist firmly. Your eyes gaze down his bare body, your chest pressed to his, your arms holding down his sides, and your body warm as it presses in against his now-dry body. It feels like he's still flexing, every inch of his body pumped from his exercise and rubbing up against you. You shift around a little, trying not to get too excited from the feeling of his body with yours. However, you can't help but enjoy the feeling, your fingers pressing through his feathers and working in against his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink I'm dry now...\u201d He grins as his beak presses up, nudging against your nose. You nuzzle back softly, nodding and mumbling. For once in your life, you're unable to find the right words. You just hold tight against Morgan while you relax, happy to be pressing in against him. Your hands keep sliding against his body, taking the chance to feel over every inch of him that you can reach. His hands aren't exactly steady either, and you can feel him pressing down over your back, just trying to keep you held tight. His arms are wrapped over your body, and your skin shifts and rubs against his feathers as you keep squeezing one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...\u201d You manage to speak a little in the middle of it all, your hands pressing more against his shoulders and wrapping around his neck. He turns his head back up, looking into your eyes as he holds you. Without another word, you press your mouth on firmly to his cheek, a long kiss lingering against his reddening face as you hold to him. It takes a moment before you breath apart, smiling softly and turning away. \u201cMmm... Hehe... I'd do more, but I'm not sure how well a bird can really kiss...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan scoffs for a moment, but just shakes his head, the hint of a smile still on his face as he holds you. \u201cReally... You can't even give up joking right now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile before leaning in again, placing another kiss lightly on the top of his beak. \u201cHey, I gave it up long enough to get this far with you... I'm glad that we were able to talk this much, but you wouldn't like me if I shut up that easily, would you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs before just moving forward, pressing his hands onto you. You give a small grunt as you feel him pressing you onto your back, his body on top of yours as he noogies into your head. \u201cDoesn't mean I'm not gonna make you pay for it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck! I give, I give!\u201d The two of you are laughing when he finally lets go, his smile wide and relaxed as he stands up. You just stare at him as he does, the sun shining bright against his body. You take a good look, the view of his body wondrous. However, your stare eventually breaks when you hear his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllen? You... You okay?\u201d Morgan's clearly blushing now. You're not sure exactly how long you've been staring, but you give a firm little nod before responding. You pick yourself up while you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah... I'm fine. Just thinking a bit...\u201d You hold your breath a little, blinking a few times. You're a little off from all of the excitement, but as you get up, you're able to respond in a relaxed voice again. \u201cIt's just...\u201d You pause before placing your arm on Morgan's shoulder. </span></div></div>",

Hey, you can't just go and randomly start feeling muscles on my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly take you hand off, \"Oh! Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to lower you hand, but Morgan quickly grabs ahold of it. Morgan smiles. \"Unless, you let me do it for you.\" Morgan slowly brings your hand in onto his pumped chest, making your cheeks redden once again. Upon shifting your hand around his chest, he would flex his pecs wherever your hand was currently rubbing. \"Heh. I used to always work out at least two hours a day.\" Morgan slowly started to shift your hand from his chest down to his rock-hard abs. At least that's how they felt to you once he started tensing them up. \"But what you said, I've always been a pretty big guy.\", he said with a smile. \"I'm probably just pumped from exercising earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak softly, \"I'm talking about since I found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan opens his eyes, \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, when I found you, you were pretty beat-up. Aside from that though, you had a pretty good amount of muscle on you.\" You look up at Morgan. You then start skimming down his still pumped body, \"Now, every part of you is pumped. It's like...it's like you gained more muscle in a matter of minutes. I don't, I don't know if it has to do with whatever they injected you with...but I'd be okay with it.\" You seem to be adrift, still talking outloud but not realizing it. \"Your chest seems to have expanded out a bit. Your pecs look so...plump. Like they can squish a brick with little effort. Feeling your abs...\", Morgan still hand your hand against his abs, \"...they practically feel like steel when tensed, but soft and firm when relaxed. I wouldn't mind sleeping on them if you'd let me. ...And your arms...god, where do I even begin? Your broad rippling shoulders...they really can make the muscles on your neck show a lot. Your softball-shaped biceps and magnificent triceps...I can imagine you lifting twice your weight with those things. As for your forearms...they suit your muscular arms just fine. In fact, I, wouldn't mind receiving a bearhug from you.\" You slowly reach with your unheld hand down on to Morgan's crotch, firmly cupping the small bulge in Morgan's shorts, \"And of course... who would forget about... !!\" Your eyes quickly open wide. The first thing you notice is you hand still caressing Morgan's crotch. You tilt your head up to look at Morgan, who was looking back at you with his cheeks blushing a bit red and with a fairly surprised look on his face. Your mouth opened wide. \"Ah... Ah... Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan said calmly, \"Uhhh, Allen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a dream, right!? I was just dreaming for the past minute? Right? Right!?\", you say panickingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was about to say, \"Uhhh actuallyyy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt, \"I-I'm sorry! I-I completely lost touch with reality! I didn't know what came over me!\" You start to tear up a little, \"Nng...I hope I didn't take it too far--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly places a feathery finger on your lips, shutting you up. \"Shhh... It's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen once again, \"!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan holds up your hand, placing his other hand on the back of your palm. He grins, \"Heh. Just go ahead.

What exactly do you mean?\u201d You blush a little as you feel him that close against you.

Kind of hard to describe. How can I put it... I feel good.\u201d He grins and turns your head a little, his arm pulling up in front of you and flexing again. Your feel his other hand letting go of your mouth to take your hand again, bringing it up to his arm. You grip a little more, mouthing a few words as you watch him flex. \u201cLike... Like my body's pumping out when I hear you talk about it. Like the attention and the rubs are filling me with strength. Like you're asking me to get bigger... And my body's responding to you...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep mouthing a little before you're able to speak again. However, when you do, you grin wide, letting your hand squeeze his arm. \u201cNo need to find an excuse, big guy... I know you like the attention...\u201d You turn and give his cheek a gentle kiss before your eyes return to his arm. \u201cI like doing it, too... Being able to feel that bulging mass under your feathers.. To grasp that powerful, thick arm as you hold it out for me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm... That's it...\u201d You hear a small moan coming from Morgan as he holds it. You blink a couple of times, but now, you're certain of it. Morgan's not moving, and he's trying to hold absolutely still while you feel him. But despite that, you can feel his arm shifting, getting harder and firmer against your grip while he holds his flex. You grin as you notice it, and he nods a little as he presses into you. \u201cGo on...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're embarrassed to speak. This time, your mind is still in complete control when you open your mouth. You realize just what you must sound like. But despite your hesitation, you don't have a problem with speaking again as your hand moves up from Morgan's bicep. \u201cYour thick shoulders... Built to help you lift and shrug off a massive load... Going on against your thick back... Might as well be wings, with how much they spread out against your body...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands move as you speak, feeling over every inch of him as you talk about it. Morgan's moaning out louder now, and you can clearly his body shifting and pumping out, larger and thicker than it was a few moments ago. You can't help big grin, and from the sounds of his moaning, he's enjoying the entire thing as well. You use the opportunity to reach down, sliding your hands down his back, even giving his rear a slight squeeze. \u201cEven this is nice and firm... Tight enough that I could squeeze all day and it wouldn't budge an inch...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands move down, your head sliding down into his pecs as you do. \u201cAnd these... Thick enough to push out... You could probably bench press enough to put most wolves to shame...\u201d You can't resist giving one of them a kiss as you move your head down, feeling it quiver and tense in delight when you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour abs are each so cut... Like a brick wall here... Bet I could get my fingers in between them...\u201d You press down, one of your hands sliding up, feeling over each bit of it, digging in between to let your fingertips move against the individual pieces of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven your legs... Just holding up so much while you walk... And I'd bet they'd be even thicker if you tried to make them move... You'd be able to break a tree if you gave it a knock with one of these...\u201d You grunt as your fingertips move down his sides. You're grinning wide now, your blush deeper than it's ever been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on your knees, blushing as you look up at him. You're hanging right in front of his trunks now, the bulge clear again. You hesitate as you kneel there, your eyes swapping between the tempting bulge in front of you and between his moaning, ecstatic expression. He pauses for a while, but he finally gives you a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd... And this... Even hidden under those boxers of yours, I can see it... The length you're packing in there... Bet it'll be even more when you get hard... More than enough to... To start thrusting at my throat, or... Or to fill my...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you're reaching forward and even pressing your hands on his boxers now, you can't bring yourself to finish saying it. You're blushing deep at the thought, and you can't help but feel a slight stirring in your loins. From the twitch you see in front of you, it's clear that Morgan's likes the idea as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-allen..\u201d His voice is shaky, but clearly excited now. You feel his arm reach down, surprising you as he lifts you up in his hands, his arms now wrapped around yours. He's hugging you in tight, your shaft and his both rubbing up against your bodies as he does...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I go too far again? W-was it...\u201d Your worries are swept away when you feel his beak pressing on your lips the best he's able to manage it. He's not able to give you a normal kiss, but the way he's pushing against you, his beak sliding in and pressing as much as he's able. Despite your worries, the feeling is incredibly gentle. He's able to twist and move in ways you had never anticipated, and your lips are pressing against his beak as he holds you in tight. His arms are firm around you, tense and pushing as he squeezes you in. \u201cMmmmph...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss eventually breaks, the two of you both grinning like goofballs when it does. He nods and lets his chest press in against you, the new strength in them clear as he easily holds you in place. \u201cWow... Just... Wow...\u201d His voice is quiet, but you can feel the barely-contained excitement in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah... That definitely worked... I mean, not like you suddenly turned into a bodybuilder or something... Well, maybe an amateur one or something. I wouldn't enter a contest yet, but... But I definitely see the difference...\u201d You blush deep as you let your hands move along him. He chuckles as he slowly lowers you to the ground, looking down on you as he nuzzles in against your cheek. Is he even taller now, too? It's difficult for you to tell with the height he already had on you, but it was possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering I would've had to work out for weeks to put on this mass, I'm certainly not going to complain. We definitely need to do this again...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah...\u201d You catch yourself growing even redder as you stare at Morgan. You force yourself to pull away, quickly turning around and looking at your bags. \u201cWell, we've been out here long enough!\u201d You're still blushing as you start moving to pick your bag up. \u201cIt's gotten a bit late now, and I don't think we'll be doing any more exploring anytime today!\u201d You're not actually sure how long the two of you have been there, and after everything that had happened, you were a little too dizzy to really check where the sun is in the sky. However, you're determined not to let your embarrassment show to easily now, and you do your best to march over to your bag, picking it up with an obviously excessive motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... Allen?\u201d Morgan's voice is as calm as he can keep it, and you pause when you hear it. Taking a breath, you slowly turn back to him, hoping you're looking less nervous than you feel. You smile again, pausing as you see him still examining his body, posing and flexing and testing it. It does nothing to make you feel relaxed, but you can't help but keep grinning as you watch. The view of his full body is nothing short of breathtaking to you, and you catch yourself staring for a moment before you're able to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah? Everything okay, Morgan?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, everything's fine. Well, better than fine. I... I just wanted...\u201d He steps closer, your breathing quickening as you see him. You could swear you could almost feel the warmth coming from his body as he stood so close to you. You can barely hear his words when he speaks,  but you know that you face isn't helping to hide your feelings about the idea when he suggests it. </span></div></div>",

I told you it's not necessary.\", you say with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinks, a little saddened, \"...\" He then grins, \"Heh. Alright.\" Morgan sets his hands on your shoulders and says with a smile, \"Alright. How 'bout I put it this way. I WILL, be carrying you home. And you WILL oblige.\" You can tell Morgan was being much more insistent this time. You were about to say something, but you felt Morgan's palms tensing up a little as he still held your shoulders. You then noticed both of Morgan's still pumped arms tensing out just like before. \"You will NOT have any say in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan...\" Your attention suddenly changes to Morgan's pecs, which he tensed up and bounced once in order to keep you quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will let me do this...\", Morgan brings you in for a soft bearhug, making all the muscles on his upper body tense up a flex a bit for a moment, \"...or I will smother you with these powerful muscles into submission.\" Morgan lets you loose, his hands still on your shoulders, \"Of course, the choice is yours.\", he says with a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment, and then say, \"Quite the demanding one, aren't we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighs, and then shrugs his shoulders, \"Alright. You asked for it.\" Morgan brought you in once again for a real bearhug, making all the muscles on his upper body tense up again. It wasn't a big bearhug, but it was definitely harder than the one he warned you about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already falling under the pressure of his bulging muscles, \"Gah! Okay! Okay! I give!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan relaxes his muscles a little, and then he rubs his beak against your right cheek, \"Heh. I knew you'd let me sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a small booming sound was heard. Morgan let go of you as you both turned your attention towards the top of the cliff. Morgan walks up a couple feet to use his hawk eyes on the edge of the cliff, which he spotted a small plume of smoking emitting up top. \"What the hell was that?\", you ask. Suddenly, a second much stronger explosion emitted, causing a large chunk of the cliff to be blown off. The large chunk on the other hand, was blown right in your guys' direction. You were too frozen to even make a move. You muttered under your breath, \"...Morgan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan heard you, turning back at you to see you in your frozen state, and then turned back towards the chunk of rock, opening his arms wide. Morgan braces for impact by lowering his head and closing his eyes shut, \"Alleeen!!\" The chunk soon makes contact with Morgan's body, dragging Morgan back, but only a few feet from where you stood. \"Gaugh!!\" Something sparked inside of Morgan, which made him raise his head up, and caused the pupils in his eyes to light up. Morgan let out a loud roar, and then all the muscles on Morgan's body began to explode right out: Morgan's chest abs, his upper and lower back, Morgan's left arm, and then his right, his left leg, and the last being his right. You couldn't believe what you were seeing. Sure it's still your friend, but he's practically a hulking bodybuilding with muscles rippling and pulsating all over. Morgan suddenly lets out another roar at the top of his voice. He thrusts his left arm back, making all the muscles flex and tighten around it as he curled his hand into a fist, and then he swings his arm hard against the chunk of rock dead center. The impact from his fist caused hundreds of cracks to form around the chunk, until it broke apart into a couple of pieces. The remnants of the boulder fell into the water, leaving Morgan to with his fist still and the air and breathing a little heavily. You were really astounded by Morgan's current look. So astounded you couldn't help but look up and down Morgan's half-hulk-like body, skimming every inch of his body. Morgan finally spoke, \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch, \"!\" You run up to Morgan, \"Morgan! You okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turned around. He had his arms up as he looked at them. His eyes were also back to normal. \"Uhhh...I think so.\" Once Morgan turned around, you were in view of Morgan's pro-bodybuilder-like body. Each muscle was so pumped and veiny it was too much for you to take it. Your nose started to bleed out, causing you to be thrown back towards the ground. \"!! Allen!\" Morgan ran over to your side, picking you up in his titan-like arms. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were swirls, as you muttered half-awake, \"Uhhhngh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems our theory is correct once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan wondered where that comment came from, \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who said that came out from behind a patch of pine trees and bushes. It turned out to be the raccoon from earlier. \"Hey Morg. How's it been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gets up, helping you up as well. \"Oh. Vince. It's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vince?\" You look at Morgan, \"Who he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's one of the guys who helped me and the others back at the lab.\", Morgan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just me. I brought the whole gang along too.\" Vince turned around, \"Hey, you guys didn't get lost did ya?\" Four others entered from out of the bushed in a matter of seconds. \"Just thought I might as well introduce you to them all.\" The first is a red and white furred female fox with a well-toned build. She has long black hair and is wearing a red top and a light-brown skirt. \"This is Sylva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Nice to meet ya two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is a black furred goat, wearing a black shirt and light-blue jeans. He also has a pair of brown horns on his head and has a lean muscular build. \"This guy is Renji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji just raises a hand, \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is a brown and white feathered owl, wearing a green hooded jacked and black pants. He has a slim build. \"This is Kyle. He's actually the smart guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle glances a little angrily at Vince, \"You mentioning that because of my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last is a lizard, wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans. He had a lean build as well, but was a little buffer than Renji. \"Lastly is this guy. His name's Steffon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteffon just hums as his arms remained crossed and kept to himself. \"Mm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan just stare at the group for a moment, then you say, \"Uh... You guys look...casual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We're not very big on suits and stuff like that.\", Sylva explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Morgan asks, \"You said you testing a theory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Kyle explains, \"We just wanted to know if that serum they injected you guys with is some sort of muscle enhancement serum. So we planted a small bomb on the edge of that cliff so that when it explodes, it would hurdle towards you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji felt a little uneasy, \"Uh, Kyle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan interrupts, \"So I see! So, who's idea was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle points at Vince, \"It was Vince's idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince froze a little, \"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly grabs Vince by his shirt and carries him up to his face, \"Ya nearly killed us ya jackass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...least you're still alive.\", Vince said worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all.\", Kyle explains. \"It also just noticed that when you talk about one's size and/or masculinity, it causes your muscles to grow on their own as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteffon interrupts, \"Uh, Kyle. I think they would've got that on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Just' noticed?\", Morgan asks. He then glares even more angrily than before at Vince, \"So, exactly how long have you guys been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince grew even more afraid, \"Uh...a couple minutes...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly place a hand on Morgan's titanic back, which caught Morgan by surprise. Morgan looks at you, seeing you grin. \"It's okay Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighs, and then puts Vince down. \"Okay. Just keep this to yourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, we got it!\", Vince assures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have one question.\", Morgan says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is?\", Vince asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I...gonna stay like this forever?\", Morgan asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\", Vince plainly says. \"From what we saw with the others, you'll remain like this for a couple more minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I see. And the othes. They're doing okay?\", Morgan asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you'd only ask one question, but yes. They're doing just fine.\", Vince reassures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylva interrupts, \"Uh, guys. We gotta get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\", Vince says. Steffon, Renji, Kyle and Sylva speed off into the bushes. \"I'd take ya to see 'em, but now's not a good time. You still got my card, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We'll keep in touch. See ya.\", Vince says as he speeds off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighs heavily. \"Great. Just when I thought it was gonna be just us too. They had to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance up at Morgan, and then grin. \"Heh. I still think they're pretty cool.\" You walk over to your bags, \"Well, 'bout we start heading back as well. I'll go get the bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast!\", Morgan yells. You look back him. \"You've still got an obligation to fulfill.\" Morgan flexes all the muscles on his upper body downward, making each muscle swell out even more than before, \"Unless you want me to smother you with this hulking and rippling body.\", he says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twinge a little, \"Oh...yeah.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cRight, right... Let's get this over with, then.\u201d You're digging through one of the bags for your shirt, just tossing it on as quickly as you can. You can feel Morgan's eyes on you as you shuffle and try to pull your pants on next. In the next instant, you're holding both of the bags, and it only takes Morgan one long stride before he easily hauls you up, one massive hand picking you up and holding you securely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. You sure dress fast, little guy. I'd put my clothes on, but I don't think anything I've got will fit anymore.\u201d He grins and lets his body push out, flexing to emphasize the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mumble a little bit, nodding back at him as you can't resist looking down. \u201cY-yeah... I'm pretty sure that if were wearing your shirt, you would've tore it off. And... And I think that your shorts are barely hiding your... Your bulge by now by now... If you give a flex or... or you... or you get turned on, you're gonna burst out of those.\u201d You're trying to avoid his gaze, but another deep laugh forces your attention back up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw... The way you say it, I'd almost think you <i>wouldn't</i> enjoy watching me hulk right out of my shorts!\u201d Your blush only grows deeper as he grins, his beak pressing against your forehead as he leans in. \u201cOh, don't worry. You'll probably get a chance to see it later. For now, we'd better be heading back.\u201d You yelp as you feel his hand lightly shifting, throwing you up against his arm. You start to protest, but Morgan silences you quickly. \u201cDon't worry, you're as light as a feather now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only mumble a small response, blushing even deeper as he easily holds you in his hand. His steps are long and powerful, easily pushing through the brush as he walks. A set of clear prints are left in the dirt as he moves, his heavy body shifting and wading through the trees as he walks. \u201cW-wow... Hey, Morgan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d His head turns towards you, grinning wider than you thought possible as he moves. He pauses a little, and you shake your head a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, no, you don't have to stop walking, you know... I mean, you want to get as much out of your current strength you can? If it's gonna wear off, then let's have a decent time with it first...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... Right...\u201d Morgan seems a little crestfallen at the idea, but he resumes walking. His pace is a little slower, and his other hand is easily pushing through the trees, a little more careless as it knocks branches aside, breaking and tugging at some of the flora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Morgan, c'mon. No need to be so down. I'm pretty sure a few minutes of being a massive hulking strongman is more than enough to do anything you'd need to. I don't think it'd take you that long to rearrange my furniture or dig out space for a basement or something.\u201d You grin rather foolishly as you try to shift a little, your hand moving up to pat his back a couple of times. It takes a bit of effort for you to do so, and Morgan chuckles as he sees you straining to try to reach his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffs playfully as he looks at you, one firm finger pushing your head back. \u201cOh, so now suddenly I'm a construction worker? That all you think of me, little guy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're worried for a moment, but the slight grin on Morgan's face keeps you calm as you look back at him. You reach up and give his shoulder a little squeeze as he holds you. \u201cFine, you can just cut the firewood or something.\u201d You grin as you lean in, a finger shyly rubbing up against his chest. \u201cReally, though, Morgan... Thanks for saving me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime, Allen... I'm glad I was able to...\u201d He grins as he squeezes you in a little closer, your body pressing firmly into his arm now. \u201cHonestly, if I hadn't grown... What were those guys thinking, dropping a rock on us like that... They must be crazy...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan, actually... I was thinking. You just hulked out because you were in danger, right? And they said it would only last a few minutes or so?\u201d You're a little concerned about him when you try to move, your arms now wrapping against his chest the best you can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it's kind of hard to forget.\u201d You feel his pec bounce up against your fingers, making you lean forward to grip and feel it. \u201cWish I could keep this for longer. This size is awesome and all, but if I can only stay like this for a few minutes at a time... Well, I was kind of hoping for something a bit more permanent.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... Kind of hard to really train your strength if you're only giving a hundred percent when you're in peril, huh?\u201d You can't help but blush as you feel his arm shifting, letting you almost lean back against the thick mass. The bulge of his massive bicep pushes up against your shirt, and you could swear you're able to feel the definition of it against our back. His other hand moves, wrapping gently around you and trying to cover your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's just hope we're not in constant danger. If I need to put you at risk to stay this big... Well, that's one thing I could do without. I mean, they might've meant well and all, but I still think I should've at least given Vince a smack for spying on us and chucking a boulder at us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and turn your head a little, letting it lay and press up against his chest. \u201cJust try not to take anybody's head off when you do.\u201d You shake your head a little, a bit of a cocky smile on his face as he gives his chest a little bounce against you. \u201cActually, I've been thinking about more than you just hulking out all the time. They said that they've seen the others grow before, but they never knew that talking about your strength and masculinity would make you grow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... And?\u201d Morgan stops again, looking right at you this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think the effects of our... um... Our talk... Maybe it lasts longer or something? I mean, if they've only seen other anthros hulk out when they were in danger, then what we've done is... Is new, right? And while you'll only stay this big for a few minutes, we were swimming for way longer than that, right? Is there any chance that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat the growth from your attention is permanent?\u201d Morgan's eyes are sparking with excitement now as he looks at you, his grin wide again as he stares. \u201cI... I hope so...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're blushing and grinning as you cling tightly to him. \u201cY-yeah... I hope so, too. Tha'd be...\u201d You swallow, shivering slightly at the idea. You're uncertain of exactly what to say, but Morgan speaks before you can figure it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe... Why so embarrassed? You were quite eager to get your hands all over me before. And now we know how to... Oh...\u201d Morgan's body is shaking a little bit as you hold on against him. He quickly moves his hand, lowering you onto the ground. \u201cAllen... I think we're about to find out. I feel... A little weird...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still inches away from him as he clutches at his sides, his arms holding tight as it looks like he's feeling some pressure. You try to keep your hands on him, to comfort him throughout the process. However, as you watch, you notice that he's taking a couple of deep breaths, but he doesn't seem too distraut. The expression he had wasn't painful, only uncomfortable, as if he had something pressing in and rustling his feathers. You could see as he visibly shrunk down, the process taking longer taking almost a minute, much more gradual than his sudden growth. However, by the time it finishes, you realize...</span></div></div>",

He was back to his original size, but he was a little more pumped than he original was when you brought him in. But be that as it may, Morgan's expression clearly showed that he was not as happy with his current size. \"...\" Morgan sighs, \"I guess exercising like I did before is the only thing that helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt bad for Morgan, but then you grinned, feeling you should cheer Morgan up. You walk over to Morgan's side, patting him on the back, \"Hey, cheer up. At least not being able to grow again isn't permanent either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighs again, \"I guess. 'Yawwwn'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, \"Heh. Looks like all that commotion from earlier made you sleepy.\" You wrap your arm around Morgan's back, \"Come on. Let's head home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinks, glancing at you. \"Hm.\" All of a sudden, Morgan picks you right up with both arms, just like before. This took you by surprise. \"Huh. Well would you look at that.\", Morgan said with a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake a bit, \"Hey! Jeez! Mind givin' a fair warnin' before you do that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shrugged his shoulders, \"Eh. Still wanted to carry you back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're already here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still.\", Morgan said. He then nuzzles you on your cheek, \"Thanks for cheering me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nuzzle him back, \"Hey, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you and Morgan were back inside your cabin. It was only the afternoon, so there was plenty of sun left in the day. You were in the kitchen preparing to some ingredients for macaroni and cheese. Morgan was sitting at the table, still only in his boxers. He sat there for a moment, and then let out another long yawn. \"Boy. Catching a large rock seems to take a lot out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want any macaroni and cheese. Or, maybe a pair of pants?\", you ask politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gets up from the table. \"Nah. I think I'll just get some shut-eye. I'm not that hungry right now. And my boxers seem to be attracting a lot of attention, so I'll just stay like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a fake laugh, \"Ha ha ha ha ha. Right.\" Morgan chuckles and then walks over to the couch he slept on last night. He goes right ahead, lying on the couch on his back. You continue with the ingredients, shredding some cheddar cheese with a cheese grater. All of a sudden, you let out a short yawn. \"Oh. Great. Looks like Morgan made me tired too.\" You turn your head back towards Morgan. You can hear him snoring from where you stood, which tells you he was already fast asleep. \"Hm...\" You turn your head back to your shredded cheese, but then stopped. \"...... Eh. I'm not even that hungry anyways.\" You let out another yawn as you pet the plate of shredded cheese in the fridge. You also put the cheese grater in the sink and leave everything else as is. \"I think I'll go catch some Z's myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over towards the other couch, but then you get side-tracked by Morgan. He was still fast asleep, but you couldn't help but look over Morgan's body again. Sure it's about the same as last night, but he's not wearing any clothes this time. \"...\" You look at the empty couch to your right, and then back to Morgan to your left. Suddenly, an idea rushes into your head as you say in your thoughts, \"Maybe...I can sleep with him. I mean, I'm sure he won't mind. Maybe he'll be surprised to find me sleeping along with him, but I'm sure he'd be okay with it.\" You think about it some more, still unsure of yourself. \"Mmm... I don't know... I mean, there isn't even enough room on the couch for us to cuddle in.\" Suddenly, you notice Morgan starting to toss and turn a bit on the couch. He lastly lies on his side with his back against the lounge of the couch. You say to yourself, \"Oh. There we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing as quiet as possible, you go right ahead and lay on the couch on your side so Morgan's chest was against yours. You say to yourself again, \"Oh boy! Now I just gotta hope he doesn't toss and turn again and suffocate me, or make me fall to the floor.\" You turn your attention to Morgan's chest. You liked how his pecs were huffing in and out with each breath Morgan took. You give Morgan's pecs a soft feel, enough to not wake him up. You also say in a soft and low voice, \"Heh. It never ceases to amaze me every time I give your muscles a good feel. Your pecs feel great. So soft...so firm... Enough to flatten a metal rod if you wanted to.\" All of a sudden, Morgan lets out a slight moan. Upon staring at his chest, you were able to see Morgan's pectorals start to bulge and ripple out a bit. Just like before! \"! No way...\" You look up at Morgan, who was still sound asleep. You look back down at his pumped pecs, cupping them with your hands. \"Could this be? Maybe another way to increase Morgan's muscle mass?\"</span></div></div>",

Was grabbing him in his sleep another way of growing him? Or maybe he just heard you talking in his sleep? That might cause it, right? You weren't sure which it is, but if you can grow him while he's asleep, then you probably should test it while there's still a chance. It's still the middle of the day, and there's no telling when he might wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, you're a little bit more eager than you should be at the idea. You're not sure whether you really want to figure out how you can get Morgan to grow, or if you're just fond of the idea of having him bigger, feeling him pushing out and getting stronger right there in your arms. However, your reasoning is halfway gone by the time your hands move against his shoulders, starting to rub and gently squeeze at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're silent this time, just letting your grip tighten and move along his shoulders. However, it only takes a few seconds of rubbing him before you get a response. You can feel his shoulders shifting outwards, one of his arms pushing a little more into the couch as the other moves upwards. \u201cW-wow...\u201d You pull him in a little closer, his body shifting gently against you as your arms rest against his. You hug him in, your hands resting on his arms as you hold him. It only takes a few moments before his biceps start to push out, a curl starting to become clearer on them. You blush as you pull him a little closer, the front of your body softly presses against his, pulling him tighter. The details might be slipping you, but at least now, you're growing certain. If Morgan's asleep, then you can make him grow with your touch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel more him swelling out softly against you. His pecs are now pressing in against your shirt, and he's starting to move, his abs now bumping against your shirt and pushing down into your body. A few soft motions later, and shirt is dragged up to your chest. You can't resist making a small sound as your body presses in against his feathers. He unconsciously moves, making you gasp suddenly as you feel a couple of growing arms suddenly grasping you and wrapping around your back, holding you tight. A smile makes its way to his face. Either he's enjoying the growth, or he's dreaming. And if he's dreaming, then he's certainly enjoying his dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're thankful that he's asleep, because if he wasn't, he would see exactly how red your face has gotten. As you shuffle a little, your hands slide against his back. You feel his body hardening and spreading, pushing back against your hands. His sides are still spreading outwards, sliding your arms around as you gently hug him. His beak rubs against your head, his neck pressing a bit against your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs softly rub sideways against his as he curls up a little, his knees pressed up for a moment before finding their way between your legs. You're a little nervous as you feel him nudge forwards, but you can't do a thing. You blush as you feel his bare legs finding their way to the parts of yours that weren't covered. It's only a few moments before his legs thicken, shifting lower and longer as he holds in against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-morgan...\u201d Your voice as quiet as you speak, but you can't resist whispering to him as you feel him this close to you. His growth isn't quick, but it's steady and warm, and you could feel his growing strength as he holds you closer and closer, your head now forced in against his chest. You even whimper as you feel his shorts sliding against your clothing. You have to hope that they don't slip... Or perhaps you're hoping that they do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow... Y-you're looking amazing...\u201d You're whispering softly, your breathing a littler harder than it should be as you hold him, and you feel him hold you. He's only growing thicker as the seconds turn into minutes, but you're contented to watch and feel him grow. Nearly his entire body is swelling now, pressing back against yours, close enough that you could feel the rise and fall of his chest with every breath, and you could swear you could feel the firm, steady thumping of his heartbeat. Ten or fifteen minutes must pass by, but the entire time, you're just staring and holding tight, an embarrassed grin on your face as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're only snapped from your stupor when you feel Morgan moving again. His legs straighten out, stretching and now hanging out from the bottom of the bed. He hasn't grown anywhere close to hulk-like, but he had certainly grown enough for there to be a clear, visible difference. There's very little room left for you on the couch, and if he let go, you would probably fall to the ground. You let off a nervous murmur, half-prepared to catch yourself as you let go. And from the slight shifting of his body, you can tell that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Morgan's eyelids slowly perk up. The first thing he sees, you. Your face right in front of his. \"?\" Morgan opened his eyes fully, blinking a few times and making sure it's really you and not a dream. \"...Allen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was lie there. Mainly because he was still holding you in his arms. You let out a little smile, \"Uh...hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lowered his eyebrows, looking pretty angry with you, \"Hrm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really unsure of what to say at this point. \"Uh...I...I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Morgan smirks at you. \"So, were you hungry for something else?\" You froze, wide-eyed and cheeks blushing at Morgan's remark. Morgan bursts out laughing. He sits up on the couch, sitting you up beside him as well. Morgan still continues to laugh a bit more as a tear rolled down his cheek. Morgan wiped it off, \"It's so easy to get to you now. It's hilarious!\" You just sit there, cheeks still showing red. \"You know, I had a weird dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise up from the couch in surprise. \"! Y-you don't say!\" Morgan stared at you. You stare back at him, putting your hands behind your back. \"Uh, what, what makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan explains, \"I'm not sure exactly, but it was a good dream!\" Your eyes widen a little. \"I mean, it was as if...I was working out while I was asleep. I was, I was able to feel my muscles, being worked to the core. And it felt great. All the muscles in my body...expanding...pumping out...blood pulsating through my veins... It was from head...\", Morgan felt his thighs with his hands, \"...to toe. !\" Morgan looked down to his legs. He realizes how much bigger and firmer they have gotten. He looked at his left arm. He raised it up, giving his bicep a simple flex. He was also able to notice the difference from before and now. Morgan then looked down at his chest. He rubs his abs with one hand, feeling how much tighter they have gotten. He then caresses his chest with both hands, tensing his pecs a few times to feel how much they've enlarged. Morgan turns his attention towards you, \"Allen...did you, have something to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang your head down a bit. You could lie to Morgan, but you didn't have the heart to do it. Besides, he'd probably be happy to hear about it. You raise your head up, \"Uh, about that... ... I...found out another way to make you grow.\" Morgan perked his head up a bit. \"Apparently I can, pump you up, while you sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Morgan with you head hanging down a little and cheeks still showing a little red. Morgan looks at his legs, He flexed his right leg, watching his thighs pump up and clump together, and then felt said muscles with his right hand. He looks back at you. \"Huh... You're just itchin' to touch me any chance you've got, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!\" You turn your head away, trying not to show Morgan how much redder you face has gotten. \"Well, I...uh...\" You glance at Morgan. He had a pretty serious look on his face, but suddenly, you see him start on smirk on one side of his beak. He lets out a chuckle, and that's when you realize Morgan is just messing with you again. You cover your face with you left hand, \"Ugh... Knock it off! !!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Morgan was standing right behind you. He wraps his still pumped arms around your chest and leans his beak in against your right ear, saying with a warm smile, \"Hey, I just happen to take after you.\" Morgan looks out the window. He had only been asleep for a couple minutes, and the sun was still glaring brightly. Morgan looks back down to you, \"How 'bout we do something together?\"</span></div></div>",

You can feel me if you want...\" Morgan's grin is wider than you can ever remember seeing it, and with his arms pressing against you and his beak brushing against you, you can't help but shift and blush deeper. Part of you tries to look away, but it's impossible for your eyes to avoid seeing him at this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you sure that you don't just want me to be complementing you and getting you bigger? Because you're sure liking the idea of... Of showing off your pump, and keeping me in held tightly in your strong, thick arms...\" Your face is impossibly red, but you're unable to keep Morgan from seeing it. His arms are swelling again against you as you speak, and you can hear a quiet, satisfied murmur as he notices the feeling as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins and lifts you off of your feet, your head resting against his shoulder as he holds you easily. \"But you're the one who really wants to get your hands all over this strong, sexy stud... I'm just here to pose...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and I'm just stick here because a little birdie decided to swoop in.\" You roll your eyes, your hands pressing back against Morgan's neck as you hold on tight. \"Just admit it, Morgan... You like this just as much as I do... You like feeling my hands all over your cut, defined body... Letting them grab over every inch of you... Letting my words fill you with strength... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft moan from Morgan confirms it for you. You grin as his arms loose, your body brushing against it as your feel reach the floor again. You give his cheek another slight kiss, refusing to let your eyes off of him as he moves. With a soft, playful growl, he smiles and lets his arms move from around you, one thick, swelling bicep held in front of you. \"Alright... I like getting stronger... And I <i>really</i> like you being the one to pump me up. Go on... This body's here just for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow, reaching your hands forward to grasp his swelling bicep. You can't even make him budge an inch, and even with both of your hands, it's a bit difficult to completely surround it. \"Oh? This is just for me? That thick bicep... You could probably toss me around like a pillow with it.\" You swallow a little at the idea, feeling it bulge out further in your grip. He's flexing his arm harder and harder, your grip on it soon loosening as he swells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... That's the ticket, Allen... Keep going...\" Morgan moves slowly, shifting his weight a little. You're a little worried that he's going to lift you up. However, he's simply sliding your hand along, his wide shoulders now under your grip. The slightest hint of a blush is on his face now as he changes his pose, bringing his arms down in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those shoulders... Gonna be wider than my door soon enough.. You could probably knock out the frame if you shrugged, too...\" Your hands keep moving down over his body as he lifts an arm, spreading his lats out for you to reach out and touch. These lats... So spread out and so thick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, yeah... Just like that...\" His arms keep moving and shifting, wrapping around you again, his pecs inches from your face as he gives them a firm bounce. \"And what about these?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmph...\" You lean forward, giving one a slight kiss. Allen's grin grows wider as he feels it, and your hands have to struggle to sneak in under his firm hug as you try to feel them. \u201cHehe... Massive pecs... Bulging out so far...\u201d You feel them moving against you as he keeps pressing them up, before feeling him bend forwards, your hands sliding down against his abs. \u201cAnd each of these... Cut and shredded like crazy...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll want to take a step back now...\u201d An eager growl is coming from Allen's throat, interrupting your thoughts. You blush a little and wonder what he's about to do, but you follow his instructions, stepping backwards. You have his full body in view this time as he flexes <i>everything</i>, every inch of him him bulging out and pumping further. The mass he had gained clearly put him past any amateur bodybuilder, and it looked as though he could've given plenty of professions a run for their money. You only manage to gape at him for a few moments before he speaks again. \u201cGo on... What part of me do you want to feel?\u201d You reach forwards slowly, uncertain what you could grip, his voice soft as his head hangs close to your ear. \u201cCome on... Get your hands on me and worship your muscle master...\u201d He grins and tauntingly raises his eyebrows a couple of times, trying to tempt you... before he ends up bursting into a fit of laughter. It takes you a moment to realize what he's doing now, but when you do, you can't help but start to laught as well. \u201cI'm sorry, I'm sorry! That just sounded so...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheesy? Yeah, no kidding!\u201d You're still blushing, but the two of you are too amused by the entire thing for him to notice anymore. It takes a minute before you calm down, but by the end of it, both of you are smiling deep and looking at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Allen. I must've sounded ridiculous. But I've never experienced anything like that before... I mean, before today...\" His blush is visible, but his grin is incredibly wide as he holds you. \"Never thought I'd like muscle worship... I mean, that's what we did, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, yeah...\" His blush might be slight, but it's noticeable. You chuckle before just holding him close, your hands no longer rubbing, but comfortable pressing in as you squeeze him. \"I'm... Not sure if I'd do that for other guys. It'd feel really... You know. It can be awkward  and stuff... Asking to just get my hands all over...\" Your blush is slowly returning, but you're smiling wide. \u201cBut... Wow... Glad that I can do it with you without feeling ridiculous. Well, too ridiculous, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you like it. And... I liked it, too. Thanks, Allen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime, Morgan.\u201d You manage another quick kiss on his cheek, your arms laying on his shoulders as he keeps you held. \u201cI have to ask, though. Are you still in the mood for more? Because I'm pretty sure that if you don't laugh, then I won't.\u201d You chuckle and keep nuzzling in as he grunts and shifts, holding you up against his body. He takes a moment before he gives you his response. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on... Let's see how big I can get!\", Morgan says with a smile. You stare at Morgan, a little surprised with his response. Morgan turned his head away a bit to look away as his cheeks began to turn a little red again, \"... I mean, I guess it would be nice to see just how...big, I can get.\" Morgan turns his head back to you, \"That wouldn't be a problem, would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You grin, \"Heh. You kidding? That'd be great to see. ...\" You looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked at you, as if you had something else on your mind, \"? Is there, something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Morgan. \"It's just, I wouldn't want you getting TOO big. Otherwise you'd probably end up destroying the only place I can call home.\" You suddenly let out a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan understood what was going, so he put on a slightly angry look at you, \"Goood! You're sucha downer, you know that?\" You begin to walk off towards the back door. \"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop upon reaching the doorknob, and then look back at Morgan. \"Care to take this outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinks his eyes at you, \"Huh? Didn't we, kinda just get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your whole body around putting your foot down, \"Okay! I really am worried about my house, okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan backed up a bit, but then laughed. He walked over to you, lowering his beak towards your head and putting a hand on your cheek, \"You never cease to amuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan were now standing at your large 'backyard'. Morgan stepped up a few feet, setting his hands on his hips and arched his upper body back to give his still-ripped chest and abs a simple stretch, \"Mmm...ah. So, what do you propose we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up beside Morgan, but your attention was on something else. Morgan looked where you were looking. It turned out to be a large oak tree. Morgan looked back at you with an eyebrow cocked up. You looked at Morgan, smiling, \"I'm actually out of firewood. You think you can help me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So that's what you had in mind, huh?\" Morgan grinned. He brought up his right arm to give it a good flex, making his bicep peak out greatly. He then patted his peak with his left hand. \"I suppose I can help you out with that.\" Morgan lowered both his arms, flexing them downwards and making the muscles ripple and tense right out on his arms, chest and back. \"Heh. So, where's your ax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You begin scratching the back of your head, \"Uh, I actually I don't have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Morgan relaxes his muscles as he sets his arm down, \"Well, then how do you normally get your firewood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold your arms as you turn your attention towards the tree again, \"By going into town and buying it there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sets his arms on his hips, \"Then what do you expect me to get firewood with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head back to Morgan. \"Heh. You just showed me.\" Morgan paused for a moment. After taking in what you said, he lowers his head and sighs. You were still staring at Morgan with that same grin on your face. \"You knew what I meant, didn't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The moment you mentioned you didn't have an ax?\" Morgan raised his head, smiling back at you, \"Yeah. I knew.\" Morgan went ahead and walked right up to the tree. Morgan turned his head back to you. He saw you staring back at him, to make sure you were watching. \"Heh.\" He turned his attention towards the tree, and then brought his arms out and bent them back. \"Well, here's to growin' big.\" Morgan went and grabbed a firm hold of the tree with his large hands. Morgan immediately tensed out all the muscles on his arms, making them ripple out with definition and strength. Morgan then used his back, tensing up his back muscles enough to make all the muscles tighten out as well. The roots of the tree were starting to shake, but it wasn't enough for the tree to be pulled out. \"I'm not done yet!\" Morgan flexed out all the muscles in his legs, making his thighs and calves pump out impressively. Morgan continued on for a few seconds and then arched his back back, using the flexed muscles in his chest and abdomen and abs to aid as well. All of a sudden, his pecs and abs were twitching a bit, but then pumped right out of body, \"Aurgh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run over to Morgan's side. \"Dude, you okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You kidding me?\" You look up at Morgan, who was staring down at you, \"This feels great!\" Morgan growled as he proceeded on with said tree. You look down at Morgan's legs, which were starting to pump up as well. A couple veins that already surrounded his lower body started to spread more, and then his legs immediately filled with more muscle and definition. Morgan's boxers were also being stretched once again. \"Hey.\" You looked up at Morgan. \"Feast your eyes on these guns.\" Morgan growled as he arched his body forward so he was mainly using his arms, which were starting to swell out nicely. Once his arms filled up with more muscle, the tree's roots couldn't handle much more of Morgan's mighty strength, and then 'SNAP!' The tree's roots were pulled right out of the ground the entire tree now resting on Morgan's arms, \"Raaaugh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback a bit. 'Morgan actually did it! Of course he would, he's a fighter!', you thought to yourself. You begin staring from Morgan's large muscular neck down. His chiseled chest and abs stuck out impressively as well, as you watched his pecs huff in and out from heavily breathing. The last were his legs, which were plump and hard like tree trunks. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\", Morgan said, breaking your concentration. Morgan sets the tree down between the two of you, causing the ground to rattle a bit. Morgan held up his arms, and then clenched his fists, tensing the muscles in his arms a bit, \"Incredible! I betcha I could actually become as big as this in a matter of seconds if I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we take things slow.\" Morgan looks at you, noticing the red that was starting to show on your cheeks. Morgan was big again, but not as big as when you hulked out from that rock. You point down at the tree, \"Uh, firewood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" He closes his eyes, \"Oh, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the sun was now just above the mountain, which showed that sunset was nearing soon. A pile of wood that was chopped up by Morgan lay against the patio. Morgan was just about to chop the last piece of wood in half, throwing his hand down like a knife right through the middle and cut it in half. Morgan wiped up some sweat from his forehead, \"Phew. That's finally taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were standing beside Morgan the entire time. You grab Morgan's hand with your hand. \"Thanks Morgan. I really couldn't have done it without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked down towards you. He kneels down on one knee, giving his grabbed arm a flex as well, \"The viewing pleasure is all mine.\", he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan stared at each other for a while, staring into each other's eyes. After staring and smiling for a short time, you finally speak, \"Shall we, continue this inside?\"</span></div></div>",

You gasp a little, but know better than to try to argue at the moment. Instead, you just give a chuckle and nod up towards him, feeling his thick arms wrapped firmly around your chest and against your underarms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry, big guy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit. And a little sleepy, and I think I've got this weird itch on my sides. But, overall? I'm definitely not complaining.\u201d Morgan grins as he walks towards the door again, pausing a little as he feels your fingers scratching against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I think I can take care of those. Food's easy enough, and scratching's not too hard. As for sleep...\u201d You blush a little awkwardly when you think about it, but shake it off. You're grinning again as he approaches, but speak as he gets to your back door. \u201cYou'd better let me take care of the door. Don't want it ripped off the hinges or something.\u201d You chuckle a little as you feel his arms shift ever so slightly, and hear him huff before he loosens his grip so you can turn away from him, your body still in his arms as you lean out to reach for the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my fault that you really need bigger doorways and stronger doors.\u201d He grins, having to move and bend a little awkwardly to try to make it through. He lightly carries you to the kitchen, stopping by the fridge. \u201cYou were cooking when I feel asleep, right? You left your food in here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You give the fridge door a tug. It's a bit of a struggle to reach the shelf you left the cheese on, and it takes a few moments to grab it. Morgan's watching with an amused look on his face, and you just roll your eyes before turning your head back to him. \u201cYou know, it's going to be <i>really</i> tough to cook if you're holding me like this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. All you have to do is tell me where you want to go.\u201d Morgan's got a goofy grin as he shifts his arms a little, letting them pull you a little higher. \u201cI'm careful, I can hold you steady enough. You can think of me as your assistant, if you like.\u201d He nudges down against your neck a little, forcing you to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get the saucepan, then. I'm pretty sure you'll end up denting my pots if you try to handle them right now.\u201d You hear him chuckle and flex his arms a little against you, but you just roll your eyes as his chest bumps against your back. \u201cBesides, after last time, I'm thinking you might want a bit more practice cooking before you do anything remotely complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, come on.

Because I'm pretty sure your mind's going to be off again the moment I do something like...\u201d You grin and lightly place your free hand on his arm, giving it a slight rub. \u201cSay that you've got bigger, stronger arms than I've ever seen before...\u201d You hear a slight rumbling from behind you, and you can't help but laugh out as you turn to him. His arms feel like they're pushing out a little, and you can swear you hear a small moan. He blushes and fumbles a little as you give a quick nod. \u201cThat's what I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that's not playing fair!\u201d You keep grinning, a slightly flustered expression on his face as he does his best to wave one of his hands around. You move and slip right out from under the other before standing back up and looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll's fair in love and war. Though I'm not really sure which one this counts as.\u201d You keep grinning as you give him another tight squeeze, hugging him the best you can for a moment before letting go. \u201cThat settles, it, though. Dinner's my job, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine...\u201d He gives your head a ruffle with a massive hand. He's surprisingly light when his hand pushes against your head, and you smile a little when you realize how cautious he must be when he holds you. \u201cYou can cook, and I'll be your assistant, or stay out of your way, or whatever. I'm sure you'll do just fine with the meal.\u201d You smile as he just stands nearby, glancing at the plate of cheese you've placed on the countertop. You quickly fill the saucepan with water before moving to your pantry. You're trying to dig out some of the pasta when you hear his voice and notice his shadow looming from behind you, his wings even stretched out a little more to cover the light. \u201cBut in exchange...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I'm feeding you. That not enough of an exchange?\u201d You turn, but when you see him you can't help but feel a little bit of hesitation. The wicked smile on Morgan's face makes you worry. You have to pause as you just stare at it for a short while. It doesn't scare you. Despite how big he is, Morgan would have to do a lot before you're genuinely scared of him. But... it certainly worries you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it puts me in your debt again. And I want to make sure we're even. So, I'm thinking tonight, when all's said and done... \u201cWe sleep together again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin a little sheepishly as you hear the suggestion. You open your mouth to argue, but you know your face is completely red, and you're not sure what you can try to say. You had taken the initiative to sneak in with him before, and it's no good to pretend you didn't enjoy it. The ball was in Morgan's court now, and the two of you both knew it. You could probably put your foot down if you had to, but the blush growing clearer on your face and his widening smirk both made it clear that it isn't exactly your first option. Instead, you try to ask quietly, \u201cSo, do I get a choice in the matter?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you're gonna be close to me, one way or another. And from today, we both know that you're gonna like it. But sure, you'll get a choice...\u201d Morgan grins and whispers softly into your ear, a blush appearing on his face as well. \u201cYou get to choose if...\u201d You blush deeper as you hear his words, barely audible but more than enough to make you dream a little. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan backs away from your ear, his body still bent forward in front of you. You just paused for a moment, staring directly at Morgan's face which still had a grin on it. Morgan breaks the silence, \"Water's boiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" You quickly turn around, attending to the boiling pot of water. Your cheeks were still blushing red from Morgan's comment as you poured a box of macaroni into the steaming pot. You stir the macaroni in the pot for a bit with a ladle, and then cover the pan. You set the ladle on the stove and lay your hands on the rail of the oven, letting out a sigh. \"... I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" You turn around, \"You heard me, stud. I said I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan holds a hand against his chin, \"Hmm... Weird. I was half-expecting your face to become red as a tomato in situations such as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was practically all over you in just my shorts, wasn't I?\" You shrug your shoulders, \"Eh. I must be getting used to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Morgan says in his head, \"Really...?\" Morgan smirks to himself, \"Hey, I think there's something on my leg.\" Morgan points to his right thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bend down right where Morgan was pointing. \"Hm? What? I don't see anything. Other than the large amount of feathers.\" All of a sudden, tenses and flexes out the muscles in his leg all at once. This causes you flinch as you back away a bit, \"Gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiles, \"Oh. It was probably just my bulging and rippling quads.\" Morgan begins to caress his still-flexed thighs with his right hand, \"Care to give it a good feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks begin to turn red again. You turn around to attend to your cooking. \"Dammit Morgan! You want there to be food on the table or not?\" You hear Morgan laugh behind your back as you pouted. You add the cheese, milk and other ingredients to the pot and mix everything together. After mixing for a minute or two you cover the pot, turn off the stove, and let out another sigh. \"Macaroni's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\" You begin wiping your hands with a tablecloth that hung on the rail of the stove. \"Hey Allen, I think there's something on my chest now. Mind checking it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... Nice try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, you and Morgan sat at the table. Morgan was sitting across from you. Morgan already finished eating, his plate set aside on the table. You were only haflway finished, but it was starting to get hard for you to finish you meal with Morgan watching you eat. You take another forkful of macaroni and then look up at Morgan. \"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan yawned, \"Just makin' sure you eat everything on your plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haw haw. You know, you're welcome to sleep now if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan yawns again, \"It's okay. I can wait.\" Morgan gets up and our from his seat, \"Besides, there's something I gotta do before I sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan walks off as you continue eating to yourself. \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat another forkful of macaroni, but then you suddenly hear Morgan, \"1...2...3...4...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head towards Morgan. You stop chewing once you saw Morgan doing push-ups on the floor. After watching him for a moment, you finally gulp down the food in your mouth. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan does two more push-ups, and then manages to pick himself off the floor with his hands and stands straight. \"What's it look like? I'm exercisin'.\" Morgan hops back up on his feet, and then turns around to do a back double-bicep flex while kneeling down on one knee and flexing all the muscles in both his legs. \"And doing a couple poses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You feel your cheeks starting to turn red and quickly cover your face with your right hand, \"And, this is for the purpose of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was now doing a wide lat spread. He held his pose and flexed his left arm upwards, watching his large bicep swell outward as a vein showed-off on his large peak. \"Not shrinking back to normal size anytime soon.\" You couldn't help but keep your eyes on Morgan's body. You mainly kept your attention the parts that Morgan was flexing: His right bicep and tricep as he flexed his right arm upwards, his pecs as he spread them out, and his left leg as he brought it forward and flexed his thigh and calf. You take another forkful and eat it. You basically continue this two more times while keeping your eyes on Morgan's massive and plump body. Morgan interrupts you, \"Uh, Allen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch, and then look up at Morgan. \"Uh, y-yeah? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to keep you eyes on your plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, oh!\" You turn to your plate, \"Right. ...\" It turns out your plate was empty the entire time. \"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan yawns once again, \"Well, that was a nice posing session.\" Morgan walks up to you. He takes the fork from your hand and places in on the empty plate. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked pretty down, but you raise your head up smiling, \"You go ahead. I'll join you in a few minutes.\" Morgan nods his head, and then walks over to the same couch. You grab both your plates and then walk over to set them both in the sink. You quietly slap yourself upside your head, \"Stupid!\" You walk out of the kitchen and into the living room. Morgan was already lying on the usual couch. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out Morgan was already covering the entire couch. He raises his head to look at you, \"Yeah. I just noticed it too.\" Morgan sat up on the couch, \"Oh well. Guess you'll have to lie on top of me instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You start to blush a bit again. \"Of course. Heh.\" You looked at Morgan. He appeared to be keeping his eyes on your shirt, but knew the drill. \"Alright alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the bottom of your shirt, and then slowly slip it off. You toss your shirt on to the sofa and then walk over to Morgan's side. Morgan gives you a wink, \"Feel free to take your time. 'Kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan for a moment, and then lie on top of him. Morgan in turn lied on the couch. You loved the feeling of Morgan's feathers rubbing up against your skin. It was also making you feel a little ticklish, but you can get used to it. \"I'll make sure I do.\", you said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was already falling asleep, but he was able to tense his pecs a bit as you laid your head on top of his enormous pecs. \"Oh, and, one more thing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You can wake me whenever you'd like.\" Morgan mumbles a little before he leans back, his body almost completely relaxing. \"I can get by just fine on a nap... And I know I'll be waking up to something good.\" He gives a small smile before his eyes completely close. You're a little impressed by how quickly he's able to fall asleep, and you smile as you hold on against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a slight snoring coming from him as you hold on, his body lightly brushing and shifting against yours as you hold to him. You blush as you feel his chest rumbling up against his face, his abs moving out softly as they press against your body, his shoulders shifting as you reach out and hold your hands against them... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth is starting a gain, a definite sign that Morgan is asleep again. You smile as you look at him, thinking about how cute he looks like that. However, a minute of growth is enough to snap your attention away from his head and to other parts of him. You blush a little as you realize exactly what's happening. Before, wherever you held him, he grew. It seemed simple enough at the time. If your hands were on him while he was asleep, he'd grow. But from what's happening now, it looks like any skin contact between the two of you is enough to get him growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the events of the evening, you had agreed to spend the night with him with your shirt off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be easy enough to just put it back on, but part of you wants to see exactly how much you can get him to grow, and another part of you just doesn't want to go back on your word. And as you gazed over him, you realize that you don't want to have to let go of him so you can go put your shirt back on, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm... Wonder if you knew about this, you big sneak...\" You shift and smile, moving up a little more to try to hold in against his chest. His legs are shifting and starting to hang from the couch. It looks like they aren't growing quite as much as the rest of him, but they're at least swelling and pumping enough to keep him from looking too top-heavy. Even as he sleeps, he's got a grin on his face, and his body rustles and moves, two large arms shifting and making their way around your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate as you feel them, wondering if you should try to move away while you're still able to. But as you try to figure out what to do, he makes your mind up for you. Your body is soon held tight against his, pressed into warm feathers as his head nudges down and brushes against your hair. You have to struggle not to shout, but that impulse quickly fades as you feel him gingerly rubbing against you, his arms holding you gently even as the strength and power in them grows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mumble a little, but though Morgan shifts and moves, he remains asleep. You try to get your hands down, pressing against his back the best you can. It's impossible for you to get your hands around him now, his weight digging deep into the couch and his body still getting wider. Your hands end up fumbling around, gripping against his shoulders and his upper arms. As you try to cuddle in, he's quickly approaching the largest you've seen him. He was big back when he had broken that boulder into pieces, but it looks as though he'll soon rival that size. And back then, you had seen all of his muscles tense, his entire body fighting to keep the two of you safe. Every inch of him was at the ready, and must've been pumped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this is a different experience. Despite their size, almost his entire body is relaxed. As he gently holds you, you feel your hands and your arms pressing in, feeling his mass give a little as you move in. His chest is soft enough that your head is comfortable when it presses in. His lats are gently stretched out, shifting as his arms move. His body is still quite firm, despite how relaxed his muscles must be, despite how soft and fluffy he looks. And Morgan's expression is completely serene, his smile as relaxed as ever as he sleeps, either unaware or dreaming of his ever-increasing strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you've been hugging him for half an hour, but it's the most comfortable you can remember being in a long, long time. Every small move makes you understand his strength, and it only needs a small twitch from his body to realize how strong he's getting. Even as he rests, the smallest movement is enough to get parts of his body to flex, his shoulders to push up, his biceps to press against his back, his legs to slide you up and along... You can even spot something now starting to peek from his boxers, though you're too embarrassed to spend more than a moment staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to roughly glance over him, you realize he must've surpassed his previous size by now. You can't tell exactly how much he's grown, but you know it's big. His pec easily pushes back against your head whenever his arms move, and his body is audibly straining the couch now. Your sense of scale is shot when you feel his massive arms almost completely covering your back as they hold you, feeling like his body could completely surround yours if he curled up around you. It makes you feel warm and secure, having him with you like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really enjoy the feeling, and the warmth that it brings makes you start to drift off. Beyond anything else, it's comfortable to be with Morgan like this. But if you fall asleep like this, you know that he would end up holding you through the night. And while part of you certainly enjoys the idea of being held, and of letting him grow through the night, you can't help but feel a twitch of concern as you try to imagine exactly how much he might grow if you're always holding him. He's already getting close to outgrowing the couch, and his boxers are barely covering a thing by now. If this goes on much longer, then you know the two of you will end up on the floor together, and in the morning, he's going to wake up in the nude with a little guy tight in his arms. You have to decide if you want to take him up on his offer and let him see himself as he is now... Or if you want to let him keep sleeping, spend the night tight in his arms, and see how far this can go. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could hear the couch starting to strain under you both as Morgan was slowly growing bigger and bigger. It's been a slow growth, since you've laid on top of him for over half an hour. You were starting to worry because the warmth under Morgan's big strong arms was starting to make you sleepy. You want to stay awake through the whole thing, and not fall asleep at the risk of having Morgan grow too much. After a minute or two, you decide to slip away from underneath Morgan's massive arms. It takes a bit of work, but it wasn't too much trouble. You now were standing by Morgan's side. You begin to skim over Morgan's titanous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach muscle you stared at was built to solid perfection. The muscles you were more interested in were his chest, arms and legs. You were slowly looking over Morgan from head to toe, getting a detailed look of as much of your feathery titan friend as you could. All of a sudden, Morgan lets out a loud yawn, and then starts to stretch. Your eyes open wide, watching different parts of Morgan's body tense and ripple up from all around. He stretches out his arms and legs, and then turns to his side, facing away from you. The last thing you looked at were Morgan's boxers, which looked like they were just about to tear a bit. This made you flinch. Maybe now is a good time to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach in slowly towards Morgan's large muscular neck. The moment you touch it, it felt like you were touching a large pulsing vein. You could feel the blood also swirling around that part of Morgan's body, making it flex especially. After a moment of feeling around just Morgan's neck, you start shifting Morgan back and forth to wake him up but it wasn't as easy as you thought. You try using both hands to wake him up, but no go. You now decide to actually use your arms this time. Instead of shifting him back and forth, you actually just try to push him, but you only manage to budge him a bit. All of a sudden, you hear a mumble come from Morgan. Was it enough to wake him up? Suddenly, Morgan shifts around the couch some more, turning around so he was lying on his other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Morgan's face, which showed his eyes were still closed but you were still unsure of whether or not he's awake. You slowly reach in with one hand towards Morgan's cheek. Just as you were about to touch it, Morgan's hand catches your wrist, making you jump up. \"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan opens one eye at you, \"So. How'd it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan for a moment. You then put on a warming smile on your face, and then throw yourself on to Morgan's hulking body. \"It was fantastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grinned, \"Heh. That's sure good to know. Hey, I was wondering... Well, sorry if I keep suggesting stuff out in the open but... Huh?\" Morgan raises his head. You had already fallen asleep on Morgan's body, you head laying on his neck and your chest lying on top of his. \"Well I'll be a sun of a gun.\", Morgan said smiling. Morgan watched you as you snored quietly on his muscled chest. He thought about sleeping with you as well, but he also wanted to see how much bigger he has grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan softly and slowly picks you up. He gets up from the couch, cradling you in his arms for a short moment, and then sets you right where he slept. Morgan sets his hands on his hips as he watches you sleep for a moment. \"Heh. Cute kid.\" Morgan suddenly notices his left arm. He holds it up, \"Well would ya look at that.\" He examines his entire arm, checking each muscle group that has grown since he fell asleep. He tenses his arm a little, but his entire arm was already pumping up to massive proportions. \"Whoa.\" Morgan flexes his arm in front of his chest, and his bicep and tricep had swelled enormously. Morgan caresses his peaking bicep with his right hand, \"Now THIS I can get used to.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a small grin, Morgan turns over his arms, squeezing and feeling as he grips at himself. He keeps bending it, letting it pump up bit by bit, his grin widening as it quickly surpasses anything he's ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow... You really did a number on me...\u201d His voice is soft, but his excitement is clear as he keeps examining himself, letting his hand move up and down his arm, gripping every inch from his forearms to his shoulders as he explores them. He grins and glances around, muttering softly to himself. \u201cWonder if there's a good way to test this out...\u201d Morgan moves around the room, turning and glancing quickly, doing his best to tiptoe around. However, even his best attempts to remain quiet result in a quiet thumping as his footsteps plod against the ground. He grins and chuckles a little, turning to you to make sure you remain asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Allen... I'd better take this outside... I doubt there's anything heavy enough here for really test out my strength here... And you didn't want any damage to your house...\u201d He moves to the doorway, taking a minute to try to get it open without knocking it down. But even so, it nearly slams before he pushes outside, his body surging outwards before he grins and takes off, running faster than he ever had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night air whips against his face and his body, making him grin as he takes a quick step through the forest. He effortlessly pushes through the brush and the trees, leaving an obvious path in his wake. Despite the mild scratches and prods that he receives from the branches, he's able to make his way through without a moment's worry. As he moves, he even takes a quick leap, nearly flying through the upper branches of the trees, the height on his jump far greater than what he expects. With a grin, he keeps pushing out, his wings moving and helping him glide through, a few firm flaps helping to keep him aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound he makes in the night echoes through the forest, sending creatures scattering as they try to retreat from the sounds. Morgan pushes his ways through the trees, moving faster and faster until he reaches the edge of a cliff, grinning wide as he looks over the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let's see...\u201d He grins and rub his hands together, looking through the area. There were a few shards and stones crumbling around the area, traces of the explosion and the subsequent landslide still lingering around. The damage was quite obvious, but Morgan wasn't really looking at all of the details of the damage above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, his eyes are on the largest stone he can find. It easily stood at twice his height, and is just as thick as it is tall. Morgan's expression is that of elation as he grunts and dashes up to it. He's nearly growling as he plants his feet firm into the ground before moving his fingers against the rock. With a grunt, he starts to lift, but is surprised by how easily it seems to go up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah... No way...\u201d With a growing smile, Morgan shifts, his pecs pushing against the rock, his legs balancing, his arms and shoulders and back all straining and pumping as he lifts. However, in a matter of seconds, he's managed to get it up past his waist, and is even trying to do a few reps with them. \u201cMust be stronger than I look... And I probably look strong already.\u201d He's unable to help but grin widen  as he shifts his hand, moving to try to handle the rock with one arm. It's more difficult, but even so, he's managing to get a slow, steady lift from it, his body shifting and reacting, a soft, intense moan coming from him as he feels the pump. \u201cYesssss...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes fly by as Morgan keeps experimenting with the stone, chunks of it breaking when he roughly handles it, occasionally tossing the rock and letting it fly a few feet away, or trying to kick it around with one of his massive legs. He laughs and grins as he keeps moving, realizing just how strong he must be, even realizing that his workout's probably making him even stronger. He gives another firm flex as he finishes with the stone, shattering it into countless splinters, more and more of his body fully pumped out as he keeps looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis boxers were already straining to their limits before, but his pump brings the inevitable. There's a loud, obvious sound, and Morgan yelps and reflexively reaches down to try to cover himself his boxers begins to tear. Despite being alone, there's simply no way for him to avoid a blush quickly rising up to his face. With an effort, he quickly tries to pull them off, removing them before any more tears appear. \u201cWow... That's... Shouldn't let Allen see that so easily...\u201d He mumbles to himself, his hand trying to cover himself, his blush deeper as he feels a bit of the new thickness now in his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stares a little bit, muttering quietly as he holds his boxers up, trying to get a better look at the damage. His boxers are still mostly intact, but clearly ripping in a couple of places. \u201cI wonder if Allen could fix these...\u201d He shifts a little, shivering a bit. It isn't cold out, but being as exposed like that makes him feel nervous, his mind still uncertain how he would feel about showing himself in the nude. \u201cMaybe I should head back... Keep him company when he wakes... But, then again... Maybe I should stay out, make sure I don't damage his house when I head back in... Maybe if I keep working out when he's asleep, I can give him a surprise when he peeks out his window...\u201d Morgan smiles to himself, quickly making a decision on the best way to spend the night.</span></div></div>",

I'll just head back.\" Morgan holds up his right arm, caressing each pumped muscle group with his left hand, \"Just hope I can still fit through his door.\", Morgan said with a slight smirk on his beak. Morgan went right ahead and flexed his arm, watching his bicep swell out immensely. \"Right on...\" All of a sudden, there was another small ripping sound coming from his boxers, \"!!\" Morgan looked down. His boxers were already tenting from his recent flex. Morgan stared at his poking it for a moment, but it just kept growing until it seemed fully erect. Morgan started to blush again. It was definitely the biggest he has ever seen. \"...I-...It looks good......but how does it feel...?\", Morgan thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand, Morgan slowly reached out to his full-length member. He softly gripped his manhood from the bottom, slowly shifting his hand up and then down once. It looked hard and strong, but if also felt soft and firm. Morgan caressed his boner a little more, in turn making him raise his head up as he began to moan and tense up a bit. \"Ooh...\" Suddenly, he heard another rip come from his boxer shorts. \"!\" Morgan looked back down. His hand was still gripping the middle of his pulsing member. Morgan stared at it for a moment. He loosens his grip a bit, and then turns his head back towards the direction of your cabin. After a moment of staring, he grins, \"Heh.\" Morgan flashes back to the first time you ever, 'filled him up'. It was when you were grabbing Morgan's boxers and then when he picked you up. Morgan opens his eyes from his flashback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then feels his member twitch in his hand again. Once again he looks down, and then a grin appears on his beak, \"It's funny... Once he reached down there...I'm pretty sure that part of me started...to pulsate. As if, if I hadn't stopped him, I'm pretty sure I would have ended up touching myself back there.\" Morgan felt his pride-and-joy twitch again, only it felt a little harder than before, \"Gih...! Urrrgh...\" Morgan's grip was starting to tighten around his pulsing member, but he manages some resistance, slowly lowering his hand away. \"No...not yet.\" Morgan looks back towards your home, grinning again, \"Not until Allen at least gets to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan steps up to the edge of the cliff. He spreads his long wings, but he takes a look at his wingspan before even taking off. His wings were long and looked powerful. He looked down to his enormous lats as he spreaded them as much as he could. Just the feeling of him flexing was enough to send signals into his everlasting manhood. Luckily he's able to manage his swelling member from being touched, or felt for an extended period of time. He raised his left arm up and behind his head so that his lat would stick out the most. He felt his peaking lat for a short time, and then got an idea that gave him a bigger grin this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan first stuck out his left leg to one side and planted his foot firmly on the ground. He then sticks out his right leg to the other side, planting his foot firmly as well. He flaps both his wings once, sending gusts of wind from the ground all around him. His arms were against his sides, lowering his forearms and then raising them back up so that his bi's and tri's would flex outward. He puffed and pumped out his chest, stretched and flexed out his neck and trap muscles, and then he tensed out both his tree-trunk legs. He began to growl, \"Grrrrrrauuuuuugh!!!\" Morgan's scream seems to have echoed across the entire forest, if not a long stretch of the forest. Morgan slouched a bit, feeling a little narcissistic , \"Ah! That felt great! I feel like one of those huge dragons I used to see in those muscle magazines.\" Morgan sighs happily as his places his hands on his hips, standing up straight, \"Well, guess I should head ba-... !!\", upon standing up straight, Morgan hears another second-longer rip from his boxers, slouching back down and trying to cover his massive boner with both his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, his hands were already big, but they weren't necessarily enough to fully cover his pulsing member. \"Crap. Didn't really think that through.\" He raises his head up, \"Guess I'm gonna have to stay here for a bit.\" Morgan glances to the right, finding a small spot of light appear behind a large group of mountains. Morgan stands up straight, \"Oh crap! Ack!\", but he ends up slouching back down. \"Dammit. The sun's rising already? How long have I been up here?\" Morgan raises his left arm to look at something that would normally be wrapped around his wrist. He lowers his arm, \"I don't even think there'd be a watch that could fit me at the moment.\" Morgan glanced towards the slowly rising sun and back and sighs. \"Just better relax.\" Morgan looked down, \"Just enough so I can get home as soon as possible.\" Morgan raises his head up, \"Eh. Maybe Allen's gonna oversleep. He did sleep pretty late last night. God, his mac 'n' cheese is ta die for!\" Morgan looks down, then back up. \"Huh. That works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan quickly spreaded out his wings again. He flaps them once or twice and he was immediately off the ground. After one more flap of his wings, he swoops in down the side of the cliff and flies over the large patches of trees, making the top of the trees swoop around once or twice. Morgan was flying at a high rate of speed, but once he caught a glimpse of your cabin he quickly slows to a stop, landing a couple of trees back towards the home. Being as quiet as he possibly could, he tip-clawed up the stairs and into the patio. Morgan slowly slides open the back glass door and enters inside as smoothly as he can. With enough luck, he manages to slip inside with both his wings. He smoothly shuts the door, and then turns around. Allen was still asleep on the couch in the same position as when you left him. Morgan sighs, and then grins. \"Heh. Still asleep. Just like I left him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan quietly walks up to the couch you were sleeping on. You gained about two or three inches in size since you left, but it was of no concern to you. Being as gentle as you could, Morgan sticks his large arms underneath Allen's back and then lightly picks you up. Morgan says to himself as he cradles you in his arms, \"Heh. It's weird. I'm not even that tired anymore.\" Morgan shrugs his shoulders as he says quietly, \"I'll just rest up a bit I suppose.\" All of a sudden, Morgan feels a quick kiss coming from below his beak. \"Gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked down at you. You were looking back at him, wide awake and smiling. \"Good morning Morgan. How are you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stared at you for a moment, sighs, and then looks away, \"You know, I half-expected you'd be awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold your arms behind your head, \"I woke up a few minutes before your strong, muscular arms opened up the sliding door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's arms suddenly start to tighten up underneath you, \"Gih...! Ah... You did that on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee. You know me.\" You suddenly raise up your arms and legs, \"Gah! Something poked me! On my back!\" You look down, and then at Morgan. Morgan was staring back at you with a grin on his face. You lower your arms and legs, \"Yeah, yeah. I'm happy ta see you too.\" You look back up at Morgan, \"So...</span></div></div>",

You feel his body move, his shaft pressing a little more firmly against your back as you feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say...\u201d Morgan grins as his legs shift, the motion making you shift when you feel them pressing against your feet, his length sliding against your back as he moves. \u201cThat my legs are thick enough, fast enough to bring me miles in a matter of minutes?\u201d He grins and lightly pulls his arms up, his biceps bulging against your back as he holds you. \u201cThat these babies hauled a rock bigger than the one that fell at us? That I could toss it aside easily? That it didn't take much to crush it into pieces?\u201d Morgan carefully holds against your body, even his fingers able to press in against you with a slight squeeze. You feel it shifting and moving from the attention, a pump still clear in his body as he moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm... Keep going...\u201d You blush and move your head down, feeling it press in against his neck while Morgan's head moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat these...\u201d He lifts his arms, his shoulders and lats moving and pressing in, nudging your body around as he shows you. \u201cGot enough practice pushing out? That they're thick enough that you could sit on them without giving me a bit of trouble...\u201d He grins as his pecs press in, pushing our body out as he tenses them. \u201cThat my chest is thick enough that I could bench press a car by now...\u201d He keeps grinning as he shifts, another bounce of his chest sending your body moving again before you find your head pressing in below his chest, the ridges of his abs, now a thick, toned eight-pack pressing back against you. \u201cThat my abs are like a brick wall, but much, much thicker...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause and swallow again as you feel something poking you again, this time pressed up into your chest. However, Morgan just keeps grinning, not mentioning it for the moment as his wings shift and start to spread out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd these... Wide enough to block out your windows... Are strong enough that I had a chance to pull my mass across the sky...\u201d Morgan grins, his wings moving, pushing the cushions on your couch aside as you feel them twist and softly wrap around you. \u201cIt's rare for us birds to really be able fly, and not just glide around... But I'm strong enough now... I could bring you for a flight, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd like that...\u201d You chuckle a little, but blush deeper as you feel him give a bit of a flap, the force of it enough to nudge you in closer against his body. \u201cWow...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice is almost a growl as he nudges down against you, his gaze firm and longing as he holds you in place. \u201cThat now, my powerful, masculine tone is loud enough to echo through the forest... And that this... this...\u201d Even Morgan's voice fails as he looks down, your eyes following his downwards. His cock is clearly exposed now. The feeling of describing everything, the excitement of showing his strength to you... It all must've been too much for him. And now, the two of you are staring at his shaft, it completely hard and starting to leak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's impossible to ignore now, but you're not sure what to say. You're just staring for a minute before you hear Morgan's voice. \u201cHehe... You like it too, don't you?\u201d You blush deep as your gaze meets Morgan's, and he's got a slight smile on it. It looks like he's resisting the urge to start grinding it up against you. \u201cI'd... better take care of this, huh?\u201d Morgan's grinning wide, the tip of his  thick length now pushing against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a dozen lines are going through your head when he mentions it, but you can't bring yourself to use any of them yet. With a slight grin, you nod and hold tight around him, your hands squeezing his rear as \u201cY-yeah... Good idea...\u201d You pause for a moment before you see him just staring at you for a moment, an odd grin on his face. You look back at him for a moment, neither of you saying a word as you just stare at another. Eventually, you can't help but grin as well, just looking up and giving his head a nudge. \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you planning on giving me any privacy while I did this?\u201d Morgan's chuckling, but you just grin and press your head in, closing your eyes as you just enjoy the feeling of holding him tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm... Let me think about it. After all, I might want to see- Alright, alright!\u201d You can't help but laugh as Morgan grins and nudges in against your neck, his fingers and his feathers lightly tickling while his other hand holds you in place. \u201cAlright, you can do it upstairs! Room on the right should be fine!\u201d You keep laughing even when he lets you go. Your body rolls off of his, lightly tumbling to the floor as he just lays there and grins. You pull yourself off the ground, unable to help but blush again as you see his towering meat still inches away from your head as you sit back up. \u201cBut... But so you know, I'm not promising I won't try to peek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan just flexes again, his full body pumping out, his shaft jumping a little at the idea. \u201cOh, you can try... I won't promise that it would end up well. But thanks, Allen...\u201d Morgan's grin is wide as he tries to move his hands down, only managing to cover up some of himself as he moves. Even as he stands up, you can't help but watch as his body keeps tensing and shifting as he walks away. You aren't even sure if he's trying to hide it, or if he's intent on giving you a show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh a little as he moves up the stairs, you wondering what you should do next. You're not sure if you should start working on breakfast or if you should follow before your ear twitches a bit, Morgan's voice starting to sound from upstairs. It seems as though he's not exactly quiet while he starts to jerk at himself. You just roll your eyes as you move, prepared to listen to a lot more of his noise, not knowing exactly what to expect.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan was now in the upstairs hallway, his left hand still grasping his hardened member. He stops beside a door to his right, and then softly pushes it open with his large right palm. \"... The bathroom. Of course. ? Hey Allen, I thought you said you don't have a shower here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer from downstairs, \"No I have a shower. I meant that I don't take showers here because then I'd have to refill the water with water from the lake every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Morgan looks at the shower, and then turns his head back, \"Well, surely you won't mind if I use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you can refill it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Morgan enters right in, turning on the light. Morgan stood in front of the sink and a half-full-length mirror on the wall. Morgan was actually lucky to find a full-length mirror sitting between the sink and the toilet. Past the toilet lay the bathtub and white half-clear curtains. \"Neat!\" Morgan walks right up to the full-length mirror, the mirror being just tall enough to view Morgan's entire pumped body. Suddenly, he smirks. Getting a good viewing of only parts of his muscular body was enough to send his manhood tingling. Glancing at his right double-diamond calf, his right pumped pectoral, his thick well-defined lower abdominals, \"Urrrgh...!\" Morgan could feel his member pulsating at just the thought of it all. \"...Yes...\" Morgan raises his head, \"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan overhears two footsteps. He knew they came from you, even though you tried your hardest to keep quiet. Morgan just grins, and then says to himself, \"Heh. It seems Allen has forgotten about my heightened hearing senses. Oh well.\" Morgan goes to push the door closed, but only halfway on purpose. Morgan went back and positioned himself in front of the full-length mirror. He then looks down to his ripped boxers. They would surely burst if he tensed up his muscles anymore. Morgan glances towards the door, and then back at the mirror. \"Eh. Why not. I'm sure Allen has a few he can spare. Morgan raises his ripped boxers up to his enormous thighs, his manhood still revealed from over his boxers. He begins to tense up his quads and hamstrings. He was already starting to feel the thread of his boxers start to spread apart and rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even goes ahead and starts flexing out his large calves. He sticks out his right leg a bit closer to the mirror, a rip line occurring from where his right quadriceps are pumping out. Another rip formed right above Morgan's left thigh as well. Morgan then decides bends his knees a bit and flexes his legs hard, making his thighs and calves stick out like tree trunks. And with that, his boxers rip off into pieces, the remnants of his boxers falling to the floor. Although his boxers were finally off, he still held his flexing pose. He stood his upper body straight and tensed up his thick 8-pack abs, making them swell up. Lastly, he went and brought his arms down in a flexing pose, also pumping out his large pecs. He held his pose for a short time, \"Yeah! Lookit that! Urgh!\", Morgan relaxed his muscles as he looked down, \"What the!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems Morgan's flex was starting to make his member pulsate and throb more on its own. He grabbed his own with both his hands and he was able to feel the blood circulate all around his proud member. He watched and felt his manhood throb a little more on its own, causing him to clench his teeth at the ecstatic feeling each time. \"!!\" Morgan looks down towards his manhood, which actually bulged and swelled out some more right in his palms. \"...Damn...\" Suddenly, his member was starting to leak out more, \"Oh crap!\" Morgan quickly jumped into the bathtub, making sure not to get any of his bird seed on the rug. 'Phew'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turned the water and the water started to pour out from fossett. He checks it to make sure it's at the right temperature, and then he sat right in as he let the water fill up the tub. He was actually only sitting up to his lower abdominals in the tub. He notices this, \"Ah. Oh well.\", but just rests his arms on each edge of the bathtub. Morgan takes a firm grip of his hardened length with his right hand, \"I don't think I can resist the urge anymore anyway.\" Morgan lightly slides a finger up and down the top part of his grown length, which reacted quickly and shows just how sensitive it really is. Morgan then strokes the lower part of his length with his left hand, which was enough to send a feeling of pleasure all throughout his entire body. \"It feels much more sensitive now than it was then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glances towards the door, \"Mm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence at the door, then you pop out from behind the door, \"Hey Morgan! Just thought I bring you some fresh towels.\" You visibly see Morgan stroke his hard member once, \"GAHCK!\", which caused you to get a nosebleed but you quickly cover your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stares at you. \"You're not even trying anymore. You know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a 8-and-a-half foot hawk with hulking muscles all over and whose junk he just revealed in my bathtub...!?\" You lower your head down as you pause for a moment. You raise your head back up, \"...You don't think I DON'T know that?\", you say with blushing red cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stares at you, and then grins. \"Care to take a feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump at the question, but decide not to say anything unimportant, \"......Sure. Why not? I've already embarrassed myself enough in front of you.\" You walk up to the bathtub, and then kneel down on both knees. Morgan was still gripping his own with his left hand as you slowly hold your left hand out. \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's manhood seemed to throb the closer your hand got to it. \"Go on. It's not gonna bite.\" Your hand inches closer to Morgan's near-erect boner, \"Maybe just throb around a couple times on its own.\", Morgan said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hand inched closer, your fingers were starting to shake a bit. But after a moment, you feel something emit from Morgan's throbbing member. \"Morgan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is a sight to be seen, huh?\", Morgan said with a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just that, but, I can feel heat eminating from your...your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, out with it. Any lame word'll do.\", Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand inches closer, until it finally grasps the lower part of Morgan's manhood, \"...thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's cheeks grew a little red from the feeling of your hand, which barely covers half of one side of his pulsating member. He glances away from you, \"Ahhh, I guess that word's okay if you wanna put it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your massive...\", Morgan looks back at you as you slowly shift your hand up and down Morgan's length, \"...hard...firm...and thick thing.\" Morgan stares at you, wide-eyed. Then suddenly, something courses through Morgan's veins, which then lead straight into Morgan's length. That was when Morgan's boner, had bulged out even more right under your palm, \"!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAHHH!\" Morgan jumps up so that he was now standing on his knees and grasping his manhood with both his hands. His grown length was really starting to leak now, as drops of pre was starting to drip into the tub and down the drain. Morgan felt his enormouse length bulge out some more as he moaned in ecstasy, \"Urrrgh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan! Are, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was clenching his teeth for a moment as his body was shivering with pleasure. He then turns his head to look at you with a smile. \"You idiot. This is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Why wouldn't I be?\" Morgan holds up his still-dripping length, \"I mean look at this baby. I can't thank you enough for what you've done.\" Morgan's member throbbed hard once again, \"Gih! Ugh... E-excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks started to blush red as well. \"Morgan, go ahead. Take your time.\", you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turns towards his body towards the fossett. He begins to caress his pulsing length by shifting his left hand up and down. Feelings of pleasure continued rushing through his body, and only heightened as he grabbed his length with his other hand and began actually pumping as fast as he could. Upon doing so, Morgan decided to put on a show since his sexual pleasure was increasing through his muscles as well. Morgan manages to stop himself from pumping, holding out both his muscular arms to flex them in front of you. Along with his massive chest and brickwall abs. Morgan put on a smile, \"It's all for the moment. URGH...!!\" Morgan looked down again. It turns out his thick length was pumping on its own! With each pump, Morgan only got more and more aroused. Morgan grabbed a hold of the bathtub with his left hand and the wall with his right as he began to growl loudly, \"Grrraughhh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, every single muscle in Morgan's body started to swell out on their own too! Once every muscle group swelled out at their most, Morgan was forced to stand straight up on his knees, arching his back so his still-pumping length stuck out the most. He lets out a growling moan, \"Urrrgh!!\" At that point, Morgan takes a look at you. You starting back with your eyes wide open and cheeks blushing bright red. Morgan says to himself, \"Allen...I'm really glad you've been here to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Morgan had reached his climax. \"GRAUGH!!\" You jumped back a bit, watching as Morgan's massive boner spewed and gushed out gallons of white honey-like substance. During this, Morgan's body was also slowly deflating in front of you. Morgan's climax and deflated actually lasted well over a minute! Once Morgan was just about back to his size, the bathtub was nearly full of his own bird seed. You sit up to check on Morgan, who looked back at you with a giant smile on his face. \"So...</span></div></div>",

Hope you enjoyed the show.\u201d Morgan's voice is almost teasing as he speaks, and you have to turn away, wiping your nose a little as you do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-of course... You're still refilling the water, though,\" You hastily comment as you walk out. It's only a moment before you're quickly turning down the hall to your bedroom. It takes a few moments for you to fish a change of clothes out from your drawers, picking a couple of things that were less stand-offish than the boxers he was wearing before. You can still hear him splashing around when you return, just tossing the change of clothes onto the towels. \u201cYou can take your time here. I'll go cook some breakfast. Are eggs okay, or is that some weird cannibalism thing that I should know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS'fine with me.\u201d Morgan's voice is a little distracted when you leave the room, and you try to avoid looking at him while you move. If you took a glance, you'd probably too embarrassed to put together a coherent sentence. Your mind's still a little off as you think about what you just witnessed minutes ago, but you're smiling as you daydream a little when you head downstairs and to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to work on cracking open a few eggs and tossing whatever you can into an omelet, the smell of it filling the room. It doesn't take long before you hear Morgan's footsteps coming back down. He's holding his stomach through his shirt, a little lost in thought as he wanders over to the table, sitting down at it rather quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan? Everything alright?\u201d You turn a little, one eye still on the pan but the other glancing towards Morgan as he sits there, his hand moving slowly over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh, yeah. Just fine. Had a time with that mess, but everything's clean now. Just... thinking a little, I guess.\u201d Morgan manages a smile, but shuffles a little bit in his seat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk to me, Morgan. What's up?\u201d Your eyes are back onto breakfast, but your ears are still perked as you hear Morgan speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just... Sort of wondering, I guess. I mean, that growth serum, I guess... Whatever they did, it's pretty clear that it worked, right? But why would they want to test it on us anthros? If... If we were gonna all get stronger, then we'd break out of there quick, right? Don't get me wrong, I'm loving the strength and all, but... But it's got me a bit concerned.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel okay? All your feathers still intact, and you're not going insane or anything, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nothing like that. I feel as good as ever... Well, better than ever, really... I mean, it's been the day, I'm working on an hour or so of sleep, and I'm better than I've ever felt.\u201d He gives his arm a slight flex, his eyes twinkling as he looks at it. \u201cEven now... I think it's just a bit bigger naturally. I guess everything I did was more than enough of a workout. But... It's just... Unsettling to think about what else might be happening to me. Like... If growing so much is unhealthy for me. Or maybe they had plans for us. What if they were plan on using us after we had gotten bigger? It's still a little disturbing to think about what might've happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as long as you're okay and safe now, we don't have to worry, right?\u201d You finish cooking, dropping a rather sizable portion onto a plate. You aren't sure exactly how much Morgan needs to eat now, but after what you had just seen, you're willing to bet he needs a large meal. \"So just relax. Build a nest if it makes you feel more comfortable or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan just chuckles and gives you a nudge, pushing you back onto your chair. \"Sure, I'll just pull a few trees from their roots and use them.\u201d Morgan smiles again when he looks back at you, his eyes on the approaching food. \u201cThanks, Allen. I guess after what I've been doing all night, things just hit... That they wanted us strong for some reason, and that I can't figure out why.\u201d Morgan takes his plate, just gazing at you a little as he does. He takes a massive bite in it, working at it quickly as you sit down next to him. \u201cStill, if I'm gonna be big, I'd rather be big for you than for the guys who kidnapped me.\" He's managing to speak between bites, and you can't help but smile as you start to work at your food as well. You're almost staring at Morgan as he eats, and from the slight movements he's making, the way he's shifting a little closer... You can tell that he's noticed. \"C'mon, Allen... If you want to sit in my lap or something, you can just say so. After all, if you do, I'm sure they'll be plenty of room for-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's starting to speak again, but his voice is suddenly interrupted. The two of you both jump as you hear...</span></div></div>",

You look back at Morgan, \"You, might wanna keep your head down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! R-right!\" Morgan quickly hides under the table. He then grabs his breakfast from up top and brings it with him underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly towards the table, \"......Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've been hungry since I came back! Just open the door.\", Morgan yells from under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You slowly open the door, realizing who was standing at your front porch with his hands in his pocket. \"! Vince!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince holds a hand up to greet you, \"He-hey Allen. How's it hangin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hey Vince.\" You turn your head back, \"Hey Morgan, It's Vince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan answers from under the table. \"Oh. Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Vince stare blankly towards the table for a moment, \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally speak, \"Aren't you, gonna come and greet him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggh!\" Morgan gets out from under the table, \"Alright, I'm gettin' up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Vince as Morgan walks up beside you, \"So what brings you back to my place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to update you guys on what's been going on. We've gotten some more Intel on that injection those bastards gave you and why they did it.\", Vince explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grew more interested, \"Ya did? Well then what did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently that injection they gave you was only a 'part' of what they were really trying to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean exactly?\", Morgan asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns out they not only hoped to make you super strong, but to the point where would even be able to control yourself anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan jump up at what Vince said. You ask, \"Why...why would they want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince pauses for a moment, \"We have reason to believe, that once you're a raging hulk, they would lock you up and drop you off in Anthro side. Where they would leave your uncontrolable form to create nothing but destruction and devastation across the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan's eyes widen, \"!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was nearly at a lost for words, \"A-...are you serious...? ......\" Morgan punches his a fist against his other hand, \"Those bastards!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head at Morgan, \"... Morgan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince had his head down for a moment, and then raises it up. He suddenly smiles. \"But, it's nothing you two should worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan stare awkwardly at Vince, \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince holds his hands up in assurance, \"Trust me. Me and the team have our sights on these guys 24/7. Oh! And before I forget.\" Vince suddenly pulls out a syringe an quickly injects some sort of green serum into Morgan's right forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan jumps up, \"OW! What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince pulls out the syringe and tosses it into a nearby trashcan. \"Sorry. Just thought I take care of that while you weren't paying much attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that thing?\", you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The serum they injected you and the other four with only was a strength enhancing serum. They needed to test the first part to make sure it works, that's why they kidnapped people from different breeds. They succeeded. But there was also another side effect to the serum. It's more of a poison, which would've killed you by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Morgan jump up again, \"!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan began shaking a bit, \"Y-you mean...just now...I would've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince patted Morgan's shoulders, \"Hey, hey. You're fine now. I told you there's nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly grabs vince and picks him up by his shirt, \"I almost just died ya jackass!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I, I was just trying to comfort you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince was trying to get himself loose from Morgan's grip, but Morgan was too strong and too ticked off to let Vince go. You watched as they both fussed and fought for a short time. What caught your attention were the muscles on Morgan's arms, which were flexing right out, and expanding a little more. You smile at Morgan, and then place a hand on Morgan's back. This caught Morgan by surprise. \"It's alright Morgan. He said you'd be okay now. Besides, you wouldn't want to weigh your powerful, muscular back down while fussing with Vince, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly gets a jolt from his back, causing him to let Vince loose, \"Gih!\" The muscles on Morgan's back bulged out a bit. Morgan dropped down to his knees, wrapping his arms around his body to hold his sides as he moaned painfully and ecstatically, \"Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince quickly fixed his shirt and backed away. \"Uh, th-thanks Mark. Heh heh... I guess I'll, be on my way now.\" Vince quickly shoved off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were waving back, \"G'bye Vince. Hope to see ya again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan suddenly places a hand on your right shoulder as he slowly picks himself up. \"Ah... I really wanted to kick his ass ya know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, \"I know. I just don't condone violence on the premises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glances at you, and then sighs. Morgan then picks you up with one arm, \"Come on.\" You shut the front door as Morgan says,</span></div></div>",

Even with a couple of buckets, it'll probably take a few trips, though. You'll have to grab some water, drop it back off in the tank in here, and then head out for some more. But shouldn't we finish breakfa-\" You stop and blink a few times as you look towards the table, spotting two empty plates laying there. \"Morgan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was really, <i>really</i> hungry!\" Morgan grins as he keeps holding you in one shifting arm, even as he starts to carry up up. \"And it didn't look like you were gonna finish yours...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes a little bit as he pops a door open and starts to dig through it with one hand. \"Fine. But only because you just had a near-death experience... sorta. Next time, if you want to eat more, you're responsible for cooking. I'm only cooking meals for two, not for three or four or however many people you're going to be eating for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fiiiiiiine...\" Morgan rolls his eyes, his body still shifting a little more as he keeps carrying you, shifting a little awkwardly as he grabs the buckets with his free hand. \"Any other chores I'm supposed to take care of, Allen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends. Can I count on you to clean the house without breaking anything?\" You grin as he steps out, taking a quick pace towards the lake as he keeps holding you, his arm moving as you reach back and hold him. \"Or are your big arms gonna end up crushing the broom when you grab it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph... No promises...\" Morgan lets off a small, pleasant moan as he keeps moving you, mumbling as he nudges in against your head. You smile and shift back in his arms, before planting a brief kiss on his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then... Maybe I should just keep you outside, if you're so eager to show off. Give every animal around a good view of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only way I'll let you do that is if you stay out, with me. In fact... You're gonna be coming with me while I do your little chore.\" He grins again as his head brushes through your hair, his body shifting and his stance changing a little as his pace quickens, fumbling to try to get the door open before carrying you outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it.\" You smile as you feel him steadily walking. You're content to just let your hands softly move and brush against his body, trying to find a good spot to hold him. Along the way, you're still steadily whispering into his ear, constantly hearing a pleasant murmur coming from his, his body still shifting and swelling as you complement him. By the time you've gotten to the lake again, he's easily holding you in one arm, almost cradling you against his bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Here we are...\" With a single, quick motion, Morgan dips the buckets into the lake and hauls them out. The water splashes about, splashing you a good bit as he keeps holding you. Morgan keeps grinning as he keeps you firm in one hand and the water in the other as he starts to make his way back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Morgan?\" Your voice makes him pause a little, his head turning to you. \"I was wondering... What are you planning to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Morgan pauses a little, a slight look of confusion on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... I really like having you here and all, but... But seeing Vince again and talking about what happened reminded me... this really isn't your home. I mean... You probably have your life to go back to somewhere. And... And, well, I do like spending time with you, but I don't know if I can ask you to stay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...\" Morgan's voice is a little shaky as he speaks, his expression suddenly dropping like a stone. \"I guess I never really thought about it... I mean, I knew I wouldn't be able to stay forever, but just with everything that's going on, and finding out everything we did... It's been a crazy few days...\" He sighs a little, a bit of water splattering onto the ground as he keeps walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan... Um... It's not a big deal. You can stay as long as you need to.\" You try to give his head a nudge as you shift in his arms. \"I mean, I think I can handle a bird at my place alright. We'd probably only have a problem if you were some animal that could maul me or something.\" You try to joke, not really sure how it's going to be taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Because I couldn't just decide to fall asleep on top of you and keep you pinned all night long.\" Morgan's eyes roll a little as he shifts again, adjusting his grip on you. \"Allen... Thanks. Really. You've been nicer to me than I'd ever expected someone to be...\" He sighs again and shakes his head. \"It's just... I don't know right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time, then. I promise, I'll try to help no matter what you choose.\" You smile and kiss him again, your arm wrapping against his slowly thickening neck. Despite his still-increasing size, Morgan seems more and more sheepish as he moves, too deep in thought to make a comment and just looking too sweet for you to want to disturb him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the time he's dumping the first buckets of water into storage, it looks like he's made up his mind. His eyes are a little sharper, and he's almost staring at you along the way. However, he still hasn't said a word, and you're not sure what he's decided. He simply wordlessly takes you and the buckets and starts to make the second trip back towards the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the two of you arrive at the lake again, you can't it anymore. You just make a clear, obvious sound as you clear your throat. Morgan's eyes widen for a moment before he looks at you, fumbling with the buckets this time. \"Oh! S-sorry, Allen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Morgan. It just looks like you've made a decision.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yeah, I kind of have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Um...\" Morgan just places the buckets down at the ground before holding you with both hands, lifting you up in front of him. He stammers a couple of times before you hear him speaking. </span></div></div>",

Morgan suddenly licks you upwards across your face, which makes you jump up, \"Gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan said while sticking his tongue out playfully, \"Sorry. You had some scrambled eggs on your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouted at Morgan, \"Okay, first off, you liked me on my face. Not my face. Second, I KNOW I didn't have anything on my face. ...\" You turn your face away, \"Look, I know what you're trying to do. Messin' with me won't get an answer out of me any faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan starts nuzzling you on your cheek, \"No. I just like messin' with ya.\" Morgan slowly lets you down, \"And, if it helps with your decision...\" Morgan kneels down on one knee so he was now looking at you eye-to-eye, \"...you've been living in a secluded area out here on the mountainside all by yourself for over five years. Taking showers in a river.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow your head down in shame a little, \"Y-...yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head up to look at Morgan, which caused you to jump up and make your cheeks blush red, \"Gih!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was shirtless, letting the shirt he wore hang around his muscular right arm as he had both his pumped raised up in a flexing pose. \"...you have a fine large piece o' meat willing to offer you a place to stay on Anthro Side.\" Morgan tenses his chest and arm muscles while looking at you with one eye open. \"Course I can still give you time to think about it.\" Morgan noticed you had your head bowing down again. He turns his head towards you, \"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just keep your head down for a moment, \"...... Mm...\" You suddenly raise your head, then throwing your arms around Morgan's round and muscular neck and plant a kiss on Morgan's beak. Morgan blinks his eyes in response. \"Okay.\" You loosen your grip as you step back. \"Heh. I could never say no to you.\", you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grins in response, \"Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not right now at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan went from a grin to a pout, \"Hrm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bend down to reach for one of the buckets and then hand it to Morgan, \"I don't wanna leave right away, but how would we even make it to Anthro Side without being detected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan remembers the card Vince handed him way back when they first spoke. Morgan blinks. \"I think we know someone who can help.\" Morgan grabs the other bucket, and then carries you in his arms. Morgan then sprouts his wide wings, and with one flap you both were now in the air. After flying through the air at fast speeds and doing a few show-offy moves, you were both finally back at your cabin. Morgan fills the water storage one last time. Quite possibly the last time he'll have to do this. For a while. Morgan flies back down to you, the buckets still up on the roof. Morgan sets his hands on his hips, \"There you go. All finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin. \"Heh. Thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk back into your house through the back. You entered in first and Morgan followed. \"So, you wanna pack up a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the staircase, \"Yeah. It'll be a couple minutes, but I don't wanna leave once I finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stands up staighter, \"Uh, of course!\" You began walking up the stairs, \"Uh, Allen?\" You stop a few steps up to look at Morgan. \"Um, are you, completely sure about your decision.\" Morgan closes the sliding door behind him. \"'Cause, I don't want you to feel like you're being forced to come or anything. If you want me to stay a little longer then I'm okay with that. It's not like I'm doing anything important right now or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looks up at you, \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Morgan with a unknown expression on your face for a moment, and then smile. \"I'm completely sure.\" Morgan stared at you for a moment, then smiles in unison. \"As long as we can come back like once a month or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shrugs his shoulders, \"Sure, sure. Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan watches as you head up the stairs. He then lets out a sigh of relief. You suddenly poke your head down, \"Hey, is it alright if I brought a few luggage bags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Morgan starts scratching the back of his head, \"Oh, yeah. Sure.\" He looks at you while squinting his eyes a bit. \"As long as you don't want me to bring any furniture along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, and then head back upstairs. Morgan's shirt and pants were still set on the sofa. Morgan walked over to the sofa and slipped his fingers into one of the pockets, trying not to rip it off with his large fingers. What he reached for was the card Vince handed him with a couple phone numbers on it. Vince's was the one he kept his eyes on. Morgan walked over to a phone that was on the kitchen counter. Morgan grabs the phone off its hook and tries to dial the number without hitting the wrong button. The phone rings a few times, and then Vince picks up. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vince, it's Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! How did you get this number!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you gave me your card.\", Morgan responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh-heh... That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rolls his eyes, \"Look, I'm not calling to kick your ass or anything. I'm just asking a favor of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sure. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like it if you guys can transport us to Anthro Side. You think you can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, who's 'us'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Allen. I offered and he was more than happy to come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do ya say?

Now's not a really good time.\u201d Vince's voice is a little hesitant over the phone, but it's followed by silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's up?\u201d Morgan tapped his fingers against the countertop of the kitchen as he tries to get a seat, awkwardly fumbling with the phone as he speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've got our hands full watching everybody else. You know the other guys who got kidnapped along with you? Apparently, your captors found out where the dragon is right now. We only just got in contact with him in time, and we're having a rough time trying to get him to a secure hiding spot. Plus, the dalmatian's not reacting well to the serum. He's become way too aggressive, and we're having a rough time keeping him from getting loose and doing some damage. Right now, our resources are tied up dealing with at-risk targets first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? They've... They're still after us? Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d Morgan's voice is a little more urgent now, fidgeting a bit as he sits onto the countertop, shifting a little as he grasps the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, you don't want to get involved right now. You're lucky enough to have ended up scot-free. I'll let you know when we've got a bit more breathing room. Until then, I'm afraid that relocating you guys is low on the priority list.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Good luck watching over the others, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, we'll need it. I'll be in contact when we have enough spare manpower to lend you a hand. Until then, keep out of sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small click ends the call. Morgan sighs as he hangs the phone up, shaking his head a little. \u201cI was excited to get going, too...\u201d He mumbles to himself as he stands back up, slowly wandering back to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething up?\u201d You grunt and try to haul a large bag of luggage down the stairs, struggling to avoid letting it bang on every step on the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... I was gonna ask Vince to try to help us move, but it sounds like he's... predisposed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVince? Interesting choice. I'm surprised he'd be willing to help with something like that after everything that's happened.\u201d You chuckle and see Morgan grumble a little, crossing his arms in front of him and just glaring slightly at you. You grunt and drop the bag onto the ground before sitting on top of it. \u201cI guess that means we won't be getting that help traveling to your place, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d Morgan sighs a little, sitting back onto the couch. \u201cI was looking forward to showing you around...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, do you think we'd really be able to do that? I mean, trust me, I'd like to get to know your town as much as the next guy. But... are you sure it's safe for you to be out and about? And...\u201d You reach forward, a slight grin on your face as your hand presses against Morgan's arm before pulling him in tight. \u201cYou think people are gonna be able to ignore your big body, your thick arms and your firm chest pushing out while you walk?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin as you hear a murmur coming from him, and just keep smiling as he picks you up. \u201cI guess I'm gonna stand out a bit, huh? Maybe I shouldn't get big before walking around publicly...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if you weren't, you might end up attracting your kidnappers again if you're out and about all of the time. We still have to figure out how we can do that, huh? And I wouldn't really be able to go out without you, unless I wanted a dozen questions about what I'm doing there in anthro lands.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's expression sunk a little, and he sighed. \u201cI was looking forward to showing you around my neighborhood, too. Would've been nice to just head out to the park or grab lunch together or something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... I'm sure we'll figure something out.\u201d You smile and give him a quick peck on his cheek. \u201cBesides, the big, strong bird's gonna fight off anybody else who tries to get their hands on his massive back, isn't he?\u201d You hear Morgan mumble a little more, his legs shifting as he tries to keep himself upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGheeze... We're gonna be busy before we have a chance to leave, aren't we...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and lean in a little more, placing your head onto Morgan's shoulders. \u201cI thought this might happen. Actually...\u201d You pull yourself up a little more, whispering to Morgan, grinning as your hands rest against his shoulders.</span></div></div>",

What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closen your face in front of Morgan's, \"Do you, know what they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan just stares at you for a moment. His frown then turns into a smirk. He grabs you with both his big arms and pulls you in so that your body was against his large pecs. \"Do I really have to ask?\" Morgan lets your body loose. You then go right ahead, feeling Morgan's muscular neck. Caressing Morgan's rounded and thick trap muscles. Morgan then tenses up his neck, making his muscles thicken and ripple out right in front of you. You blink your eyes, and then you look up at Morgan, who stares at you with that same smirk on his face. \"Go ahead. You feel. I flex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan holds out his thick left arm in front of you. You stare down at his arm, and then look back up at Morgan. He gives you quick wink. Your cheeks blush a little red, but then you smile. You start to feel Morgan's arm, your left hand feeling his forearm and your right hand caressing the unflexed bulge that Morgan's bicep. \"Heh... Even when relaxed, your muscles still feel thick and dense.\" You hear a grumble come from Morgan, then you watch and feel as his arm starts to throb out some. Making him clench his fist into a ball. You just keep your hand rested on his throbbing arm. \"Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grins, \"Feels nice every time.\" He raises his showing arm and flexes it. As you continue feeling, he continues slowly pumping his arm. With each pump, his arms muscles thicken out a bit more each time. \"Alright.\" Morgan relaxes his arm, and then sets his hands against his sides to do a wide lat spread. He bounces his pecs a few times, \"Now why don't you give these guys some love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan winks at you again. \"Heheh.\" You begin feeling the outer reaches of Morgan upper body, mainly his large thick lats. \"But of course. I wouldn't forget about your big round lats.\" You then start to shift your hands up and down Morgan's abdominals, \"And these abs are rock-hard! So pumped and well-defined.\" You then move up to Morgan's chest, getting a good feel of his large pecs. \"And your chest...it feels so tight...so...meaty...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...good!\", Morgan suddenly finishes for you. Morgan starts to growl and clench his teeth as you watch as the muscles in his upper body start to expand and grow some more. After a few more seconds of growth and tensing, Morgan's muscles started to relax and was panting a little heavily. \"Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Morgan opens his eyes, and then looks down to you. Your cheeks were still a little red and you were looking back at him with a smile on your face. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stares at you for a moment, and then puts a bit of a sinister grin of his face. He pulls you in and carries you to give you another bear hug. \"You know I am.\" After his hug, Morgan sets you down beside him. \"You ready too feel the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin in response. You start feeling Morgan's enormous thighs. You even gripped parts of Morgan's quads a few times. Morgan in turn tenses out both his legs. His massive thighs pumped out even more, stretching the fabric in the shorts he was wearing a lot. \"I love your legs so much. They're so powerful, so veiny, I bet they're strong enough to bench-press this entire house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\", Morgan moans as his legs start to grow more plump. Morgan's shorts were especially starting to stretch out more than it can handle. Morgan didn't seem to mind at all as he laid his head back and said with a bit of a toothy grin, \"Yesss... Heh. Anyone tell you you're amazing at what you do?\" Morgan suddenly hears a loud ripping noise. \"Gih!\" Morgan looks down towards his legs. His thunder thighs were now completely revealed. Morgan felt a little awkward, saying to you as he closed his eyes, \"... Oops. Those shorts of yours didn't cost too much did they? Gah...!\" Morgan's eyes were surprised open. The first thing he spotted was your hand...which was holding Morgan's slowly growing member. Your cheeks start to turn red as you both just watched as Morgan's member just kept filling a little more and more. Morgan was having a hard enough time trying to keep it from growing on his own. \"...Allen...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your attention on Morgan's pulsating manhood. You then look up at Morgan with a grin on your face. \"Morgan...we both know this isn't gonna be the first time I'll see it. Plus, it's almost like you're wearing a speedo now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan sighs smiling. He begins patting your head with his left hand, \"Getting into it a little quickly, are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a little more as you lower your head a bit, \"Mm... We don't have to if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan just looks at you with a warming grin on his face. He then says...</span></div></div>",

Morgan grins back at you. He then says as he gets up and out of the couch, \"Good.\" Morgan turns his to you, \"'Cause it's actually kind of tough for me to not touch myself here at this moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Morgan was staring at you with a pretty serious look on his face, but then he smiles. You pretended not to be amused, \"Touch yourself, I'll make sure you're no longer mobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughs loudly, \"Hah hah! Alright, alright.\" Morgan turns away with an eyebrow cocked, a hand underneath his chin and a smirk on his beak, \"Although, I am curious about the idea. Would I end up being an immobile hulk, or will I still be a mobile 500-pound, muscular titan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up beside Morgan, tugging on his thick left forearm and say as if you were getting impatient, \"You gonna head outside or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glances down towards you, and then says as he lowers his head towards yours, \"You first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, \"Heh.\" You walk up to the sliding door, Morgan following behind you. You slide the door open all the way in hopes that Morgan doesn't get stuck. You walk out the door, down the patio stairs, and then stop to turn back around. \"Alright Morgan. Whenever you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan goes right ahead, but was only able to stick his head and the right part of his body out. \"? Uh, wait a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait patiently for Morgan, but then you start to hear creaking noises coming from your house. \"Uh, Morgan?\" You wait a little more, only hearing more and louder creaking sounds. \"Morgan? D-don't try too hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's either gonna happen out there or in here!\", Morgan yells. After a moment of waiting, Morgan was able to squeeze himself out of the sliding doorway, nearly falling down the stairs. Morgan wipes a hand across his forehead, \"Phew. I know I might be bigger than before, but wow.\" Morgan turns toward you, \"Now then.\" Morgan jumps up, rolling his entire body twice in midair before he lands a few feet in front of you. Causing the ground to shake a bit as well. Morgan wraps his massive arms around you, \"Where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink your eyes, \"... Whoa! Since when were you so agile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you have wings, fly a lot, and just so happen to have a pumped up bod, you tend to learn a few things while soaring through the sky.\", Morgan says proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare Morgan, \"Riiight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!\", Morgan exclaims. \"You want I take you for a long, dizzy ride across the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare a bit at Morgan, \"No. I'm good.\" You place a hand on Morgan's half-erect member, \"Besides, I don't think your big, strong body is in any condition to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that sentence, Morgan's member throbs in your hand. \"Gih!\" It also caused Morgan to unwrap his arms from around you and tilt his head up as his entire throbbed a bit as well. Morgan moaned in pleasure, \"Aughhh...\" It also made Morgan back away from you a bit as he bowed his upper body down to try not to lose his grip. He slowly looks up back to you, and then says with a toothy grin, \"Curse...you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groped the air twice. \"Hey, you were askin' for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stands up straight, with a grin still on his face. He walks up to you, then placing his hands on his hips. \"Alright. So what part of me do you want to feel first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan with a smile on your face for a moment. You then look down at Morgan's massive and thick thighs and calves, which he tenses a bit once he noticed you looking down at them. \"Heh. It's a bit of a no-brainer, but let's start from the ground up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Morgan goes ahead and sits on the ground. You looked a bit confused at first, but then grin along with him as he sits up straight. \"Your wish is my command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go ahead and kneel down so that you were now standing on both knees. You turn your head to Morgan's left leg. Morgan in turn stretches out his left leg, and flexes it as much he could so that dozens of veins would start to accompany it. You start out by wrapping both your hands around Morgan's plump calf as he flexed it a few times in your hands. \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan brings his head in closer to yours. \"Talk to me Allen. How do my muscles feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Your legs...they feel so firm, and...so meaty...\" You start to feel Morgan's calf throb out a bit as you continued to speak, \"It feels...so firm. So magnificent.\" You hear Morgan moan a bit in pleasure, and then you start to feel Morgan's right thigh with your left hand. \"And your thighs...they're what make your strong, pumped legs really shred out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan begins to moan a little more, \"Ohhh...\" His thighs were starting to stretch out as well, which only made him flex both his legs at once as hard as he could. \"My legs are big...! They only want to be felt some more...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Morgan's legs were being flexed and slowly growing some more all around you. Both legs were shredded and rippling with many continents of muscles and you started running a hand along both of his treetrunk legs. \"Yeah. They're big alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that sentence, Morgan's legs bulged out one more time, making the shredded muscle in his legs bigger. Morgan continued making pleasureful moans as his head was tilted up. He says as his teeth were clenched, \"Nnng...! Yeah... Feel like I can run an entire football a couple dozen...no, couple hundred times! !\" Morgan looks down to you. You were wrapping your arms around his sides, making the best effort he could to get as much of Morgan's dense back as you could. Your face was also set against Morgan's rock-hard abs. \"You want I give you back a good bearhug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head up to look at Morgan's, \"Heh. It's okay. Just be sure to stretch that massive back of yours as much as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel Morgan's back muscles expand a bit, causing Morgan to let out another moan. \"Ah... Alright. But the view from there is horrible. You best take a seat behind to get better look. I promise not to let my wings get in the way.\" You nod your head in response. You unwrap your arms from Morgan's sides and stand up. You walk over Morgan's massive leg and walk around him to kneel in front of Morgan's large and thick back. Morgan raised his wings up as he placed his hands on his hips to stretch his back out as much as he could. His back muscles stretched out with great size and definition. An impressive V-shape was also showing as he kept his pose. Morgan looks back to you with an eyebrow cocked, \"Does this look impressive enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Yeah.\" You raise an hand up to feel Morgan's upper back, \"But, I'm sure your large thick back muscles can get larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Morgan growl, which causes you to look up towards the back of his head. \"You...might wanna take a step back...\" Morgan lounges his body forward. You get a great view of Morgan's back muscles as they start rise up and expand a bit. Morgan then raises his body up, \"Aurgggh...!\", with that, Morgan's neck muscles also expanded and hardened. \"Mm... That feels much better.\" Morgan looks down to you with and eye open, \"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already sitting beside Morgan, carrying his right arm in your hands. You look up at Morgan, \"My I, see your other arm?\" Morgan smiled, nodding his head in response. He brings his left arm around beside his right, so you were now holding his left arm with your left hand. You stare at them for a moment before speaking. \"Grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinks his eyes, \"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak again. \"Grow.\" Morgan's clenches his fists, already aware of what's happening as you say one more time, \"Just grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's arms begin to tense and flex on their own. Different parts of his arms throbbed out a bit, and then swelled out altogether. It wasn't long until Morgan now had a pair of hardened pipe arms with great size and definition. Morgan raises his left arm up to feel his bicep with his right hand, \"Wow... Impressive\", Morgan says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one part left.\" Morgan looks down to you. You then hold out your arms. \"Care to give me a lift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiles, and then nods his head in response. He wraps his meaty arms around you, picking you up without any effort. He carries you close enough to his chest so you would be able to reach it. You hold you arms, \"Oh and please...\", you look up at Morgan, \"...no one-word sentences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You lower your head, \"Ah... You're killing me!\" You raise your head and smile, \"But, okay.\" You begin feeling Morgan's pumped chest and hardened abs, \"Besides, it wouldn't take much to make that sizzling massive chest of yours puff out. Or these juicy hard abs to have another row of abdominals to be added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment's thought, Morgan's chest tightened up, and then pumped right out! Forming a pair of plump veiny pecs. His abs also began twitching, then filling out to gain a fifth row of abs. Morgan moans once again, \"Ooh... That's the ticket. ...\" Morgan looks down to you, \"Wait. 'Sizzling'? 'Juicy'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were smiling at Morgan, while still in hi arms. \"Heh. Hey, I'm hungry for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lowers his head, \"Now you're just sounding cheesier.\" Morgan sets you back down on the ground, and then he gets himself up. Now standing about half-a-foot taller than before. Morgan sets his hands on his hips, \"Man...does this feel great.\" 'Riiip!' \"!!\" Morgan looks down, only to see his half-erect foot-long member pointing right in front of Allen. He looks at you, noticing your now-blushing face. He looks up at you, and then, Morgan smiles.</span></div></div>",

After everything you've seen, I'm surprised that you haven't jumped me yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uh... I kinda...\" You mumble a little awkwardly, but Morgan just laughs, using the chance to move in front of you, holding his arm and flexing it firmly, letting you see the bicep swell up right in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Allen... You know you want to. I've gotten this massive for you, you know... Besides, you've already gotten your hands all over me... We might as well take it to the next level together...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly blush, staring right at Morgan's body while he moves again, changing to another pose, his arms both spreading out, displaying his lats for you, turning to show you his thick, firm back. \"M-maybe...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No 'maybe' about it... I know how much you want this...\" With a grunt, Morgan tries to flex all of his body, everything pumping out. He's easily the biggest bird you've ever seen now... Quite possibly the biggest one in the world now. \"And...\" He grins as his shaft is completely stiff now, over a foot long and thicker than you had expected. \"As you can tell, I want it too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what else to say. You wordlessly step closer, both of your hands moving down to try to grip at his length, struggling to hold it. You hear a soft, lustful moan coming from Morgan as you hold him. \"Yeah... I do. You sure about this, big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been sure for a while now...\" Morgan pulls you in tight against his body, his arms both holding you tightly in place even while your hands cling to his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Oh? You've been eager to show me this thick, massive cock for a while?\" You hear a soft murmur, and you could swear you feel his length throb in your grip, a steady drip of pre now flowing from it. You're not even sure if it's growing larger or if he's getting a full erection, but the feeling of his length swelling in your hands excites you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugh... You...\" You grin before pressing your mouth to Morgan's, your tongue sliding against his maw, the two of you awkwardly pressing around, doing your best to kiss each other. You can feel him firmly working in, his beak pressing against you. It must be tricky for him to avoid giving you a few pecks, but the feeling is intense and wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss eventually breaks, the two of you both grinning widely as you look at each other. \"Lemee... Get my clothes off... If your morning in the shower is any indication, then there's no way that they'll stay dry otherwise... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan moans out louder, grunting as a hand reaches down to help keep his shaft ready and waiting. \"Mmmmm... You know you like it... Seeing how virile I am... Knowing I've got a load big enough to fill a tub...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a bit as you quickly toss off your shirt and pants. \"Yeah... It was awesome. And I hope that... That you still...\" You blush deeper as you remove your undergarments, throwing them aside. It made you feel awkward exposing yourself to Morgan like this, not knowing what the massive bird would think as he sees all of you. However, he just gives an approving whistle, moving closer and immediately wrapping his arms around you, picking you up and holding you up, your body now pressing directly to his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, Allen...\" He chuckles and lets his pecs shift and bounce against your body, almost sliding you against his abs as he holds you. Even his shaft is large enough to rub against your rear and your back while he hugs around you like this. \"I might be bigger, but you're still quite sexy, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-morgan...\" You mumble awkwardly, your own excitement growing as he holds you like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.... That you poking me, now?\" He grins as one thick arm moves from your back, grabbing tight at your length while the other keeps you tightly in place. You can only mumble your confirmation as he gives you a slow, firm pull, your shaft beginning to react as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chuckles as he holds you, a naughty look in his eyes as he whispers to you. \"Well, if you're this excited as well, then we'll be sure to have a good time together. I'm thinking...\" You blush deeper as Morgan leans in closer, your body barely able to move as he speaks to you. </span></div></div>",

It's just...it seems like a lot of take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rolls his eyes, \"Yeah. I'll say.\" He feels you jump in his arms again, only this time more noticeably. Morgan bursts out in laughter, kneeling down on one knee as he sets you down on the ground. As he continued his roar of laughter, you just kept your attention on bouncing length. Once Morgan's laughter slowed to a stop, so did his bouncing shaft. Morgan wiped a tear from his eye as he looked down to you. You still had your eyes on his erect length. \"You didn't set me up for that, did you.\", he says with a smile. Morgan stares at you for a moment, and then starts running a hand up and down his thick member, which was starting to leak some more. \"Hey. What's up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink your eyes, and then shake your head. You look up at Morgan, \"Huh? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan asks with a smile as he still ran his hand up and down his length, \"It's not gonna be a problem, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Uh... Well I...\" You suddenly hear a moan coming from Morgan. You look up at him to see the pleasureful look on his face, and then down to him and his throbbing shaft. \"! Wait, are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out Morgan was slowly stroking himself. \"It's either gonna be one thing or the other. You pumpin' it for me, or me pumpin' myself. Nng... Better think fast. I think I'm about to blow soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan's throbbing shaft for a moment longer. You were noticing a couple veins starting to form and pulsate around Morgan's manhood. He even watched as his erect member seemed to have elongated just a bit more! \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's length was starting to leak more than before. He moaned a bit louder this time as he raised his slowly filling member, \"Nnngaugh...! Guess it'll have to be me again--\", you suddenly grab Morgan's stroking arm, which stops Morgan from stroking anymore, \"--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your head down, \"Alright! Alright. Mm...I'll do it.\" You look up at Morgan with a pouty look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiles as he sets his arm down, \"I knew you'd come around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up at him, bending your arms back against your sides, \"Geez. Why don't you be a man and wait a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you with an eyebrow cocked up, \"I've been waiting since breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You didn't really have much to say. You just look at Morgan's pulsating manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinks at you, \"...\" He notices the expression on your face. You looked pretty uncertain about what to do at this point. Morgan puts a hand under your cheek to raise your head to look up at him. \"Hey, Allen? I just want you to know, I'm not forcing you to do anything. If you're not comfortable about this, then I wouldn't want to make you do it.\" Morgan smiles at you, \"I'm really just giving you a choice here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan with a fairly unhappy smile on your face for a moment. It then suddenly turns into a smile, \"Heh.\" Morgan blinks at you. You then caress Morgan's hand with both your hands. \"When I said I'll do it, I really meant it.\" You set down Morgan's hand, and then you slowly run your hands down Morgan's thick length until you were now gripping the near tip of his shaft. \"Just...try to show a little restraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon gripping Morgan's erect member, you noticed it was still leaking a bit. But that didn't startle you at all. You stick out your tongue, and then start to licking the tip of Morgan's length. You were even welcoming the small amount of pre that was entering your mouth after each lick. This startles Morgan a bit, \"! Urrrgh...!\" Morgan begins to moan as you continue licking his manhood. He flexes both his treetrunk legs as his length was starting to tighten up as well. The rest of Morgan's body was soon starting to tense up as well. \"Arrrugh...!\" You stop licking to look up at Morgan, getting a great view of each of his muscles that were still tightening out from the sensation he received. \"Nng... Damn... Your tongue feels small, but I guess my pride-and-joy is sensitive enough for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Morgan's throbbing length as Morgan held it up with one hand. \"... Hey, Morgan. About your...heh, you know.\" Morgan opens his eyes. He then lowers his eyes to keep his full attention on you.</span></div></div>",

However, his grin widens as he hears you say those words, nodding and trying to hold still, his entire body surging and bulging out with the effort as you keep licking at the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might be able to try taking Morgan's length, but you can't help teasing a little more first. Your lips only press and smear against the tip, your tongue still sliding slowly but steadily. His pre keeps dripping out in copious amounts, sliding into your mouth or over your lips. You lick a bit more over Morgan's length, trying to get him lubed up and ready. Your tongue slides casually over the head of the length, before taking your time to lean in and slide your mouth all the way to the base, leaving a small kiss neat the base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uuuugh... Allen... That's... Just...\" Morgan tries to reach down, starting to grab at his length. However, a quick tap from your hand stops him. You just grin as your hands move to the base of his length, more than enough room for them while you keep licking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opens up now, and your efforts begin in earnest. It takes a huge effort, and you have to stretch your mouth out just to try to start taking him in. You can see Morgan straining and trying not to squirm, the feelings sending his body into overdrive as he pants and groans, his body even looking like it's still shifting out, still pumping heavier and wider and thicker while you handle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands keep him nearly still the entire time. You grip and tease near the base, but they slowly begin to move and well, a gentle rub at the base of his shaft keeping him completely erect and eager for more. One slowly moves down the length of his massive shaft, before you use it to try to hold the tip in place. Even with that, it feels like every motion his shaft makes would be enough to push you around a bit. Taking another deep breath, your mouth opens and starts to press in, the taste and scent of Morgan's masculine musk filling your senses as you begin to work. It takes a while before you finally manage to get the tip of it in, and even that much takes all of your efforts. But you manage it, and Morgan's got an ecstatic expression on his face your tongue easily presses around, your mouth sliding and working against his tip. His load is only growing more and more ready with each passing second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... Allen, that's... Ah... So good...\" Morgan's breathing hard now, and you can see his massive chest rising and falling with every breath he takes. He's struggling not to really let loose, his entire body shaking as he holds onto you, trying to keep his composure. \"You've got a talented mouth, little guy...\" He isn't able to resist a chuckle, though a small glare and a quick squeeze with your lips gets him to quiet down while you keep working, your hands now gripping at the length of his shaft while your mouth keeps pushing and slurping at his sensitive, dripping length. You know that it won't take much more of this for him to lose it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen the moment you feel his load coming. With barely a moment to think, you quickly decide...</span></div></div>",

He's about to blow, and you better prepare yourself for it! You look down to the bottom of Morgan's thick shaft, your eyes widening in response. You can actually see member fill up from the bottom up until the tip started leaking out some more than usual. \"Gahhh...!\" This enormous feeling causes Morgan to arch his upper body back as he growled with pleasure, his pecs stretching and flexing right out the most. You watched as Morgan began to sweat a lot from the resistance, sweat running down his stretched chest and abdominals. Morgan's hands were shaking so much, he was even trying to reach for his enlarged length again. Morgan says while his teeth were clenched, \"Can't...hold...it...!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was now caressing his length with both his large hands. You were about to stop him, but you felt he's, 'suffered', enough. You watched as Morgan started stroking his massive shaft with both of his hands, which were barely large enough to reach around his entire length. Morgan kept his head down, watching as he slowly pumped himself more and more as more pre was leaking from his member and dripping down on his hands. \"I...\", you look up at Morgan, \"...I...feel so strong... So...powerful... So...horny...\" He notices you off the corner of his eye, but he keeps his attention on his pulsating length. \"Sorry Allen. I...don't think I can hold it...nng...anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you watched as Morgan's body began to throb as he was about to go through another growth spurt. Morgan's left bicep bulged, then started throbbing out a bit, and then bulged out. Along with his left shoulder, his tricep, his forearm, and then his left hand, which gripped his length harder. Morgan stretches his upper body back as he moans out loud, \"Nnaugh!\" Morgan's body suddenly shifts to the right, his right shoulder, bicep and tricep, forearm, and hand also being stimulated with growth. Morgan's growling moans start sounding tougher as the muscles in his neck started stretching out more as well. As Morgan was panting with his chest and abdomen rising and falling, they seemed to rise a little more and more each time as they were going through his growth. You look down to Morgan's legs, which were flexing out right now, but only shredded and rippled out more with each flexing motion. He suddenly starts to cross his legs, bringing you in so your body would be rubbing up against Morgan's shaft. Morgan groans out once again with you rubbing up against his meaty length, \"Nnng...! ...Allen...\", he looks down to you, \"...you feel nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, one of the most wonderful things happens. You can already feel Morgan's heartbeat from the feeling of his faster pulsating shaft. He could hear the blood gurgling within his shaft. Your entire body could feel Morgan's manhood slowly grow more, and more, and more! Morgan was sure to burst any second now! You stand up on your two feet, and then set a hand on the tip of his length. This takes him by surprise, then looking down to you. You smile. \"Let me, just try this.\" You stick out your tongue and slowly start licking the tip of Morgan's still dripping shaft. It may not look like much but Morgan was definitely able to feel it. You continued licking some more, Morgan's length starting to throb as it was about to reach its limit. You shifted your hands along Morgan's thick meat, feeling the large amount of juice filling up to the top. At that moment, you open your mouth wide to cover Morgan's leaking length. You start to suck on it as much you could, as the semen that was filling your mouth was also dripping out of if. Morgan groaned out one more time, as he felt his massive length start to get surrounded by many snaking veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Morgan thinks to himself, as if everything in time came to a pause, \"Allen...you really are good at what you do.\" Morgan grins. As everything went back to normal, Morgan yells out as his climax was reached. Your cheeks start filling up more with Morgan's thick milk, but you weren't able to hold out for long. You get thrown back a few feet as Morgan's climax was still erupting out of his enlarged meat. He arched his back forward so his massive length stuck out while still releasing his bird juice all over the place. His fingers were also jabbed into the ground as his climax was still going for half a minute now! His body was being covered by his own milk as it rained all over him. As his juice was spewing out, his body was slowly starting to revert back to his normal self. His release still continued on for another minute! By the time his member finished release what left he had, his body was back to normal. Although he did appear a bit bigger than when he last reverted, but still not noticeably enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was still panting heavily as his chest was raising up and down. He opens his eyes, and then scours the area around him. There was so much semen everywhere. Morgan was hardly able to believe it. \"Uheh. I guess I had a lot more in me than I thought.\" He looks in front of him. There you were, lying on the ground, covered in Morgan's bird juice. You appear to be outcold. \"!! Allen!\" Morgan quickly runs to your side. He begins shaking you a few times to try to wake up, but you still remained motionless. He cradles you in his arms, \"Oh god... What have I done? I, I hope he's okay... I mean, I know he wanted it. I'm sure he did too, it's just, I, I hope I didn't take it too far.\" He looks down to you, and then back up. \"I hope I wasn't too hard on you. I...I hope...\", he suddenly gets a surprise, \"!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprise he got was a kiss from you, that he received under his beak. \"As I said before, you taste really nice. I guess I couldn't keep my mouth off you. And, I guess I didn't succeed either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stares at you for a moment, and then he grins. He starts nuzzling your cheek, \"Heh. You did great.</span></div></div>",

You were standing in your backyard with a hose in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other, spraying water all over the once semen-coated place. The last thing you sprayed water against was a nearby tree from the top down. You switch off the hose, and then take a sip of your coffee. \"Ah...\" Later, you slid the back door of your house open then enter inside and closed the door behind you. You set the coffee on a small table in front of the couch, and then you fall back on it, \"Ahhh... Thirty minutes of watering...mm...that mess.\" Suddenly, you start hearing the sounds of taloned making their way downstairs. You opened your eyes a little, but you were too tired from watering the plants, and, gettin' to know each other more. You slowly close your eyes back, and then you hear Morgan's footsteps walk right past you. You then hear a soft thud come from your couch, which must have been Morgan taking a seat right next to you. You open your eyes half way as you turn your head to him, \"He big guy. How're you...gih!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had his left arm out and flexed right in front of you. I didn't seem as hard and pumped as before of course, but it was still pretty interesting. Morgan was noticing this as well, as he then began rubbing his chest and abs with his right hand. \"Hmm... This sure is interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...um...wha's goin' on here?\", you looked away while stuttering aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glances at you with a grin on his beak, \"Heh. Haven't you noticed?\" Morgan brought his arms down so that he held his hands together over his abdomen, tensing his arm and chest muscles, \"I'm just gettin' bigger every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance away as if you were aggravated, \"Ugh, you're so full of yourself. And why you wearin' m'dad's pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I don't know.\" Morgan raises his right leg over his left so he was sitting indian style, \"To be honest it was just something that was lying around that could fit, so I decided to wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. You then lay your head back so that you were lying on Morgan's lap. \"Fine. Just be sure to slip before...\", you look away, and then back at Morgan with a grin, \"...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stares at you with a warming smile on his beak, and then he lowers his head down so that he could playfully peck you on your cheek, \"Sure. No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan even starts to nibble at your nose with his beak. I didn't hurt, it just feels...nice. All of a sudden, there was a knock at the door. This catches you both by a bit of a surprise, \"!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit right up on the couch, \"There's someone at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get up to walk towards the door, Morgan immediately gets up and runs right past you, \"Wait up!\" You blinked your eyes, staring at Morgan with a confused look on your face. He for some reason picks up a crowbar that just happen to be right near the door, \"There we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a finger at it, \"Hey, I was lookin' all over for that. What're you gonna do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan backs up against the closet so that he was out of sight from the doorway, \"If Vince is at the door, I'm gonna use this crowbar, and then...eh, well, you know.\" You sigh at Morgan. \"Don't worry! If I nail Vince on the head at least once I promise I'll leave him alone forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another knock at the door. You walk right over to answer, \"Just wait 'til I least call out who it is first!\" You grab ahold of the doorknob, and then swing the door right open. \"! Officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" Morgan turns his head towards the direction of the door, \"What?! Oh crap!\", he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen kept his cool while going though this. \"How can I help you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for an escaped avian. A blue-feathered eagle to be more specific.\" The officer glares at Allen intently, \"Have you seen him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen glares back for a moment. Morgan froze where he stood, still readying the crowbar in his hand. Allen shrugs his shoulders while turning away a bit, \"Heck if I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer still held his glare at you, \"Hmph. You're not <i>hiding</i> anyone in there, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, this is like the second time this month you've stopped by. Do you really have drive all the way out here just to check up on me every time an anthro happens to be spotted in the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't like this anymore than you do! I can't believe your dad is still helping those...freaks of nature!\", the officer yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\", Morgan yells to himself, clenching the crowbar in his hand harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen just kept his cool still, not looking at the aggravated officer. \"I don't know what your father was trying to do getting tangled with those freaks, but he and everyone one of them is better off dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence. You remained for a moment, but then glance at the officer and say, \"Are you done here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer stares at you with that same glare on his face, and then says as he turns and walks away, \"Piece o' crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You shut the door. You walk over to the window and shift the curtains a bit, making sure the officer leaves in his squad car, which he did. You leave the curtains and sigh. You walk over to Morgan, \"They just don't know you guys at all, huh. ?\" The crowbar drops to the floor, which you look down at. The part of the crowbar Morgan was holding was scrunched in a lot. You look back up at Morgan, \"Morgan?\" His face just looked dark and shadowy. You couldn't tell the expression on Morgan's at all. You reach out and grab Morgan's wrist, \"Hey, you okay?\" </span></div></div>",

No pupils, just, red. \"Morgan, are you okay? What's wrong?\" The burly falcon raises his hand and slaps you away on the cheek, throwing you back a bit to the floor. A pretty bad bruise was left behind on your cheek. You stumbled to get up and looked back at your avian friend. It was like, he was in some kind of rage and couldn't control it, slowly walking up to you like a angry zombie. \"M-...Morgan?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" That last call to him must have gotten to into his head, 'cause once he stares down at you injured on the floor his eyes blinked, \"!!\", and he was out of his furious rage. \"Oh my god, Allen!\" Morgan quickly ran to your side, dropping to his knees and lightly helping you up. \"What the hell happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

I'm, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, your small frown turns to a big grin. You when and slapped Morgan on his shoulder. \"Hey, don't worry about it big guy.

How can you be so cheerful after what I just did?!\", the avian screams with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned away a bit, still looking back at Morgan while cupping your injured cheek, \"Hey, it's just a small bruise. I mean yeah, it hurts, but it's nothing to be worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly WHY I'm worried!\", Morgan objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly pat your hands on Morgan's beak, which calmed him down. \"It's okay Morgan.

Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bird sets you on the couch with care, and then bends down a bit on his knees to stare at the bruise he had left behind. \"Now, I want you to open your mouth. Wide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled uneasily. \"Well I, suppose I can take you in even after my predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry vein appears on the side Morgan's head, and then he sticks a finger under and over your lips, \"That's not what I meant.\" Morgan opens your mouth for you, skimming the inside to make sure nothing has been broken and/or is out of place.

I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the sad avian for a moment, but then try to comfort him. \"Morgan, what happened back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...\" It was pretty hard for Morgan to recollect his thoughts. \"Honestly...I just don't know. I just remember getting angrier and angrier at that asshole at the front door, and then...it was like my whole body was burning up. Like, I was filling up with rage and I just needed to let it all out.\" Morgan turns his head to you, his saddened expression even making you feel sad. \"Then, when I saw you lying on the floor hurt...I guess that's what snapped me out of it.\" Morgan arches his body forward, covering his face with his hands. \"Allen...I'm so sorry.\" You stared at the hurt bird for a moment, and then let out a sigh. Suddenly, Morgan receives a pretty swift slap on the back of the head. Morgan turns to you, rubbing the back of his head, \"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now we're even.\", you remarked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allen, what was that for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slapped me, I slap you back. It's a win-win.\", you explained childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan leans forward while looking away, returning to his hurt state. \"That doesn't automatically make this kind of thing even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned up against the blue bird, wrapping your arms around as much of him as you could. \"Morgan, I told you. It's okay. I mean really, the only time you'd see me really hurt is if I had fallen down a cliff, er somethin' like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan frowns, \"Hrm... This isn't really helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want you to get angry like that again. Okay?\", you continued. \"Otherwise, I'd be seeing a strong and sexy bird like you becoming the incredible bird hulk a lot more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. NNG...!\" Morgan gritted his beak, feeling the muscles on his body start to stretch out and become more pronounced. The pants Morgan was wearing was even about ready to burst under the adding bulk on his legs, at least enough for the surrounding continents of muscles on his thighs and calves to <b>really</b> show underneath the seems. Morgan's own member was also being affected, which started to bulge out a bit as well. Now Morgan's pants were really starting to stretch as his words of growth came to a panting stop. Morgan catches his breath a bit, staring down his body to notice his added growth, and then at his legs, which were really starting to stretch the jeans he was wearing to the limit. The sexy bird then turns to you, noticing the slight blush appear on your cheeks. You tried to hide it, but he knows it all too well. Morgan puts a cocky smirk on to his beak,</span></div></div>",

Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly lift your head close to Morgan's beak, making eye contact with him. \"Well, yeah!\" You looked up at the avian, \"I mean, you've practically been wandering around the house half-naked this whole time anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smirks, \"Heh. Yeah, I guess that's true.\" The thick-built bird then decides to pull his shorts off slowly, letting your eyes take in as much as they could of what the bird is now packin' underneath those jeans that have now become a little tight for him. His tremendous thunder thighs, his blasted calves, his throbbing rod...it was all just so beautiful. Morgan was really liking it himself, and he knew you were too. The jeans the big bird was wearing drop around his ankles, and then manages to slip his clawed feet off. \"Ahhh... That feels so much better.\", that hunk of a bird remarks, stretching his thick muscles a bit before walking up to you. \"How do I look?\", he asks with a wink and a coy grin on his beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but blush noticeably before the muscly bird. The avian's beak was literally right in front of your, well, nose. Although, Morgan's sheer body was immense as he knelt on the couch with one knee while hanging his studly body right over you. Your body was back against the sofa while your head hung right between his thick, meaty arms. The sexy bird even takes notice of your glances, your eyes slowly shifting down his rippling bi's and tri's. Morgan even tenses up his arms, his veined biceps drawing ever so closer to you. God, how can such a massive falcon be so feathered and still be able to show off so much muscle!? Your eyes widened, \"Mm... Holy crap this is intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\", replies your bird, in a soft and sexy tone that you probably have not yet heard. Morgan then gently wraps his big, strong arms around your back, hugging your body even closer than before. \"...Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the eager bird's mouth, \"Wha...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grins, \"Heh. I feel somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... What do you mean?\", You uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Morgan carries you right up, and then whispers into your ear, \"I mean, I feel something stickin' out of ya, and pokin' me on the stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was long before you were realizing it yourself. \"...Ah...oh... I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big bird chuckles. \"Hey, you know how good that feels? Mm...!\" You felt Morgan's entire body tense up, along with his thickening length. It slowly throbbed and bobbed up, higher and higher, until it was rising up between you both. Morgan groans warmly, \"There we go. It feels great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just watched, watched at Morgan's hardened meat was throbbing up against you and him. And it was rather huge! And starting to drip too... \"Um...hey Morgan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighs. \"Jeez, and I thought you'd be over the whole making-my-house-a-mess thing by now.\" The large avian nods his head warmly. \"Alright, alright.\" Morgan walks over to the sliding back door while carrying you in his protective arms. He slides the door open, and then manages to squeeze himself out of there. He uses his wing to slide the door shut, and then takes a seat on the lowest patio step while setting you on his lap. \"There. It's always nice to get some fresh air anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" You were kind of at a lost for words at this point in time. Sitting outside on an overgrown falcon's lap who can grow as much as you want when you want, what more could you want? \"Morgan, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly interrupted by Morgan's mouth, which interlocked with yours. He even slowly rubs your hand against his meaty pecs, tensing them up every so often. You even went ahead groping the blue falcon's chest, only making the bird's lust start to rise. Morgan backs his head a bit from your satisfying kiss, \"Allen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... I couldn't help it, okay?\", you whined childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bird could only grin at your reply. \"Heheh.\" Morgan then looks out towards the direction of the waterfall. He even sees the sun was still shining pretty bright. \"Hmm...\" Morgan slowly gets up on his feet, with you still in his strong arms. \"Hang on.\" The massive avian then spreads his enlarged wings, with one flap of his wings, he manages to get himself and his lover in the air. With great speed and velocity, he brought you both to the waterfall in no time, then landing safely on to a rather small ledge that stuck out of the water. He then places you softly on to the rock formation, \"There you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You took a look around, scouring the area. \"Morgan, what're we doing here? I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the scenery and all...\" Morgan then kneels down on one knee right in front of you. You about to look up at Morgan's face, but not before taking a good look at the pumped bird's plump thighs. \"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...was wondering if we could do something out here.\" You stared intently at Morgan, waiting for an answer.</span></div></div>",

A few inches taller, Morgan was 8\u20193\u201d at least, and his arms and legs both were another inch around. He yawned. \u201cWhat, only an inch isn\u2019t good enough for those wrecking ball arms and legs?\u201d You asked him, both smiling as the arms and legs both gained another inch around. \u201cNo, it\u2019s 10:30 at night\u201d Morgan told you. \u201cOh, uh, yeah. We should probably go to bed now. And I think I\u2019m better than any old bed...\u201d he said, wrapping you against his chest in an extra tight hug.

You feigned sleep, and about 20 minutes later, you felt a finger flick you in the head. \u201cWake up, sweetie.\u201d You heard from Morgan\u2019s deeper voice. You slowly fluttered your eyes open, and he stood up, still hugging you. He was big before, but now he was utterly massive. A little over 9 and a half feet tall, his arms were probably 30 inches around now, and his chest was another 8 inches wider. You soon realized he took you outside, feeling a breeze hit your legs, as you were covered by him from the waist up. You managed to wriggle out of his grip, telling him, \u201cYou\u2019re hot and all, but I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were surprised when you had gotten the call. It had been months since you last heard from him, and you weren't exactly sure as to when you would get in contact with him again. However, as you packed a bit of luggage, you had a small smile on your face. It had been ages since Davur had contacted you, and you weren't going to risk losing contact with him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't heard from him every since the end of college, when he had signed up for some experiment or another. The entire thing had been very secretive, and you weren't sure about the details, but you weren't going to miss a chance to see the dragon. You were just glad for the chance to see your friend again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprising that the two of you had ever struck up a friendship. The only reason the two of you began talking to one another was because he had collided with you in the hallway while he was in a rush. It was quite something when you crashed into the biggest dragon at the school. It was a rather rough first impression for the two of you, and you weren't quite sure what to make of it when you saw the large red splotch on his white scales and light shirt. As you picked yourself up, you It only took the two of you a few moments to figure out that while there wasn't any serious injury, you had gotten a bit of a nosebleed. The mess had been enough to make him worry, and he had taken you back to his place until he was sure that you were okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't even sure how things had progressed from that stage. Although he always had plenty of people surrounding him and talking to him, and he was always busy at the gym, the two of you just bumped into each other enough for things to start progressing. You had gotten into the habit of carrying a small snack with you, and he was always a voracious eater. From there on, whenever you bumped into one another, it always seemed like the two of you had a few minutes to sit down and chat while he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was hardly enough for a stable friendship. But during those few conversations, you learned a lot more about him. Of course, he was working towards being a bodybuilder, but how he was trying to get a degree in physics just because he wanted a backup. On how he was determined to go through the entire thing on his own cash, which made it tough for him to really go out around the town. Even on how he was the first one in his family to really be out on his own. It wasn't a whole lot that was unusual, but you listened, and he just seemed happy that he had someone who was listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had just kept moving on from there. He invited you over a couple of times, and even though all the two of you did was just chat or watch TV, you had gotten used to each other. You had even accompanied him to the gym a few times, though it was painfully clear that you would have a lot of difficulty keeping up with him. Even with that, he was satisfied with you just trying to help him out. He always had a few eyes on him when he worked out, and after a while, you were one of them. But despite that, it amazed you that despite there being much stronger people around, he usually asked you to help spot him or to keep an eye on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a couple of years before two of you had become close friends. During your third year, the two of you had moved in together, and had taken care of one another. During that time, he seemed to work even harder. You didn't quite understand it. To you, he had always looked fine. He was easily the biggest person in the school, and everybody knew it. You had to admit that when you saw him coming back from a workout, or walking around without a shirt, he looked amazing. He had always laughed it off whenever he caught you looking, and though you were a little embarrassed, he had made sure that you were never intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of years, he kept working out and kept growing, and you were always the first to see it. Though he could easily get into almost every athletic team. Instead, he rejected them just to continue working on his body. He attracted plenty of attention, and you still remember hearing him talking about a few offers he had gotten once he had graduated. By then, the two of you had planned on being roommates if he was offered a job close to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that changed right before graduation. He had suddenly gotten an offer from some secretive scientific clinic, and he accepted it without a second thought. You still remember his expression upon reading the offer. His grin easily stretched along the full length of his muzzle, and he looked like he'd punch a hole through the ceiling if he tried to jump for joy. The offer that he had received didn't pay as much, but something about it made him simply ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little disappointed that he'd be going away, but you weren't going to let that get in the way when he was that excited. The two of you had split off since then, and you had settled into your new office job. Things had been calm, and while it was difficult to bear it, you were satisfied with life in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ever since that time, it was nearly impossible to get any details about him. He had only occasionally managed to get a couple of calls through to you, and they were always brief and vague. He couldn't ever talk about the details, and could only tell you not to worry. This time, however, things were different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't exactly sure what to make of it. Somehow, he had gotten you a chance to visit him. You weren't sure exactly what changed, but it was quite clear that something had changed. It was difficult for you to make out how he was feeling just from his voice. He seemed oddly subdued as he spoke. You would've though he would be in high spirits after confirming the visit, but it was nearly impossible for you to hear his tone of voice. You had to wonder exactly what happened, but as you drove out onto the location he had provided, you were just excited to see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drove, it was slowly becoming clear why Davur had such a difficult time getting in contact with you. You had to travel over numerous side roads to attempt to follow his direction, and after a certain point, you were driving upon dirt paths in order to try to follow along. If there was anything out here, it clearly wasn't a place that many people visited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you had to gape when you arrived. The building that you saw was an enormous, sturdy construction, and the place felt like there were room for thousands. There were a few security gates, and you couldn't easily get a good view into it. However, near the front, you could see a security camera hooked up near a speaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really certain what to do, so you simply parked the car and walked up near the front gate. You pressed the button, shifting a little awkwardly as you waited. However, you soon heard a fuzzy crackle from the speaker, followed by someone's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned a little, looking at the camera, but giving a small nod. \u201cY-yes, that's me. I'm here to visit Davur... He arranged for everything, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour response was an awkward silence. But before you could speak again, you received a small confirmation from the speaker. \u201cSomeone will be there to escort you in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gate opened slowly, making you swallow a little as you waited. You heard a slight rumble as the steel door pulled off to the side, a ferret in a lab coat nodding as he walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can leave your things in the car for now. Come with me.\u201d He only gave you a slight glance before starting to walk the other way, forcing you to run a little to catch up and keep pace. If he noticed, he didn't think much about it. He simply spoke as he walked onwards. \u201cThere are a few checkpoints to make sure that you wouldn't be a security risk. As you've probably guessed, this is a rather private facility. You're only here on Davur's request.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure exactly what that meant. Did Davur really become someone who had enough influence to get you into a place like this? You weren't sure what happened over the last couple of years, but there really wasn't anything for you to say at this stage. You figured you'd have to ask him yourself when you saw him. You had to wonder as you passed through all of the security and were guided down a few halls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you would soon find out exactly what had happened to him...</span></div></div>",

Davur's in here?\" You looked around a little, staring at the door. It seemed to have a rather secure bolt over it, with a keypad placed near the front. You glanced over, swallowing as you stared at it. You weren't sure why that type of security would be necessary. You jumped a little as you heard a few quiet beeps, noticing the ferret tap in a few numbers without a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be monitoring from another room, as Davur's bound to tell you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll... He's okay, right?\" You heard a few quiet tones go off as the door slid loose and started to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see for yourself.\" The ferret quietly placed his hand on his forehead and shook it a little as he stepped back, letting you try to peek your head in. You tried to look around the room, but the first thing you could really note was that the place was absolutely massive. It looked like the ceiling went up as high as the gymnasium at your college, and you weren't able to even glance over all of it before you heard a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pret? That actually you?\" You swallowed but gave a small nod. The voice was a deep, guttural growl, and it made you hesitate. However, you could recognize the slight, mild tint in it that made you relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davur... You're... You're here after all?\" You tried to glance about for him, grinning widely and stepping into the room as you saw him. \"That... you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like he had been in the middle of a few stretches when you had arrived. You could spot him sitting on the ground, but he was quickly picking himself up and rushing towards you. \"It <i>is</i> you! I'm glad you managed to find this place!\" You heard the door shutting behind you, a long beep holding for the moment as he approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he did, you had grown a little uncertain. It was a bit more difficult to make out his figure at a distance, but as he approached, it didn't take you long to realize that he had visibly changed. His scales were still white, but they seemed to have an odd, gray tint that showed when he moved. His wings were visible as he moved to you, clearly a bit higher and wider than they would normally be. However, as he approached, something more obvious was foremost in your mind. You got a very good look as he quickly zoomed closer, it quite clear that he had at least four or five feet on you by now, and that every bit of him was looking pumped. He had the same familiar look that he always had when he was fresh off of a workout, but even his quick steps towards you made his body seem to shift and press out more. As he reached within a few feet of you, one of his hands were held up towards you, shifting out and clearly packed with strength. Before you could even get a good look at him, your feet were off the ground as he picked you up, his arm around your back and side and his expression ecstatic as he pulled you to eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again, Pret! It's been... What, half a year?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You shook yourself out of your stupor as you heard his voice, and broke into a wide grin. \"Something like that, I think. It's been a while. I don't think phone calls are really the same as seeing you, though!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me! Been wanting a chance to meet for ages! It's been a bit of a pain to get permission, though!\" He just gave a hearty chuckle as he held you, his hand lightly patting your back. \"Work been going well for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. It's been a pretty steady thing. Couple of coworkers are a pain, but it's not too tough. I'd ask the same for you, but... Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Kind of obvious, isn't it?\" He grinned widely, holding you steady with one hand as he casually threw a pose with the other. \"I guess you can see why I wanted this job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shook your head a little as he did, though you still kept your smile. \"Just going to the gym wasn't enough for you, was it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a powerful, rumbling laugh as he held you, your body shaking a little as he held you in and pulled you closer. \"Hey, you should know that better than anybody!\" He gave your head a light bop, and you just shook your head quietly. \"I mean... A chance like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly did you get yourself into, anyways?\" You let your hand lightly rub where his hand had made contact, and you felt his grip release, your feet landing lightly on the floor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, then. You should probably grab a seat while I explain this.\" He kept a grin on you as he started to walk away, and you had to keep at a slight run to keep up with him. You followed him with a bit of effort, glancing over the place as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was definitely set up for him to live in. It looked like it had been set up as a studio, though everything was clearly set up for his use. The size of most of the furniture was a good deal larger than you were used to seeing, and it was rather clear that he was being monitored the entire time. You had managed to notice at least a few obvious cameras, though you thought you spotted a couple of smaller ones near the lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had noticed you staring at one of them, and let off a small chuckle. \"Yeah, they pretty much keep an eye on me almost all the time.\" He had a bit of amusement in his voice as he spoke. \"I mean, I get that they want to make sure things are working okay, but they might be going for a bit of overkill here. Think they monitor what I eat, what time I wake up and back, what time I take a shower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile a bit as you heard the casual tone he took to all of it. \"And here I thought you'd want people watching you all the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned a bit, nodding towards one of the few normal-sized chairs sitting near a rather large couch. However, instead of sitting it, he sat against the floor and laid his back against it. You sat down next to him, his head just meeting yours as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaaaaaaybe. I think they prod and poke at me enough without the cameras, though.\" He shook his head a little as he spoke. \"I mean, they measured me twice a day, have to take blood tests, have an injection of the growth serum every week, take scans on every little thing... I'm pretty sure that if I bumped myself in my sleep, they'd notice before I woke up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... That's... quiet something. Still, I suppose they want to keep an eye on you...\" You just quietly smiled and looked at him, though you couldn't help the nagging feeling in the back of your mind. \"And... And it's okay for you to tell me this? I mean, after the cloak-and-dagger stuff that I went through to get here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it's fine! They had asked about if I was going to tell you. It's a whole bunch of red tape, but we're in the clear! I had to make sure that your visit was going to be smooth and all! And... Well, obviously, I'm not going to be able to keep this a secret if you see me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I mean, the ten foot dragon tends to be a bit of a giveaway.\" You just leaned back into your chair, watching him shift a bit, his legs kicking out, looking like they'd easily knock a hole in the ground if he sent them downwards. \"So, what changed so suddenly? You've probably been eager to tell me this for months, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since the start! After all, I thought you'd be as eager to see this as I am!\" He chuckled and nodded, shifting up slowly. His body seemed to press a bit against itself as he stood, his strength showing in his steps. He crouched a bit as he approached, his grin wide as his muzzle brushed up against your ear. \"But... Well... Something's changed recently. They've stopped giving me the serum about a month ago, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" You weren't exactly sure what to say as you tried to turn, his body held inches away from you as he spoke. It was a bit of a distraction, but you heard his voice quite clearly as he gave you the news. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes perk up. You awake in a dark and slightly messing room. Your bed cover was wrapped around your body after tossing and turning so much. You slowly sit up on your bed as you softly grumble to yourself. You turn your head down towards your left to stare at your floor, which had a few pairs of shoes and slippers scattered around the floor. You didn't really worry about it much. Suddenly, a glimmer of light suddenly peers from the window right beside you. You slowly raise up the shutters, your eyes more than half closed from the amount of sunlight barging in. Within a minute or two, your eyes manage to dilate and open wide. You were living in a two story humble home. Behind your home, you were in view of a large beach shore and the Pacific Ocean. You smile. \"Always an eye opener.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the shore was being plowed by small waves of ocean water. You soon walk up to the shore as small waves start wetting your bare feet. It really only took you a couple minutes to come out dressed in your black and white surfer suit. Your hair was black and spiked down a bit. You were also carrying your yellow surfboard in your left arm and a pair of binoculars around your neck. You take a deep breathe, and then let it out, \"Ahhh... It's always a great sunny morning.\", you say with a smile. You position your self to run towards the water, \"Well, here we go...\", you quickly stop just as you held out your surfboard. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up straight and take a look through you binoculars out towards the sea. Looking through binoculars in its current zoom you were able to make out something floating out on the open water. \"What's that?\" You zoom in closer. Once you zoomed in close enough you how now spotted what looked like a humanoid body. \"Holy crap!\" You take off your binoculars and throw it don on the wet sand. You immediately run and throw yourself onto the water with your surfboard underneath you. You quickly paddle through the water and small waves to get to the floating body. With each paddle, your breathing grows faster and faster. Within a minute or two, you reach the floating figure. You get off your surfboard and pick up the figure, laying him on his stomach on your surfboard. You hurry back towards the shore as fast as you could. It took less longer for your to swim back since you had a little help from the small rising waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, you reach the shore. You quickly lay the figure on its back and hold out your arms to perform CPR, \"!!\" You take a closer look at the body, backing your hands away a bit. \"......It's a shark.\" An male anthro shark with grey skin to be exact. He had a shark fin on the back of his head and a pretty muscular build. His nose was pointed and rounded on the end, and stuck out a bit. The ends of his fingers and toes were pretty clawed-like. The only patch of clothing he had was a pair of dark-blue shorts. You examine the shark's head for a moment as you sat up on the beach with your hands on your lap. \"Wow... I've heard of these guys. Just never got to see one up close.\" You slowly skim down the shark's body. Examining a little more of him, until, \"!!!\" The shark had a deep and bloody gash on the left side of his abdomen. \"Oh shoot!\" You quickly feel the shark's neck with two left fingers. He was still breathing, but barely. \"Crap! I'll, I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly run off towards your two-story abode. A few seconds later, the shark suddenly slowly opens his eyes. He was barely able to open his eyes halfway. The shark just stared up into the sky. The sky had a few patches of clouds slowly passing by. He just lays there, staring at the blue sky for the time being. \"Mmph... Guess...this'll be the last time...I get to stare out at the sky... ...Mm...\" The shark slowly closes his eyes, \"...Least I was able to see out of the water...this time...\" Just before he closed his eyes fully, he caught a glimpse of you on the corner of his left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood beside him on your knees for a moment. And then you quickly unwrap a big roll of bandages. As you proceed to cover up the shark's wound you start to think to yourself, \"He woke up...to stare at the sky. ... Hopefully this won't be the last time.\" You look at the shark's face. You yell out to him, \"Hand in there! You're not gonna die! Just hold on! You hear me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around the shark soon fades black. In a matter of seconds, a small bunch of bubbles float up in front of him. After that, everything around him starts to turn clear blue. As more bubbles began floating upwards around him, he slowly opens his finally. \"Mm...\" Upon opening his eyes, the first thing he sees in a room. \"Hm?\" It was a fairly decorated room with a flat-screen TV, two couches, one bigger, one smaller, and brown floorboard. It looked more like someone's living room. \"... Where am I?\" The shark suddenly hears some tapping, \"!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark turns to his right, spotting you in front of him. \"Oh thank god! You're awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" The shark swims back, only to him the another wall of glass behind him, \"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry. I normally try not to tap the glass. You feelin' okay?\", you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharks starts to look around. \"Okay, where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're in my fish tank.\", you say with a happy smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark takes a look around. There was a lot of open space around him. \"This is a fish tank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fish tank actually stretches across half of your living room and stretches up to the ceiling. You start to scratch the top of your head, \"Oh. Yeah. I guess it's more of an aquarium than a fish tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I the only one in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Rick's in here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick? Who's Rick?\" A fairly large blue bass suddenly swims up in front of the shark, \"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my pet bass. Caught him about a month ago.\" You watch as the shark stares at the bass for a moment. \"Heh. He's saying hello to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" The shark turns to you, \"He also says it's lonely in here.\"</span></div></div>",

Please don't tell me I'm being experimented on again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not... Wait, 'experimented' on? Well, I'll explain first. I found you afloat on the ocean. Swam as fast as I could to get to you and managed to pull you to shore. I didn't realize you were a shark until I was about to perform CPR on ya.\" You point at the shark's covered wound, \"You had a pretty bad gash on the side of your abdomen, but I also managed to cover it up in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark looks down to it, \"Oh. I see.\" He felt his wound with his right hand, which caused him to grunt a bit in pain. \"Ah... Well, least it doesn't hurt as much anymore.\" The shark looks up at you, \"Hey, ya think you can get me outta here? I mean I may be a shark, but I don't necessarily need water to keep me alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure! Here, hang on.\" You press a button under the glass. In a few seconds, the water starts to drain on its own. The shark watched as the water around him was being drained. He also saw Rick quickly swim to the bottom of the tank. After half a minute the water drains, leaving the shark to now be walking on the artificially colored rocks. The shark also saw Rick now swimming in a small water tank under the aquarium. \"There you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark looks up at you, \"Huh? So, how do I get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point, \"To your left. You can push the glass open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark looks to his left. He walks up to the glass, and then pushes it open. \"Ah! So this is how you clean your tank.\" The shark jumps out of the aquarium and on to the floor, but then grunts in pain, \"Gah! Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to his side, \"Whoa! Easy!\" You hold on to the shark's right arm, \"Here. Let me help you to the couch.\" You both slowly make your way towards your couch, the shark covering his wound with his left hand. You finally help the shark sit in the couch, \"Here, sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark lounges on the couch, still covering his wound, \"Ahhh... Couch feels nice. Good thing too. I was feeling a little claustrophobic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go ahead and sit beside him. \"So, why don't we introduce ourselves. My names Randy. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark glances at you, \"?\" He turns his head towards you, \"Harmon. ... Hey, I think the massive blood loss has left me hungry. You wouldn't happen to have anything to eat, would you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure! Of course.\" You get off the couch and walk off into the kitchen. You take out a box from the freezer and put it in a microwave. After a minute, the microwave is finished. You walk back to Harmon with a plate of food and a fork. \"Here. It's not much but it should fill you up for the time being.\", you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thank you.\" Harmon grabs the fork, but then just stares at the food. \"Um, what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mac &amp; cheese. It tastes good. Trust me.\" Harmon looks back at the food, and then scoops some up with his fork. He holds it up to his mouth, and then finally eats it. He chews it a bit and then gulps it down. After that, Harmon blinks his eyes, and then starts eating up more of the food. Gulping it down. \"Heh. Wow. You sure weren't kidding when you said you were hungry.\" You go and sit beside Harmon again. You watch as Harmon continues consuming more of his food. You also kept your attention of Harmon's right arm as he kept lowering and raising it to his mouth. Watching his muscles flex a little with each scoop. You quickly snap yourself out of it, turning your head away as you close your eyes. You think to yourself, \"God Randy...! Snap OUT of it man!\" All of a sudden you hear a loud burp. You turn your attention to Harmon, who was lounging back on the couch with the empty plate of food on his lap. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon raises his head, \"Oh!\" He begins scratching the side of his head, \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smile. \"Heh.\" You grab Harmon's plate and walk over to the kitchen, \"You sure were hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Yeah.\" You place the food into the sink, \"Hey Randy...\", you turn your body back towards Harmon who says with a grin on his face, \"...thanks for the food. And uh, thanks for saving my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Harmon for a moment, and then smile. \"Yeah. Sure thing.\" After taking care of the plate, you wipe your hands and walk back over to sit next to Harmon. \"So Harmon, what exactly happened to you? Were you attacked by a shark or something? And I don't mean like a shark of your kind, I, I mean like a regular shark or an orca or, somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew what you meant.\", Harmon said with a grin. But that grin turned into a slight frown, \"... Believe it or not, I was actually torpedoed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-torpedoed!? You mean, like, torpedoed in your abdomen by something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...torpedoed. You know. With one of those missiles from submarines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pretty shocked to hear that. \"R-really?! ... But, how is that even possible? I mean, I figure half your body would have been blown off! Uh... Just, just saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon stares at you for a moment, but then just smiles about it as well. \"Heh. Yeah. To be honest I was thinking the same thing.\" Harmon raises his left arm and winks as he flexes his bicep, \"I guess I must be tougher than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Harmon's slightly pumped bicep. You then look back at Harmon, \"Uh, so...if it's not too much of an uneasy topic to talk about...you mentioned being 'experimented on' earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!\" And with that, Harmon's expression quickly sank. He lowered his arm, looking straight down towards the floor with his arms on his lap. \"...Yeah.\" You just sat there staring at Harmon, who still had his head down. After a moment of silence, Harmon says in a low tone...</span></div></div>",

I'll...tell you what happened.\" Harmon clenches a fist, and then closes his face in front of yours, making you jump up. \"Just promise to keep it between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Harmon, looking right into his yellow eyes. You gulp a little before you speak, \"Yeah. Of, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon stares intently at you for a moment, and then backs his head away from yours. He sits in the same position with his arms on his lap as before, staring at the floor. After another long pause he finally speaks, \"... I'm, still really shaken up about what happened to me.\" Harmon flashes back to when he was swimming along in the ocean. \"It all started out when I was just swimming on the outskirts of Atlantica. That's the underwater city I originate from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt Harmon, \"Whoa! Cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon glances at you with a slight glare in his eyes, \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry. Please continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon continues with his flashback. \"A-hem. As I was saying. I continued swimming through the ocean. No apparent reason. I just do it to get enough exercise each day. This day however, didn't turn out to be normal. The first reason being because I was able to sense the fish around me swimming away in one direction. I turned around to see what they were swimming from, and it turned out to be a large submarine. Normally subs weren't permitted near out territory unless they were allowed access. In this case, they weren't. I was going to swim up to try to communicate with them.\" A large fish net suddenly drops on Harmon in his flashback. \"Instead, I was captured, and then electrocuted until I passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything fades out. After a moment, everything fades in. Harmon was slowly starting to wake up. \"Once I started to wake up, I found myself waking up in a cell. I know I was in the sub, because there were a few humans talking right in front of me. It seemed off because they were all wearing lab coats. Of course at the time, I didn't give a crap about that. I immediately demanded to them about what the hell I was doing there. That was what first got their attention. Two of the four scientists walked up to me while the other two walked away. One of them was a bald man wearing eyeglasses. The other was an orange-haired woman also wearing glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bald guy knelt down to me, assuring me to stay calm and that they don't plan to hurt me. He then said that...they would like to use me for an 'experiment' of theirs. That, did NOT calm me down at all. All I remember after that was cursing them out and yelling to get me out of there. And that they had no right to capture me and treat me in such a way. What got me riled up even more...was the bald guy's f*cking smile. I kept screaming and growling, but he just stands there looking at me as if I was some sort of trapped rat! Then just as I was about to spit in his face...\", Harmon's eyes widen, \"...the woman pulls out a syringe that he hands to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{\"What...the... You're not planning to poke me with that thing are you!?\"}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{The bald scientist grabs a hold of Harmon's left arm and holds it out. \"I told you. Just calm down. This is a simple serum I've been testing many other fish like you with. Once injected, one of two things'll happen. One, you'll feel much stronger and healthier than you normally are. Or two, you'll end up silently being put to sleep.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Harmon pulls his arm away from the scientist's grip. \"You bastard!! You think I'd take a chance on that!?}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{The bald scientist stands up, handing the syringe to his female accomplice and sighs. \"I told you to remain calm.\" He nods his head, \"You fish scum are all the same.\"}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{\"What!?! How DARE you!!\" Harmon grabs a hold of the bars of the cage, scrunching them forcibly, \"I'll kill you!!!--ah...!\" Harmon was suddenly taken aback by a syringe that was thrown in to his left pectoral. \"...\" Harmon looks up at the female scientist, who was the one who threw it. She stands up straight, straightening her glasses as well. Harmon grabs a hold of the syringe and pulls it right out, \"AH! Nng... Why...you... !!\" Harmon was starting to feel dizzy, his vision starting to swirl around and see double. \"Wha...\"}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{The bald scientist straightens his glasses, \"Alright Jessica. Let's go. The serum should make him drowsy, for now\"}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{\"Yes Mr. Stock.\"}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Mr. Stock and Jessica turn away and start walking off. Harmon tries to make an attempt to run after them, \"Hey...wait...! Don't...you...run......off...\", Harmon says as he falls forward and passes out.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I awoke, I didn't necessarily know how long I was out. All I knew was, my wrists and ankles were held down against a wall. I also found myself in some sort of large room. Sitting in front of me was some sort of cannon. I didn't know what the hell was going on at first, but I didn't have any time to think either. There was a loud boom, and a cannonball was shot out. Hitting me right in the middle of my chest. It hurt. Really bad. But then, it didn't. I looked down to where the cannonball struck me. Then all of a sudden, my muscles were starting to tense and expand around that area. Mainly my chest and upper abs. I couldn't believe what was happening to me, but I didn't have a chance to take it in either. They continued shooting more and more balls into various parts of my body, until each part of me got struck at least once. I was hurting A LOT, at first. But then, once I opened my eyes, I...just growled out very loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed pretty vague but I was able to feel my body just...explode. Each muscle in my body was starting to feel really warm. As if I was being worked to the core. All my muscles...pumping...throbbing...swelling out all at once... A-heh... I guess I did kind of enjoy it more than resisting it. But then, something hit me. I noticed the cuffs my wrists and ankles were shackled to were starting to break up from my growth. I looked up and noticed a couple windows of the sea as well. If I can break from my shackles, I can make a quick escape! I took one quick look at the lab-coated bastards. They seemed pretty preoccupied with the results. So with a quick flex, I managed rip my left arm out. The same goes for my right arm. Then my left leg, and then my right. I quickly climbed up a wall to get to the window. And with my brute strength, managed to punch an entire window out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater quickly filled that room of the sub, but I managed to swim out in time before the whole room filled up. I quickly swam off in one direction. I didn't want to concern myself about where I was going. I just wanted to get the hell away from that submarine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inched closer to Harmon looking incredibly interested, \"Wow! And, and then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon glances at you, \"......\" He starts to scratch the back of his head, \"Um, well...I'm not sure if this part is really, ah-hem, important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare at Harmon, a little confused, \"? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you remember the part I brought up about me enjoying my growth than resisting it?\" Harmon appeared to be blushing a tiny bit, \"It's, kinda like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to keep staring at Harmon. \"... I, still don't completely understand.\" You smile, \"Heh. But, unlucky for you I'm the type of guy who wants to hear about as much detail as possible about people's stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon looks away, \"... Well...\"</span></div></div>",

It, uh, it, happened back after I had made my escape from the submarine.\" Everything flashes back to when Harmon was still swimming away from the submarine. \"So...I didn't know exactly how long I had been swimming away. But I could tell I was swimming much faster than I used to. I soon came to a stop. I turned around to see how far the submarine was behind me. But when I did...the sub was nowhere in sight. I must have swam for miles, but I was just glad to be away from that thing. I let out a sigh of relief.\" {\"!\"} \"And when I did, that was when I started getting a, better feel, of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By merely laying a hand on my stomach, I got a feel of my abs. I mean, they felt...hard. Like, I was feeling a brick wall. So firm, so thick, so...big. Eh-heh. I didn't exactly want to feel me while floating around. I looked around to see the ocean floor just a couple feet down, and immediately floated right down. The first thing I noticed were my arms. They were so large!\" {Harmon clenched his fists}, \"So immense! I flexed my right arm in front of my chest a few times. Watching my bicep swell up and down with each tensing flex. I then began feeling my right tricep area with my left hand. It felt like solid steel, when tightened hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked down to my chest. I began pounding my pecs with my right fist a few times. It felt pretty exhilarating! I brought up my arms against my chest as I puffed it out. I swear, I almost could feel my pecs with my chin! ... After that, I, I was starting to feel a little weird. I just, I just couldn't stop flexing and tensing different parts of my body. And who could forget about my legs. I looked down and raised up one of my short legs to get a great view of my massive quads. I began to flex it a few times, especially with my large calves. Watching my legs shred with my rippling muscle...it made me smile...sinisterly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I began stomping my foot against the ocean floor. It didn't make a very loud sound, but I sensed just how much the floor shook below me. I then noticed a boulder covered in algae that lay against my foot. I picked it up and held it against my chest. I let out a toothy grin, and then let all the my strength from my arms and chest. They both tensed out impressively,  enough to start straining the boulder in my arms. After a few rock crumbling seconds...\", {'CRACK!\"}, \"...the boulder cracked into pieces. I watched as the pieces of rock floated to the underwater ground, and then...heh. I just let out a roar. Screaming at the top of my lungs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything flashed forward to you both sitting on the couch. \"Heh. I guess I nearly lost it. I mean, not anything manic-like, but a very proud sort of way.\" Harmon glanced at you. But then he turns his head towards you, \"?\" You were staring at Harmon with a pretty scared look across your face. Plus your sitting a foot further away from him too. Harmon blinked his eyes, \"Is my, is my story scaring you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up, \"Ah! Uh, w-well...\" You look down, and then look back up with a faint smile, \"Is this the real story, or are you just exaggerating a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon blinked his eyes at you again. He then smiles, turning away, \"Heh. Yep. It all really happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away as well, \"So, I presume weightlifting is your thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Bodybuilding is more like it.\" Harmon looks up, \"I've been workin' out and pumpin' up for years. Wanting the be the best, the strongest, and the biggest! Man. What I wouldn't give to be that big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to look at Harmon, \"Huh? But, aren't you at the least concerned about the serum they injected you with? Or maybe even the possible side effects? I mean, you might end up turning into some kind of monster for all we know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!\" It took a bit for Harmon to absorb what you said. He lowers his head as he his expression saddens a bit, \"Oh yeah... ...Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You hold out a hand to Harmon, \"Uh, didn't, mean to make you feel bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon shifts a hand towards you, \"No, no. It's alright. I sometimes tend to forget about what's important before going through with something actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both pause for a moment. Then you break the silence, \"Hey, why don't you finish up that story of yours. Were you near the end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon glances at you, \"Huh? Oh, yeah.\" Harmon let's out a slight smirk, \"Heh.\" Everything flashes back to when Harmon was standing on the ocean floor. \"So, after my proud roar...I, didn't really know what to do at that point. I was just standing on the ocean floor with some underwater rock pieces lying around me, away from danger. I looked around, but I didn't necessarily know where to go either. I even thought about swimming to the top and try to figure out my location out of the water. I was about to do just that, but then, a fairly large school of fish was starting to swim around me. Being able to communicate with fish, I overheard them talking about my newly earned physique. I'm actually a bit of a show-offy jackass, so I decided give them all a good show. I went ahead and started doing a couple bodybuilding poses. Flexing and pumping as many muscles as I could. All while holding a large snickering grin on my face. I could even hear them talk about how much they like my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt Harmon's flashback, \"Boy, you sure weren't kindin' about wanting to be strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon looked at you, only with a slight glare in his eyes. \"Hrm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow your head down, \"Eh-heh... Sorry, please go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" You look up, staring at Harmon's smiling face. \"I was nearing the end anyway.\" Harmon turns away, scratching the back of his head with one hand, \"Although, I probably shouldn't even be grinning about this part.\" Everything flashes back to when Harmon was doing his last pose, which was a backwards double-bicep flex while kneeling on his right leg and stretching his left leg out. \"I was finishing up my routine with the school of fish. Then all of a sudden, they all ran off.\" {\"?\"} \"I wasn't sure if it was because I scared them off, or if something else scared them off. That was when I sensed something.\" {\"!!\"} \"As soon as I turned around, a torpedo suddenly gets lodged right into the side of my stomach. I look up, and spotted the submarine closing in on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But before they got close, the torpedo that was lodged in me exploded. I screamed...I was jetted through the ocean at a high rate of speed. ......\" Everything flashes back to normal. Harmon was staring down at the floor once again. \"And, as for the rest. Well, you pretty much know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon turns his head towards you, cocking an eyebrow, \"Hm? Is that all you have to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it was both interesting and sad. I mean, what, what else would you expect me to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon crosses his arms, \"Did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up straight, \"Oh, yeah! Very much.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harmon lounges back on the couch with his arms folded behind his head. \"So, that's pretty much it. 'Yaaawn'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that macaroni and cheese must have made you tired.\" You get off the couch, gesturing your hand on the couch, \"Why don't you lie down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon stares at you, \"On here? I mean, you won't think it rude of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my guest. I'd feel it'd be rude if you didn't.\", you said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon looks down and stares at your hand for a moment. He then let's out another long yawn. \"Alright.\" Harmon merely lies down on his side, so that he was facing you. He let's out another yawn as he closes his eyes. You were about to walk off, \"Hey Randy.\" You stop to turn back to Harmon, who smiles at you. \"Thanks.\" You smile at Harmon, and then walk off. Harmon makes himself comfortable as he shifts his body around the couch a bit. Harmon yawns one more time, before slowly falling asleep. You walked over to the kitchen to set Harmon's plate in the sink, and then turned on the faucet. As Harmon was sleeping, we proceeded on into his dream. \"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Harmon's dream, it was taking place on the ocean floor. There were a couple different species of fish swimming around on their own, minding their own. All of a sudden, a large fish net appears from underneath them, and traps all of the fish in one catch! Above them was a large fishing ship, which was slowly retracting the netted fish higher towards it. A purple seahorse manages to squeeze its head out from the ball of fish. \"HEEELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon opens his eyes, \"!\". He was sitting with his legs crossed on the ocean floor. His entire body was also shaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fishnet was starting to raise up higher and higher, until it was just a couple feet away from the ship. An eel yells out, \"Who's going to save us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dolphin screams out, \"I don't want to be fish food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seahorse turns his head out towards the distance, \"? Look!\" A fairly large anthro shark was speeding its way towards the ship. He grabs the top of the fishnet, stopping the net from raising any higher. \"It's Harmon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed Harmon, only every muscle on his body was rather bigger than his normal self. \"Not worry my friends. I will save you!\", he yells out heroically. He grabs the net with his other hand, and then he uses his fin on the back of his head to slice the net from the small space between his hands. He carries the end with the trapped fish and releases them all. Harmon then turns his attention to the large boat. He swims up and appears out of the water. \"!\" All of a sudden, a harpoon gets shot from the boat at a high rate of speed. Harmon smirks, \"Heh.\" He holds out his muscular right arm, and then catches the harpoon with hardly any effort. Harmon grinned proudly as the tip of the harpoon was held less than half an inch away from Morgan's head, \"Heh heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon then goes and throws the harpoon right back at them, puncturing into one side of the ship. Harmon dives back underwater and swims underneath the ship. He swims up to the ship and holds on to the bottom of the ship. Harmon takes a deep breathe, and then all muscles in his arms and shoulders pumped and swelled right out. He tried his best to lift up the boat, but it didn't seem to be enough. Harmon thinks to himself, \"Come on body... You can do this!!\" Harmon brings his head up as the muscles in his upper body start to flex and expand with his arms. His legs flexed and swelled out as well, which he uses to try and push himself AND the ship up and out of the water. He was slowly accomplishing this as he was starting the raise the ship higher and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freed fish that swam underneath him watched in awe. After a minute or two, Harmon slowly manages to pick up the ship until the top half of his muscular body was poking out of the open water, the muscles all over his body still tensed and flexed with life. As we zoom in to Harmon, he had a big and toothy grin on his face, which only got bigger as he said to himself, \"Yes...!\" With one twist of his entire body, he lets loose the large ship that was carried on his massive back. The ship was practically thrown a fourth of the world away as it disappears into the distance. Harmon sets his hands on his hips, standing his upper body up proudly. He yells out with a cocky smile, \"Don't you dare come back to my ocean again!\" He flexes both his arms down, making his back raise up as well to do a crab flex, \"Or you'll have to deal with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, something was shooting right through the top of the ocean at a high rate of speed. \"!!\" Harmon turns his attention towards it, which turned out to be the same missile that injured him from before. Harmon tried to defend himself, but he wasn't able to react in time as he thinks to himself, \"CRAP!!\" 'BOOOM'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\" Harmon wakes up from his dream, panting heavily as he sat up on the couch. He pants a little more as he says to himself, \"Damn... Had to be the same missile from before.\" Harmon turns his head towards a window with the shutters down, \"?\" Harmon overhears a couple ocean waves coming from outside into the dark home. He gets up from the couch and walks up to the window, opening up the shutters with two fingers. He blinks his eyes once, \"!\" The first thing he sees is you. Only you were surfing on your own out on the open water. You were surfing through the waves like a pro! Doing a couple pro stunts too. Harmon was a tad speechless. He thinks to himself, \"... Wow... I new he surfed because of his outfit. I never thought he was so good at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Harmon turns his head towards the front door. \"... I could, go outside... But, what if those science freaks show up again?\" He turns his attention back to you. \"On one hand, I'll be able to experience Randy's moves up close. ... On the other...I might end up putting my life, and HIS, in danger...\" Harmon blinks once again, \"... \"What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You continued surfing over small waves and a couple big ones. You were even able to surf through a large tunneling wave once or twice. As you swam up a large wave, you managed to get up to the top. Upon surfing the top of the large wave, you caught a glimpse of something off to the distance, \"?\" That something turned out to be a figure standing out on the beach shore. And that figure turned out to be Harmon, who has been watching you with his arms folded and a grin on his face. You think to yourself, \"... Harmon? Ack!\" All of a sudden, you lose your footing, and then end up toppling to the towards the water. \"Gahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon waited patiently with arms still crossed while staring towards your direction. The wave then ends up hitting the shore right in front of him, leaving you face first into the ground in front of Harmon's feet. What was left of the tide started to wash away. \"...... So. That was some, how do you say, wipeout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring your head up to look at Harmon, \"What are you doing outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", Harmon asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up on your own two feet, \"I mean, don't you think it's <i>a little</i> dangerous to be out here at the open water if what to you is true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon raises his head up a bit, \"... Wait, you don't believe my story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift your hands up and down a few times, \"Trust me, I WANT to believe you.\" You start scratching the side of your head, \"It's just...it all seems a little exaggerated, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon's says, his tone sounding a bit louder, \"Exaggerated!?\" He starts yelling out at you, \"You think I'd fake a bruise like this just to be saved?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying your bruise was fake. I just think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What I said happened to me REALLY happened to me! Okay! If you think I injured myself just to be saved by the likes of you, then you're sick! You're sick-minded, okay!?\" You stare at Harmon, with a hurt look on your face. Harmon was looking back at you, but then his angry expression lessened upon staring at yours. \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still stare at Harmon with that same hurt look, \"...Harmon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon was still staring at you too, \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were starting to grow watery, \"...I was just saying...\" A tear runs down your cheek, \"...But that kind of hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon's eyes widen a bit, \"...\" He hold out a hand to you, \"Randy...I... !!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon spots a large wave line starting to form behind you. \"Hm?\" You turn around. Once you were facing the other way, the wave was already in the form of a tidal wave. And it was coming right at you! You were in a state of shock, staring scared stiff right at the oncoming tidal wave. \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon throws an arm out to you, \"RANDY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself as the wave was about to plow you down, \"Crap! I...\", you close your eyes shut, \"...I didn't prepare for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Everything fades to black. The sound of gurgling water echoes-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to open your eyes. \"...\" You blink, and then open your eyes wider, \"... !\" You were now wide awake. Lying on your couch with your forehead bandaged up. Your abdomen, left shoulder, and left knee were also wrapped in bandages. \"...... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake.\" You blink your eyes, turning your head to your left. Harmon was sitting on a sofa a few feet away from you. He put on a warming grin on his face. \"I'm glad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink your eyes, \"... Wha-...what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...got wiped out again. Only by an even bigger tidal wave. And your surfboard.\", Harmon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You feel your forehead with your left hand, only to receive a bit of pain in return, \"Ow! ... You don't say... How did it all go down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon grins again, \"Heh. Well, it all started with your surfboard. Apparently you must have forgotten about it when you first wiped out. It was basically thrown with the tidal wave, knocking you out in a heartbeat. I ran out to you as fast I could, but the tide got between us first. I got washed away by the wave, but I managed to recover from it. I looked around as fast I could to try and found you. And I did. You were floating just a couple feet away from me. So I swam straight for you as fast I could. When I finally reached you, I grabbed you in my arms and swam straight for the top. Once I swam out of the water, you still cradled in my arms, I looked around see where your house was. I spotted it, and luckily it wasn't that far away. Upon swimming my towards the shore, I realized something. ... You weren't breathing. I quickly swam to the shore. I didn't know how long you haven't been breathing, but I didn't hesitate to perform CPR. After a minute or two of performing mouth-to-mouth and whatnot, I finally and miraculously get your heart beating again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon stops speaking for a moment. You wait patiently for him to speak again, but you speak up instead. \"... Then, what happened next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon raises his head a bit, not looking at you. And then he continues on with the story. \"Heh. When I got your heart beating, you coughed up some water. Some of it got on me, but I didn't mind. You began to open your eyes a bit, but then, you seemed to go unconscious. You were pretty banged up also, but I sighed with relief seeing that you were okay.\" Harmon looks up at you, \"And, well, here we are now.\" Harmon stares at you, and you just stare back at him. \"You, do believe me, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what happened?\" You smile Harmon, \"I'm gonna have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon smiles at you, but then hi expression drops a bit, \"... Um, hey, about earlier... I'm, I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier. I didn't mean to hurt you like that. But, do you even believe my story at this point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harmon...\" Harmon looks up at you. \"I do believe you. I just can't not say I'm a still a bit skeptical about some parts of your story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmon glances down towards the floor, \"... I understand.\" He stares at the floor for a moment longer, and then he looks back at you. Ready to say something.</span></div></div>",

I am also mixing many fetishes into the story, but the main will center around it being an anthro. Although I will say that this is supposed to be a gentle type of relationship story. Remember that the anthros have already been hurt by someone so unless their personality asks for it, be nice to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world has both anthros and humans, but more humans. There can be human interaction as long as it involves plot development.
