Though no pictures of the available or allowed at the funerals, one casket had what appeared as if a horse mane growing out as along the length of his neck and spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gaining of proof was in the capable hands of Jennifer and David.

What began with a stealthy entering of the research facility and grounds turned into a cobbled mess. If worse happens and David becomes a captive too, he plans to write a letter to his parents, spelling out some obscure reasons as of why he had entered the facility. Weeks later his parents did receive such a letter, as describing to them his wish to remain there as is, becoming a scientific volunteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I his friend was told came third hand from his parents as they read to me a letter received from their captive son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Mom and Dad,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had great plans of doing as Dad wanted and become a teacher, but the English Lit Professor is the world's biggest ego trip jerk, and told me he was hell-bent desiring to dash my hopes! He wants those not in frat houses to brown nose him at every exam time, or buy him gifts, and he has a list!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine my surprise receiving a phone call requesting me to come for my first interview. There I met the Professor and his assistant asked me dozens of questions about family background. I soon could tell where the conversations were going. The two of them were concerned with the possible complications. The two professors argued openly as professor Beaker wanted a volunteer to become in part or completely as a consequential- surrogate within their gene therapy experiment. What they really had as a needed want for security purposes, were volunteers without any next of kin or, were foreign exchange students.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI told them exactly what they wanted to hear. My imagination worked at deriving a long, as equally sad story about me growing up as an orphan. It was a great sounding story, almost made me begin to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd how things worked out as one of the questions asked, ventured me to remembering when we resided at Grandpa's farm, the professor wanted to know which of the animals did I like best, the draft horses, my pony, or cows, and the bull?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experiment to which I signed as accepting is the Homo/Equine/Procreation -Gene -Dartmoor-Induction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, I talked with the professor asking him as what my part was in the experiment, but all he talked about was the sponsor being some Equine Society that requested the gene therapy, they based in Britain. What I read between the lines was of me offering some of my cell structure as young, human, male cells chemically merged, made a serum and injected into some equine to add human traits of increased intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA secondary project was of using the serum to culture produce a chemical virus. The virus acting as a interregna, it when injected into a person causes what might be unhealthy tissue to reformat, becoming new cell tissue and return a subject to perfect health. It is all medical scientific jargon! I think what it means is that the Professors invented a D.N.A. reformation serum. Its planned use when injected into pregnant mares causes a D.N.A. distillation in the womb and a preferred realignment to the foal cell structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third and final serum generated by the foal body after the birthing, come from the penis glands, and added to the Reformation serum stimulates athletes to gain muscle mass and stamina equal to that of the equine genus. This serum when injected would give an athlete ten times their physical strength of bone, muscle, and endurance even to common biological illnesses. If it works as directed, the final serum could render all human population as immune to infections and/or cancers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was then and remain proud to be a partner in this experiment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going very well until last week, my third week into the experiment when attendant Jim, gave me two injections of my Antibiotic drug. It was as he did my injections, the professor noted the assistant had used the wrong ampoules. As what I received through the injection given were two loaded syringes with the full-strength form of the H.E.D. Reformation serum.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStunned to here that horror, I felt a wave of fainting come over me, it being a sudden drug induced form of shock, and put me into a coma like state. This was the reason for me not writing sooner, as I was in the coma like sleep for five weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplications arose and the Professor had me moved to a swing room where Nurses, pretty ones, kept watch over me until all vital signs became stable. Professor Beaker came to visit me several times each day. He would check my vitals and then did what AI thought was quite odd, he measured my toes, feet, and shins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt fine, better than fine, excited, the nurses were arousing me, and my given task was to lie in bed, watch television, and lounge for several days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the Tuesday of the seventh week since my mistaken injection that my skin which in summer is very dark a tan, reoccurred in November without the being out in the sunshine. Each day after that realization, my skin color darkened one shade or more until by the end of the eighth week the textured feel of my skin was changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lab assistants moved me from the swing room to a special secure room without windows, and no visitors, except Prof. Haun and another man named Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first day in that room I noted no mirror on any wall. They removed the bathroom mirror as well this made me suspicious. While each day my skin color continued to change darker until after tenth week, all of my skin became thicker as a dense charcoal-black coloration. I was on a 24/7 watched basis and not allowed even a shaver to whisk off those few whiskers, which Dad says is peach fuzz. Well that too is changing fast, as some of my whiskers grew to being three inches long. Most of my new facial hairs as grown remain short. It is the long ones, which felt like the feeler hairs around the mouth of Grandpa's horse Buster, you remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke scared the next morning, discovering my head, body, and arms as legs wrapped thickly, as if mummified. Completely immobilized, as during the night and sedated, they bound me and strapped to the bed, I had a cathode jammed up my pecker, and another sort of suck pipe, shoved up my butt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBetween my screaming I heard then Justin trying to tell me it was due to a drug interaction and that for a day or two, I needed to lay quiet. I calmed myself and decided it was for my betterment to remain quiet, since I was stuck, could not move, could not walk around or even feel my hairy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Sunday when most of the staff was off for the day; Professor Haun and Justin decided to release my bonds. The result of their visit is why I am writing you this long letter of explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring those days stuck in bed, I experienced such leg cramps that I know I screamed. My back ached and even my groin felt different. Hands and arms seemed strange and worse of all my sense of smell and hearing became so acute, it hurt when the Prof would speak, or Justin came into the room wearing his old spice aftershave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey told me to lie very still as the gauze wrappings were removed. Justin released the security straps, allowing me then to sit up, but warned to do so slowly. Doing as told, I waited for a chance to sit up and or stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes to what had to be the most terror-filled moment of my entire life. It felt like when they say you about to die, the whole of life's memories poured out in a flood of emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy legs were what I saw first. My skin was still very dark, actually black! My toes are gone as they merged into a single solid toe. Hair, black in color grows on my feet and they are very much longer than my shoe size of being thirteen's. My shin and upper leg now look more like Grandpa's pony, drastically different then what walked in here some weeks previous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease Mom, do not cry, they told me this does not need to be permanent, as soon in time, an antidote is coming and then the real, true me could come back. I became more afraid of it all when I felt the pinching as I sat up on the bed of me having grown then a hairy tail. After some moments of hands reaching as feeling behind me, I gained an unreasonable thrill about my changed rump, as being rather neat! The tail and the thick fur black hair grown on all of me from head to hoofs offered me a strange sense of pleasure. As later, and when standing upright, the new tail I could swing, it brushes over what is now protruding, being tender and soft to the touch. My tail sways whenever I walk, and by thinking, I can move the tail to flicking it, and find this brings me a tickling sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other drastic change came to my maleness, it changed too, becoming leathery, and a grown as thick-skinned sheath attached itself to my lower abdomen. The penis, it is held up inside, but when aroused for urination or from varied strange odors, what is my penis, protrudes out the sheath. The sensual sensation is surreal! I feel it as the arousal is beginning, the leathery skin of the sheath bloating, pushing out the collapsed penis from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I gain a penis erection, and it takes very little stimulation to making it happen. My changed as immense of girth, and a lengthier penis, bloats, extends to stand arching away from my lower abdomen what the Professor measured as being twenty-two inches from sheath edge to the blunt ending tip. Oh sorry, but I need to report that with this radical shift in my physical form, the circumcision that Doctor Michael did on me is now gone. The end of my penis is flat now, having a flange like gland wrung about the end. It does swell when I become erect, looking somewhat tulip shaped, but circumcised, it is not!<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

The research facility used the information to plant a cover story for their captured spy, informing the college of the acceptance of David into a two year sabbatical experiment. Therefore as far as the college or any authoritative would know or if later asked, the scientist group had time enough to work their scientific miracle, causing a species transformation of David into a Dartmoor breed of a pony stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething the scientists never really expected to have happen and did, was that after the experiment began and showed great promise, David became sexually enthused with the wonders of becoming a stallion animal used as a breeding stud. His happenstance meet with college coed Margery, gave further credibility to his spun story about wanting to become an interracial part of the equine experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet what ever became of his truer friend Jennifer, as she had gotten shot in the legs by an overly zealous security guard. She might have gone to a hospital, or taken care of in the research facilities' extensive medical infirmary. David did not know and was not talking or asking about her, as by doing so he would implicate her and she in turn would do the worse for him and his fantasized story of why he came there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks of painful conforming to the planned Reformation serum experiment and being physically half way along to becoming a seal-brown colored pony, he happened to overhear the conversation of two attendants talking about the sexual orgies done at the home of Professor Beaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid being wise as well crafty, made a comment to the other Reformation process patent owner, a Professor Haun, as asking him about the rumor of sexual orgies as, \"Organized\" by his partner. The use of the word organized made the Professor laugh and broke the ice between the two, allowing David the spy and the very reserved professor to begin a dialogue of open conversation, mostly dealing with the sexual antics of Professor Beaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat after just two sessions of humorous conversing with Professor Haun, did David hear the name Jenny used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally David asked about the girl named Jenny, as generally the name/word of a jenny refers to a female mule. David then asking the Professor Haun, he a very knowledgeable man, then spilled the proverbial can of beans, as informed to what became of Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDearest friend Jennifer retained her self esteem by not being an informant, she given to Professor Beaker then as another of his many Reformation processed orgy partners. The manic scientist hearing the name of his newest volunteer as being Jennifer, he took it upon his duties to regulate her form to better comply to her name. As and while the facility was busy causing David to change species, Professor Beaker was in his spare time causing Jennifer to become a Mule-girl for his weekly, weekend orgies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Haun rarely bothered to visit the Beaker mansion and estate property, but did once, and happened to see there a pretty part Mule, part human female, she working as a day-maid. When the time seemed appropriate, he said he stopped her, as asked her if what she was, was to her delight?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the reserved ham told was of how the Reformation serum applied and done so while the subject is fully alert, and not sedated, the resulting convocation causes brain damage, leaving the unlucky recipient as a retardee.  Her mind near to being gone, all useful as learned knowledge scrambled, made to look as a sexually enhanced human female with equine Mule traits, and another college coed becomes a new sex bimbo of the continuing orgy delights of a evil man.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
