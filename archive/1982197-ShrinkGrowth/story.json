They were going to make a green screen movie together, and Mike was excited.  He had never really shared his video ideas with anyone, so looked forward to doing so - although he was a little anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike got out of the car, and started to unload his equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, how's it goin'?\"  Kermit asked, as he and Candace walked down to greet Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good man.  Looking forward to making this movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kermit and Candace approached Mike, the sky started to darken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it supposed to rain?\"  Mike asked.

The two walked back up to their porch and sat down.  Kermit took his cigarettes out of his pocket and removed two from the pack and placing them both in his mouth.  He lit them up and passed one over to Candace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike could hear Kermit and Candace talking, but their voices were muffled by the thick beard.  The hair was softer than Mike would've assumed, and felt nice on his tiny naked body.  Without warning, a giant finger and thumb invaded the beard and grabbed Mike's tiny body.</span></div></div>",

Their vision is still blurry, and their still suffering from some dizziness, but other than that, they felt fine. The chubby adult couple curiously looks around their surroundings, and everything looks strange, almost alien in appearance. As their vision returns, the first thing they notice is their lack of clothing. \u201cDamn, that lightning strike must have been a dream,\u201d Kermit says in a puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Candace on the other hand still has some blurry vision because her glasses are missing. \u201cIt must have been some party,\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, as Kermit\u2019s vision returns, he looks around and sees they are in a weird looking dollhouse of some kind. Everything except for their bed looks plastic. This place has a strong resemblance to a Polly Pocket dollhouse, but life size, Kermit thinks. He also cannot see anything around them to wear, not even towels. \u201cThis must be one of Mike\u2019s dollhouse sets. It\u2019s very detailed.\u201d Kermit says in an amazed voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Candace is the first to notice their bed actually looks like her underwear, only much, much bigger. They both tried to ripe some cloths off the giant underwear, but the fabric is too tough. \u201cGuess we are stuck like this,\u201d Kermit says, as he excitedly looks her over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The horny, passionate nude couple is still unaware that they have both shrunk as they passionately kiss each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Who is watching the show? </span></div></div>",
