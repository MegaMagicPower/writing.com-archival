You <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngo to open the office door but it flings open and your dad is standing in the doorway. You look up at <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhim. \u201cDad let's walk\u201d. He nods in agreement and you both walk out side. You both begin walking <br>\r\n<br>\r\naround the grounds. \u201cDad, I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am that your alive\u201d you say as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nembrace him in a hug. He returns the hug and pats you on the head in reassurance. \u201cYes, but putting all <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat aside, we need to think about what comes next\u201d. You dad nods in agreement. \u201cYou know better <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthan anyone what Freddy is capable of, and I'm not prepared for what's to come\u201d. He continues to nod <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin agreement. \u201cI need your help dad. Train me, give me the strength to take these jokers down for the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncount. Your dad puts a hand on your shoulder and nods. Your dad reaches into his coat and pulls out his <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmachete and hands it to you. \u201cY-your machete\u201d? You ask. He nods again in approval. He motions for <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou to follow him. You both begin walking towards the woods when Winnie comes running out. \u201cNow <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhere are you going\u201d? She asks in concern. You walk over to her, putting your hands on her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinnie, my dad and I need to train and prepare ourselves for what comes next. I don't know exactly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhere were going or how long I'll be, but know this.\u201d you say lifting her chin so that she may meet <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour gaze. \u201cEverything I'm doing is for you\u201d. You both then kiss passionately. \u201cI'll be waiting\u201d she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay safe\u201d you reply. Then you and your father resume your trek into the wilderness.</span></div></div>",

Time passes and the sun sets and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe moon rises high into the sky.

He was interrupted as Winnie gave him her answer in the form of a passionate kiss. He <br>\r\n<br>\r\nquickly began doing the same. As things got heated, Jason unhooked Winnie's bra, revealing her small <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut perky breasts. Winnie in return, ripped off Jason's undergarment and tossed it across the room, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrevealing his more than ready member. They looked into each others' eyes as they were both blushing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nintensely, not from embarrassment, but from the sheer ecstasy of the moment. Then Jason removed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie's panties and prepared himself for what came next. \u201cAre you ready for this\u201d he asked one last <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntime, looking for reassurance. Winnie wrapped her arms around him, embracing him as she brought her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nface closer to his. \u201cMore than you know\u201d she replied. Jason took that as his cue and took the plunge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed began to squeak softly, the sheets were being ruffled, and the soft exhales of Jason and Winnie <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwere let out as small, almost inaudible  moans. The two began moving in a rhythmic up and down <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmotion under the sheets as the two were in a world of pure pleasure and ecstasy. They both continued <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor some time and eventually fell asleep in each others' arms.</span></div></div>",

One of the girls shrieked. The masked giant remained silent as he <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbegan to slowly walk up to girls, knife in hand. Jason Jr. knew of what Myers was planning to do and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas intent on stopping him. He stepped away from Winnie and quickly pulled out his machete. \u201cJ.J.! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you doing\u201d?! She asked. \u201cHey Myers, why don't you quit scaring little girls and take on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsomeone your own size. Myers slowly turned his head towards Jason Jr. He then began walking <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntowards him in a sluggish manner. J.J. Stood his ground waiting for the lumbering giant to make his <br>\r\n<br>\r\nway over to him. Then everyone heard a loud BANG! And shuttered. Everyone immediately clasped <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntheir hands over their ears. J.J. Turned to see a smoking gun in the Colonel's hand and a bullet hole in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe side of Myers' mask. \u201cYou aren't going to put a FINGER on these children mister\u201d! Said the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel, thinking he had vanquished the giant. To his horror however, Myers simply turned his head <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntowards him, and he started trudging his way towards Calloway. \u201cWhat\u201d?! Said the Colonel. He began <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfiring round after round into Myers as he continued to make his way over to him. To no avail however <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas he ran out of bullets and Myers was still standing. Just as he was about to reach Calloway he raised <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhis knife over his hand, arching it to strike. Calloway flinched, expecting the worst. \u201cKYAH\u201d! Yelled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.J. As he slashed Myers in the back, leaving a huge gash going down from his shoulder, to his hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had no affect however. All it managed to do was draw his attention back towards J.J. Myers turned <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto face him and threw a hard punch right at J.J.'s chest, sending him flying back and crashing through <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe school. \u201cJason\u201d! Yelled Winnie, worried for her boyfriend's safety. Myers then started walking <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntowards Winnie. Before he got to her however, another figure caught hi eye. A man in a hockey with a <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntorn trench coat, and a large machete in hand. It was Jason Sr.! Both killers stared each other down as <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey walked towards one another. Then they came face to face, neither saying a word. Then Myers <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthrust his knife into Jason's heart. Jason merely looked down to see it, then slowly looked back up at <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyers. He then threw a solid punch to Myers' face, sending him flying fifty feet back into the woods, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nknocking over trees and debris. Jason slid the knife down to his belly as he took the liberty of taking out the knife and <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntossed it to the ground. Once the debris cleared, everyone could see Myers back up on his feet. Before <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could go after his unarmed adversary however, he vanished in a cloud of black smoke. Everyone <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbreathed a sigh of relief as Myers departed. \u201cOh no! J.J.!\u201d said Winnie as she ran to the hole J.J left in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe school after he was sent crashing through it.

He had an older sister named Judith and a younger sister. The family resided in a two-story house at 45 Lampkin Lane in the surburban town of Haddonfield, Illinois. On October 31, 1963, a six-year old Michael dressed as a clown for Halloween and watched his sister &amp; her boyfriend kissing before going upstairs to have sex. Taking a knife out of the kitchen drawer and waiting for Judith's boyfriend to leave, Michael then snuck up the stairs and repeatedly stabbed his sister to death. After watching her die, he left the house only to be discovered by his astonished parents, who had just returned home. Michael was sent to Smith's Grove Warren County Sanitarium for his crime, where he would remain until his twenty-first birthday until he could be tried as an adult. At Smith's Grove, Michael received psychiatric treatment from Doctor Sam Loomis. Upon spending time with the boy, Loomis concluded that it was a hopeless case that Michael Myers had no humanity left. He pleaded his case that Myers be moved to a more secure facility, but his superiors refused to listen and ordered that he remain in the \"adequate\" Smith's Grove In 1965, Michael's parents were killed in a car accident, and his little sister was adopted by the Strode family, who renamed her Laurie. The Strodes brought Laurie to visit Michael at Smith's Grove on at least one occasion when she was still a little girl. <br>\r\nOctober 30, 1978, the 21-year-old Michael Myers destroyed his room at Smith's Grove and carved the word \"sister\" on his door before breaking out. He also released the other patients from their rooms. At the same time, Dr. Loomis and Nurse Marion Chambers were arriving at the facility to transfer Myers for his court hearing. Noticing the patients roaming around outside the hospital, Loomis got out the car to investigate as Michael attacked Marion and sped away in their station wagon. As he drove across Illinois, Michael stopped to murder a truck driver to steal his boiler suit. Travelling to Haddonfield, Michael returned to his childhood home. The next day on Halloween, a teenaged Laurie Strode dropped off a key at the Myers house for her realtor father, and was immediately recognized by her brother. Michael proceeded to stalk her and her friends Annie and Lynda throughout the afternoon. He also stole Judith's gravestone from the local cemetery, and broke into Nicol's Hardware to acquire knives, rope, and a white Halloween mask. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis had followed Michael to Haddonfield and warned town sheriff Leigh Brackett of the danger he posed. That night, as Laurie and Annie were babysitting across the street from each other, Michael watched them from the shadows. He murdered Annie first, strangling her in her car as she left to meet her boyfriend, before slitting her throat. Later, Lynda and her boyfriend Bob showed up, only to fall victim to Michael as well. Worried about her missing friends, Laurie crossed the street to investigate, only to find Annie's body arranged under Judith Myers' gravestone, and Lynda and Bob hidden in the closets. Michael lunged at his sister, catching her on the arm with his knife, and she ran for help. Michael followed her across the street, and Laurie was forced to stab him with both a knitting needle and his own knife. As Michael rose from apparent death to resume his attack on Laurie, Dr. Loomis appeared and shot him six times, causing him to fall off the balcony. When Loomis went to check the body, Michael had vanished.Michael Myers' body was never found in 1978, although many simply assumed him dead.Michael Myers seemed to contain superhuman strength, having been able to lift a tombstone out of the ground  and also seemed to withstand critical injuries that would normally result in death, such as being shot, stabbed, electrocuted, or even burned. He also seems to be able to regenerate lost tissue</i>\"<br>\r\nthe webpage read <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
