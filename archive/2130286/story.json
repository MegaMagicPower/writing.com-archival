Each choice takes you to a different part of town where different characters crop up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not to say that they can't intermingle; everyone lives in the same town after all. So even if you don't pick one character, you might still run across her in another tour through town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we're getting ahead of ourselves\u2014where do you want to start?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><b>Uptown</b> is the uppermost section of Valentine, and is rapidly growing. New jobs bring in new people, who start new families in the Suburbs. This probably has something to do with the fact that it's located in a good school district\u2014Valentine High School is centrally located and easily accessible, with a relatively high graduation and college enrollment rate. The wealthiest Valentinians live in a housing complex area referred to almost exclusively as the Heights. The exceptionally rich and powerful tend to make their homes here as well, so it's no surprise that they're located close to City Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Downtown</b> is a bit seedier and shadier than its more respectable counterparts, but not without its merits. The nightlife is much more fun on this side of Valentine, with even little bars like Shenanigans able to offer a drink and a good time. There's a low-income housing development where some folks might lay their heads called Sunny Villa Apartments, which is a delightfully misleading name. There's some seedier characters lurking around in the Slums, but downtown's not all bad. There's also the Police Department, where the men and women in blue help keep Valentine in line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>the Business District</b> used to be known as Old Town, and part of Downtown. But the surge of new businesses attracted to Valentine segregated it into its own little section, and is growing almost every day! Gilbert &amp; Heil is one of the older companies that helped found Valentine, but has gone through a major overhaul recently. Losing its tight grasp on the town's sense of history and nostalgia allowed Yeng Distribution to sneak in and settle. Both bring in a lot of money and a new crowd of more \"metropolitan folks\". Which is good, because having big businesses like that around make it challenging for Mom and Pop's like Little Bake Shop on Main to stay open...</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There are a lot more \"domestic\" sorts to be found here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><b>the Suburbs</b> are a nice place to start. There are all sorts of folks to be found there. Some of them are couples, looking to settle down. Some of them are families eager to send their kids on their way out. And some of them are singles, looking to mingle. It's a nice, sleepy part of Valentine that has a lot of different stories to offer. With the recent expansion in the business district, you'd be hard pressed to find an empty home here these days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>the Heights</b> are an even better place to start, albeit strictly financially speaking. You can pretty much tell the kind of people who live in this part of town just by looking at them. They dress nice, they hold their heads high, and they can pretty much get away with acting like they're better than everyone because... well, they are. Again, in a strictly financial sense. You won't find too many \"settling in\" sorts around here, but there are a lot of up and comers attracted by the business boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Valentine High</b> is a centrally located, government mandated facility that teenagers are dragged to every day. Nobody likes to go, not even a lot of the teachers. But it's a good school. Lots of funding for the football team, not too much violence, and kids from the Heights and the Suburbs go there as harmoniously as a large group of teenagers can get. There's a distinct class divide though\u2014so be warned; High School is as rough as it gets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>City Hall</b> is where laws are made, notions passed, and a whole lot of bureaucracy happens. It's a new addition, located close to the Business District. Which is probably saying something, considering the amount of \"pull\" that some of those businesses have. The Mayor is newly elected, and easily swayed. Only time will tell if she's what's right for Valentine...</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been less than twenty four hours since... well, Reese wasn't exactly in the mood to refer to it at all, but let's call it \"the incident\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese had rushed home the night before for the first time before six in more than five years. She had been a cheerleader since in middle school, back when she was still stuffing her bra. Having her home at four 'o' clock in the evening was alarming even for her mother, who was incapable of consoling her crying daughter. Reese had locked herself in her room and had refused to come out, even for dinner, for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her mother worked up the courage to go knocking on Reese's door. They talked, Reese told her what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie...\" her mother said softly as she rubbed her daughter's heaving back, \"Being a cheerleader isn't <i>everything</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was! Oh my God, she wanted to scream, yes it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her friends were cheerleaders. She had gotten all of her boyfriends because she was a cheerleader. Now she was just... a <i>nobody</i>. And during the most important year of her life\u2014Senior year of high school. How was she ever going to come back from this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is!\" Reese heard her mother call from down the steps, \"Come on down sweetie, your breakfast is getting cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese was a pretty girl; like most of the women in her family. She had <i>had</i> long blonde hair throughout the Summer, but had cut it short right before school started. She was tall, but only slightly, and had a modest but noticeably bust line. As she came down the stairs, dressed down in a pair of simple jeggings and a halter top, it should have been obvious to everyone that she was in no mood for small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better, pumpkin?\" Her dad asked from behind the newsfeed on his phone, not even looking up to acknowledge his suffering daughter, \"Your mother and I were worried after last night's little episode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese and her dad had never really gotten along. He wasn't exactly the most open, caring, touchy-feely type of person. It probably stemmed from being the Quarterback-turned-CEO. He was a lucky guy who kept win, win, winning. Up until the accident, Reese had very much been his favorite daughter. After, though, she may as well have been chopped liver when compared to the previously shitty daughter Bailey, or even to the too-young-to-fuck-up Abby. You'd think that with a daughter full of women he'd be more approachable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" Reese said curtly, \"Can I just have some pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled and placed a plate in front of her. Three pancakes with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. The Mom Chin-Up Special. Normally it worked. But after all that had happened, Reese honestly didn't know if she'd ever be able to feel anything other than misery ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, it did make her feel a little better. Her Mom had been her rock through this whole ordeal. She drove her to those stupid AA-Youth meetings, ran damage control with the other cheer moms; she even had her car repaired, which was more than anyone could say about her Dad, who's response to everything lately just seemed to be \"suck it up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her mother's sake, Reese choked down some of her pancakes. Even if she wasn't really all that hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Headed out!\" came the voice of her oldest sister, Bailey, as she sashayed through the dining room and grabbed her keys off of the corkboard in the kitchen, \"Staying out late tonight, don't wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey was three years older than Reese, and a Sophomore at Valentine Community College. Like Reese, she was sort've tall with blonde hair. Like her mother, Bailey had a pretty prominent chest and a tight waist. And like her Dad, she was a complete asshole. She had spent Reese's entire life tormenting her, and that car accident taking the shine off of her pants had put Bailey right back into the spotlight\u2014something that she was more than ready to bask in gloriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun, sweetheart.\" their dad looked up from his phone to flash a smile beneath his beard, \"Be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come Bailey gets to stay out late but Reese doesn't anymore?\" Abby, the youngest, asked from behind her mushed-up pile of pancakes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because <i>I</i> don't get drunk and wreck cars.\" Bailey said with a smirk, sticking her tongue out at her middle sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anymore.\" Reese quietly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, her older sister was off. Sometimes it seemed like her mother was the only person on her side. Her Dad had turned so hard against her that she might as well not be his daughter anymore, Bailey was acting like a bigger bitch than ever, and Abby was just too young to understand what was going on. Her squad had all slowly turned against her, and she was a pariah in school. She wasn't Reese the cheerleader anymore\u2014now she was just the alky who had totaled her Dad's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't even totaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm headed out too.\" Reese pushed her plate away, \"I'm not hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese stood from her chair and grabbed her backpack, the rest of the table seemingly unaffected by her world ending around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good day, sweetie.\" Her mother said with a smile, \"Try not to let... all this... get you down, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Reese rolled her eyes and got her keys off of the corkboard, \"I'll try.\"</span></div></div>",

She almost thought that she was gonna have to knock someone out on her first day as a normal person. Imagine that, no cheerleader reputation to protect her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia was further out into the parking lot, having come in just a little after Reese had. Marcia broke into a brisk jog to catch up with her longtime friend, her long legs bouncing against the pavement so she could make the speed. She was a tall girl, even taller than Bailey, and had always been a bit less girly than anyone else in Reese's social circle. She wore shorts as short as Valeville High's dress code would allow and shirts that didn't encumber her wide sweeping motions with a lot of fabric. Marcia long brown ponytail whipped back and forth, an earnest smile that Reese hadn't seen in far too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Reese had been on house arrest, Marcia had been her sole contact to the outside world. She wasn't allowed to come in for the first month, of course, but that hadn't stopped them from texting each other. It was through Marcia that Reese learned that anyone who was everyone was talking about her, and it was through Marcia that she had learned that almost her whole squad had turned against her. They'd been friends since they were in second grade, and it was nice to know that no matter how badly some things fucked up, others would always stay the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, <i>please</i> stop calling me that.\" Reese offered a weak smile as she unclenched her balled fist, \"I get enough of it from everyone else. I don't need it from you too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, calm down, I was just kidding.\" Marcia puffed as she rolled her eyes, \"You're so sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be too if you became a pariah overnight.\" Reese muttered as Marcia took her place beside her, walking towards the entrance, \"Everyone thinks you're some kind of alcoholic, your dad won't talk to you, no cheer squad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, <i>I</i> still think you're better off without them.\" Marcia rolled her eyes, \"Those girls had the combined personality of a wet paper bag. This way you get to... you know... be yourself. I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese couldn't help but smile at that. Marcia had always been there for her, even when she hadn't always been there for Marcia. Being on the cheer squad had eaten up a lot of time in her life, but Reese and Marcia had always been cool. She hoped, in light of everything that had happened to her recently, that they always would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Beck.\" Reese said quietly, \"I needed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweat\u2014now come on, the sooner we get you to your first class as a <i>normal person</i>, the sooner we can start rubbing that cheerleader stink off of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit, classes. Reese couldn't even remember what she had signed up for before Summer started. She couldn't really remember anything little like that before the accident. Oh, this was going to be awkward. What if she had classes with one of her old squadmates? Or Josh? What if she had classes with Josh? That would be so fucking awkward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese stopped to rummage through her purse\u2014surely her schedule was in there somewhere, right?</span></div></div>",

Stitch a piece of fabric to another piece of fabric, learn to thread a needle, bake a cookie or two. Piece of cake, right? Women were expected to do that kind of stuff just by merit of being women, and the last thing Reese needed in her life was more drama. All of her squad had thought it was a stupid class, and there was no way that Josh was going to be caught dead in a pretty pink apron or whatever.

I'm headed to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey embraced, parted, and went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Reese was happy that she was going to have an easy course to start off her mornings with (now that she couldn't use \"early morning cheer practice\" as an excuse to skip!) she couldn't deny that she thought the whole premise of this class was lame. Cooking and cleaning? Reese's own mother didn't do stuff like that. This whole neighborhood was full of people rich enough to afford maids and house-cleaners. Why was this stuff even offered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, it was an easy A.

She was a new teacher, one that they had picked up last year. Somehow she couldn't quite picture a prim, proper, ex-cheerleader like Principal McBride sitting down at the same table with this cow and thinking that hiring her on was the best option for the school. Or the furniture, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that this is your first day back, so we're going to try and take this nice and slow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she spoke, Ms. Walker's words rippled in her swaddling chins. Her face was so fat that they actually rested on her chest a little bit. Her arms were big and heavy-looking, like pillow cases filled with jello. They wobbled inside her sleeves and folded so visibly that Reese had a clear outline of them beneath the butter-yellow fabric. Her belly was this big, blobby thing that stretched her shirt so tight that everyone could see where her khakis cut into the crest of her gut. And her <i>ass</i>\u2014forget getting hired here, how had this woman even fit through the door?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God.\" Reese heard one student whisper to another, \"Kill me if I ever get that fat, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese couldn't help but agree. Ms. Walker had to be one of the biggest, fattest women she had ever seen in her entire life. There were rumors as to why she got fired from her other school, the most prevalent was that she kept snapping furniture beneath her enormous butt. Reese would readily believe that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, is there something you'd like to share with us, girls?\" Ms. Walker raised her brown brow expectantly at the whispering girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" she continued sternly, waddling to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take this time to show off our new club\u2014the Cooking Club.\" Ms. Walker said with a smile as she handed a stack of flyers to the student closest to her, who took one and passed it back, and so on, \"It's a new club I and some other students started last semester, and we're looking for some new members to replace the seniors that graduated last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese looked over her flyer vaguely, rolled her eyes, and folded it up into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, this class was going to be so lame.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Classes at Valentine High were about an hour and a forty-five minutes long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for Reese, that was just enough time for Ms. Walker to do the whole \"getting to know you\" shtick with everyone in the classroom and then move onto the first step in her lesson plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found, in my time teaching Culinary Arts at Buttercombe Academy.\" Ms. Walker said with a smile bunching up on her fat face, \"That I really enjoy cooking. So there's going to be a lot of emphasis on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise surprise, the fat woman liked to cook, Reese thought to herself bitterly as she watched the enormous woman toddle around the classroom. There were enough ovens so that everyone had one, but it was a more or less small class. There were only ten students, and a little less than fifteen ovens. You would have thought, by the way that Ms. Walker was huffing and puffing by the time she got to Reese, that there had been a hundred girls to check on. The roly-poly brunette was so out of shape that standing at each oven for about a minute and then lumbering over to the next one was enough to make her start to sweat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's your name again?\" Ms. Walker asked breathlessly, her chubby cheeks blotchy and red<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Reese?\" she offered, \"I'm, um... not exactly good at... this. Just, any of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, neither was I.\" Ms. Walker offered a belly-laugh with extra jiggle, \"But I've found that some people have a way of coming into their talents a little late in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time everyone's cookies were out of the oven and cooled to edibility, the whole class seemed to have relaxed slightly. No one was really tense. There was a lot of opportunity to get up and talk to people. Ms. Walker wasn't a huge stickler about phones out, so nobody was obligated to hate her yet. In fact, she was a pretty fun woman. Full of laughs, telling jokes. Even a couple at her own expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on, hold on.\" she held up her hands as the bell rang and everyone started to pack up, \"Class isn't over 'til the fat lady says so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone exchanged a guilty little laugh at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I come around and sample your dishes, you're free to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone groaned a little, but even Reese was quite surprised when Ms. Walker turned out to be quite light on her feet when it came to getting fed. She eagerly snuck a cookie off of each plate provided to her by every student. Some of them, she regretted. But others she found quite enjoyable. First Lauren went, then Tamera, then Jocelyn and Kate. All the way down until Reese was the last student in the room. Ms. Walker gripped a cookie between her forefinger and her thumb and took a rich, decadent bite as warm gooey chocolate fell to rest on her full pink lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmm</i>!\" Ms. Walker let out a small grunt of approval, \"This is very good, Reese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" Reese raised an eyebrow, \"Like... you're sure?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm sure!\" Ms. Walker said jovially, \"A+ for you, sweetie. And here you thought you couldn't bake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I really can't.\" Reese blinked stupidly, genuinely surprised at her own abilities, \"At least, I've never had to bake anything before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think you have yourself a natural talent, Reese.\" Ms. Walker said, slipping rummaging around her desk and handing her another flyer, \"Here. I really think you'd enjoy yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Reese was off, a plate of her own cookies in hand. Ms. Walker had her fill from one of each girl, which was more or less a whole batch by herself. But that meant that Reese had nine (apparently) delicious cookies all to herself, all wrapped up in cellophane on a Styrofoam plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was... what to do with them?</span></div></div>",

It was the first day, and everyone was doing what basically amounted to busywork. One of those sheets that were passed out and provided general information so that their teacher didn't forget their names, more or less. Stuff that Reese outgrew when she was a Freshman. She had still <i>done</i> hers, but there were more pressing matters at hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Reese made a face, \"Like... you're <i>sure</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese had nine chocolate chip walnut cookies on her plate, wrapped underneath some cellophane for good measure. Ms. Walker had eaten one and told her how good they were, and Reese could barely believe it. She herself didn't really care for walnuts (or the temptation of losing her squad bod!) so she was more than a little unwilling to give it a try. Marcia had been more than willing to take them off her hands, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who had tried them (which was, granted, two people) had gushed about how good they were. Reese didn't really pay any attention to what that cow Ms. Walker thought, but Marcia's opinion was another story! And as nine cookies became eight, then seven... and now, as Marcia picked up a third, <i>six</i> cookies stored beneath the loose ceran wrap, she was a little inclined to believe her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, girl. These are really good.\" Marcia bit into her third cookie, \"I didn't even know you knew <i>how</i> to cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't.\" Reese curled her brow, \"I mean, I just... you know, followed the instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well those were some damn good instructions.\" Marcia snorted, finishing off her third cookie. \"You're sure I can have these? I mean, I don't want to take anything you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh yeah no, go ahead.\" Reese dismissed, \"I hate walnuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud coughing from the front of the room. It took the two girls a bit longer than it should have to realize that they were carrying on a conversation at a rather regular volume. Almost everyone in the class could here them, and that included Mrs. Saint-George. She put her hands on her child-bearing hips and tapped her little foot, her face scrunched like she smelled something gross. She coughed again, fully catching Reese and Marcia's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So on your sheet there, does it list baking as a hobby, Reese?\" the short woman inquired sternly, walking over to the back corner, \"Or do you just like disrupting my class?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight chuckle throughout the classroom at Reese and Marcia's expense as Mrs. Saint-George held out her hand expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Give'em here.\" she wiggled her fingers expectantly, \"Can't have you disrupting class on the first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia rolled her eyes and Reese just sort've shrank into her shoulders. God this was embarrassing. Getting called out on the first day of class. All the confidence that had been built up by Ms. Walker's class had been pretty much shattered here. This really was going to be the worst day of Reese's life, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Saint-George took the plate away, raised her eyebrows, and went back to her desk. From then on everything was pretty blase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did the whole \"getting to know you\" thing. Stand up, say something interesting about yourself. Reese had to try desperately to find something that wasn't cheerleader related. So her interesting fact was that she had middle child syndrome. The class laughed, but those who were old enough to know her either snickered or rolled their eyes at her expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also the <i>last</i> person because Marcia had had the bright idea to sit in the corner, furthest away from the starting point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the bell rang, it was a mercy killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow we start doing <i>actual</i> homework, okay?\" Mrs. Saint-George called out to the class as she dabbed at her lipstick with a napkin, throwing the styrofoam plate away and brushing the crumbs off of her desk, \"Don't forget, I want you to read the first chapter by tomorrow!\"</span></div></div>",

The jocks and preps were no God because of there strong connection with the cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Don't worry we'll sit with my friends,\" Marcia said excitedly.

All the gossip and all the drama surrounding her and her drinking. The rumor that she'd totaled her dad's car. All the shit Heather was saying about her to justify her relationship with Josh. God, it was just... all so much. And she'd stayed strong throughout it all. She still did her exercises and she still did her best to stay in shape. She hadn't slipped up once, even when her Mom started making her all her favorite foods. She stayed strong and did her best not to cheat on the rigourous diet that she'd been placed on for Cheer practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then yesterday had happened, and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Big Burger, can I take your order?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter yesterday, Reese could have really used a pick-me-up. It wasn't often that she splurged and got fast food, but when she did, she was usually not without good reason. After the accident she had stayed strong and had done her best to avoid it, but every other time in her life the negative could be punctuated with Big Burger. Failed a test? Big Burger. Her dog died? Double Big Burger. Her <i>Nana</i> died? Double Big Burger Deluxe. Reese was something of a comfort eater, through no fault of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never really interfered with her life, and she had never been so unhappy so frequently that she had ever put on so much as a pound because of it. Even when Becca started working at this particular restaurant, offering her free food out the wazoo, she had stayed strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was just a special case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can I get a Double Big Burger Deluxe meal?\" Reese bit her bottom lip contemplatively, \"Make it large, with a Coke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby little redheaded girl behind the counter smiled and pressed some buttons on the register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be $5.95.\" she said with an affirmative nod of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese swiped her debit card and collected her empty cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, her mom would kill her if she knew that she was here right now. She had skipped breakfast just to load up on junk food. That may as well have been a cardinal offense in her house\u2014especially considering it was the Mom Chin-Up Special. God, even her Dad would have flipped his shit if he saw her here. Yadda yadda studying, yadda yadda cheer team, yadda yadda \"just because you suck at life doesn't mean you can ruin it by skipping.\" blah blah blah. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese didn't really care at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Burger had always made her feel better in the past, and it was up to Big Burger to start making her feel better for the rest of the year.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shawna Williams was one of the most creative minds on campus. This was a girl who had written poetry that had gotten into the school newspaper, who had started a flash mob dance during one memorable finals week, and who had even managed to convince the school to let her spray-paint a mural on the school gym's wall. It had been taken down a week later, but her painting of of a wounded devil had certainly reflected how a lot of people felt when Tommy Williams had broken his leg during one particularly intense football game. It was no surprise to people who knew her, or at least knew of her, that her submission to the Theater Department for the student-directed play had been the one picked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the casting call was posted in the classroom at the back of the school theater, where drama classes were held. They were always posted a few weeks in advance of the actual auditions so that student actors could try and get into the heads of the characters that they might be portraying. Shawna's play, titled <i>The Light Side of the Moon</i>, had an equal number of male and female roles, as well as short descriptions of each of the characters; what their personality was like, what they wanted, and so on. The lead female role, however, had an unusual caveat: \"<i>Clara has been overweight most of her life, and has had to battle the perception that she is less capable than she is because of that.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little bit of information naturally made junior Diana Green worried. Diana's ego could be compared to that of Valentine High's cheerleading team; she was beautiful, talented, and she wasn't afraid of letting others know it. Her position at the top of the theater hierarchy had been cemented after the graduation of a class of particularly talented seniors whose underclassmen hadn't really been talented actors. Diana had picked up the slack, and her spectacular audition had gotten her the role of Abigail Williams in their school's production of <i>The Crucible</i>. The following year, another strong audition had gotten her the role of Lady Macbeth. She had also gotten the two leading roles in the two student-directed productions. She was expecting another guaranteed leading role this time, too. The \"overweight\" thing could easily be worked out, or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commotion in the quad when Diana had asked Shawna about the role had been very loud and very spectacular. Shawna had simply said that she had a vision for the character and that Diana, at least at the weight she was now, probably wouldn't fit it. Diana had accused Shawna that she was out to get her personally. Shawna simply remained calm, and explained her point again. The episode had ended when the bell had rung, but it was clear that Diana wasn't done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the people who had witnessed that incident was Cassidy Burns, also a junior. She had entered the world of Valentine High School's theater at the same time as Diana, and yet hadn't been as successful as Diana. While she would be the first to admit that she hadn't been as talented as Diana had been in her freshman year, getting only a bit role, she had made significant strides as an actress during that year and had gotten the role of Lady Macduff as a sophomore. Cassidy was also, it should be mentioned, chubby. She wasn't enormously fat or anything, but she did have a small potbelly and a bubble butt. Her body wasn't something she usually got really worked up about, but right now it sounded like it could be an advantage. After 2 years of nothing but bit and supporting roles, now might her chance to get the spotlight for once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audition date was still a few weeks away, but both girls began to plan how they could best prepare to get that leading role.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile a heavy boom signalled a pair of pallid bloated soles crashing into the floorboards as the second woman heavy herself out of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening their bedroom doors the pair of women caught sight of each other and greeted each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Yaaaaawn!* Morning Cer.\u201d Daisy greeted as she rubbed some sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Daisy.\u201d The fatter woman replied as she lazily scratched what she could reach of her immense stomach. Both women noticed that they were wearing mid-riff exposing clothes. But it was more that Daisy liked showing off her figure, while Cerys couldn\u2019t find anything in her size. \u201cGuess we share some taste in clothes.\u201d Cerys chuckled, nodding towards the bare brown skin in front of her. Daisy had to hold her hand over her mouth, for some reason anything Cerys said, Daisy found ten-times funnier than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing some cereal from their kitchen counter, Daisy began to pour herself a bowl, leaving the box ready for her roommate. One would expect a woman of Cerys Porter\u2019s immense girth to have made a virtual mount out of her breakfast to help her get through the day, but that was not the case. The bowls were part of a matching set and certainly looked the part with an identical amount of bland cereal flakes poured into both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cerys had no concrete plans on a diet yet, she was determined for the moment that her goal was to not get any fatter. For all the time Daisy and Cerys had known each other, the black woman could only watch as Cerys grew bigger and bigger and bigger, all without seemingly indulging herself that much, it was like magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no magic here though; Cerys knew exactly why she was inflating at such a rapid pace; it was her mother\u2019s loathsome genes. The gargantuan goth girl came from a very <b>big</b> family; her mother was an absolute whale and Cerys\u2019 <i>younger</i> sister was actually <i>fatter</i> than the goth by a country mile. They were barometers which Cerys constantly compared herself to, always worried that one day she would end up that enormous, that big and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy knew Cerys worried about her weight ever since they roomed together at college, back when she thought Cerys was just kinda chubby. They had been randomly allocated together as roommates back then and the pair just hit it off despite having nothing in common, they just worked off each other. After graduation the firm friends knew the easiest course of action was to room together, Daisy knew very few people at college and Cerys had not kept in contact very well with her friends from prep school, so it was an easy call rather than room with some total stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings though had not gone 100% to plan. While Cerys was in the early days of her dream job as a nurse, Daisy was stuck in a rut working some crummy waitressing job and living off tips. Cerys offered to pay more than her fair share of the rent thanks to her better wages, which always left Daisy feeling a little guilty. She wanted to help out but\u2026nobody wanted to hire a college grad with little experience!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what had led to this morning, Daisy in her colorful fluffy pink pyjamas virtually burying her nose in her food as her thick braid almost drooped into it, while Cerys in her black attire gulped down her own breakfast in mere moments, trying to resist the urge for a second helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that out-of-sight-out-of-mind was the best course of action, Cerys scraped back on her pair of chairs (she didn\u2019t want to burn their budget on another set of chairs\u2026the college had been very nice the first time it happened, but they didn\u2019t have that safety net anymore) and waddled back to her room, being careful to make sure her fat flanks did not nick the sides of the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing her skull-marked P.J.s onto her bed, Cerys opened her wardrobe and stood in front of her floor-length mirror. She was the perfect model for young adult obesity. The goth girl\u2019s stomach was her biggest feature, rolling over and between her thighs like a tidal wave and creasing in the middle. It made her so big and round that she always had to be careful not to knock everything. Resting on her shelf of a stomach were Cerys\u2019 impressive breasts, each basketball-sized tit loved to loom large out of even her more conservative tops, but they were hilariously outmatched by Cerys\u2019 upper arms. Her hammy upper-limbs were huge squishy pillows with a thick crease in the bicep, wobbling and gyrating every time she so much as reached for a set of notes or held her stethoscope aloft. The Goth\u2019s face was as bulbous and round as the rest of her; thick swollen cheeks gave her a permanent mini-pout and her double chin was large then her original\u2026and there was that third chin that was coming in to worry about. All this heavy fatty bulk rested on a pair of thick roll-encrusted legs, built like pillars to hold her immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Sigh* At least my hair looks nice today\u2026\u201d Cerys remarked as she lifted up one of her pink bangs that framed her fat face. She had cut her black hair short ever since trying for a job in the medical profession, to try and counterbalance how ungainly her bulk looked by showing her hair would never get in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing her morning ritual, Cerys removed a big black bra and panties; they were both lacy as hell. \u201cStupid shops\u2026just because I have fat boobs does not mean I am some bimbo trying to show them off\u2026\u201d Cerys grunted as she lung each strap over her shoulders, watching them dig deep into her copious amount of back-fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerys finished off with the baggiest black jeans she had left and a simple black top with a skull on it. She kept her scrubs in her station at work; nobody there liked her taste in raven-black anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Daisy\u2019s problems were more motivational-based than body-based\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was blessed with a slim figure and long legs, not that she ate junk though\u2026she sometimes took guilty looks at Cerys and thought of herself in her goth friends fat shoes if she ever let herself go. Along with her killer legs and toned stomach, Daisy had an unusually large pair of boobs; it was like all her fat deposits were located there or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking her butt-length plaited hair behind her, Daisy began to apply her make-up. She didn\u2019t like making herself look so good for such a shitty job\u2026but if she wanted tips a tasteful amount of make-up and a hint of her deep cleavage went a long way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her clothes produced the same \u201cwhy-bother\u201d response. She would be taking them off in favor of her uniform anyway, what was the point? Opting to take a page from her roommate\u2019s book, Daisy picked out a pair of ripped jeans; if she was forced to go to this stupid job she might as well try to show off how she felt about it as much as possible before it actually started. There was no way she would have ever gotten the job wearing those, Daisy thought as she sneered at her reflection before grabbing a top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth woman emerged from their rooms simultaneously again; Cerys looking cheerier now that she had a day of work ahead of her, while Daisy grumpy for that same reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou first.\u201d Cerys offered as they approached the door, \u201cI\u2019m not making that mistake again\u2026\u201d she added as she rubbed her fat hips in memory of when they first excitedly tried to go through that door at the same time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The alarm clock on April's phone rang, and the redhead slowly woke up and turned it off. She looked around in her small bedroom. May Swift, her cousin, was still sleeping in the bed next to her, as she probably went to sleep over midnight. April's head was still dozy, but she couldn't wait much time, so she forced herself out of bed and had a quick shower. April was a young woman who had just graduated out of college, with long red hair, a round freckled face with green eyes, a tiny nose, and meaty lips. Her body was curvaceous with a well-endowed butt and wide hips, the results of years of cooking practice, but she didn't mind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she woke up with the help of the shower, she was ready to prepare a quick breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday it was an important day for April: it was her first day on the job at the Italian restaurant \"Mamma Mia!\", and, therefore, she considered said breakfast the last exercise after an entire week dedicated to practice and improving herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril prepared some pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream. She made some extras so her cousin would have something to eat when she woke up. April's green eyes gazed at the door to the right, near the window. That was Marcie Smithers' bedroom's, and the redhead knew her friend has already gone to work. With a sigh, she thought of the few times the two had spent together since she and May had moved there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her own bedroom's door opened. It was a young woman with shoulder-length black hair, sleepy green eyes with dark circles and a round chin. She was still in her pajamas, which consisted of a tank top and underwear and was loose enough to hide her little potbelly. That woman was May, her cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, April,\" greeted the black-haired girl with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning, May. Up so early?\" asked the redhead with a note of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I smelled your cooking and I couldn't sleep anymore,\" replied May while taking a seat in front of her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay licked her lips as she served herself some pancakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have all of them, I can make more if necessary,\" said April before eating a strawberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, cousin,\" said May greedily taking all of the pancakes. The wavy-haired girl suddenly got more energy and wasn't sleepy anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, now that I think about it, isn't today...\" asked May, but April anticipated her next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I admit, I'm kinda nervous...\" she said, twirling a lock of hair in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, if you cook like this, only a dork wouldn't hire you,\" said May with a smile full of whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. By the way, do you want something more? I still have a few minutes for practice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you make in a few minutes? Some eggs and bacon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can even make you an omelette,\" said April, going to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" exclaimed May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamma Mia!\" was in a small square, which was a ten-minute walk from April's flat. \"Very convenient,\" she thought while going there and feeling the fresh breeze on her face, a few minutes of relax before arriving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamma Mia!'s colorful signboard was very visible in the plaza, as was the fancy aquamarine building of the restaurant, which stood out from the white of the neighboring shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril suddenly got nervous again. Ever since she was a teenager and made her first cooking attempt, she fell in love with cooking and wanted to do it as a job. She went to cooking class in college despite her father's disapproval (and even gained a good twenty pounds in these years), and now she was a step away from that dream's fulfillment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her fists and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant wasn't particularly large, with only a dozen tables, and at that time of the morning, it was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is anybody here?\" asked April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chubby young man burst from the kitchen door. His black suit and bow tie made April think he was a waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed her for a bit before asking: \"Are you the new cook?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm April Swift\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you, my name is Albert. Vera is waiting for you in the kitchen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril stepped in the kitchen trying to stay as calm as possible, as someone caught her by surprise screaming behind her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the new one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril turned around and saw a slim and tall woman in her early forties almost a head taller than her. She had short blonde hair falling on the left side of her sharp face and narrow brown eyes. Being so tall, April couldn't notice how well-endowed Vera was in the chest, despite the chef jacket she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead remained quiet, so the blonde got closer and examined her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmmmh, you definitely seem to have the body of a chef,\" the woman commented while gazing at April's hips. \"And, if I recall your curriculum, you graduated with good grades, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril nodded. \"Exactly, I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good start! But it means nothing to me if you can't keep up with the orders or if you don't keep the kitchen in order!\" Vera said loudly, interrupting the redhead. The blonde cook crossed her arms and grinned. \"But to know this, I have to seen it with my eyes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril gulped but, noticing Vera's stern gaze, she pumped her fist and said: \"I won't disappoint you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" replied the chef. \"By the way, my name is Vera Rossi, but just call me Vera\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril gleefully checked the mirror. She was wearing a white chef jacket, just like she had always dreamed, and it even fit her perfectly. She definitely wasn't going to lose it anytime soon, and would've proved Vera she was worth it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she changed, another cook arrived. She was a woman named Laura, around ten years younger than Vera and a full head shorter. She had olive skin and long brown hair. The woman greeted the new arrival with a big smile and some words of encouragement before Vera called them both to prepare the kitchen before clients arrived. And there was sure a lot of work to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrepare the tools, washing the vegetables, bake the bread, clean the floor... these were some of the many little chores Vera and her two cooks had to do. The blonde was loud and was like a sergeant, but there was also a motherly side of her that let April be comfortable while Vera explained her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the restaurant itself was kinda small, the pantry, instead, was huge: refrigerators loaded with vegetables, meat of all kinds and seafood, various desserts all made by Laura during the morning and, especially, lots of pasta. April knew Italy was well known for the pasta, and she studied it and learned how to make some sauces when she was hired by \"Mamma Mia!\", but she couldn't believe how many types of pasta there were: spaghetti, linguine, penne, farfalle, fusilli, etc... and each of them had different varieties! And that's not counting lasagna or tortellini which, according to Vera, is different from a dish than \"spaghetti\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera explained that \"pasta is everything in Italy\", to the point Italians ate past in most of their lunches and dinners. That's because there were so many kinds of pasta and sauces that it provided complete and different meals. Thankfully April had practiced pasta's cooking a lot in the days before (and May approved every dish she made, to the point the redhead wondered if her cousin simply liked everything), and it was actually much easier than expected. The harder part was the sauce, and it was also what gave most of the flavor, so she gave special attention to learning how to make it. Unfortunately, during her speech, Vera named some kinds of sauce April had never heard before. The redhead thought she had to expand her cooking knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes before noon, arrived a young slim girl, probably just out of high school, with long black hair and a green lock. She was wearing the same uniform as Albert, only with a skirt instead of pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of guests have just arrived,\" said while making small energetic jumps \"here's their order.\" She gave a paper to Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Amber. I hope you were more composed with the guests,\" said Vera. The waitress nodded, her long hair waving behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, April, this is yours!\" yelled Vera before loudly reading the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101176360'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: regulus11\r\nMember Since: August 24th, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">regulus11</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View regulus11's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/regulus11',%20'CommunityR_101176360',%20'400',%20'650')\">22</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'regulus11', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'August 24, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360',   'mess101176360_1591461115', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: regulus11 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffregulus11\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffregulus11', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101176360&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffregulus11');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add regulus11 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffregulus11\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> )</div></span></div></div>",

She was an only child, and the most people she had to cook for were her parents, her uncle and aunt, and her two cousins, May and her sister Melissa. Even in college, at most, she cooked for her roommate and a couple of guests once in a while. While in her new home, she usually had to prepare for her and her cousin, with some rare occasion where Jane wasn't at work or at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the restaurant closed at 2 o'clock and reopened at 7:30, but April had to be there at least half an hour before and, counting the time to tidy and clean up the kitchen, it meant that she had barely four hours of free time, which she spent in a nearby bar with Laura, who told her she had begun working there only a week before and had yet go get used to the amount of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, April managed to keep up the pace but was exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to sit?\" asked Laura with a giggle while bringing a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thanks,\" said April before sitting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another day done! Good job, girls!\" said Vera while walking into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to tell me that I'm good?\" asked April with sparkling eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly,\" replied the chef. The redhead lowed her head. \"You did your job fine, but here I demand high quality! And you don't have it yet! For instance, your bloody steak was cooked a bit too much, your meatballs were too hard and you can't make homemade pasta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril thought of Vera when she was preparing some ravioli starting with the basic ingredients, explaining that, while most of the time they use pre-made pasta to save time, if the client asks it, they'd prepare homemade pasta for a surplus of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind you, I'm not disappointed, I just think you need to, and can be better,\" concluded Vera politely. \"Normally, we'd clean the kitchen before closing up, but I allow you to go home early so you can practice. Maybe you can take a menu and try some dishes at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril came home very tired and disappointed. She wasn't fired at all, but she could have made a better impression. During the walk to home, she read through the menu in search of something to practice in the oncoming days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead sat on the couch, next to her cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, April! So, how was your first day?\" asked May without moving her eyes from the screen. She was playing a fighting game, and she was about to score her third win against her companion of videogames online, SummerT1me77.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" answered April after a few moments of silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she won, May turned to see her cousin. \"Are you sure? You don't look so well\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that the job is more tiring than expected, but it was fun. Oh, and I have to improve a bit\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Improve? You're already great!\" commented May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not enough. Especially because I can't keep up with all the dishes I prepare, so I make some mistakes here and there. My boss suggested me to practice some meals on the menu,\" she explained while showing the small menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay picked it and gave it a look. There was sure a lot of dishes, many of which, by their descriptions, sounded delicious and complicated to prepare (Although May could barely make some eggs and bacon, to the point she ate takeout whenever April didn't prepare dinner or lunch, so they could just be complicated only for her)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" blurted the black-haired girl. \"You just have to practice, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril nodded weakly. \"Yeah, thankfully, the restaurant is closed from Tuesday to Thursday, so after this weekend I'll have plenty of time. And I can even exercise between lunch and dinner shift if necessary! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you prepare something now?\" asked May while placing the controller on the small table in front of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May, it's past midnight! And I'm tired\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even this... Uh... Pasta carbonara?\" pleaded May with puppy eyes, though her expression resembled more of that of a goofy panda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril laughed. \"Only if you stop making that silly face. And if there are the ingredients\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There probably are. Marcie did the groceries this evening, before going to the gym,\" said May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Marcie hasn't come back from the gym yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead was a bit disappointed that her friend wasn't at home, but at least her cousin gave her the motivation necessary to practice despite the exhausting day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril checked the fridge and the pantry. Eggs, bacon, grated cheese, pepper, spaghetti... There was everything, so she rolled up the sleeves to prepare the best carbonara she had ever made, even if the ingredients weren't the exact ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a difficult dish to make, she had already tried it a couple of times, but she decided to make it abundant since the main hitch of her job was that she had to handle large quantities of food. She used most of the said ingredients, her new job did pay well, so she thought they could afford to do more groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready!\" said April while placing a large bowl overflowing of spaghetti carbonara. Although the redhead wasn't so sure it counted as a dinner, since she had a quick one at the restaurant, while a box of takeout fast food found on the table indicated May probably had one too. And that's not counting it was half past midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, May didn't seem to care. \"I've never eaten a pasta carbonara, I'm curious to taste it,\" she commented licking her lips. \"C'mon, April!\" said lifting her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young cook served two ladles in May's plate, and two in her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about to eat, that they heard the sound of keys unlocking the entrance door lock. In the apartment came a dark-skinned woman with long black hair that felt on the sides of her face. She was wearing a jacket left wide open, and underneath a tank top that showed her busty and toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcie!\" said April upon seeing her friend. \"Where have you been?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the gym, I went to a bar with some friend and had a couple of martinis,\" said Marcie with her head still dizzy. \"After all, tomorrow is Saturday, there's no school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was a bit saddened to hear that her old best friend went out with some other friends, but after all, she came at almost midnight, and tomorrow she had another day of work. And Jane spent most of the weekend evenings at the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you're hungry, cause we've made some pasta,\" said the redhead, deciding to ignore her worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I am quite hungry, just let me leave the gym bag in my room,\" replied Marcie, not thinking that her roommates were having dinner in the middle of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-skinned woman tied her hair into a ponytail and sat with the other two, in front of the dish full of spaghetti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want more, there's still plenty,\" said May who, unlike April, didn't wait for Marcie to begin slurping the spaghetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, April, today was your first day of work, wasn't it? How's your job?\" asked Marcie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril recounted the day to Marcie, including what Vera told her. Her friend explained that, when she began her job as a teacher, she too had troubles getting the hang of it, but after a year, she had learned how to handle it and a few helpful tricks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three roommates chatted for almost an hour about some events of the day or Marcie told some curiosities about the town of Honor\u00e8, since she had lived much more time there than the other two, who in the meanwhile had their second of carbonara, leaving a small portion that May said would eat the next day for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was happy to chat with Marcie, her best friend in middle and high school, and May, whom she had known since they were little kids, and thought she was very lucky of living with them in the same apartment. Unfortunately, she didn't realize how late it was getting until she accidentally eyed the clock in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead almost jumped out of her seat, and then quickly ran into her bedroom to waste as little as time possible for her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, April was satisfied with that day and was sure she would've improved her skills in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101176360'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: regulus11\r\nMember Since: August 24th, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">regulus11</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View regulus11's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/regulus11',%20'CommunityR_101176360',%20'400',%20'650')\">22</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'regulus11', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'August 24, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360',   'mess101176360_1591461116', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: regulus11 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffregulus11\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffregulus11', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101176360&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffregulus11');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add regulus11 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffregulus11\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> )</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After only a few days, April was having an existential crisis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd put her whole heart and soul into her passion for cooking. Ever since she was a little girl, she'd loved making food and eating it and having other people eat it; more importantly, she liked the attention that came with it! All her life, people had always told her \"Wow, April, what a good job!\" or \"You made this? I can't believe it!\" blah blah blah\u2014she'd been working at a real restaurant for less than two weeks and all she'd heard since she started was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to work, Swift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril ducked her head back down as she heard Vera's voice boom over the kitchen clamor. A stray lock of fiery red hair fell from underneath her hairnet and bounced over the soapy white suds of the sink. She'd been going non-stop since they opened today, all because one of the dish washers called out. Again. For the seventh time in the twelve days that she'd been working here. What was so hard about coming to work and doing your job? Just come to work, do your job, and be done! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the kitchen staff was like that here. Albert, the chubby waiter she'd met on her first day? He'd already put in his two weeks. Olivia, the girl she'd been complaining about and washing the floors for? This was the seventh time in the twelve days she was scheduled that she'd called out. Even Laura, the one person who she had really started to like, didn't seem to take this job all that seriously. She'd stroll in a few minutes late here or there, usually when April was opening. April was the only one working herself to the bone for this job that she'd thought she'd love, but you wouldn't know it because\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, take me now.\" Vera pinched the bridge of her nose as she dropped a load of plates into the deep sink, \"April, honey, I need you to pick up the pace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril jumped as Vera clapped her shoulders in a way that surely was supposed to be motivating, but all it did was make her jump out of her skin. With her slippery, soapy hands, April could practically feel her soul leave her body as the plate she was washing fell from between her fingers and shattered into a million porcelain pieces against the kitchen tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Swift, did you just break a plate in my kitchen?</i>\" Vera whipped back around, death in her eyes, before forcibly calming herself down with a low, murderous, \"Take your fifteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I just got here and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. Take your break and I'll...\" Vera growled, blowing a stream of hot air from her lips as she did her best to decompress, \"I'll get someone to clean this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about the third time that morning, April was thinking about quitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking in a kitchen was hard work. Everything she'd learned in culinary school hadn't prepared her for the school of hard knocks that was being Mamma Mia!'s scullion dishwasher. Mopper. Chef. Garbage girl. Half the time she wasn't even making any food! She was just doing everyone else's job for them because they called out or \"got sick\" or were already so late that it didn't matter. Honestly, April had only been employed for two weeks, and she already felt like she'd wasted her entire life ever thinking that she was cut out for culinary work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rough day?\" Laura asked softly with a smile as she pulled up a chair next to her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave it away?\" April sniffled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The puffy red eyes, mostly.\" her fellow slave-driven chef laughed a little, \"Don't take it so hard. It's the dinner rush. You know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just...\" April wiped her eyes, \"When's the part where I actually start <i>liking</i> my job?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shared a meaningful laugh. Laura had only been hired on about a week before April had gotten there, but they were already two weary veterans fighting the war for (or against, they weren't quite sure) Mamma Mia's Italian Restaurant. After plenty of day shifts, trips to the pub, and coming back to close for the night, the two of them had gotten to know one another awfully well. The customers sucked, they already had so much to work with in gossiping about their staff, and their boss <i>ugh</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll get better.\" Laura put her hand on April's shoulder, \"I mean hey, your cooking's getting better at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell? I'm never on the oven anymore.\" April pouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but remember when you let me try a bite of your lunch?\" April remembered the chicken dish in question, four days ago, \"That was so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she offered a smile weakly, \"I just wish that everyone here didn't suck so hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Laura laughed, \"You know what we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette looked around deviously for a moment before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should...</span></div></div>",

That way she might be nicer and give us less work\" said Laura slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice moved a strand of hair from her forehead. \"It sounds easy, but how do we do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura put her hands on the hips. \"Well, we are cooks, aren't we? We can prepare her some meals. Since she's so obsessed with Italian cousine, how about a dish of pasta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril sighed. \"That's exactly the reason why we can't: she would nitpick everything and gets even stricter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura bit her lower lip but, before she could reply, Vera's mighty voice yelled: \"Swift! Evans! It's not time for gossip, back to work! Customers are waiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, both girls stopped the discussion and April went back to clean the tower of plates in front of her. She kept cleaning and cleaning, her nose had gotten used to that terrible stench while her arm had memorized the movement and April was practically washing the plates without thinking. How many plates there were? It was almost like there was no end to them, every time one was cleaned, another one was added to the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed an eternity to April, the restaurant closed and there were no more dishes to wash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead left \"Mamma Mia!\" with an almost defeated walk, red eyes and a pale face. Her arms hurts by how much she rotated them. She was tired and only wanted to go home, get a snack and sleep. Thankfully, the next day she only had the dinner shift, so she could sleep some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, April!\" said a voice behind her. The redhead jolted by the surprise. It wad Laura, she was tired as well, but seemed to have some more energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was too out of breath to ask  \"what is it?\" but the brunette anticipated her: \"I know what we can make to Vera: a dessert. It's nice, everyone loves sweets and can be eaten every moment as a snack. I think it's the best present we can make\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert... Good\" repeated April, whose tired brain was elaborating the info. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For tomorrow I've asked to do only the dinner shift, just like you, so we can bake our 'special gift for our beloved boss'\" said with a fake flunky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" said April, who was less weary after hearing Laura's plan. \"It's a great idea! Do you want come to my home so we can decide the dessert and bake it together?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, where do you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Freshman Street 15, right down there\" replied April. \"Sorry but I gotta go, see you tomorrow\" added with a yawn before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, April found her cousin, May, playing video games as usual, while Marcie was already asleep. The redhead was too tired to prepare something, much to May's disappointment, and ate a bag of doritos before finally going to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Laura texted April that she would have arrived by lunchtime, so they could've prepare something together. April was truly excited of that, not only she finally had her first guest in her new apartment, but she could cook with Laura without Vera ordering them around. <br>\r\nThe brunette found April's apartment warm and hospital and met May, the cousin she had heard about a lot of times. Unfortunately, Marcie was at school. <br>\r\nAfter a quick tour of the apartment, not that it could've been longer by how small it was, the two cooks rolled up their sleeves and prepared lunch: a roast duck with tartar sauce and baked potatoes. During lunch, the two girls discussed their plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, what dessert should we make?\" asked Laura after gulping down a piece of potato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some muffins? I'm pretty good at it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can confirm it!\" intervened May, who was devouring the content of her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too simple\" said Laura. \"We should make something that shows how much we care for her, something big, like a pie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril tapped her chin. \"How about something more creamy and inviting? Something that would make you water just by looking at it. Maybe a cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned. \"I like it. And why stop there, we could make it even more inviting, like adding some chocolate topping\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! It must be irresistible for Vera\" said April feeling more and more involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, you're making me watering\" said May who had just finished her second serving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril kissed May's cheek. \"Don't worry, I'll make something for you too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! But you didn't need to do that\" replied May rubbing her cheek with the back of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, do we have the necessary ingredients?\" asked Laura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril raised her chest proudly. \"Don't worry, this morning I've bought enough ingredients that we could bake all kind of sweets we wish for an entire week\" and pointed at the pantry, whose door was doing its best to contain all the stuff bought by the redhead. <br>\r\nThe brunette's grin became even wider. \"Then what are we waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls put their soul into it. Making the crust crispy enough, balancing the cream.... Everything had to be perfect. April's passed some samples to May but the dark haired girl seemed to like everything the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours, the cheesecake was done. The two cools were proud of their result: it looked like those seen in recipe books and it was really inviting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril and Laura exchanged an high five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Vera will like it\" said Laura caught by a moment of insecurity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she will. C'mon, it's making me hungry\" replied April. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the redhead gave her cousin a large biscuit she made with the leftovers. \"I promised it, didn't I?\" said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, cousin\" said May before putting it in her mouth and continuing shooting at zombies on the tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and April chatted for an hour before going to work. In the meanwhile, Marcie came back home, met April's new friend and joined the two for ten minutes before they had to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend, Marcie, is really cool!\" exclaimed Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril nodded, without moving her eyes from the package she had in her hands, which contained the cheesecake for Vera. \"Yes, she indeed is\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few steps, the redhead changed arguments. \"Do you think Vera will like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe she's so concentrated with her job that she doesn't want a distraction, or maybe it isn't THAT good\" started blabbering April before Laura calmed her down by placing an hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok. After all, even if she gets angry for this, to get even worse she would have to whip us\" said the brunette and both women exchanged a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant they set foot in the kitchen, Vera appeared in front of them and gave an inquisitive gaze at the small box in April's hands. \"Swift, what do you have there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril felt like she got caught trading something illegal, her face was as red as her hair, and said. \"I-it's a pre-present for you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera approached an hand to her ear. \"What did you say? I can't hear you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swift and I made this for you, chef\" said Laura in a single breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women gulped while crossing Vera's brown eyes, then she picked it up and, with a surprised tone of voice, said: \"Well, thank you\" as she picked April's box. She opened it and for a moment her face was pleased before going back to her usual stern expression. \"Now go wear the jacket! We have a lot of customers today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, chef!\" said in chorus the two women standing in attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to the kitchen, they saw their cheesecake standing on a small table at a corner, with already a missing slice. April gave Laura a victorious look and the brunette replied with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day April worked as usual washing the plates, cleaning up the floor, tidying up pots and pans. However, she wasn't much downcast because she noticed that, once in a while, Vera was munching. A couple of times she even spitted crumbs as she yelled orders and even demanded April to prepare a dish of beef and salad! When the restaurant closed, on the small table at the corner of the kitchen, there was only an empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101176360'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: regulus11\r\nMember Since: August 24th, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">regulus11</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View regulus11's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/regulus11',%20'CommunityR_101176360',%20'400',%20'650')\">22</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'regulus11', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'August 24, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360',   'mess101176360_1591461118', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: regulus11 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffregulus11\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffregulus11', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101176360&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffregulus11');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add regulus11 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffregulus11\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> )</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was night, and the apartment was pervaded by dark, with the only light on being in the living room. Lying comfortably on the two-seater couch, there was a young woman of 21 years old. Her name was May, and she had shoulder lenght wavy black hair, a small nose and green eyes with a constant black circle around them. Her body was, for the most part, slim, except for a potbelly resulted from a sedentary lifestyle of couch, video games and tasting some recipes for her cousin, who had just began working in an Italian restaurant. May habitually spent of the days wearing comfortable and large clothes, like the large black tank top and the pair of leggins she was wearing in that moment. After all, why bother when you spent most of the time inside these four walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! This time I'll beat you for good!\" said the dark-haired girl while pressing some switches on her controller. Unfortunately, a bomb hit her vehicle and caused her to stop. \"God damnit!\" Yelled the girl, almost throwing away the controller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was about to ask \"SummerT1me77\" for a revenge, but the latter anticipated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's too late. I'm going to bed. Goodnight\" said the message on the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay checked the clock, slightly illuminated by a small lamp in the corner on the living room. It was almost two o'clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay replied: \"Ok, see you tomorrow. Same hour\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummerT1me77 was a person May met online a month ago, before she moved in, and since then, the two have played almost every night, challenging themselves with multiple games they shared. The thing that May didn't know, however, was that SummerT1me77 was actually Lily Monet, a young woman who lived in the apartment in front of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward May silently entered her bedroom, which she shared with her cousin, April. The chubby redhead had gone to sleep a few hours before, and her loud snores resounded in the entire room. May got used to that after the first few nights, and one day she jokingly claimed to April of being able to sleep even next to an airplane's engine, the redehad had simply replied with a flip on the forehead. <br>\r\nThe raven haired girl didn't even bother to change herself, and quickly fell into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen May woke up, the sun had risen a few hours before, but she couldn't have noticed since her bedroom didn't have any window. In the same room, there was April, who was getting dressed in front of the wall mirror. The redhead had the same green eyes of May, but had a rounder, freckled face and was a bit plumper, especially in the lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" asked a dozy May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, May!\" said April noticing her cousin had woken up. \"It's half past ten, I have to go to the restaurant. There's breakfast on the table. Bye\" said the redhead before leaving the room in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's brain cells still weren't connected and simply grasped that it was somewhat late morning and her cousin had to work. Once she went to the table in the kitchen, some minutes later, she noticed her breakfast: a smiling face with eggs as eyes and bacon as a mouth, accompanied by a couple of pancakes with blueberry syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, you're the best cousin one could wish for\" said May with a grin before proceeding to eat the smiling face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, sitting on the couch, there was a dark skinned woman with long hair tied into a ponytail, Marcie, already dressed with a shirt and a . She was marking some papers with a red pen, May guessed she was correcting a test, while watching some local news on tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay decided to ignore Marcie, hoping the latter would've left soon so she could've taken control of the living room as usual. The two didn't get along at all, and the only reason they could afford to live together was through April, who was Marcie's best friend since middle school, although their relationship weakened since they went to different colleges, and now the two could barely spend time together with their jobs.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seemed that Marcie didn't want to ignore May. Once she finished correcting the test, she grabbed the newspaper on the table and took a seat next to May.<br>\r\nThe latter tried to concentrate on what remained of her breakfast, hoping Marcie would just ignore her, however, she couldn't help but give a quick and envious gaze at Marcie's ample cleavage and then move her eyes toward her own barely-existent chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi May\" said the long-haired woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Marcie\" said deadpan May, scratching her dozy eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your plans for today?\" asked Marcie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay gave her a look that said: 'do you really want me to tell you?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you're going to stay at home and laze around all day, isn't it?\" said the long haired woman with a condescending tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where's the problem in that?\" thought May. Damnit, she moved away from home with April so that she could've stopped to hear her parents' complaint, only to have Marcie say that instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been living here?\" asked Marcie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay thought of when she and April moved there. \"Two weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many times have you left the apartment?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay shrugged her shoulders. \"A few\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie cocked an eyebrow. \"And for how long? Whenever I come home, I always find you on that stupid couch! C'mon, Valentine is a nice town to visit! You should go outside more often. I'm about to go jogging in the park, do you wanna come with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay shook her head. \"Thank you, I'm fine\". She might could've not minded a brief walk or going into a place not that far away, but a jog would've killed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie sighed. \"If you really want to remain in your nest, fine, I don't care. Then let's get into some more serious stuff: you need to find a job\" and placed the local newspaper right in front of May. \"I don't want to sound tedious,\" although May was thinking exactly that, \"but, if you really want to stay here, you have to contribute somehow. Here there are some job announcements, pick one\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay gave a quick look at the local newspaper, but only read an article about the opening of a new sushi restaurant. Meanwhile Marcie went to her room to change into her jogging gear, and when she came back into the living room, she found May already sitting on the couch and zapping on the tv. The dark skinned woman shook her head in disappointment and thought to ignore her, hoping that lazy girl would've found a job by the next week, otherwise, she'd have to talk about it with April. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning flew quickly for May. After jumping from channel to channel for a good ten minutes, she turned on her console and grabbed the controller. That was the sweet life for May, just her enjoying some video games without any parent yelling at her, at least until Marcie wouldn't had come back. <br>\r\nSummerT1me77 wasn't online, so she tried a new game she had just bought. An horror rpg-fighting she hadn't tried yet, and found pretty enjoyable for the most part, but not scary at all, and before she could realize it, it was already lunch time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay took a pause from videogaming to order some takeaway food from Happy Burgy, the cheapest fast food shop in town. Before dialing the number, May thought Marcie could've back in any moment, and maybe she wanted some takeaway food too, so she turned off the phone and waited for her roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then she would definitely talk about getting a stupid job like every other time. Damn, she's a broken record!\" muttered May with a nervous kick to the bin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes fell on the newspaper Marcie gave her, still untouched, and scratched her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, there's an easy part time job. It wouldn't waste too much free time, and Marcie would finally stop bothering me\" thought while picking the journal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101176360'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: regulus11\r\nMember Since: August 24th, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">regulus11</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View regulus11's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/regulus11',%20'CommunityR_101176360',%20'400',%20'650')\">22</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'regulus11', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'August 24, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360',   'mess101176360_1591461119', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: regulus11 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffregulus11\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffregulus11', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101176360&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffregulus11');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add regulus11 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffregulus11\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> )</div></span></div></div>",

Why would she need to change what was already perfect? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay spent the rest of the day playing her new video games. At one point, she found an incredibly hard stealth-based one, which got her stuck in the same level for an entire hour. May was getting annoyed to the point she was tempted to throw the controller against the tv but Marcie's arrival removed that option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay avoided to look at Marcie, that bore would have soon asked what job had she picked and then would've made another lecture of hers, as if May was one of her students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, Marcie didn't ask May anything, actually, she ignored May and, after drinking some water, went in her room, leaving it only an hour later to go to the gym. The dark haired girl was pretty cool with this, much better than any quarrel or lecture, and didn't question Marcie's behavior, instead, in her mind there were only two worries: \"Which game should I play next?\" and \"What's in the fridge?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays passed and Marcie, despite finding May in the same spot of the couch whenever she walked home, never said a word to her. Even during the rare times they were eating together (of course, there was April too), they never exchanged a single word with each other.<br>\r\nThis didn't go unnoticed by April but, between the constant anymosity that there's been between the two and her new job, the redhead had always delayed the day in which she would've made the two reconcile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay, however, was the happiest one out of this situation: she could play video games and watch tv all day without her parents, or anyone else for that matter, to scold her and tell her what to do and her dear cousin April prepared her delicious meals almost every day. To make things better, April had been spending a lot of time at home practicing new recipes ever since she begun her job as cook in an Italian restaurant, and needed May's help to taste her culinary attempts. Everything April made was already delicious for the tv-obsessed girl, but the redhead felt the need to improve even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, between a movie, a gaming session with SummerT1me77 and a dish of pasta, May's life couldn't be more perfect. Nothing had to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day... </span></div></div>",

Don't forget to study chapters six and seven of your history book for next week\" said a teacher, hoping her words would reach the teenagers' ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid teacher was a busty African-American young woman with long black hair tied into a ponytail. She was wearing a formal dark jacket over a white shirt and a pair of black pants. Her name was Marcie Smithers, the newest teacher of Valentine's high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie's wide brown eyes gazed at the students, hoping at least one could've given her a nod that they heard her. Thankfully, there was her pupil, Amanda Brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, problem Ms. Smithers\" said the young redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Marcie could've come home with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her apartment, she found one of her roomates, May Swift, sleeping on the couch, with an animated movie on tv and an half eaten bowl of chips in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the usual, that girl would just rest her butt on the couch and get up only when it was time to sleep. If she had a job so she could've contributed to the expenses, she wouldn't have much problems with that. <br>\r\nShe checked April's room, but it was Friday, meaning that the redhead was at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie went to her bedroom without bothering about waking up May, when she was sleeping, not even an explosion could wake her up, picked the papers from her case and organized them on the desk. Her bedroom was fairly simple and tidy, everything was in its own place, from her numerous clothes in her wardrobe, to the books on the shelves above the desk and the bed. <br>\r\nShe looked at the time on her phone and decided she would've prepared the test the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie prepared her gym bag and left the apartment. May was still sleeping. The dark-skinned woman thought she was a little more of a piece of furniture at that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine's gym was pretty famous in the area, though not as much as some of the town's restaurants, and had multiple fitness classes. Marcie discovered it not long after she moved in Valentine, and quickly became one of its most famous customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie had just finished working out, and went to the locker room. She greeted the other two women who were about to have a shower, after being a regular for all that time, Marcie had known almost every client of the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the phone, and saw a message, it was from April:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Marcie, are you home tonight? May and I are planning a movie night, and I'll bake some hazelnut muffin, just as you like ;)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie smiled and replied with a quick: \"Sure, count me in\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going into the shower, she looked with pride at her toned body. Gone were the high school days of chubby Marcie. <br>\r\nThen, a cold hand touched Marcie's shoulder, making the woman jolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have seen your face\" laughed a woman with short strawberry blonde hair and a couple of piercings on her left eyebrow. Despite her childish-looking face, she had a pretty muscular body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrysta! Dear God, never do it again\" yelled Marcie before bursting into a laugh like her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This evening, Natalie, Paula and I are going to the Pink Dolphin for an appetizer, are you with us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie was thoughtful, as she had just said \"yes\" to April, so Chrysta added with a wink: \"Maybe there are Teddy and Lucio too\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed much more tempting to Marcie but then considered how little time she had spent with April since her friend moved in, and declined: \"Sorry, tonight I have already something in program with my roommates, how about tomorrow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but don't you dare bail on us then\" said Chrysta in a fake menacing tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I swear it\" said Marcie drawing a cross on her chest with her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back, it was almost eight o'clock, and April was having her dinner shift.<br>\r\nMay was playing video games as usual. After coldly greeting each other, Marcie shut in her own bedroom and turned on the pc to prepare the test until, a few hours later, she heard the entrance door opening. Since there wasn't much left for the test, she rushed typing the final questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home\" said April's voice accompanied by the sound of steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, cousin, are you ready for tonight?\" asked May pumping her fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just give me a second and let me bake the muffins. The dough is ready, all I need to do is put them in the oven\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, meanwhile I'll start the movie\" said May before turning off the console and connecting her computer at the tv screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Marcie? Hasn't she come back already?\" asked the redhead once she had turned on the oven. She then remembered to have seen her jacket hanged next to the entrance door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That swot is locked in her bedroom\" nagged May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That swot was doing her job!\" bursted Marcie slamming her bedroom's door. \"Unlike someone who doesn't have anything to do for all day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay snorted without replying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, please!\" said April stomping a foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women turned their attention to her and the redhead put her hands on her mouth, as if she was sorry for what she did, then the moment of embarrassment passed and said: \"Let's not quarrel over such things, instead enjoy this movie night as friendly roommates\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, April\" said May, avoiding to give a nasty gaze toward Marcie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skinned woman nooded. \"You're right, I'm sorry April\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead clapped her hands together and smiled. \"It's no problem! So, May, what movie do you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either Mad Max or Beauty and the Beast\" replied her cousin with a grin while opening the folder with the two downloaded movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two very similar movies\" thought sarcastically Marcie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you prefer, Marcie?\" Asked April taking a seat between the two. The couch wasn't well suited for three people, so they were squished between the armrests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno... Let's go with the second\" said the dark-skinned woman while squirming to free her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" exclaimed April as May started the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the movie they remained quiet for most of the time, especially because not long after the muffins were ready and the three roommates were busy snacking on them. After an hour of so, May fell asleep, resting her head on April's shoulder. Marcie couldn't help but notice how Apri bursted into tears at the ending, just like with every romantic movie, and giggle at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's always nice seeing Beauty and the beast\" said Marcie with a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, especially when we're all together\" commented April. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this was a nice idea, but now I really have to sleep, goodnight!\" said Marcie but, after she stood up, April called her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" said the redhead, and she moved May's head from her shoulder to stay more comfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Asked Marcie, hoping for a quick answer so she could finally go to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101176360'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: regulus11\r\nMember Since: August 24th, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">regulus11</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View regulus11's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/regulus11',%20'CommunityR_101176360',%20'400',%20'650')\">22</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'regulus11', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'August 24, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360',   'mess101176360_1591461121', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: regulus11 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffregulus11\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffregulus11', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101176360&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffregulus11');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add regulus11 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffregulus11\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> )</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a sunny morning in Orcawood, and three ladies living in an apartment in Freshman Street 15 were just having breakfast. No one of them was a great cook, but they managed to handle it well. At the table there were two blondes. One with long curly hair, who was having a bowl with milk and corn flakes, and the other with her hair cut in a pixie bob, who was eating a buttered toast and some bacon. Those were, respectively, Margaret Mckenzie and Lily Monet.<br>\r\nPreparing some scrambled eggs was an half-japanese woman with black hair cut in a messy bob. She was Sakura Brown, and the owner of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received the apartment from an old aunt three years before, and decided to move in immediately while accepting the first job she found, which was as a clerk in a small discount in the suburb. After almost two years of living alone in such a large flat, she had grown bored of it, decided to rent it, so she could round out her salary too. There were two spare room, after all, if she moved some of the furniture in the living room and prepared two beds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Sakura didn't expect was to have such pretty women as roomates. Lily was tiny, cute as a button and had wide blue eyes that made her look like a childe, while Margaret had beautiful face features and a well defined figure. The asian girl considered herself very lucky, to the point she asked both of them half of the rent she initially wanted. There was only a problem, no one knew Sakura was a lesbian, and she was reluctant to confess her feelings to any woman in fear of being rejected, something very easy to happen when said woman probably had a different orientation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, isn't today a beautiful day?\" asked Sakura while sitting at the table with her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret glanced at the window. There wasn't a single cloud in the sky. \"Yeah, so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this evening we could go out for a walk in town centre, and maybe have a dinner in a nice place. Don't you agree?\" proposed Sakura, she gleefully thought about going out with her roommates since her boss told her that day the market would've been closed for some restorations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily nooded with a smile, while Margaret replied: \"Do you know I have my job this afternoon, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course, I mean after your job. You come home and we'll go or, if you prefer, Lily and I can wait for you outside the shop when your job is over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I'll think about it\" said Margaret before leaving and closing herself in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed, and Lily put a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-if you really want, we can go just the two of us, or you can also invite a friend of yours if you prefer\" said the tiny blonde while her cheeks have become red. Lily was very shy, and Sakura remembered that the first week Lily moved in rarely uttered a word before she got used to her roomates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's cheeks became red. \"T-thanks, Lily\" said before deciding to dedicate her attention toward the breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled in reply, while placing the empty plate in the kitchen sink, and went to work in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was in her room, drawing on a large paper a sensual woman, with long flowing hair and a skimpy dress. Sakura learned drawing with that style by copying some illustrations of comic book artist Milo Manara and in a couple of years she could copy effectively most of his drawings. Then she started making drawing on her own, quickly developing her own, albeith similar, style. One of the main difference one could find was that Sakura's women were much more rubenesque, as the half-Japanese woman loved adding some soft features and curves in the women she drew.<br>\r\nAt one moment, Sakura could hear Margaret leaving for work, so she put the pencil in its place and hid the paper in the large drawer of the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura tied a bandana around her head went to the cabin in the hall and grabbed a feather duster a cloth and a degreaser. <br>\r\n\"Let's start with the kitchen\" said with the same determination of an action hero who was ready to face an entire army of zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a broom she swiped away the crumbs on the floor that resulted from that day's breakfast and lunch. Dammit, there were too many for her tastes, and she told her roomates many times to eat on the table!<br>\r\nShe cleaned everything with the accuracy of the surgeon. The sink, the counter, even the windows. Everything had to shine. Lily tried to sneak into the kitchen but, noticing that Sakura was in the middle of a \"cleaning craze\" she went back to her bedroom unnoticed. During these moments, the best ideas was avoid to stay too close to Sakura and especially not leave the room for a while in the risk of slightly soiling something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sakura moved to the living room, and then to the bathroom, in the meanwhile, Lily decided to go for a walk in town with her camera, that way she couldn't have done anything that angered the clean freak of her roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Sakura had cleaned every inch of the house, except her roommates' bedrooms. As much as she was curious to visit them, she wanted to respect their privacy. <br>\r\nShe sat on the armchair and turned on the tv, watching some local news and then switching to one of these shows where a hovel gets restructured and become a wonderful house. Sakura confronted the final result with her own apartment, and noticed it wasn't that different, albeit hers was much smaller. She was thankful her aunt had such good tastes in interior decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sakura felt a vibration in her pants: Lily had just sent her a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margaret told me she doesn't want to go out this evening. Do you wanna go just you and me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura pouted. She would have really wanted to go out with Margaret, especially in the hopes of seeing her in that new dress Sakura just gave her for the blonde's birthday and, among the two roomates, she definitely did find Margaret the most attractive one, with her more defined curves and confident expression,while Lily was cute but too scrawny. However, the tiny blonde was so close to her... could it be... Thinking the possibility of Lily's liking her back, Sakura's heart skipped a beat. Then she shook her head, it was probably her immagination. Even still, it was rare for Sakura to have a free evening  and she could not waste this chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed it had been almost five minutes since she saw the text and hadn't replied yet, so she quickly texted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101176360'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: regulus11\r\nMember Since: August 24th, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">regulus11</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View regulus11's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/regulus11',%20'CommunityR_101176360',%20'400',%20'650')\">22</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'regulus11', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'August 24, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360',   'mess101176360_1591461123', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: regulus11 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffregulus11\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffregulus11', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101176360&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffregulus11');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add regulus11 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffregulus11\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> )</div></span></div></div>",

She pondered and poked her tiny chin with her bony index before picking a box of chocolate wavers, then she cautiously closed the door and crossed the kitchen, making attention to not leave any mark on the clean and sparkling floor. Sakura, her roommate and owner of the apartment, must have cleaned it not much time before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was extra careful to check if Sakura was in the hall, if the half Japanese woman find out that she was snacking (and leaving crumbs!) in her room, it would probably anger her. Thankfully there was no trace of Sakura and the sounds coming from the living room implied she was watching the television, so Lily could safely go back  to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat comfortably on her desk chair, thanks to her short and petite frame she could even cross her legs, and began typing on the keyboard. Lily Monet was a young and small woman, with very long blonde hair and blue eyes. She was already small, but her habit of wearing oversized clothes to stay comfortable made her appear even smaller. At that moment, for instance, she was wearing a large yellow sweater and bright blue yoga pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was of French origins, and had recently found a job in a large company, of which the blonde never remembered the name. That job was a blessing to her, all she had to do was check the daily mails and data and rearrange them and/or send them to the proper sector of the company, often acting as a kind of coordinator, all of this without leaving home. Being this one a big company, there was a lot of stuff to rearrange, but usually Lily managed to finish her work after three hours, leaving the rest of the day free and, even better, she could just work at home with her own pc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was working, she usually ate an entire box of biscuits, she wasn't sure if it was to get the necessary energies, because she enjoyed their taste or simply to pass the time while she read through all the files she found. One thing was sure: her metabolism was efficient enough, therefore she had no fear of gaining a pound on her tiny frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce work was finished, it was almost lunchtime, and when she went to the kitchen Sakura was beginning to prepare lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lily, I was about to make some Onigiri, you wanna help me?\" asked the half Japanese woman. She had black hair in a messy bob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily nodded. She was a very shy girl, and rarely spoke, that was also another reason of why she liked her job so much, so that she couldn't interact a lot with other people. That always made her nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde loved Japanese food, especially stuff with rice like sushi or Onigiri, the latter was basically a meatball of rice with some raw fish inside. When she learnt that Sakura was able to cook it (thanks to her mom) , she went in ecstasy, and would've eaten Sakura's cooking every meal if it wasn't for the other roomate, Margaret, the other roommate, who didn't like sushi at all. Margsret even tasted a sushi roll but the taste of raw tuna repulsed her, so Sakura only prepared it whenever for lunch or dinner there are only Lily and her, and the tiny blonde was happy of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two roomates cooked rice while chatting every once in a while, of course, Lily being extremely shy, Sakura did most of the talking while Lily replied with short words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, all done! Enjoy\" exclaimed cheerfully Sakura clapping her hands together as the two girls where sitting at the small glass table, a plate with some onigiris in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls picked an onigiri each, and ate it. Lily loved it, and never dropped her smile as she chewed the ball of rice. Meanwhile, Sakura ate more slowly, she watched Lily happily eating the onigiri she made. The half Japanese woman found the tiny blonde very cute when she was eating. <br>\r\nSoon Lily finished her onigiri and stretched an arm to pick a second one but was hesitant. Her bright blue eyes gazed Sakura's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, pick how many you want! There's alot of them and I'm not sure I can eat much more\" said the dark-haired girl with a smile. Her cheeks have become red too but Lily, much to Sakura's relief, didn't notice it since she had immediately picked a second onigiri. And just as quickly, she picked a third, a fourth and so on until there were no more onigiris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You sure eat alot for being so tiny\" commented Sakura \"and cute\" added in a whisper that Lily didn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl blushed and smiled, not knowing how to reply. Did she ate a bit too much? Maybe she had been too greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing her roomate's embarrassment, Sakura said: \"It's a sign you appreciate my work! If you like it so much, next time I can even make more. It's a shame Margaret doesn't like it, or we could enjoy these special sushi meals all together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black haired girl got up with an almost mechanical movement and started to clear the table. Lily looked at the clock and realized Sakura had work in an hour, so she helped her roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Lily\" said Sakura almost heartened, only to become suddenly strict: \"Now, please, leave. I only have half an hour to make the kitchen shine\" said as she gazed through the floor tiles in search pf rice grains and crumbs that had fallen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily didn't reply back and quickly left the kitchen. Every \"clean-craze\" turned Sakura from a sweet roomate into a tyrant. The best way to deal with it was to go out for a while and the tiny blonde had developed the habit to go for a walk while taking photos of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily walked down Freshman Street. It was close to the town centre but not enough to be caothic, with small trees on the sidewalks and fancy shops in every block. There was one which sold plushies of every kind and the girl was tempted to buy them, however she knew that if she had bought one she would've ended up buying all of them and estinguish all of her salary. Next there was a candy shop, where Lily bought a small bag of candy every day, including that one. That way she kept herself busy munching gummies before reaching the street next to the lake. <br>\r\nThe blue water was shining under the sun, and some sailboats were racing from one side to another. Lily took multiple photos of these sailboats, especially the yellow one, since yellow was her favorite color. The she walked down the lakeshore, taking photos here and there. Despite being autumn, a few people still spent the evening next to the lake, a couple of them even daring to take a swim, including a young, muscular woman with short strawberry blonde hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Lily looked at the pictures she took on the pc and deleted the ones she didn't like, while suddenly the door opened and the tiny blonde closed the folders of the pc, leaving the screensaver with the image of a space-ship. The one who opened the door was Margaret. Like Lily, Margaret had blonde hair, but hers is wavy and longer, while her face was sharper and her body more curvaceous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm eating out with a friend, you're alone for dinner, ok?\" said Margaret before closing the door without waiting for Lily's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was fine with that, as it meant she had all the house for herself for at least a couple of hours. She prepared everything: made some toasts with cheese, brought a package of biscuits, turned on the tv and the console and grabbed the joystick. Every night, Lily would spend hours playing videogames until she was too tired but most of the time there were her roomates, which meant she had to keep the volume low if not turning it off, instead that night she could hear the sound of her guns and her chainsaw mowing down dozens of zombies.<br>\r\nShe noticed her videogames friend, Dark5Mistress, was online. Lily's codename was SummerT1me77 and she had been playing with Dark5Mistress every night since a couple of months before but, ironically, neither of them knew their videogames mate was living in the same building, with only a couple of walls between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore deciding a game, a message appeared on a small window in the corner of the screen: \"You already online?\" asked Dark5Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\" replied SummerT1me77. \"Have you bought the new ZombiEmpire 3?\" asked. She hadn't played it yet and was anxious to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, sorry. Wanna play Astro-Race?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Lily spent the next few hours playing videogames. She didn't hear Sakura coming home from home at half past midnight but neither did the half-Japanese woman hear the beeps of the spaceships racing through an asteroids field. Sakura was too sleepy and, with a zombiesque walk, went to her room and collapsed on the bed. After another half-hour, Lily felt tired and texted her friend she was going to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the bowl and the plate back to the kitchen and went to sleep after another usual day, with nothing particularly different. Margaret came home not long after Lily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, however, happened something that would completely shake Lily's daily habits and her life:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101176360'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'regulus11', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: regulus11\r\nMember Since: August 24th, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">regulus11</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View regulus11's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/regulus11',%20'CommunityR_101176360',%20'400',%20'650')\">22</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/regulus11\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'regulus11', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'August 24, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360',   'mess101176360_1591461125', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101176360/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: regulus11 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffregulus11\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffregulus11', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101176360&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffregulus11');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add regulus11 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffregulus11\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> )</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day began like every other day. Lily woke up, had a quick breackfast and carried the usual box of biscuits in her room. However, when she entered in her company's website, she didn't find the usual mails and data, instead, there was only a single mail destined to Lily Monet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To me?\" said the tiny blonde, still surprised. After months of doing the same work over and over, she didn't expect for the company to suddenly contact her. Did she do something wrong? Lily began to think of a possible mistake she could've made, maybe when she was thinking too much about the games she would've played later, or when she distracted herself for a moment whenever she picked a biscuit from the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's only one way to find out\" said Lily with a 'click' of her mouse. She put a biscuit in her mouth and read the opened mail:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Ms. Monet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe, of the Yeng Dinstribution, appreciate a lot the work you do and your constant efficiency, which we think should be of example to every worker of our company. <br>\r\nFor this reason, we are offering you a promotion, which includes an higher pay and 20 days of vacation every year. <br>\r\nYou are waited for a meeting at the Yeng Palace, this morning at 11.30 A.M, to learn and discuss about your new job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeng Dinstribution staff manager, Miranda Mice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was reliefed. She had actually gotten a promotion. And did they really thought she was the ideal employee? For Lily, it wasn't even that difficult, and took up only the morning, in fact, she wasn't quite sure if that promotion was a good thing: what if she had to work more? What if it left her with barely any freetime?<br>\r\nIf it was a good or bad thing, Lily would've learned about it in a couple of hours, at the meeting. Speaking of, the Yeng Dinstribution venue was in the business district, not exactly behind the corner, if she didn't want to arrive late, she had to move now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLily put the closest she found as formal clothes: a green shirt with a pair of black pants. The blonde was fond of wearing more comfortable clothes to stay at home, like oversized sweathers or t-shirts, and had to search through all of her guardrobe to find something decent for a job meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little more than an hour (damned city roads too busy), Lily was in front of the palace of the Yeng Dinstribution. From what Lily knew, it was a subsidiary of the much larger Yeng Corporation. <br>\r\nInside there was a large and bright hall, almost completely empty, save for a young woman at the reception and a couple of people sitting on a bench next to a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering all of her courage, Lily approached the receptionist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I have a me-meeting with the ma-manager\" said with her high-pitched voice. Her face completely red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist looked at her computer. \"Lily Monet, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily nooded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist turned on a small microphone on the desk. \"Mrs. Mice, Monet is here. Shall I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hohoh!\" laughed a husky voice from the microphone. \"Let her in now! I'm eager to meet her\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary maintained her composture. \"Seventh floor, at the end of the right hall\" said quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-th-thanks\" said Lily before running toward the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was standing in front of a pair of large and wooden double doors. A plate confirmed it was the staff manafer's office. From the other side, she could hear some noises and the sound of unwrapped plastic bags. Lily knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, come in!\" said a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda Mice, the manager, was the fattest person Lily had ever seen. Her body was almost completely round, her neckless head topped by some curly brown hair, while the desk was half-moon shaped to accomodate her gargantuan belly. A tent-sized red dress covered her body, while fat-chocked arms reached the bags frenchfries piled on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, take a seat\" said the manager, pointing at a chair in front of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily didn't react immediately, blocked by her shyness and the shock of seeing that landwhale, but then quickly ran toward the chair. These two women, sitting at the opposite sides of the desk, were completely opposite. One tiny and skinny, the chair almost too big for her, the other huge and wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda glanced at the clock on the wall. \"You've arrived twenty minutes ahead. I like this! It means you really take your commitments seriously\" commented the massive manager. Red sauce dripping from her double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks\" said the blonde in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"please, take some fries. It's almost lunchtime, you must be hungry\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lily, it was almost a couple of hours early for lunch, but didn't want to offend the manager. Besides, she was used to eat snacks in the morning, so she picked one of the many French fries bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today there was a special offer at \"Fried kingdom\", so I ordered quite a few\" commented Miranda with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked at the graveyard of empty packages piled on a corner of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, try them with this sauce\" said Miranda moving a glass close to Lily, or at least, as close as she could before her belly was pressed against the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside there was the red sauce that smeared Miranda's double chin, it was similar to ketchup, but of a brighter color and a denser appearance. Lily poured a French fry and tasted it. The flavour sent fireworks inside her tastebuds and the tiny blonde couldn't wait to pour a second french fry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smiled behind her hands while she saw Lily's happy expression. \"Really good, isn't it? It's one of our latest products\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily stopped to pour french fries in the sauce and eat them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large woman cleared her throat before explaining: \"The Yeng Corporation make products of every kind for the people all around the globe. The Yeng Dinstribution doesn't have the same influence of variety of products, and specializes in food. Mostly snacks but also special ingredients and crops\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily kept nooding at every word. Thinking back, many of the mails she had to arrange was about food orders and/or production. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda gulped down a mouthful of fries. \"At the moment we make products dinstributed in Valentine and the neighboring towns, ingredients for the restaurants, products for the markets... Stuff like that. Your new job, if you accept it, will be very important and closely related to our products... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily gulped, hoping it won't be something too demanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda spilled the remaining fries in her mouth and threw away the empty pacage. \"Your new job,\" said between munches, \"is to...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A young woman was looking at the mirror. She had long, wavy blonde hair tied into a ponytail and bright green eyes. He mouth was widened in a 32-teeth smile as she gazed herself with the leopard print vest, which left the belly-button exposed, the short black skirt and the stockings, all of these clothes emphasized her slim body, something she was quite proud of. <br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, a voice interrupted that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margaret, you know those clothes are for sale, don't you?\" asked sarcastically an indian woman who was standing behind the cash desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, Kyra\" hissed Margaret to the colleague who had just broken her moment of dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde quickly changed back into her ugly black uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a couple of months ago, if I wanted, I could've bought half of the stuff in sale here\" thought with pique as she remembered the day her parents told her she needed to \"grow up\" and sent her in that crappy town with \"only\" a couple of thousands of bucks. She even thought she had been lucky at finding a job in Orcawood's largest clothing shop, but it actually meant she had to spend all day with clothes she could never buy with her miserable salary.<br>\r\nAnd to add insult to the injury, she saw many women who could afford these fashionable clothes, some of which Margaret thought they didn't have the right body to give those clothes justice. Of course, that's not getting to the fact that said shop had a plus size section, meaning they often have overweight women who apparently preferred buying a new pair of pants rather than losing a few pounds. <br>\r\nMargaret, instead, had the perfect body, with no sign of fat or cellulite, no muffing top, not even a scar, and yet she could only assist these fat women and even had to compliment them whenever they asked for an opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, other five minutes and she would've been free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret was resting her head between the crossed arms on the cashier desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kyra\", she called her colleague. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired woman was busy reordering some pair of jeans by size, with no answer to the blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyra!\" called with a higher tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the third call, Kyra replied. \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you happen to know any nice place on the street next to the lake?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends, are you going with someone?\" asked the Indian woman placing an hand on her svelte hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" replied bluntly the blonde girl, to make clear she wouldn't have answered who was she going out with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra scratched her nose. \"There's the Pink Dolphin, which is a nice pub if you're going out at late night, or just have a walk on the docks and you'll check by yourself. There's even a nice ice-cream shop, but I guess it doesn't suit your tastes, does it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" replied Margaret, who at that point was checking the clock every few seconds, until her turn was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, see ya tomorrow! Thanks Kyra\" said while hastily putting on the jacket, she needed to hide her uniform, and leave the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\" replied her colleague before the blonde closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before reaching her apartment's door, she could already hear the sound of the vacuum cleaner. She opened the door with caution and removed the shoes to wear a pair of frilly slippers. She hated these ugly slippers, but it was an ironclad rule set by Sakura Brown, her roomate and owner of the apartment, therefore neither she nor Lily could object to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was too busy removing the dust under the couch and the armchair to notice the blonde arriving and going into her room.<br>\r\nMargaret removed that hateful uniform as if it was constricting her, and put on some comfortable (and decent) clothes before laying on her bed to chat on the phone some friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an half hour, Sakura opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Margaret! You could've told me you've arrived\" said the half-Japanese woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde put the phone on the bedside table. \"How did you notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura pointed at the slippers next to the bed. \"I saw they were missing\" explained with a laugh. \"I'm going for the groceries. We're almost out of fruit, milk, bubble bath and most important, degreaser. You wanna come with me?\" asked with her eyes pointed to the ceiling and while twirling a lock of hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm tired at the moment. Why don't you ask Lily?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" said Sakura with disappointment as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret spent the rest of the evening while surfing on the net, until she decided to have a bath.<br>\r\nDuring the walk to the bathroom, she saw the other roomate, Lily, sneacking from the kitchen with a box of oreos under her arm. The tiny blonde asked the taller blonde to don't tell anyone putting her finger on the lips, and Margaret shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sakura was in her room, the door wide open, drawing with pastels, but Margaret could not see nor she was interested to know what it was, she just wanted to relax in the bathub. <br>\r\nHer body warmed by the water, soft bubbles around her and the feeble light of the lamp. That was one of the few moments when Margaret felt as if she had the same life of before her parents neglected her the money. Next to the bathub, the timer was set at one hour, an hour of pure bliss for the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Sakura knocked the bathroom door before that hour was over. She knocked a second time, louder, to have a reply from the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a minute\" said Margaret emerging from the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait, I don't have to use the bathroom\" explained quickly Sakura, unnerving the blonde. \"I just wanted to ask you if you have some suggestion for this dinner. If you want I can tell you what there's in the pantry and in the fridge\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret cocked an eyebrow. \"Tonight I eat out\" replied quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gulped. \"Really? And with whom, may I ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your business\" said bluntly the blonde before submerging herself again in the bathub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret had changed into her clothes for the night: a leather jacket, a long pair of jeans, high heels... And even put on some makeup. Sure, these clothes were rags compared to what she wore when she had money, but at least gave honor to her beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her roomates, which were having a dinner based on sausages and mashed potatoes (Margaret was thankful of not having dinner with them, she couldn't have standed such a fatty meal) and left the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called for a taxi, but then remembered she'd spend most of her money, and so went on foot toward Conrad Street, the street next to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, Margaret Mckenzie was meeting with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Margaret was in front of the bar, stepping impatiently her foot while checking the hour on her phone every minute. She checked the last message received from her friend: \"Almost here, just a minute\". Only for that minute to have already become ten. The blonde puffed and crossed her arms, Melanie was late as usual. Margaret cheked the passing people, just in case her friend walked over without recognizing the large bright signboard that said \"Shanenigans\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another couple of minutes of wait, her friend was there. Melanie was a short dark-skinned woman, around the same age of Margaret, with straight black hair and round eyes. Half of her hair was shaved, with the rest falling on the right side of her head. She was wearing a feather jacket above a blue top and a very short skirt. All expensive and latest fashion clothes, observed Margaret with a bit of envy.<br>\r\nAll of Margaret's anger for the lateness disappeared while Melanie ran toward her as fast as she could with her heels, seeing her old friend after so much time warmed her. The two exchanged a short hug and a kiss on each cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mellie! You look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all thanks to the new diet, Margie\" replied Melanie poking her exposed and flat belly. \"And you? Did you adapt to your new life?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret was ready to whine and vent all of her frustration to Melanie but her friend anticipated it would've been long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we discuss it at the table in front of our dinner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was bright, with multiple lights of different colors, giving the bar an eerie atmosphere. The two girls had a Caesar salad and a portion of fries to split, along with a Cuba Libre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret said all of her problems to Melanie, as if she had been keeping them inside for a long time and had to burst out like a volcanic eruption. How she couldn't buy any decente piece of clothing, how the apartment was so small it was more of a pantry, how cheap the food she ate was, which caused her to gain almost two pounds, and how she even had to tidy up her own room! Margaret listed all those \"problems\" like a whiny child, Melanie wasn't surprised Margaret's parents forced her out of home with no money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for you, but I'm sure your parents did it for a reason\" said Melanie trying to be comprehensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret crossed her arms. \"If their reason was ruining my life, well, congratulations! They did it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still have a good life without much money\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reply was a terribly wrong one. Margaret squeezed her eyes into two slits. \"It's easy to tell when you're still rich\" said in her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie could not read people's mind, but clearly understood what her friend was thinking. \"I saw a dance club out there, wanna bet who can dance the most before falling on the floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat idea brightened Margaret's face and in half an hour the two girls were going wild on the dance floor, a second round of drink helped letting loose of any possible awkwardness. They didn't care about the gazes of the people around them or when they've accidentally hit a chunky girl who fell on the floor. Margaret, with drunken stupor, even commented that the chunky gilr deserved it for wearing skimpy clothes that showed her fat rolls.<br>\r\nThey stopped around two o'clock and Melanie accompanied Margaret back home with her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at the pub, Margaret felt really happy, as if she still had her old life, but when she left the building it was like going back to reality, where she didn't have the money she used to, and didn't say a word during the ride back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is that your home?\" asked Melanie pointing at the building at the corner of the street. \"It looks... Nice. I'm sure the inside it's really cool\" said to make her friend feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret sniffed. \"No it isn't\" said. She was about to list again all of her problem but was too tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie pinched Margaret's cheek. \"Look, I don't know if it can make you feel better but...\" </span></div></div>",

When she found the money on the bedside table, she grinned excitely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe money didn't last long: the same morning, Margaret went shopping and spent all of them for some very expensive clothes. In the span of three hours, she came back without Melanie's money but with enough clothes to change half of her wardrobe. The blonde threw in the bin with a relief many of the cheap clothes she had bought in Valentine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of days, she almost regretted that choice. Sure, she needed these new clothes, but maybe could've bought less of them and spent part of the money in something else, like a dinner in a luxury restaurant, or a day in a Spa. One thing was sure for Margaret: she needed more money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe it? Two days ago I felt like going back to my old life and now I'm back here in this mess\" said Margaret while collapsing on a bench in the clothing shop where she worked. \"Now I understand those who say that life is expensive\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an experienced woman\" commented sarcastically Kyra. \"After all, everyone needs a leather jacket worth athousand bucks\" added with a sigh of frustration after hearing how Margaret busted what was the double of their monthly pay. Kyra came from a very poor family, so she found Margaret's whining very annoying and quickly left her colleague to help a newly arrived customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Kyra to vent her frustration, Margaret spent the rest of her shift in the storehouse, surrounded by shelves of old clothes. She just wasn't in the mood to work, especially when she had to endure the sight of other women buying clothes she couldn't afford. <br>\r\nThankfully for Margaret, Kyra was understanding enough to leave her alone and not tell the boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed an eternity, the shift was over and Margaret went back home on foot. The sky above her was gray, reflecting the blonde's mood. <br>\r\n\"If only I could get more money...\" thought Margaret, looking at her empty hands. \"With this job, I can barely get enough to pay food and rent...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Margaret was with the head in the cloud, she knocked against a pole, on which there was a depliant with the solution to her money problem</span></div></div>",

Once upon a time, anyway. Once its founders passed on and their acute business acumen was no longer available, its grasp slipped a bit. This is a good and bad thing depending on who you ask. Naturally, if you ask the new boss, Carol Polluck, it's a bad thing. They do a little bit of everything, sort of a jack of all trades company, and have a lot of staff to offer. However, they're starting to feel the squeeze when it comes to their newfound rival in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yeng Distribution</b>, which is a subsidiary of the Yeng Corporation. They mostly peddle product to the good people of Valentine, and what they're peddling is good old-fashioned mass-produced produce. They're working on supplying every major restaurant in the city, and offering jobs that come in either blue or white collar. There are rumors that everything isn't as peachy keen as Branch Manager Fukuda Hinamizawa claims, despite helping bring unemployment to an all-time low and feeding the hungry folks of Valentine. But what are rumors, anyway? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Little Bake Shop on Main</b>, however, has been struggling to find its foothold. Owner and founder, Ronnie Wilson, just doesn't have the head for business that co-founder Penny Simon does. And unfortunately, her insistence on \"good old-fashioned\" baked goods doesn't seem to have the niche that she would have hoped to have found in a town like Valentine. If things don't pick up for them soon, it'll have to close down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bean Machine</b>, though, has found lots of success! All this foot traffic\u2014lunch breaks and the like from those busy number crunchers\u2014has led to lots and lots of people wanting coffee. Mo and her baristas couldn't be happier with all the money that they're raking in. If anything, there's <i>too much</i> business! They're always looking for new hires!</div></span></div></div>",

She couldn't help it that she just so <i>happened</i> to get along better with people of a similar gender to her, could she? That wasn't favoritism, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the longer she worked at Gilbert &amp; Heil, the more some ladies in particular started to stand out to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Parker Black</b>, a begrudging secretary if there ever were one, looked placidly at her computer screen. Her brown eyes were dull and lifeless as she watched the minutes tick away on the simulated analog clock. Carol had been watching her for some time now, quietly \"re-evaluating\" Ms. Black's position as her personal assitant. Honestly, she had a pretty poor attitude. How she had gotten hired, with her nose held high and her seeming lack of work ethic, Carol could have never guessed... well, so long as she didn't want to assume that the previous employers weren't <i>so</i> open about being dirty old men. Parker was a beautiful woman, even Carol saw it. Her olive skin and her beautiful black hair could turn heads from across the street, and her tight body with a still-firm set of breasts made it impossible for almost any straight folks around her to get any work done. Carol watched as Parker looked around, seemingly unaware of her presence, and whipped out her phone to check her Facebook feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, something would have to be done about that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the left were Katie and Pam, two of Carol's \"less-than-dilligent\" workers. They were fine apart! Katie just handled a big contract, and Pam had impressed their last client so well that they were already joking about \"stealing\" her from Carol. They weren't <i>bad</i> workers, by far. It was just... well, it hadn't taken Carol long to find out that they were easily side-tracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pam Weiss</b> was a pudgy blonde woman in her mid thirties, standing by the copy machine. She had a very motherly figure\u2014full round breasts and wide hips, with a little tummy that rounded out her front beneath the blue blouse she'd squeezed into that morning. Carol had been sort've \"defaulting\" to asking Pam about questions regarding how things were done around the office. She had been there the longest out of all her employees, and was apparently well-versed in how Misters Gilbert &amp; Heil ran some parts of the budgeting that had thus far eluded Carol. She was a smart woman, but Carol knew the type. She was as chatty as they came, even with her! Carol hadn't been in the door five minutes before Pam had dropped the latest juicy gossip about just about everyone in the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, next to her was <b>Katie Kline</b>. She was a taller woman with brown hair, who even from Carol's totally non-judgemental and completely professional standpoint, looked sort of plain. She was a very slight woman, and dressed with all the fashion sense of a school marm. She had on a baggy purple sweater and khakis that were too big for her. Carol would have never guessed that she handled the clients like a cardshark, given how meek and mousy she assumed her to be. People assured her that she was just \"slow to warm up\". In time, Carol hoped to see what made this saleswoman tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about the third time this morning, Carol caught <b>Brooke Blake</b> staring at the clock on the wall, typing idly on her keyboard in an attempt to pass the time. Brooke was\u2014no disrespect meant, just Carol stating a simple fact\u2014a big girl. Probably one of her largest employees in the office. There were plenty of reports (and gossip from Pam) about the old bosses getting onto her about snacking at her desk. Keeping food in there, attracting ants. But she was <i>also</i> second to only Pam in how long she'd been working at the company. She knew a lot about its internal workings, and she had a good repertoire with her repeat clients. It wasn't like Carol had a problem with her size or anything\u2014weight <i>was</i> covered by anti-discrimination acts!\u2014she would just really like to see Brooke focus on something other than when her next break was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and poor whats-her-name... <b>Becky Berger</b>, the first intern since the changeover. These women could be absolutely awful to her. She was trying, and Carol really liked her! She had spirit, moxie, or... whatever you wanted to call it. She had been a former barista before applying at Gilbert &amp; Heil, but somehow Carol mused she spent more time at Bean Machine now than she did when she worked there! Everyone had her making coffee runs, handle difficult assignments for them, break bad news to Carol.. the poor thing just couldn't catch a break! Add into that how <i>awkward</i> her figure was, with a disproportionately wide set of hips and a bottom big enough to stop and stare at, and Carol could only imagine how rough of a time she was having fitting in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your coffee!\" chubby Becky said with a smile as she placed a Black and White on her boss' desk, \"Just like you ordered it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Becky.\" Carol said with a smile as she took a sip, \"Mm... good job, hun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby twenty-something bounced out of the room a bit happier, her big round ass bobbing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that, Carol was reminded of the caloric content of her new favorite drink. If she wasn't careful, she might have more trouble fitting into her new workspace much more literally than intended...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, Carol needed to go back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was plenty happening around the office...</span></div></div>",

The clattering of keyboards silenced for one oh-so-brief thirty minute period before lunchtime where the wheels of office chairs would turn, and socialization finally wasn't frowned upon. Pam and Katie <i>lived</i> for these little breaks. These little tidbits of time where they were allowed to talk amongst themselves.

True, Katie <i>had</i> noticed Parker's plumping up; it was hard not to. The resident sex symbol of a secretary had certainly let her bored, sedentary lifestyle get the better of her. When at the height of her boredom, Parker Black could snack like a champ and, to be fair, it's not like her eating habits particularly stood out in this particular work environment. Even Katie could be found more often than not with a donut or bag of pretzels in hand; she was just blessed with a high metabolism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is with Parker though... is that almost every calorie she consumed and ounce she gained seem to go straight to her already hefty boobs. No, scratch that, Katie thought to herself, it seemed like just as much if not more was finding its way to her round, jutting rear. Sure, Parker may have been thickening around the middle just a <i>little</i> bit, but nothing could compare to that girl's frankly ridiculous T and A. Given that the girl's recent weight gain had only put her in the category of \"somewhat chubby\", it was hard to really criticize when the curvy girl in the office just got curvier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam, on the other hand, couldn't exactly qualify as \"somewhat chubby\" anymore. No, it was easy to see that Pam was out and out fat. From her thick middle surged a soft, droopy belly that rested on her thickened thighs, thighs that led up to wide, round hips. Sure, Pam may have had a pretty large chest of her own, but the double chin that rested just above her cleavage could draw just as much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was more than aware that Pam was being a <i>bit</i> hypocritical in her critique, Hell, Pam likely even was in some subconscious capacity, but both girls knew that Pam's gradually-but-always increasing weight was one of the very, very few things that was strictly beyond the range of discussion. Poor Pam needed her outlet for her weight frustrations, and what better outlet than her fellow fattening employees? Katie often wondered how quickly Pam would turn on <i>her</i> if she ever managed to gain a pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't matter. Katie knew the routine. She was obligated to do anything to sustain her cohort's self-esteem, and that occasionally included tearing down her other colleagues. It was all good fun, she figured, as long as they never actually overheard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can practically hear the floor shaking when she walks to the break room,\" she snorted, clearly fibbing but still earning a deprecating laugh from Pam. \"Still though,\" she added, eager to continue now that they had gotten into their flow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, the girls continued to snicker as Becky's booty ballooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like they were the only ones. Becky was new meat around the office, so that meant she was ripe for various forms of torment from her coworkers. Nothing too extreme, of course\u2014most everyone liked Becky, and at least she did her work at least\u2014but this fact alone made it substantially easy for Pam and Katie to whisper about and behind her increasingly voluminous backside. And it wasn't like anyone <i>didn't</i> notice that Becky's butt was as big as the broad side of a barn. Parker made the occasional derogatory commentary, and even big-bellied Brooke wasn't above an off-handed remark here or there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps it wouldn't have been quite <i>so</i> easy if Becky's butt would have stopped inflating there. But as it was, surrounded by tempting office goodies and trapped in a mostly sedentary position, it was hard for just about anyone to keep a trim waistline. Certainly not for Becky Berger, stress-snacker extraordinaire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day new calories would pass through Becky's soft lips; donuts, krullers, big lunches and snacks from the vending machines. And every day they would inch further south before settling on her hips, legs, and ass. From there they worked outwards, inching her butt bigger and bigger by way of a naturally slow metabolism and a genetic disposition towards obesity. Slacks and skirts grew tight, some of them even ripped, before disappearing forever, but never forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially not by those who were watching Becky balloon with great intention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I know I'm starting to sound like a bitch\u2014\" Pam managed through a mouthful of muffin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Never</i>.\" Katie half-sarcastically interjected, taking a slurp from her coffee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014but have you <i>seen</i> Becky's butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Katie had. Everyone had. It was rather hard <i>not</i> to notice it as it. The tubby twenty-something was so big below the belt that she'd popped out of a skirt just yesterday! Everyone eyed their dangerously curvy intern with suspicion as she wiggle-waddled her way through doorways, for fear of her bodaciously big buns getting wedged in the opening. It took two steps for her to get into a room, with her pudgy pile of a tummy bobbing in front of her, but it took three steps to get her all the way out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have to be blind not to, right?\" Katie smirked, stirring her coffee, \"But then again, the dimples on her butt probably spell out 'WIDE LOAD' in braille, sooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that's cold!\" Pam snickered, her chubby cheeks rippling, \"But it's so <i>true</i> though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully unwrapping her second muffin of the day, Pam picked up her sweet breakfast treat and took a hearty bite. Little blue-tinted flakes fell from her face and onto the napkin she'd spread onto her desk. Ever since they'd started discussing the expanding waistlines of some select coworkers\u2014but especially Becky and her ballooning butt\u2014with more regularity, Katie had noticed that her friend had been in much better spirits. She had also noticed, perhaps coincidentally, that Pam had been indulging herself rather liberally lately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" Pam cooed as she savored her sizable swallow, \"I mean, can you imagine? When <i>I</i> was Becky's age, I would have just <i>died</i> at her size. The poor thing must be so self-conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, Katie mused, but no more than usual. But then, she'd never tell Pam that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone should have been self-conscious of a growing waistline, if was Pam. The growing regularity of their weight-related gossip seemed to have made it easier for Pam to forget that the growing regularity of her snacking was resulting in a regularly growing waistline. Pam had been regaling her about some new clothes she'd picked up, no doubt to hide her widening stomach or address her  bigger breasts, before Becky came into conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind've feel bad for her, you know?\" Pam crumbled up her muffin wrapper and dusted off her desk, \"It's like she doesn't even <i>realize</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, <i>yeah</i>...\" Katie looked to the side nervously...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the correct code of conduct here? Like, gossip-hound aside, Pam was still Katie's best friend. They'd been working together for years now, and she knew all about Pam's glass cannon of an ego. But she'd been eating a lot lately, and had put on more than a little weight... But then again, they were friends. The last thing Katie wanted to hear from Pam (or hear that Pam had gossiped about) was that she had put on a little weight. It wasn't <i>too</i> noticeable, at least not yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a poor girl to do?</span></div></div>",

Pam was a grown (and growing) woman who had helped Katie feel good about herself more times than she could count. She was just going through a hard time lately, Katie figured, and things would go back to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice it to say, of course, they didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever switch had been flipped inside Pam lately, it didn't look like it was going to un-flip any time soon. Somehow displacing her weight woes into a fixation on the waistlines of everyone around her\u2014Brooke, yes. Parker, double yes. But <i>especially</i> Becky and her mile-wide behind\u2014helped her turn a blind eye to an extra trip to the vending machine, or an appetizer before lunch. Or a <i>couple</i> of extra trips to the vending machine, and <i>two</i> appetizers before lunch. Every Friday night, Katie and Pam would go out to the bar after work and just talk and talk and talk while Pam slurped down a beer and gorged herself on bar food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it went on like that. Eventually, this just sort've became the new norm. It was such a slow, steady transition that Katie couldn't remember a time when Pam didn't have to bring her breakfast to work, or make regular trips to the snack machine. It felt like they'd always ordered two appetizers \"to share\", and somehow it was like their tabs were always that high on Friday nights. Katie and Pam were still friends, as close as ever, it was just... well, they were <i>literally</i> closer than ever, as Pam seemed to take up more and more space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a normal day in the offices of Gilbert &amp; Heil. A day like any other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie Kline was making a trip to Ms. Polluck's office, delivering the Fernando account. They were tough clients, but she had managed to win them over. No doubt it was effort like <i>that</i> that had won her the coveted employee of the month parking space! If this kept up, that corner office would be hers in no time, and Katie could finally start to really make some bank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in order to get to Carol, you had to pass the vending machine. And around the offices of Gilbert &amp; Heil, the vending machine could be a difficult thing to pass sometimes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake, for instance, the pair of thunder thighs and double-wide derriere crammed into a pair of painted-on khakis, bent over for all of the office to see. It was just the fattest ass that Katie had ever seen! There was no way those two wrecking balls would be <i>nearly</i> as big if there weren't like, a vending machine around every corner here. Seriously, that thing was <i>huge</i>. Katie could practically see the cheek dimples beneath the fabric as he poor heifer attached struggled to fish her snack out from the trap jaw of the delivery bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way that ass could have belonged to anyone other than their resident blimp-tern, Becky \"the Booty\" Berger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Becky.\" Katie offered with an awkward smile, \"Need a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stood up slowly and turned around...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh! Umm hi...\" Becky whimpered, clearly just the slightest bit startled. She slowly turned around, an awkward hip-shuffling struggle that gave Katie a full 360-degree view of her corpulent colleague's physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, she had been getting big.  All gossip aside, Becky had been getting <i>really</i> wide as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's hips spread out farther than any doorway was built for, and with the way her epic booty stuck out behind her, turning sideways only exacerbated the problem. Her monstrous derri\u00e8re had been needing <i>quite</i> the amount of extra room as of late. Becky often found herself apologizing for one mishap or another as her titanic hips and monumental booty bumped and brushed appliances and employees alike. Those constantly swaying cheeks were veritable wrecking balls in the office environment and heavy but humble Becky was more than sorry for the ungainly burden of her ungainly butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie actually felt bad for the poor girl. See, the thing is, Becky actually <i>liked</i> Katie. And Katie knew she liked her. It made Katie just the slightest bit guilty about making Becky the main focus of their weight gossip. The cubicles of Gilbert and Heil had thin walls, both literally and figuratively, so snippets were easy to overhear, especially if part of one's job involved constantly shuffling her hips in between aisles and offices. With how <i>often</i> Pam seemed to want to make Becky's impressive weight gain the subject of snarky conversation, it was only a matter of time before either Becky overheard one of Pam or Katie's sardonic \"critiques\" or somebody else overheard and reported back to the expanding intern. Becky and Katie had this mutual awkward awareness of the former being fully knowledgable of the gossip going on behind her expansive back and the latter being cognizant to the fact that the former had this knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet Becky still liked Katie <i>anyway</i>. And that's what killed Katie on the inside. Sure, it was no secret to either of the girls that one was talking shit about the other, but Becky had too much of an odd sort of respect and understanding for her senior colleague to hold it against her. It was almost as if Becky silently understood that her bountiful butt being the subject of scrutiny was just a consequence of inter-colleague gossip, a natural occurrence in office politics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr even worse, Katie thought, that Becky's naturally deferent disposition meant that she actually took Katie's constant barbs to heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, \"Oh, umm hi...\" was certainly more politeness than Katie deserved. The poor girl was blushing furiously, an assortment of chips and snack cakes in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the Goodman account?\" Becky smiled, doing her best at making office small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, Fernando,\" Katie answered and didn't continue, less as an attempt to be rude and more out of a lack of things to say. Well, this could hardly get any more awkward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was Becky's only reply. The girl was shifting anxiously from one foot to another, out of nervousness or the fatigue just from holding up her own great weight, Katie could hardly say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, Goodman's on its way,\" Katie fibbed. It's not like Becky needed to know the Goodman Group was considering dropping Gilbert and Heil as clients. \"Ive had my hands full enough with this baby right here,\" she proudly gestured to the manila envelope tucked under her arm. \"Speaking of which,\" Katie made to move past Becky and continue to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Of course, sorry,\" Becky stammered. She awkwardly scooted over to the farther side of the hallway so that Katie could squeeze on by. The rapidly growing young intern was lucky that it hadn't been anyone but Katie. With the ever-increasing amount of space Becky was prone to take up, Katie was about the only person left still skinny enough to maneuver around Becky without either of them having to turn sideways to let the other past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good one, Hon!\" Katie beamed genuinely as she sauntered past. 'God, what am I doing to this poor girl?' she thought to herself guiltily. Becky was such. A. Sweetheart. It was killing Katie on the inside that she had so nonchalantly directed so much sass and vitriol toward this girl behind her back. But <i>Pam</i> was the one spearheading these conversations nowadays, and Katie couldnt help but go through all of the typical motions. Insults like \"fatty\" and \"wideass\" were thrown around as often as ever-increasingly creative nicknames like \"Barge Booty\" and \"Double-Chair Derri\u00e8re\", two nicknames that Pam had delightedly come up with herself. It seemed as though as Becky's ass got fatter, Pam's criticisms got harsher. And there didn't seem to be an end to how fat Becky's ass was getting as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie could only whistle in admiration as she watched her colleague's behemoth butt bounce away furiously in those ridiculously tight khakis. Sure, Becky was more than a little top-heavy, especially now, with her fledgling second chin finally fully formed and a healthy set of love handles spilling out over her work pants, but nothing, <i>nothing</i> compared to the size of that breathtaking booty. Becky's surging saddlebag hips laid a wide foundation for the roundest of rumps, a wobbly, wiggly rear that jutted so obscenely far behind the poor girl Katie swore she could have balanced Pam's entire coffee order on it. 'All of that extra weight must be so hard to walk around with,' Katie's inner narrative continued, being sympathetic rather than spiteful for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky certainly didn't look like she was having the easiest time waddling down the hall. It wasn't just the burden of the sheer amount of mass she had to carry on her lower frame, it was the thickness of her thighs that prevented her from easily moving one leg past another without swinging them in wide, slow arcs. This left poor Becky with a comically slow, wiggling waddle that only made her coffee runs twice as time-consuming and three times as arduous. The poor plus-sized personnel would be positively exhausted, leaning heavily on the closest wall or desk and panting for air after a brief run to the local bakery for a few extra baker's dozens for the break room or a tiring trek up and then back down the stairs to run a document to another department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's self-loathing was beginning to reach an all-time high. She couldn't keep making fun of this girl... There had to be a way to redirect Pam's focus. Parker certainly hadn't been slimming down at all and even Carol was starting to look a little chunky. It was about time somebody took Becky and her epic booty off of the chopping block, and Pam certainly didn't look to be the one to take the initiative anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with Becky's rapid weight gain showing no signs of slowing down, if the miniature mountain of snacks cradled in her arms was any form of indication, it looked like Pam wasn't going to run out of fodder any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe,' Katie sighed to herself as she reached Carol's office, 'I ought to just tell Pam to take it easy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would she be able to turn down her gossip buddy like that? Pam might think Katie was taking sides against her... Pam could be so <i>touchy</i> at times. Katie knew it was something she couldn't dodge much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd \"much longer\" actually ended up being later that very week when, right in front of both Katie and an absolutely gleeful Pam, </span></div></div>",

With the clock ticking away towards the weekend, and a heavy Mexican meal on everyone's stomach, it wouldn't have been a stretch to say that almost no one had their mind on business. Not Parker, as she tapped away on her phone <i>just</i> out of her boss' line of sight. Not Carol as she cradled her overstuffed stomach behind the safety of closed office doors. Not Brooke as she pondered whether or not she should order out for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd certainly not Katie and Pam, as they cobbled together a fragile excuse to walk down the main hallway together. In their years of office dronery, they had learned that as long as they were carrying something\u2014a file, a manila envelope, sometimes even just a stapler\u2014and kept this sort of professional expression that had come with practice, they were roughly twice as successful at passing off the idea that they were actually doing work, rather than just walking towards the same destination together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that, lately, had become more cumbersome than Katie remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery couple of steps, Katie swung her arms. And every couple of steps, they would bounce against Pam's pudgy thigh. Her friend forced one chunky leg in front of the other with such a speed that it left the underwalked desk jockey winded. The skinnier of the two had actually started keeping pace one step behind her friend, so as to better allow her breadth of the walkway. With her wide hips, spreading lovehandles, and the overall depth that Pam's prodigiousness posed, it had simply become easier to allow her to lead the way, rather than attempt to stay at her hips. Pam's soft, dimpled belly headed the expedition towards the break room, slyly peeking out from underneath her sweater as if to better see its goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam was always a bit bigger than Katie, owed to a slower metabolism and being just a bit older than her. But had she always been <i>this</i> much bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been talking about something or other. Either it was a client or a celebrity... maybe a mutual friend? Honestly, it was hard to keep up sometimes. And Pam loaded up from the pink box of donuts left for all but often eaten only by some, got another cup of coffee from the espresso machine. She'd started topping herself off in the middle of the day for some time now and, honestly, Katie didn't really think anything of it. It was Friday and even Carol didn't seem to mind too much so long as it didn't interfere with work. The breadth of blonde bobbed diligently out of the break room, Katie one step behind her, and was already munching on a donut when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Pam stopped right there in the doorway, causing Katie to impact with her well-padded posterior, \"I think it's finally going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that could have meant a multitude of things. Especially with Pam. A promotion, a fight, or a high-profile celebrity breakup. Pam probably said that about once a week. So how, in a week where Carol had emptied out two offices, Parker and the Copy Girl had been exchanging nasty glances, and Taylor Swift talking about releasing a new album, did Katie know that Pam was talking about Becky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she was totally talking about Becky. Of course she was. Every other word at work seemed to be concerned with Becky. How fat she was. How big her butt was. How \"any day\" she was going to pop right out of those khakis, and everyone would laugh and Pam would take a big celebratory bite of her muffin or her donut or whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time, Katie knew that she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, uh...\" Katie suggested awkwardly, \"What do you mean, Pam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky!\" the plump keyboard cruncher said in a hushed tone, \"I think she's finally going to... <i>you know</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blimp-bootied intern had joined them for lunch earlier at La Casa del Gordita, and Katie had visibly winced at how much she had ordered. Two lunch specials. <i>Two</i>. A number 10 and a number 5. Even Brooke thought that was a little much, as she stuffed down three quesadillas and a whole basket of chips. How that girl had managed it, Katie would never know. But her gut was turgid and pregnant with enough tortilla, meat, cheese, and rice to make her blouse tight enough to see the creases of her belly rolls, and her khakis were stretched so taught that Katie could see her naval beneath the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor thing was staring down at a file she'd dropped, looking helplessly from above her fat belly. She looked from side to side, seemingly not seeing either of the two gossip hounds, and chewed her bottom lip in trepidation. Bending over at her size wasn't easy, Katie could guess. Those pants looked like they were ready to go <i>before</i> lunch and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think those things are finally gonna blow!\" Pam said with a whispered elation, \"I knew it! I just knew that today would be the day when I saw her pig out on all that Mexican food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but...\" Katie laughed, \"We all kinda did, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like Becky \"Broad Side of the Barn\" over there!\" Pam bit into her donut excitedly, \"Just you watch, that heifer's gonna bend over and grab that file! And when she does...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie could practically see it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gonna pop out of those khakis like biscuit dough!\" Pam giggled evily, clapping her sugar-coated hands quietly, \"Oh my <i>gawd</i> Katie, I told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did...\" Katie gulped, \"You really did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't right. Becky was a nice girl, and Pam was being a total bitch about this, right? It wasn't Becky's fault that she had such a big butt. It was probably... genetics or something, Katie didn't know. More importantly, this didn't feel right. Picking on poor defenseless, bubble-butted Becky while her back was turned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pam was her friend. And had been for years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a girl to do?</span></div></div>",

The old fridge that leaked when it got too hot and tended to leave even the freshest foods with a slight smell had been replaced with a new state of the art, stainless steel goliath that was capable of taking almost all contenders.

This change went over so well, in fact, that an entire cabinet had been designated as the Coffee Supply cabinet. It was filled with cremes, sugars, different roasts, coffee filters, and some special flavor syrups that had come with the maker itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an office of girls hesitant to accept their new employers, the break room made for a small consolation and a show of good faith that these new bosses weren't all bad. To a woman like Brooke, who lived for office frills and spoils of proper budgeting, the breakroom might as well have been heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had snuck into the breakroom a couple minutes before her first thirty minute break, tiptoeing as gingerly as a woman of her substantial size could manage. On the counter was a still-untouched box of donuts that Becky had brought them all during her morning run. They had managed to pick the first box clean, but this one was just sitting there, waiting for someone like Becky to break the ice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled into the room, lit by the soft glow of the new vending machine. Turning her head from side to side, Brooke made sure the coast was clear before she resumed her trek towards the unguarded countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping the top open with one expert motion, Brooke was left to salivate at the sight of all thirteen of those sweet, delectable donuts; they were just begging her to take a bite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big belly grumbled expectantly, even as she leaned onto the counter. Her chubby finger wriggling with excitement, Brooke eased in and started taking her spoils...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She nearly dropped her sugary sweets right then and there as her heart skipped a beat. She fought the urge to whip around in surprise, managing only to look behind her abashedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker Black was standing right there in the doorway, her hand on her hips and this most curious bitchy look on her face. Her black eyebrows were piqued, her lids lowered as she took a wild guess to what exactly Brooke had been doing before she walked in. Her free hand sunk from the light switch as she sauntered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... nothing?\" Brooke offered sheepishly, her chubby cheeks bunching as she smiled, \"I was just gonna... you know... grab a donut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like grab <i>all</i> the donuts.\" Parker scoffed, \"Like, for real? You really think you need all those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke felt the embarassment in her chest turn to an impotent rage. Parker wasn't exactly the most sociable person, and already had a tendency to put her foot in her mouth. That, though, wasn't just her being aloof. That was her being a bitch. Parker had made it very clear how she felt about Brooke's weight during her internship, with aside jokes that grew less and less good natured until she was eventually hired on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, Brooke had to admit, she was being kind of a pig...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" she agreed begrudgingly as she took one (just one!) from the box on the counter, \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brooke shuffled away from the counter and took a seat at one of the tables, she heard Parker mutter something under her breath. God, she hated her. Everyone did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had been one of the last employees hired on full time by their old bosses, but nobody knew exactly what she brought to the table other than a big chest and a pretty face. She didn't do well with clients, she wasn't particularly sociable around the office, and when she was it was usually through snide, snobbish behavior better suited to Mean Girls than it was to an adult environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven Parker's predisposition towards pointing out peoples' weight, Brooke was given an entirely different reason to dislike her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad she had made her time as an intern so difficult!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke squashed one of the bench seats beneath her, she mostly kept her comments to herself. She whipped out her phone, and tried to forget about it with a little mindless scrolling down her Facebook feed. That is, until she looked back up, and saw that Parker hadn't even gotten a donut! She had made Brooke move and feel bad for no reason, when she still had plenty of room to use the coffee maker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna get one?\" Brooke asked flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd no, I wouldn't be caught <i>dead</i> eating those things.\" Parker scoffed, \"Do you know how many empty calories are in just like, one of those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some silence as Parker actually looked Brooke up and down before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you don't.\" she said, \"But they're gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence between them grew stronger as they slowly went back to doing their own thing. Parker making her cup of coffee, Brooke trying to tolerate Parker's existence. There had always been some animosity between the two of them, but lately things had gotten to the point where Brooke just couldn't stand her coworker. </span></div></div>",

Clients would call and ask to speak with Carol. Clients would call and ask to set up appointments. Clients would call wanting to know what their rates are--it was all just so... so stupid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had been reluctant from the get go to even start working. Not living with her Mom was great, but at about halfway though her internship at Gilbert &amp; Heil, she had to start reminding herself just why she needed this job. Every morning she would wake up, roll her eyes, and give a great big millennial sigh as she groaned her way out of bed. She'd get dressed, put her big girl pants on (rather, her big girl skirt) and drag herself to the office building kicking and screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that the work was hard it was just so boring! Parker had gone from (almost literally) going out every night in Daven's Port and partying with her friends and going to clubs and blowing all her money to this stupid new city with stupid new people that she didn't even know. Home was like two hours away so even if she wanted to go back and hang out with her friends, she'd have to turn right back around after like, three hours, if she wanted to get home at a decent time so she could get some sleep before her commute to work and still do all the morning routine shit she did before she caught the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUGH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdulting was hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully she didn't have to do too terribly much of it. The secretary position at Gilbert &amp; Heil was a mostly sedentary one. She wasn't constantly dealing with people or customers like the rest of those poor schmucks out on the floor or in their offices. No, Parker got the glorious job of sitting around at a desk all day, taking the occasional phone call and otherwise appearing to be busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it had been enough that she actually showed up to work--back when Misters Gilbert &amp; Heil were the ones calling the shots. With her long black hair and her killer figure, a little contouring and an especially short skirt, they had been putty in her hands. She couldn't tell you how many files had fallen from their desks, and she had so graciously offered to pick them up. After more than a couple of shows, Parker could have literally slept at her desk (she had, once or twice) and neither of her old bosses would have cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this new one though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she was a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Get those to me by noon, Miss Black.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get any messages, did I Miss Black?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do everything in the world for me, Miss Black\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlah blah blah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Parker, Ms. Polluck couldn't control her life literally all the time. Even if she expected her to pull her weight a little more than her old bosses had, Parker was still a free woman during certain times of the day. On breaks, lunch, or after work, Parker was a free woman. She made enough money to afford her modest apartment (if she budgeted properly. Ugh.) and she'd carved out a decent little existence for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot in her office building. She hated most of those twats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now was not the time to mourn over being a kept woman. It was the end of the day, and she shouldn't let work bog her down. That's how you wind up like Pam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Parker had quite the exciting evening planned...</span></div></div>",

Tight waist, big tits, and a big ass that came naturally with her Armenian heritage. Her black hair and pretty face made her the perfect piece of eye candy for most guys, and she'd never had to do really anything to keep her figure going strong. It wasn't like she got her curves from dieting. Parker had spent her high school years into (what should have been) her college years just laying around and burning off all her excess calories at clubs or between the sheets. She'd never needed exercise before, and honestly, she really didn't think she needed any now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was just an... insurance. A little something to keep her on the straight and narrow (and to help keep her waist straight and narrow!) Parker had seen some of the other girls around the office and they were prime examples of what a couple years of sitting around on her butt all day could look like. That Brooke girl alone was enough to give her nightmares--she couldn't imagine letting herself get that fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she was so happy to learn that, out of the many horrible things that had come out of her moving and being forced to be a grown-up, Parker had actually found herself in the neighborhood of a relatively low-cost gym that fit within her budget. It seemed like the perfect place to not only keep her buns firm and tight, but maybe a great place to go when she wasn't on the clock. Maybe meet a guy--the novelty of being dateless had well worn off after a few weeks in her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had click-clacked her way out of that office building as quickly as her heels would allow, and walked straight onto the bus that took her across town. She stood for about fifteen minutes, grabbing the handrail, before she arrived at her stop. Jim's Gym was just a block away from there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the locker room, Parker prepared herself for her first day of working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd traded her blouse and pencil skirt for a pair of leggings and a tight tank top. Her full round ass pressed tightly against the stretchy material, and her bust was big enough to strain the straps of her top. She looked over the damage in the full-body mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, maybe it's good I started coming.\" Parker sucked in her mostly flat stomach, \"I can't believe how fat I've gotten...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few months of working in a new place, without much of a social life due to a somewhat anti-social (read: bitchy) approach to adult life, Parker Black had developed a sort of thickness that hadn't been there when her Mom had kicked her out. One would have thought that scraping by as she had for the past few months before her pay raise would have leant to a much leaner figure but, unfortunately for Parker, they'd be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't look bad, per se. Parker's assets had only grown slightly, and whatever growth that she had accrued definitely didn't make her any less attractive. If anything, it just gave her hourglass figure a bit more sand to play with. And Parker saw this, after a good long look at herself, and eventually her posing became flirtatious and playful. Even still, it was good that she had seen this coming. The fifteen pounds or so that she had picked up (while more welcome now than they had been just a few seconds ago) didn't need any new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith any luck, Parker could drop this weight and catch her a man to bide her time with before office life drove her crazy...</span></div></div>",

That time she and that Persian guy came back from the club and they were both super wasted but he was still ridiculously good in bed? Piece. Of. Cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was a dripping, damp mess; and it had only been an hour! Her entire life had been devoid of hard labor. She'd never had to work for her body--she'd just been blessed with it since puberty. She could always eat what she wanted, and she never really had to exercise much. Of course, now she was wishing that she had. Parker had absolutely no stamina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd flitted from machine to machine without any rhyme or reason. She had a very vague idea of how some of them worked and, what she recognized, she tried to replicate. The treadmill, the elliptical, the weight bench, even the medicine balls! But Parker couldn't last more than a few minutes at any of them. And it took her far longer than it should have to get her wind back, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did anyone else even <i>do</i> this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the tight, sexy bodies around her were a testament to the impossible. That chick with the tight ass and round buns? Going, like, sixty times faster than Parker had gotten on the treadmill. That guy with the muscles the size of a Thanksgiving turkey? Intimidatingly handsome and infinitely better than she had been at the weight bench? Even that girl with the scary six pack was dominating the elliptical! Parker had never felt so... so unfit before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for the peons in this gym, Parker did not deal well with feeling inferior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she pushed herself harder (huff!) and harder (huff huff!) until she felt like she was literally going to rip a muscle. If she did one more rep, just one more round, or even a step on the treadmill, Parker felt like she would fall apart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for Parker, that had only lasted about fifteen minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn accumulative fifteen minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody seemed to notice the crazed Armenian bombshell going from machine to machine (another reason Parker may have been so on edge!) sweating buckets and audibly struggling to make her body go. After another three minutes of heavy panting, and a minute straight of sucking on her S'well bottle, Parker had finally had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck this.\" she loudly announced, much to the confusion of those who had only just realized her presence, \"I need a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker leaned over the sink, stewing in wild and scalding emotions. She had washed the sweat off of her face with cold water, and had just now regained her breath. Her lungs still ached and her legs were already sore. And so were her arms. And her back. Shoulders...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, <i>everything</i> hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did those jerks do it? Those ones out there just... flaunting how much better they were at fitness than she was? Newsflash, gym rats, Parker was a newbie! They didn't have to whip out their fitness and spray it all over the place. Like, geez, she got it, they work out. They could put it back in their gym shorts already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker sighed heavily onto the mirror, fogging up her reflection with ennui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she had burned a lot of calories, she told herself. That was something, right? How many did she burn off? A thousand? Two thousand? Three--dare she think three thousand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...how many calories were in a pound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, she didn't want to think about this right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Parker had wanted to do was come burn off some extra pounds. And now all she felt was bad about herself. She hadn't realized that she'd put on about fifteen pounds since she started her job, and she'd been gymtimidated by all those...those jerks out there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker grumbled and turned off the sink...</span></div></div>",

Too tired to shower, she was content to veg in front of the TV with her food and drink for the entire night - something that seemed to be becoming more and more common these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">(PS: this chapter was originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'gingerdude', '', '', '', '2', '', 'ON', '100928329'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'gingerdude', '', '', '', '2', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: gingerdude\r\nMember Since: December 1st, 2011\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">thatdude</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View gingerdude's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/gingerdude',%20'CommunityR_100928329',%20'400',%20'650')\">40</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/gingerdude','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/gingerdude\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'gingerdude', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  6/2/20', '6/2/20', 'December 1, 2011', '', '', '2', 'Registered User');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-2.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100928329',   'mess100928329_1591461148', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100928329/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: gingerdude [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffgingerdude\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffgingerdude', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=100928329&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffgingerdude');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add gingerdude to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffgingerdude\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span>\u2014 you should check out some of the other stuff they've written <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/view_item/action/show_chapters/user_id/gingerdude\">here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/view_item/action/show_chapters/user_id/gingerdude\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>)</font></div></span></div></div>",

The stiffness of last night had matured into a deep stabbing ache and the beer cans into a lingering headache. Parker eased herself up and out of bed slowly, breath hissing between her teeth as her feet hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker winced with each tottering step as she made her way to the bathroom. Back when her bosses were pervy old men, Parker would have had the day off already. But no, <i>someone</i> had decided that women were worth more than their looks. Stupid feminist bitches. She'd been much happier when she was eye candy, thank-you-very-fucking-much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' work,\" she muttered into the mirror. She looked like death. Smelled like it, too. She put on a hot shower and peeled out of her sticky workout clothes before carefully stepping in. The hot water felt good and her hands rubbing gentle soapy circles over her sore muscles was painfully satisfying. Her hands lingered for a moment over her middle, feeling a thick layer of flab that slid independently over her abs. The aching made it clear where muscle ended and belly began. Parker couldn't help but prod and pinch. Had it gotten smaller? It must have. Her herculean efforts had to be good for a pound or two, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing was another challenge entirely. Parker ooh'd and ahh'd and cursed as she stiffly struggled to yank skin-tight khakis over her sensitive thighs. Then there was the issue of a bra. It took her nearly five minutes of hissing and wincing to coax her aching arms around her back to do the clasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was somewhat presentable, Parker was late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Parky-Park,\" Pam said as the elevator doors opened. The chubby administrator was leaning against Katie's desk, smiling. As usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker walked to her desk normally she could. \"Wow. Is that an original?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly,\" Pam said. She turned and began muttering something to Katie. That suited Parker just fine. Let the bitch talk. It's not like <i>she </i>went to the gym yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, here she was. And would remain, for the next eight hours. The red message signal was blinking and Parker was just about to check it when a shadow fell over her desk. It was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was your typical late night pitch, a toned and tanned model slowly walking down a beach as unbearably cheerful music played in the background. After the day she had, the last thing Parker wanted to see was a supermodel reminding her of her own inadequacies. \"Fuck where did I put the remote?\" Parker groaned, clumsily searching for the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare touch that dial.\" The model ordered, her voice soothing but firm. \"Not until you hear what I have to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker continued to search for the remote, but quickly losing the energy to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, would you like abs like mine? Legs like mine? Arms like mine?\" The model asked, gesturing to her honed physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than anything.\" Parker sighed, as she flopped back onto the couch. Poking and pinching her newfound flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do. But traditional models of losing weight are slow, painful, and expensive.\" The model replied in a reassuring tone. \"No wonder so many people are over weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aint that the damn truth!\" Parker nodded along, cracking open her second beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Y System solves all of these problems. By using the latest innovations in technology and health, we are disrupting the weight-loss industry. No more expensive gym memberships and no more bland diets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Parker was all in. She gathered all the energy her battered body had and focused it on the model, hanging on her every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, the Y System isn't a diet. It's a lifestyle.\" Said the model. \"Are you ready to ditch the diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tv flipped back to whatever drivel she was watching before but Parker didn't care. The Y System sounded like the answer to all her problems. She knew what she needed to do.</span></div></div>",

Now she only saw her imperfections; the hips that were getting a little too wide and pinching her skirt, the fluffy tummy that was not as washboard as it had once been and the slow muffining of her breasts over her top. If she wasn't careful, she might wind up like that fatass intern. Or worse, <i>Brooke</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf those gym regulars out there could do it, so could she! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to start somewhere too, now it was Parker\u2019s turn. Imagining herself with a set of barely visible girl-abs, a trim behind and sleek powerful legs, Parker marched herself right back out to confront the machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring daggers at the Adonis-like figures still going at it like they had been doing this forever, Parker looked for an unoccupied target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the Armenian bombshell hopped back on one of the treadmills. At least this way she could take out some aggression! Turning it up way higher than she should have, Parker began a quick jog. Unimpressed with the machines speed, she cranked it up further. Now she was really running!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it came back to her, the pain, and the aches. Wincing her teeth in agony, Parker tried to fight through it; big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Parker thought the slightly blurred vision was due to sweat getting in her eyes; so she tried to shake it off. Then her chest felt like it had gone up in flames, but still she tried to power through. Then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*crack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thud thud*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one bleary-eyed moment, Parker had misplaced her right foot and put all her weight on it. From there it seemed like forever to her, but to the startled onlookers it was merely two seconds. Parker\u2019s body went careening straight down to the cycling rubber, her chin hitting it with a dull *crack*. From there her body, no longer running to keep up with the treadmill, was flung backwards across the room; her body hitting the back wall with considerable force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker\u2019s world was spinning; she could barely see the figures rushing over to see what had happened. She could just barely make out what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh my god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sure those melons broke her fall\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren!

She slid back down, looking up at her limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was covered in red markings and carpet burns, but her ankle looked twisted completely out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone call 911!\u201d one of the onlookers stated as another person arrived with an ice pack, placing it gingerly on the damaged leg. Some of the gym staff had arrived on the scene too, one starting to apply basic first aid while the other barked instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, everyone back up!\u201d he called out, \u201cCho keep her awake, do NOT let her fall asleep!\u201d he added, looking over his shoulder at the medic taking care of Parker, trying to ask her details to make sure she remained conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, couldn\u2019t she go away? It was hard enough to think straight without her asking all these silly questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she has concussion\u201d the Chinese \u2013American woman noted, seeing how Parker\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t focus on her own, \u201cCall an ambulance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker barely noticed more people arrive, a stretcher coming out. Or hell, even being placed on it; as she slowly slipped out of consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly opening her eyes, Parker still saw only blurry objects whirling in front of her. But as the shapes finally came into focus one thought permeated her mind, were was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was most certainly NOT her apartment, the room was a pleasing teal color, and there was a large window sending fresh rays of morning sunlight over her. And then there was the curtain-rail, and no not on the window, that would have made sense. Instead there was a curtain, draped across half of her field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Parker tried to process this sudden change of scenery a hand whipped the curtain away revealing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">(PS: this chapter was originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'tyrann0', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101190116'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'tyrann0', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: tyrann0\r\nMember Since: November 23rd, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">Trampltrum</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View tyrann0's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/tyrann0',%20'CommunityR_101190116',%20'400',%20'650')\">23</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/tyrann0','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/tyrann0\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'tyrann0', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Today', 'Today', 'November 23, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101190116',   'mess101190116_1591461151', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101190116/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: tyrann0 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_fftyrann0\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('fftyrann0', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101190116&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_fftyrann0');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add tyrann0 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"fftyrann0\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span>\u2014 you should check out some of the other stuff they've written <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/view_item/action/show_chapters/user_id/tyrann0\">here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/view_item/action/show_chapters/user_id/tyrann0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>)</font></div></span></div></div>",

It was difficult, her body felt slow and sluggish, like she had swallowed a lump of lead. Finally getting her torso into a vertical position, she took a look at her morning greeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a nurse, which much was obvious from her pitch-black scrubs, with a stethoscope peeking out of her hip pocket. She was also big, like really really big; hell she looked a bit bigger than Brooke back at her office. Her monumental stomach took up most of her build, hanging low over her thighs but still covered tastefully by her tent-sized nurses-scrubs. Her legs (or what Parker could see of them from her bed) were thick and pillar-like, certainly well built to hold up her huge form. Her chest was also, like the rest of her, super-sized; the heavy mounds perched on top of her beach-ball stomach and stretching her top. Lastly her face was super fat, with thick round cheeks and a double chin that clearly outstripped her neck and sat a bit on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat nurses were not an uncommon sight though; it was her choice in makeup that made Parker stare. She had raven-black lipstick, black nails, cat-eye lashes and a white base that accentuated her pale skin. Her black hair was done in a bob with a pair of long pink bangs hanging down in front that sat neatly on her fat chest. Parker noticed she was also very young, possibly a few years younger than herself, ugh! Please don\u2019t say she was stuck with a newbie intern!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Nurse Porter, and I will be looking after you until you are fit to leave\u201d she stated with a sarcastic smile between her heavy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but I would rather be going now\u201d Parker grumbled, turning herself sideways, but her care-giver was quick to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t do that\u2026\u201d The gothic Nurse remarked in a barely interested tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why the fu\u2026what?!\u201d Parker shrieked as she pulled back the covers, revealing her right leg was now covered in a cast up to the base of her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was trying to explain, you had a fall, your leg was fractured and you need bed-rest\u201d Nurse Porter elaborated picking up and waving Parker\u2019s medical notes tauntingly before resting her chubby hands on her massive stomach to rest them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine\u2026guess I could spend a few days here\u201d Parker snarled, attempting to pull the covers back before the nurse beat her to it, tucking her in like she was a small child. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d Parker thought, \u201cAt least I get some time off work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Parker settled herself down, she watched as Nurse Porter waddled around back to the table and picked up her white box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that Porter?\u201d Parker inquired, trying to peer over the lid as the black-clad Nurse opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Cer\u201d she hand-waved, \u201cAnd this is just a snack, running around all day is tiring, so I bring these every morning\u201d at this Cer turned the box around to reveal a very large, half finished, box of donuts. \u201cWant one? I can\u2019t have too many, might ruin my figure...\u201d the spherical nurse added with no sense of irony what-so-ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Parker relented; she might need something to cheer her up. To pass the time, the pair began to share donuts and chat; with the overfed nurse pulling up a very sturdy chair to rest her monumental backside on. It turned out that while they had little in common; Cer was not all that bad a person to talk to, hell they both shared a snarky sense of humour at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what were you doing to break your leg?\u201d Cer asked, not looking up from her box of unhealthy snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Parker stuttered, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you know that from my notes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavyweight nurse shrugged; \u201cYeah but we can either sit in awkward silence or make slightly less awkward conversation, your call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you must know I was exercising at the gym.\u201d Parker explained snottily, looking down her nose at the fat pig who was busy making herself even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool\u2026which one?\u201d Cerys added, still not looking Parker in the eye as another doughy dessert was pressed past her black-lined lips. Parker could not remember the exact name of the gym, so instead tried to pin it down by location, to which the obese nurse responded in a way Parker certainly did not expect. \u201cYeah I know that one, I try to go almost every day after work\u2026strange I haven\u2019t seen you there before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was too shocked to explain that it was her first time, also it would have ruined the fa\u00e7ade of her being some healthy go-getter she had going here. So instead she spluttered out without thinking; \u201c<b>You</b> go to the gym?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to strike a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Porter stopped shoveling back the doughnut that was on its way to meet its fellows and placed it back in the bow. She turned her gaze upwards and stared daggers at Parker. \u201cLook, I know I am fat, hell I am way beyond just <i>fat</i> anymore, but I know that if I don\u2019t exercise like crazy and eat right then I will be even fatter before I can blink\u2026these donuts? Low sugar and low cal, but I need <i>some</i> energy each day to keep me going tending to assholes like you nine to five\u2026so, you can either rag on me about how fat my ass is, or I can do my job and make sure you are comfortable\u2026so you want a coffee or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I wouldn\u2019t mind a hot drink\u201d Parker asked, still a little shook up after that rant from her career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, one cup of joe coming up\u201d her caretakerremarked, bracing her fat hands on her fat knees as she heaved herself upright with a heavy grunt, \u201cPhew! That gets harder every time\u201d she muttered offhandedly as she waddled away, hand wafting her flabby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the jumbo nurse was away, Parker tried to collect her thoughts, piecing together the incident. She began to remember the gym bunnies, the treadmill\u2026her unsightly stomach\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the covers again, the Armenian stunner looked down, her hospital gown covering her unsightly middle; forget not wanting to end up like Brooke, now Parker had a new barometer of fat to compare herself to. Before she could make any further judgments, a rumble heralded the return of the not-so-jovial nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can never understand why they have so many brands, so I got you the same as me\u201d Cer lowered the cup down with a sadistic smile before dropping her bulk back in the seat with a satisfactory *oof* noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker picked up the drink and took a slurp, heavy cream and whipped cream on top, predictable for someone of her carer\u2019s girth. As she took another sip, she noticed out of the corner of her eye a lot of rustling coming from said butterball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I got hungry and got some more donuts\u201d Nurse Porter stated, jiggling the box around with much jiggling of her own. It seemed despite the nurses attempts at dieting, it wouldn\u2019t work if she just ate a metric-ton of food anyway\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Parker replied, promising herself to let the whale-sized woman take her fair share this time. The pair were about to pick up where they left off; when Parker suddenly remembered, she hadn\u2019t actually been told how long she was staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Cer?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Grunt* Yup?\u201d came the reply, once a mouthful of pastry had been swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long am I actually staying here for?\u201d Parker inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it is cost you are worried about, don\u2019t worry, the gym offered to pay all your fees\u2026from what I read of how you were injured I think it is to make sure you don\u2019t sue\u201d Cer\u2019s body rocked with mirth at this bit of information; \u201cBut I would say you have to stay about\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Back then she'd dismissed it as unimportant \u2013 after all, Piper had just started in a new job, met a new guy and moreover \u2013 it had been Christmas! Everyone puts on a couple pounds during Christmas. And loses them afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Piper hadn't. She'd found more pounds instead, and plenty more, by the look of it. Her bust was even larger now, larger than Parker's for sure, but it was propped up by a sizable belly that slipped from the confines of a far too small T-shirt. Below, her thighs stretched the denim of her jeans to bursting too, rubbing all the way to her knees. And from occasional glimpses Parker could surmise Piper's backside had expanded even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Parker took all that in, she blurted out, \"No offense, but...what happened to YOU? You\u2026 You look like Porky Piper again. In fact, you look like you ate her. And a cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll let you know,\u201d Piper scowled at her, \u201cthat I'm the pinnacle of feminine beauty.

In fact... Jack might come too. Actually, he promised he will but I don't think the company'll let him go for more than a couple days.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Parker dabbed the last sweat she could bother to remove (her clothes were sodden, and they were going to remain like that no matter what she did), her soft stomach gave a growl. Fuck, she had been so concerned with dropping these newfound pounds that she didn\u2019t realize Parker had forgotten to eat her usual late-afternoon snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lazy woman had sunk into the office lifestyle, her body had got used to various *topping up* several times a day, and it was very impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back (well as well as she could in her almost delirious state), Parker remembered seeing a large machine in the lobby. That had to have been a vending machine right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinging her towel haphazardly into her duffel-bag; Parker retreated to the air-conned lobby. Unfortunately the Armenian stunner was forced to walk by all those immaculate hulks again, ugh! Parker felt her hands drift to her un-toned middle in shame as she passed; despite none of them giving her so much as giving her a sideways glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it grew later in the afternoon even more of them had got off work and arrived. Some had personal trainers as well, such as that tank-like blonde woman with the short-scruffy hair barking orders at a rather timid-looking woman on a weight-machine (who was STILL in better shape the Parker was, so unfair!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was relatively quiet in the lobby; the receptionist was the only real sign of life there, her head ducked down behind the tall counter. But there, in the corner, jackpot! Parker had remembered correctly; the big red machine WAS a snack dispenser. What the hell a snack dispenser was doing, fully stocked with fatty treats, in a gym was anybody\u2019s guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over as nonchalantly as possible, Parker slipped a few notes out of her purse and began to feed them to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she feel like? Chocolate? Bag of chips? Soda? Parker\u2019s stomach rumbled as she gazed over the options. Deciding to well, not decide, Parker instead used up her entire bill on one of everything, feeling all that exercise had earned her the right to a little snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning hungrily as the payload dropped down, Parker began to lick her lips at the thought of her sweet reward. Perhaps this was how she could motivate herself to go to the gym more? A little hard work for a little snack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be careful if I were you\u201d came a sudden voice. Parker looked around to see where the sound came from, until she spotted the eyes of the receptionist poking over her desk. \u201cI used to visit that vending machine all the time, until I stopped fitting into my pants\u2026\u201d she warned darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmph, well I have a little thing called self control\u201d Parker snorted as she turned around and left the lobby, snotty little woman, what did she know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of heading back to the workout machines after she dropped of her garbage, Parker instead went to collect her effects. She had had enough gym for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back home was a rather unpleasant one. Parker had opted for public transport rather than to walk to her apartment, and instead of walking through nice clean fresh air, had to suffer the strangeness of the average bus-user in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help her mood when Parker felt the sudden rumble of an incredibly fat woman drop her immense mass onto the seat next to her. Sure she had apologized, but she would not have needed to if she wasn't so fat! Ugh and her massive hip had oozed over Parker's lap a bit...gross!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, with much relief Parker got to her stop. At least now she could lie down and relax the evening away. Then she remembered she actually should get herself a meal...FUCK! Adulting was so hard! Turning the keys in her lock did not feel so satisfying, knowing that more work awaited her on entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Parker trudged her way inside, she felt the unusual texture of her heels meeting something that was clearly not her doormat. Looking down, the dull-brown-skinned woman saw a bunch of leaflets underfoot. Scooping them up and readying herself to throw them in the trash as usual, Parker began to idly flick through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recycle your gold for cash...junk...local church fundraiser...junk...car valeting service...junk...new Chinese place opening...ju..oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker stopped at the last once, she had tried take-out a fair few times from various different places, but they all were quite out of the way and far from her place, leading to high delivery costs. She had given up after the last one charged almost 50% of her meal as its delivery rate. But this one was just down the road (Parker at no point even considered actually walking there and collecting it herself, fuck that), perhaps this was how she could get out of cooking tonight? I mean, she was really sore and hard worked so hard right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">(PS: this chapter was originally written by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'tyrann0', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '101190116'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'tyrann0', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: tyrann0\r\nMember Since: November 23rd, 2015\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">Trampltrum</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View tyrann0's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/tyrann0',%20'CommunityR_101190116',%20'400',%20'650')\">23</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/tyrann0','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/tyrann0\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'tyrann0', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Today', 'Today', 'November 23, 2015', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101190116',   'mess101190116_1591461155', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/101190116/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: tyrann0 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_fftyrann0\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('fftyrann0', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=101190116&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_fftyrann0');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add tyrann0 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"fftyrann0\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span>\u2014 you should check out some of the other stuff they've written <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/view_item/action/show_chapters/user_id/tyrann0\">here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/view_item/action/show_chapters/user_id/tyrann0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>)</font></div></span></div></div>",

Finish what you're doing and then you can just come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although it was made to <i>look</i> innocent, like Carol had just stopped to say hello or to perhaps reschedule an appointment, everyone else on the floor knew that something was up. And as Carol sauntered down the central aisle, created by cubicles and desks, everyone did their best to contain their various reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no secret that Parker and Carol had developed some bad blood in the short time that they had become acquainted. Their quiet feud had been broadcast in hushed tones and whispers, with some giggling and shushing, all across the office building. Just about everyone knew that Parker was a shitty secretary. But <i>now</i> everyone knew that Parker was a shitty secretary and her ass was about to be grass. And that proved to be infinitely more entertaining conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the office, Pam was practically drooling. Katie was already texting \"SHOTS FIRED!!!\" to Pam.

The gravitas of the situation had, apparently, not been lost on her. For the first time since Carol had arrived, Parker was sitting up straight. She still looked distasteful, an air of unpleasantness about her. But she was at least attempting to control her resting bitch face with some passing success. She sat in the chair opposite Carol's, one leg over the other, and held onto her knee. Her skirt was tight and small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker... do you <i>want</i> to be here?\" Carol asked, pyramiding her fingers thoughtfully, \"And I mean here as in the company, not here as in my office. I'm completely aware that you'd probably much rather be back at your desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Parker bounced her prominent black eyebrows, \"It's nice in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... it is nice, isn't it?\" Carol extended a hand in gesticulation, \"And do you know how I got here? By <i>applying</i> myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. That right there, Carol reminded herself as she caught that sly little eye roll, <i>that</i> was why she was in here.Parker had no respect for her job, this company, or her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker, I'm not going to beat around the bush.\" Carol's tone turned stern and her hands folded on top of the desk in front of her. She hunched slightly into her burgundy blazer. Her shoulders hiked up and her brow furrowed\u2014she looked rather menacing, \"I know you're on your phone all the time. I know you're rude to clients. I know you \"lose\" half of your paperwork because you're lazy and, frankly, irresponsible. I know all of these things because I'm your <i>boss</i>. And if you'd like for me to stay your boss\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Parker looked to have wanted to say something, but wisely decided against it. The small break in her stoic lack of upset was enough to let Carol know she pushed a button. At least she wasn't a crier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014or remained employed at this company,\" Carol corrected, \"then I suggest you take me very seriously when I say <i>this is your last chance</i>, Parker. If you don't shape up, I <i>will</i> fire you. Are we understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surly twenty-something took a deep sigh, her huge chest inflating and deflating in defeat. God those things were huge. But ultimately the stunning secretary relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Parker nodded with a more pronounced frown, \"I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then you're dismissed.\" Carol smiled tightly as Parker eagerly removed herself from her seat, \"The next time I have to call you in here, it better be because I have a question about an appointment. You got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure <i>mom</i>.\" Parker said mockingly to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Carol arched her eyebrows threateningly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure boss.\" Parker corrected as she shut the door behind her, and got back to work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well look at her now, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wilson!<br>\r\n She's... in just as much financial trouble as they said she'd be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could it be? It wasn't like she wasn't trying! She was trying, like, <i>so</i> hard you guys. Maybe people just didn't like her cooking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie's been big her entire life. After a stint in <b>Buttercombe Academy</b>, where she learned about her passion of pastries and put on much more than the freshman fifteen, she's bigger than ever and dying to break even.

She's never really liked sweets before, but she has to admit, Ronnie's stint in that Academy and being away at Culinary School has really helped her see the light.

I just want it to be a cute little bakery. You don't get customers\u2014<u>or friends</u>\u2014by being mean, Penny. You get them by being nice, friendly, and humble!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little nook carved out into an old brick building wasn't much. Unless you thought \"overdoing it on the white and pink\" counted as much. Ronnie had been involved pretty heavily in the design and, even though Penny had okayed it, she couldn't help but feel like she was getting involved in a huge disaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis part of town, this atmosphere, this economy, <i>this fucking shade of pink</i>, none of it made Penny Simon feel like she was making a sound business investment. Or better yet, playing with her inheritance wisely. How many businesses failed within their first year of opening? Like, 80% or something, right? Those numbers didn't exactly play into Penny's chintzy senses well, and she had been up all night... well, all <i>week</i> in anticipation for their first day of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lo and behold, despite all the ads she had put in the paper, the flyers she had literally thrown into the wind across town, and begging all of her friends to like their page on Social Media, they had seen a very modest success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hurt her to see Ronnie so glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it hurt her wallet more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this was a dumb idea.\" Penny said, her hands on her hips, \"We shouldn't have made it a big deal to be like <i>we're open</i>! We should have just always acted like we were open. Y'know, like we've always been here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that helpful?\" the normally cheerful Chernobyl of energy rolled her eyes from behind her glasses, \"Maybe if you hadn't have scared those kids off\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were, like, sixteen.\" Penny cut in, \"They should have been in school, and were skipping. What 16 year old walks into a bakery at noon on a Monday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me.\" Ronnie struck defiantly against her childhood friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny didn't doubt that. She had known Ronnie since they were kids, and she'd always been big. Her time at that Academy up in Virginia had done a number on her figure for sure, but Penny couldn't remember a time when Ronnie was under at least two hundred pounds. At twenty five, Ronnie weighed more than two hundred and seventy pounds. So it wasn't hard for Penny to believe that Buttercombe Academy had been nothing <i>but</i> bakeries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have let them buy <i>something</i>.\" Ronnie almost whined, \"Now we're those two mean old ladies who scared off a bunch of kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like two kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We scared <i>two kids</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're not old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't! Despite what those kids had called her as she (quite literally) chased them out of the store. Penny looked even younger than Ronnie, despite being a year or so older than her. It helped that she was shorter. Her stylist said that the bob made her look older, but even Penny didn't buy that. Though at this rate, with all this stress, Penny was going to wrinkle up like a prune with worry lines. There just had to be something that they could do to help pick up business!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... ugh...\" Penny let out a steady stream of air, \"I'm gonna take a walk. Clear my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you sure?\" Ronnie asked, sounding petrified by being left alone in what was so far a failing dream, \"I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie seemed to shrink into her meaty shoulders, twiddling her fat fingers over the swell of her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay.\" Penny smiled tensely, \"Maybe I'll get the chance to pound the pavement. You know, get the word out there...\"</span></div></div>",

While Penny was continuing to plaster the flyers to the walls around her, she was still somewhat mad at Ronnie, but she knew that even though she could be a bit frustrating to deal with, that at least she was trying to actually run the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of walking though, Penny ran out of posters, but before she thought of going back to the bakery, she was stopped by someone, saying to her \"Hey, you wouldn't have happened to be the one who opened the bakery on Main Street, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I opened it, though it was the idea of a friend of mine. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny quickly turned around to look at the woman, and she saw that she was a rather short woman with pink hair and a ponytail, and while she was somewhat chubby around her midsection and breasts, the rest of her body looked thin and lithe. She also noticed that the woman was wearing some sort of fancy dress, though it seemed to be a bit tight around the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, the woman finally responded to Penny, saying to the woman \"Well my name is Momoko Terumi, and I am a cousin to the heir of Yeng, Tetsuko. Anyway, I need to stay here for a year, since I need to take a break from the hardships at home, and I need a place to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this has to do with my bakery because?\" While Penny was confused on why this stranger was talking to her, she had heard about Yeng in the news before, and how they were some sort of famous company. Whatever the company did though, Penny was unsure of, though she thought that maybe she could ask this woman before she left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just that I saw that your building was rather spacious, so I thought to ask you if I could live there for the year. You wouldn't need to worry about the costs of me living there, and in fact I may even help you if there's any problem to the bakery, since my relations with Yeng have made me rather rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is rather sweet, but most of that space is storage. We actually live across the street from the bakery, and while we do have a guest room, it's rather small.\" As Penny said these words, her stomach growled a bit, and while she was beginning to get  a bit hungry, she wanted to finish her talk with this Yeng person before leaving for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly for Penny though, Momoko's stomach also growled, and as Momoko rubbed her chubby gut for a bit, she said to Penny \"Perhaps we should continue talking after we get lunch? I've been here since yesterday, and there is a place near here that serves an amazing burger. I'll pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a bit, Penny thought for a bit before agreeing to go with Momoko, if only to get something to eat for a bit. As Momoko led Penny to the restaurant that served her, a small restaurant known as Cupid's Diner, the two placed their orders, with Penny ordering a simple cheeseburger with all the toppings, Penny ordered three of the same, along with two large fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the food arrived, the two continued to talk.
