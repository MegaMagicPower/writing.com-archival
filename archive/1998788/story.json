She was starting the early hours of her night with some bass practice when she noticed a figure standing outside her window. Thinking this was some kind of lost passer by forest critter she decides to pay it no mind and continue on with her practice. Her practice came to a halt when she hears a knock at her door.<br>\r\n\"Is that you Finn? Give me a second to clean up.\" She responded<br>\r\nThe knocking came again, this time twice as fast and twice as hard as before.<br>\r\n\"I said give me a second to clean-\" <br>\r\nThe door was kicked off it's hinges by a bear of a candy person. They appeared to be a chocolate strawberry that donned a black and red cloak.<br>\r\n\"I, Darth von Bellsweet, demon slayer extraordinaire! have come to end your reign, succubus!\" They bellowed. Bellsweet unsheathed a crossbow and fired a stake at her. It singed past Marceline by just an inch.<br>\r\n\"What the hell?! Do I look like a succubus to you?\" Marceline yelled at the intruder<br>\r\n\"Well, a succubus is a demon that's also a lady, ain't it? So it checks out!\" Bellsweet responded<br>\r\n\"You dummy. A succubus has sex appeal. Do I look like a sed-\" she was cut off mid sentence by a punch to the gut that made her kneel in pain<br>\r\n\"Get up you stealer of men's hearts! I want to look you in the eye as I end your bloodshed.\" The excuse of a slayer told her<br>\r\n\"F-fine. You want sex appeal? I'll give ya sex appeal!\" Marceline stammered<br>\r\nAs the slayer was about to land another punch, Marceline's breasts swelled forward ripping out of her shirt and catching his fist. The idiot struggled to free his hand from her cleavage but it was pointless to struggle, soon his entire body would be absorbed into her cleavage. Marceline seemed to revel in the experience, she really enjoyed how much he struggled to break free. Marceline enjoyed it so much, even after Darth von Bellsweet had been fully sucked into her bosom, she continued to expand. <br>\r\nNot even realizing that she has almost outgrown her living room, she only begins to realize her size when she feels her uber sensitive nipples begin to press against the walls. This was enough to snap her out of her eroticism long enough for her to turn into a bat and remove herself from the cave.<br>\r\nUpon turning back she was incredibly disappointed to find that she had turned back to normal, save for some extra weight put on by that Bellsweet guy.<br>\r\n\"Guess I got to start over.\" Marcy said herself</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After putting on a new shirt, Marceline found a whole encampment of demon slayers close by. They all consisted of about 10 chocolate strawberries with the same taste for demon killing and each one was as eager to start a fight. She moved in closer to eaves drop on 2 them<br>\r\n\"By glob, if Bellsweet ain't back in 5 minutes. I might just have to start killing the others\" one of the smaller strawberries said<br>\r\n\"Easy, Montague. He'll be back... Eventually.\" One told the other<br>\r\n\"But Bellsweet was only supposed to scout the parameter for anything funny. Hopefully, he ain't run into nuthen.\"<br>\r\n\"He can totally handle his own. He's the smartest guy around.\" The other responded<br>\r\n\"That may be so but I'm gonna go check on him either way\" Montague said while heading off into the brush. <br>\r\n\"Ay, Bellsweet. Are you ok? You been gone for to long. You ain't run into a demon have ya?\" He chuckled to himself. Just then he felt something pulling on his leg. He reeled back and stabbed at what had caught him. His boot was only entangled in a branch. \"phhhht. As if a lowly branch woul- yuuuaah\" he was lifted off of the forest floor and before he could even realize what was happening it was too late, a pair of fangs had burrowed themselves into his skin and had begun to drain his life force.<br>\r\nShe let his husk fall to the forest floor<br>\r\n\"PB really knows how to make em\" Marceline said licking her lips. She could feel the juices of her prey filling up her breasts. She could feel her nipples growing with her voluptuous bossom. In the end, they expanded to about a foot in length and width. She hoped out of the tree causing her breasts to slosh as though she were storing water balloons. This noise attracted the attention of another strawberry.<br>\r\n\"Ay, Montague. Is that you? Leopold had said that you'd run off again. Is there something you ain't been telling us.\" A distant voice loomed from somewhere close by. Instinctively, Marceline turned invisible. A muscular thing of a slayer came out from the bushes<br>\r\n\"Yo Montague. What's the matter? You don't look so- oh my glob! What got the drop on you's?\" The slayer dropping to meet him eye to eye<br>\r\nMontague, using what little strength he had left pointed behind her and in a raspy voice responded \"L-L-Lu-Lo\"<br>\r\n\"Good glorb. You were attacked by leprichaAAAAAAAAAAAA\" She was cut short by a seering pain on her neck and a sudden case of light headedness as she immediately passed out.<br>\r\n\"2 down, 8 to go\" Marceline laughed to herself<br>\r\nMarceline felt the fabric of her shirt begin to tear as her breasts were once more filled with the juice of incompetent demon slayers. In a complete state of euphoria she looked down and saw what was becoming of her chest. She saw that her shirt had become more transparent. She watched in awe as her pale blue skin stretched forward while her nipples were growing with her breasts, rubbing against the fabric and becoming as hard as ice. <br>\r\nHer shirt began to tear, ripping a hole across her shirt from one nipple all the way down to the other. Once the growing had stopped, she began groping herself. Both breast layed heavy and full in her hand. She started to stroke her breasts, letting her lust take over as she felt the liquid inside of her chest slosh and gurgle as though she were a cow ready for milking. She worked her way down to her nipple not realizing just how sensitive they were. Her aerola's had become large enough that she could grasp them in her hand and her nipples were as big and as puffy as stiff marshmellows. She felt this immense pressure, building up within her as she massaged her breasts. She rubbed the tip of her nipple sending her into righteous moan as the pressure had finally released. The juices with in her started to spray everywhere completely soaking her shirt.<br>\r\n\"OH FUCK!\" Marceline shouted<br>\r\nPanicking she slipped her breasts through the tear and brought them to her mouth, to try and drink her escaping fluids. Her breasts now acting as an ouroboros, she got lost in thought of how good it felt to suck on her own nipple. Feeling the liquid trickle down her throat was bizzarely hypnotic for her. Unfortunately, her good times were cut short by the glow of torchlight. She made to much noise in her lustful moment and had alerted the slayers of her presence, now she was paying the price. Not only was she being hunted, she was hiding with two barely alive demon slayers by her side.</span></div></div>",

His original idea was to increase the size of food was less successful, as the procedure backfired because it was only temporary, within time the food would shrink back its original size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that failure, he decided that his second idea was to build a machine that would somehow help people digest food more efficiently. For weeks he had been working on this machine, as his desk was littered with so many written stacks of calculations and algorithms, but sadly he knew that there was always that wildcard that put all his charts and graphs to waste; his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, Dee-Dee came dancing and skipping in approaching Dexter closer and closer to where he sat and awaited the ever repeating phrase she spoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Dexter!\u201d she shouted at the top of lungs, making Dexter jump up in surprise, soon Dee-Dee saw something that knew very well each time she visited her brother\u2019s lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooooh\u2026 What does this button do?\" she asked with curiosity at the button in question, before Dexter could even react and shout Dee-Dee immediately pressed the button and activated the machine.  Soon the machine was on and started spinning around erratically and fired a laser from the tip and bounced off the wall and around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does it hit?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was walking along with her eyes closed like normal humming a tune. She didn't notice a flash that was coming straight at her, but since the beam didn't hit her with any pain she didn't feel it, making her none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was a slight rumble from her stomach. Dinner was less than an hour away, so she shrugged it off thinking this was probably normal. She went downstairs, did the laundry, and went to the kitchen to start preparing dinner for her and the family. However today she felt like deserved a little snack, as the rumble in her stomach was growing louder with each passing moment. It started with one cookie, then the next cookie and next one, until she decided to devour the whole cookie box in seconds. Still not satisfied she decided to move onto what was inside the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess I'm hungrier than I thought,\" Dexter's Mom giggled. She opened the fridge and gazed upon at all the food inside. Dexter's Mom started off shovelling all the food she could get into her mouth, from vegetables, to the more fattening foods. She chewed loudly, chomping away on the food with no care in the world. As crumps rained down on her shirt and apron as her flat belly grew. She grabbed a six-pack of beer that her husband was keeping for any big games coming up and drank it to quench her thirst as she swallowed the contents of what she had in her food filled mouth in one sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter's Mom grabbed a pack of burgers and ate them all before moving onto squirting some ketchup into her mouth and staining on her face and white apron. Her first shirt button and pants button burst, exposing her growing belly. She grabbed a pizza and a cupcake and ate them together, enjoying the bizarre mixture of flavours. Dexter's Mom reached out for the ice cream in the freezer and started shovelled it into her mouth and making her gloves sticky. Finally, she grabbed a giant ham she was saving later for a special occasion, opened her mouth as wide as she could, and swallowed it in one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finally finished eating, Dexter\u2019s Mom sat down on a nearby chair, with her belly so big that it tore open her green shirt. Exposed but hidden underneath the dirty stained apron, along with her ass that tore the back of her pants. She cleaned out the fridge and the cabinets, before long there was nothing left for supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... <b>*UUURRRRPPP*</b> I don't know what came over me,\" she said in astonishment.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another typical day in the lab, as Dexter sat at his workbench and tightened a bolt on some superfluous device. So absorbed was the young scientist in his work that he didn't notice his sister stealthily ballet-dancing her way into the laboratory, passing right by him on her merry way. She was in need of something to drink at her doll tea party, and in a leap of logic that seemed perfectly normal to her, figured she'd root around her brother's lab for one. Her travels brought her to a large, ominously open blast door labeled, \"Biohazard: Do Not Enter!\", with, \"That means you, Deedee\", scribbled in Sharpie underneath it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...I wonder what's in here?\" she asked innocently, strolling inside. It wasn't that Deedee was a dumb girl-- quite the contrary, she could sometimes be downright smart. It's just that she tended not to pay much attention to detail, hence her decision to enter the scary storage room. Inside were numerous beakers, bottles, and test tubes, sealed behind glass cases covered with warning labels. She settled on a particular concoction in the centre-right case-- a bright green liquid that seemed oddly familiar to Deedee. \"This'll work perfect!\" Reaching into the poorly-secured case, she grabbed the beaker and strolled on out of the lab with it, waving to her brother and offering a hurried, \"Thanks, Dexter!\", as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, no problem Deedee...wait...DEEDEE?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her obnoxiously pink room, Deedee had seated herself at the table with all her assembled dolls, pouring the green potion she'd taken from the lab into a teapot, and from there, into cups for herself and the dolls. \"Ah, isn't the tea lovely, Mrs. Nesbitt?\" she said to a ragdoll seated across from her, before taking a sip. Once again, that feeling of familiarity struck-- had she tasted this before?  Yes, yes, some other time she visited the lab, but which one? Deedee spent a few more moments mulling it over before deciding to just forget it and go on with her tea party. \"Whatever, tea is tea-- mmpphh!\" Her sentence was interrupted by her lips suddenly pulling themselves shut-- at that moment, she finally recalled just which potion it was she had decided to sample...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, how could I have been so blind?!\" Dexter lamented, running frantically around his laboratory in an attempt to figure out what Deedee had done during her brief visit. He soon slowed down, confused at how nothing seemed to have been disturbed. \"Wait a minute...hmm...nothing is broken, no buttons have been pressed...what could that vile girl have done this time?!\" Soon enough, an idea came to mind, and the redheaded genius decided to consult Computer for help. \"Computer-- do a scan of the lab and tell me if anything has been tampered with!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, Dexter,\" she replied in her sultry electronic voice, using her control of the lab's vast electronic systems to do a thorough search. In mere moments, she sounded a ping, having found the problem. \"Dexter, my sensors indicate that your Biohazard Storage Vault has been tampered with-- I suggest checking there.\" In a flash, he made his way over to the Vault, silently cursing himself for leaving it open after his earlier experiment with fungal spores. It wasn't long before he spotted the open case, conspicuously emptied of its contents. \"Oh, no, no, no...\" he moaned, realizing what he had been keeping in there. \"Anything but THAT potion!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>CRASH</b></i>* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shoot...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a second later, the steel bulkheads behind Dexter were shattered by a massive, yellow beast-- one which he immediately recognized as Deedee, under the influence of the \"Don't drink this-- it'll turn you into a MONSTER!\" potion he had once accidentally fed her, mistaking it for a silence potion. How could he forget-- he was still paying off fines to the city after the damage he and his sister caused last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, DEXTER!\" Deedee roared in her deep, rumbling monster voice. \"I THINK I DRANK SOME OF THAT WEIRD STUFF AGAIN...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn right you did, you STYUUUPID girl!\" he shot back, glaring at her with enough venom to give even the 20-foot bird monster that was his sister pause. \"Now sit RIGHT HERE and do not move-- I'm getting an antidote and nipping this stupidity in the bud!\" With that, he stormed off toward, leaving Deedee unattended. She sat her massive, furry ass down on the floor of the lab, creating a crater where she sat, and absentmindedly twiddled her thumbs, waiting for Dexter to return. Taking a look down at herself, Deedee pondered over her transformed body, wondering whether she would end up mutating into different forms again like last time...her dress, unlike last time, had developed numerous tears through which tufts of thick, yellow fur poked out. Before she could think much more about it, though, something different happened-- a loud, gurgling roar sounded from deep within her belly, and all at once Deedee felt a hunger like nothing she had ever felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRGHHH...NEED...FOOD~!\" she moaned, reaching out and taking a bite out of a large mainframe with her powerful fangs, easily chewing it up-- it didn't even occur to her that this was not strictly \"food\". No, she was just hungry as all hell and NEEDED something to sate her! </span></div></div>",

She needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" she roared, angry and frustrated that she'd already consumed all of the equipment within arm's reach.

As if in response to this dilemma, her body began to shake, as she felt tingly all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep, almost sultry, moan, Deedee felt herself growing again, getting taller and, oddly enough, a bit wider as well. She felt her titanic stomach expand into a muffin-top, then a hefty pudge, as her ass grew wider and sank deeper into the ground. When all was said and done, she was twice her original height, and easily able to grab more \"food\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yess,\" she whispered happily, giggling slightly as she reached for another, even more tremendous, handful.

She shot out one flabby arm, reaching her claws into the containment unit and seizing a handful of the tiny vials before tossing them into her gaping maw. Drinking them the normal way was pretty much impossible for the 40-foot, massively fat beast she had become, so she just swallowed them, glass and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So...feel anything yet, Deedee?\" Dexter looked up and down across his sister's bloated form, scientific curiosity peaking even as his fight-or-flight response did the same.

Before she could express her pleasure any further, she suddenly began to swell upward and outward at a downright frightening rate, bowling over rows of computers and machinery with her burgeoning rolls of flab while her head shot up to the ceiling of the lab. By now, Deedee was positively roaring in animalistic pleasure, and the process seemed like it wouldn't be stopping any time soon-- and all the while, Dexter watched in a combination of fear and awe, wishing he had some way of taking down notes as his sister continued to trod all over the laws of biology. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n               Ben Tennyson is your average ten-year-old boy....or he would be average if not for the alien device on his wrist.  The device, the Omnitrix, allows Ben to transform into a number of aliens with special abilities that he uses to protect the world from various threats, both alien and human.   The Omnitrix was originally meant for Ben's grandfather, Max, but the Omnitrix latched onto Ben thinking it was Max instead.  Ben didn't fully understand how the Omnitrix worked--just that the device was bonded to him and his DNA.  All that he cared about were the ten awesome aliens that he could turn into for a limited time. There were possibly much more than 10 aliens available since Ben once traveled to the future where he was known as \"Ben 10,000\".   Ever since he traveled to the future, Ben had unsuccessfully tried to unlock  new aliens.<br>\r\n                               Ben had two traveling companions; his cousin, Gwen and his grandfather who was a Plumber. Plumbers are the Intergalactic Police force charged with protecting the galaxy.   <br>\r\n                                   Gwen wasn't your average ten-year old either as she was gifted at magic.  She wasn't that good at magic yet but she was learning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     Ben awoke with a start.  It took him several  moments for his eyes to adjust to the darkness and realize he was in his bed in the RV that Grandpa Max drove.  Some sixth sense told him that he had been awoken by a loud noise that came from outside.  A bright flash of lightning filled the  RV with light for half a second. In that time, Ben saw a glimpse of a hulking shape just outside the RV's front window.  It sort of looked like a much bigger form of  Wildmutt--one of the aliens that Ben could turn into--if Wildmutt were ten times the size!   Ben yelped at about the same time as a  crack of deafening thunder came. <br>\r\n                           Ben got out of bed in a rush and thus was tangled in the sheets which made him trip and fall to the floor with a loud thud. <br>\r\n                           \"Ben be quiet\" grumbled Gwen's sleepy voice.  <br>\r\n                          \"We need to--\" started Ben but was interrupted with another loud crack of thunder and then the skies opened with rain.   <br>\r\n                          \"Go back to sleep, Ben\" said Grandpa Max who was asleep in  the front seat.  The man could sleep anywhere.  <br>\r\n                          \"But I saw something outside!\" exclaimed Ben.<br>\r\n                           The glare of lightning that came next revealed nothing in front of the RV.  Ben blinked several times.  Did he just imagined what he just saw?  He got back into bed but stayed awake for a time before drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Hey, Ben!\"<br>\r\n                         Ben opened his eyes to see Gwen in front of him.   \"What?\" he asked sleepily.<br>\r\n                       \"Time for breakfast, Ben\" came the voice of Grandpa Max who was clearly cooking something in the stove of the RV.  More than unlikely it was something not fit for human consumption in Ben's view.  Max had very odd tastes when it came to food.  <br>\r\n                  Ben stumbled out of bed and into the bathroom.   After that, Ben exited the bathroom in time to see that breakfast was on the table.  Ben's guess was right; the food looked inedible....whatever it was.  Max and Gwen weren't in the RV.  <br>\r\n                       \"Guys?\" asked Ben.  <br>\r\n                      Ben walked to the door of the RV and saw that Grandpa and Gwen were outside soaking up the morning sunshine.  Glancing back at the breakfast plate with disdain, Ben climbed out of the RV.  He managed to exit the RV without Gwen or Grandpa noticing.<br>\r\n                        \"Time for a real breakfast this time\" grumbled Ben, adjusting the Omnitrix on his wrist.  His plan was turn to into XLR8 and run to the nearest restaurant and have some real food for a change.     He wasn't worried about money; he would be nothing but a blur as he took food.  Finished with the adjusting of the Omnitrix, Ben slammed the button down and waited for the change to come. </span></div></div>",

It was boring if you were a fearsome fire-breathing dragon because nobody came to save the princess.  This didn't stop brave adventurers from coming to the castle, trying to save the young maiden from the top room of the highest tower.  What made it boring was the fact that all the brave adventurers were easy to subdue and/or kill off.  The dragon usually ate the adventurer because the castle was completely devoid of a food supply.  The female dragon would simply swallow the hapless adventurer alive, sending him down her gullet and into her waiting stomach.     The  brave adventurer was almost always a man.  <br>\r\n                     The dragon was guarding the princess for as long as the princess moved into the ruined and ancient castle.  The castle was quite a ways off the beaten track and so visitors were rare.  The dragon would hunt for food in the surrounding area by day and went to sleep at night.   At night, the dragon noticed something happening in the highest tower; a strange yellow glow that seemed to fill the bedroom up there.  It wasn't long before the dragon figured out what was happening; by day, the princess took the form of a human and by night she would turn into an ogre.  It was a curse that the young princess had been born with.  <br>\r\n                    The dragon preferred living food but she soon experimented on other ways of eating the brave knights due to boredom.  She would roast them alive with her fiery breath, she would slice and dice them into ribbons and feast on their guts.  But after experimenting for a while the dragon found that she much more preferred raw food; she loved the way her prey struggled in the depths of her belly.  <br>\r\n                 Eventually, the princess was saved by an ogre by the name of Shrek and his \"noble steed\", a talking donkey named.......erm, well....Donkey.   Guarding the castle seemed pointless so the dragon left the castle and explored the world at her leisure....stopping to have mutant children with Donkey that were half-donkey and half-dragon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      After the defeat of the Fairy Godmother, her potion-making factory was soon taken over by an lovely woman by the name of Morgan Le Fay who continued to make potions that did almost anything imaginable.   Morgan decided to keep the same staff but insisted that she create potions on her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  Our story begins on a dark winter night.  The ground was covered in snow and a full moon was out.  The sky was completely clear and Morgan's potion-making factory was shut down for the night.  A figure dressed in a black cloak rushed to the factory and opened the door without much trouble.  The figure then hurried to the factory floor and towards a back room that held many many potions.  <br>\r\n                             \"Let's see...where is it....?\" muttered the figure as he looked over the potions on the shelves.  <br>\r\n                         Spotting the potion he was looking for, the dark cloaked figure grabbed the potion from the shelf and left behind a single rose.  The cloaked figure then ran out of the room and silently ran out of the factory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    What kind of potion was stolen?   Let's keep the identity of the potion-stealer a mystery for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   Option 1:   A special wish-granting potion was stolen. This potion allows the drinker of the potion to have three wishes.   <br>\r\n                  Option 2:  A shape-shifting potion.  This allows the drinker to transform into any desired form.  Another drink of the potion will restore the drinker to their normal state.  If the drinker doesn't turn back to their original form within 24 hours, he or she will be stuck in whatever form they have chosen.  The drinker simply needs to drink the potion and say what shape he or she wants to be.  <br>\r\n              Option 3:  A growth potion that allows the drinker to grow to a huge size.  There's a warning label cautioning not to drink the entire bottle in one gulp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pick from a variety of series or movies, with plenty of room for extra choices, and just go bananas. Want a character to outgrow the planet? No problem! Underage sex? Go for it! Transformations so bizarre and inhuman that they make you go, \"How the hell is that even sexy?!\"? You bet your bottom dollar! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't worry about the type of expansion/transformation-- all the basics, like GTS/GT, WG, inflation, AP/AR, muscle, and the like are covered. Shrinking, however, is discouraged, <b>unless</b> it's either reversed later on or is accompanied by another character getting bigger in some way. And I aim to try and make sure that this interactive doesn't get bogged down in choice chapters like so many others-- there will be no character choices, just pick your show and story type, then write whatever you feel like. Start with whomever you like, and bring in others as you please, so long as it flows naturally. No one ever said bizarre cartoon erotica can't have a logical story progression! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlob, bodily functions, and other such things are okay to bring in as part of a plot line, but I will ask that there be <b>no</b> blood/gore/guro. Aside from that, one-line or excessive choice chapters, along with poorly-spelt or just plain stupid ones, will be removed-- but other than that, go nuts!</td>",
