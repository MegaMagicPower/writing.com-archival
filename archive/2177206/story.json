Her dress was beginning to feel tight. The chest was pressing down on her developing breasts and the middle felt all too uncomfortable, but she soldiered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the fourth morning after her apple treat, her dress would not close at all. Snow White blushes and laid the gown on her bed in the small room the dwarves let her have and looked herself over in the mirror. Her hands cupped her small breasts through her shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be becoming a woman.\u201d She whispered, despite the fact that the dwarves were already off to the mines for the day. \u201cBut...\u201d her hands slid down to her stomach for a moment before she rucked up her shift to reveal the five month pregnant swell underneath. \u201cI do not recall other girls bellies growing.\u201d Untaught on the birds and the bees, the princess had no idea what was happening to her or that she would be a mother. Her hand stroked over the firm swell curiously. Well, if the dress no longer fit, there was nothing to be done. She would have to alter it that evening. For the moment, she set about the chores in her shift and bloomers. </span></div></div>",

This was a woman\u2019s trouble, after all. No need to bother anyone else with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set to work loosening up the bodice of her dress so that it would fit her more properly in the morning before settling into bed  and easily dozing off. All would be well when she woke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning found Snow White standing before the mirror again as her now 28 week pregnant belly pulled the fabric of her shift tight. The girl rolled it up again to feel the fertile mound of her stomach curiously taking in the sight of herself. She could feel that there was something heavy within her, the weight causing her back to bow and her stance to slightly widen. Her breasts were even fuller now and heavier than they had been before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow White tried to think nothing of it and shoved her shift down again before going about her chores, though she could feel the tasks growing harder to do. By the end of the day she was worn out and all but collapsed into bed, out like a light before the dwarves even returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sixth day after eating the apple, she awoke to her shift already bunched up above her stomach, pushed there by her growing stomach. The young princess waddled her way to the mirror to be met with the sight of her 35 week pregnant form, the weight now settled heavy in her widened hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my...\u201d she breathed. There would be no making her old dress fit now, even after all her alterations. The girl finished her chores as quickly as she could before settling in her room and working up a new dress from the window curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two pieces, a skirt that was fitted to her wider hips and fell much like her old one had, and a new top that held her milky busom  while the fabric below flowed loose, the front cut open in order to set her belly free as she was unsure how much larger she would get. </span></div></div>",

(No getting pregnant with hundred of babies at nine months in five seconds...)<br>\r\nLet's also keep the baby number in general sensible. Dozens of 20 pound children or whatever? No please. <br>\r\nOther things may be in the womb like eggs and such but it must be in relation to pregnancy and not in the stomach.<br>\r\nPlease no describing an under 18's breasts in a sexual way. If you want to say that they have grown them or are producing milk now that's fine but please no lengthy or detailed descriptions.<br>\r\nUnbirth is allowed but only over 18.<br>\r\nBirth is allowed but please do not be detailed about child emergence under 18.<br>\r\nYou may reserve one of the routes on a chapter that you have added by adding a (R) to the end of the choice (I will remove this when you have added the chapter.). The reservation is valid for one month. It will be removed if not added to by that time.<br>\r\nIf you are going to add a new character or start a new plotline, you must give at least two chapters of that story. This is to prevent endless character choices without any story attached to them.</td>",
