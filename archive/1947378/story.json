For example, if you choose \"In a bowl of corn flakes\" how long do you think your character is making it out alive lol. The choice where you are standing in the living room is a lot longer in length and will have much character development and story. The other choices do not explain much of what is going on so you may want to come back to these later. Though, if you prefer less story and more to the point, the other choices are perfect for that.)</span></div></div>",

In the distance of the hard wood floor you stand on, you see a coffee table and a couch. \"This cannot be happening.\" You muttered to yourself. You continue to scan the area, and notice a kitchen past the living room, opposite to the kitchen an arch way which appears to lead into what you'd assume are bedrooms,  and a stand towards your backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\"<br>\r\nYou look around puzzled.<br>\r\n\"Under the chest now! The goddess approachs!\" <br>\r\nYou then feel slight vibrations in the floor, and smacking akin to footsteps barefeet make on such a floor. \"*Yawn* <br>\r\nYour ears hear a very feminine yawn which you then turned in direction to. \"Holy shit.\" You manage to say as a half naked giant woman walks towards the couch in the distance. This beautey is wearing black and pink short shorts and a black bra only. Her skin is flawless as is her black long hair with a tiny stripe of pink. You watch as she lays down on the couch and grabs her phone from the table. You look to the guy that yelled from the stand, then back at this woman. \"Do I trust this man at my size? Maybe he can help me out. Although this woman is huge and may very well be able to figure my situation out. Plus, maybe I might have a chance with her if I can get back to my own height.\"</span></div></div>",

She sits up and looks over at your direction. \"Ah, another guest.\" The woman said as she stood up. <br>\r\nYou start to think this was a bad idea. In seconds, she stood before you. You slowly bring your vision up to her face. <br>\r\nLooking straight at you she says, \"You wanted my attention and I don't know if you noticed, I just woke up. So say something that will amuse me or.....*she seductively bites her finger* I slowly crush you under my foot.\"<br>\r\n\"I...I....you are gorgeous! Just don't kill me! I will do anything!\" You cry out.<br>\r\n\"Anything? Lay on your back.\"<br>\r\nYou quickly do so.<br>\r\n\"Now, watch as my foot slowly comes down onto you. Once its barley touching your small body, kiss my foot. If your lucky, I'll step to hard on you and you'll die quickly.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try to struggle out of her hand but her iron grip is so strong that you are unable to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disobeyed me. And for that you will pay.

Her Hair was quickly bond in a ponytail and a beautiful smile decorated her pretty face. \"Oh god, pls help me ma'am, I am trapped in here\", you shout and bang against the glass of your prison but a look into her green eyes told you that she was not your saviour but more your host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed away as fast as you could as the giantess moved closer very fast. As your back touched the cold glass you noticed for the first time that you are naked, which at the moment was secondary. She stood right in front of you without saying one single word and her two giant hands wrapped around the container before you where lifted up into the air. She got a closer look of you in there. Inspecting her prey. You felt even more naked than you are already as the green eyes inspected every inch of you. She sayed nothing but turned the jar and shook it from time to time to make you move. A human inspecting a trapped insect. </span></div></div>",
