            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Severus Snape was not surprised by the announcement that the headmaster found another instructor for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position.  He was used to it every year, or more frequently, when necessary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was wrong this time?  His name was John Smith.  Was Prof. Dumbledore running out of ideas, or did he think that no one would think the name John Smith was fake because it was so obviously false?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing that was off was he looked like Barty Crouch, Jr.  Not just a passing resemblance either.  During the faculty meeting, Severus purposely placed himself so he could keep an eye on this individual.  He drank nothing other than the tea all of them were offered.  'Smith' also resisted sticking his tongue out and from getting a fevered wild look in his eyes.  As a young Slytherin, Crouch stood out, but at the time, the rest of the house chalked it up to him taking all the classes in the curriculum to achieve twelve OWLs and NEWTs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting, Severus was able to block John Smith and get him to the side, in case he wanted to race off to drink some Polyjuice, and mentioned, \u201cYour seeming youth may have the students trying to take advantage of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, the headmaster inserted himself into the conversation.  \u201cNo need to worry, Severus.  John has impeccable credentials.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn entire shelf full of fictional tales he's written?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, not this time, Severus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn Smith actually took a billfold out of his brown three-piece muggle suit jacket, and opened it in front of Severus' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what an impeccable credential would be to Albus Dumbledore for this position, Severus' mind was blank.  He did not often see things written in Danish, but he knew enough to recognize a season pass to Legoland \u2026 for 1983.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously,\u201d he replied dryly.  He understood Dumbledore chose to make this position into a joke, but there was no need to taunt him in such a manner.  The headmaster had let John Smith in on his jest.  Was his appearance and name purposely crafted to add to the headmaster's obvious disdain for the subject?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmith cockily added, \u201cBesides, I'm brilliant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other new staff member chose this moment to get invade his personal space, announcing her name, \u201cMartha Jones,\u201d while extending her hand.  She was not really a full staff member, but some sort of advanced apprentice that would be assisting Madam Pomfrey in some way.  The headmaster had been suitably vague.  This Jones was also a former colleague of Smith's.  Wait, Jones and Smith?  The headmaster was truly losing his touch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Severus was slow to take the lady's hand, Albus introduced his colleague, \u201cYes, and this is Prof. Severus Snape, Potions Master.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeverus did the gentlemanly thing and took the lady's hand, however his contact was brief, and he gave her a quick nod to acknowledge what the headmaster said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha's face lit with a broad smile as she repeated, \u201cPotions?\u201d  She really could not believe the place the Doctor landed them in this time.  Magic, of all things, and in England.  Oh, wait, Scotland.  In a real, fairy tale looking castle and he claimed that it was today.  Well, close enough in 1995.  It was within her lifetime.  And now the typical looking wizard, Dumbledore, claimed this dark looking bloke had something to do with potions. Potions.  How was she expected to keep a straight face during all this till the Doctor found the oddity that caused the time deviation in the area.   Might as well just chalk it up to magic and be on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure if this Jones was making fun of his subject, Severus merely replied, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d Smith added, also looking amused with a toothy grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Pomfrey joined their group and pleasantly added, \u201cAh, you've met Severus.  You'll learn more from him about the potions used in the infirmary, Madam Jones.  In addition to the ones used for more extreme cases that you will be seeing at St. Mungo's.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot madam,\u201d Martha corrected.  \u201cMartha's fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, Severus asked, \u201cShe will?\u201d  No one had informed him of tutoring an adult witch.  How convenient that he was the last to know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot madam?\u201d Albus repeated, ignoring Severus' question.  \u201cOur female staff that is not a professor is either a Mister or a Madam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about Miss Jones?\u201d Martha suggested.  The female staff was somewhat older than her and may get away with being addressed as madams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might confuse some and they might see you on the same level as a student ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am a student really.  Just an advanced student,\u201d Martha replied brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeverus felt a headache coming on.  A pushy, 'advanced' student who was a companion of someone who unashamedly introduced himself as 'brilliant'.  Was the Hogwarts castle big enough to contain two pairs of such nuisances? Hopefully, they'd soon come into conflict and spend the rest of Smith's tenure as Defense instructor trying to one-up each other on the quidditch pitch, and leave the rest of them alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">HP crossover with Doctor Who.  Specifically I am drawing upon new Doctor Who Season 3, Episodes 9 and 10: Human Nature and The Family of Blood as inspiration.  That's when the Doctor hides himself by becoming human.  His nature and memories are hidden, and only Martha knows that they are bound to a silver fob watch.  The Doctor, known as Mr. John Smith, is teaching at a boarding school in 1913.  Martha is employed as a housemaid by the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a doubt, I'm sure someone else has thought of this crossover possibility.  I am going to have to answer a couple of obvious questions during the course of the story, but what if the Doctor taught at Hogwarts?  Also, Martha would not be relegated to working as a housemaid based on race in the 1990s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I gave it even more thought and considered that a Doctor with his mental faculties intact would be immensely more fun.  He would need to duplicate magic effects for at least himself and maybe some for Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBTW, I love David Tennant as the Doctor, and I'm so old I used to watch the old series on television.  Locally in the US, we saw the Tom Baker episodes mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to be particularly annoying, how about Helen Cutter from Primeval as our villain?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisclaimers: These characters are not mine, and I make no money on using them.</td>",
