An eagle was flying his rounds, looking out for prey with his sharp eyes. There was a smaller bird a few hundred meters below him, chasing after a dragonfly. The mighty king of the sky started to circle around it, preparing to dive and attack the little creature. Just as he was about to strike however, he noticed something was glowing above -and came closer. He quickly dropped backwards, barely escaping a large fireball which was falling towards earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the burning object passed the eagle, the image of a young woman wearing white wings on her back was projected in his eyes for a second, before it slid past the mighty animal, going for collision course with the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, where would the falling Angel, Sarina, land?</span></div></div>",

He plugged in his earphones, turning on his MP3-player, the music muting the birds around him. He looked down the hill he had just drove up. Everywhere around him he saw green hills, overgrown by the forest, no signs of streets, cities or any kind of civilization in sight. Thinking about it, Alex had no idea how he had made his way from the town into this wilderness. He only remembered to nearly have crashed into a tree two times as he followed the narrow paths which were not made for cars - especially at the speed he was driving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he did not care. He was full of anger, and trying to calm down had not much success. \"Damn girls.\" he said to himself. \"Why do they always have to be so... sensitive? I mean, this woman's bosom was huge, even other women in the mall stared at her, and I was just looking at her for a second, was only taken a look out of curiosity, and Alice? Alice acts as if I had cheated her!\" He let out a heavy breath, turning up the volume of his MP3-player. Loud guitars and drums silenced the sounds of his environment, including a low, but rising noise from the sky as if something was falling towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe argument Alex had with his girlfriend had been very bad. She had started crying, saying he would not love her because of her small breasts - B-cups probably, he never asked - , while he had tried to calm her down since they were in public. In the end, they had both shouted at each other, and though he admitted to have said some stupid things - \"If you don't like your breasts, go and take surgery\" - , Alex didn't think it was his fault when she said \"It's over!\" and walked away crying while he took his car and drove off into the forest, to get some distance and calm down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill filled with anger and still not noticing noise which was loud enough to scare off the birds, he took out a packet of cigarettes and a lighter from his pocket. Actually, he had quit a few weeks ago - Alice wanted him to - but was always carrying a packet in case of emergency. Like this one. After taking out a smoke he hesitated for a moment, but then placed it in his mouth, turning on the lighter. Not even a sign from heaven would keep him from smoking that cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when his cigarette, his lighter and Alex himself were blasted away by a massive explosion right behind him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was blurry, everywhere was dust flying through the air. Slowly, Alex's vision began to sharpen, as well as his mind, trying to comprehend what had happened just now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he? After a while, he realized he was lying on the ground, face towards the ground, still inside the forest on the hills near the town. Why was he on the ground? Oh yeah, there was an explosion. Did his car blew up? Rolling on his back, he looked to his left. The red colour of his car was mainly covered by dirt and dust, but it looked like it was okay. When checking the status of his car, another question came into his mind: Was he injured? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, he moved his arms towards the sky, testing if they were okay. They didn't seem to be broken, only dirty like the rest of his body. Then, leaning on his arms, he raised his upper-body to examine his legs. As he looked at his dirty trousers, he noticed something ahead in the dust. When looking closer, he nearly fell back out of shock, his heart making a big leap. At first he thought to be imagining thing, still confused from the explosion. But as the dust fell, his eyes grew wider, not believing what they were looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen meters in front of him, a girl was laying on the ground. She was wearing a white dress, though it was very dirty now, which looked like those the Romans used to wear. Her long, gray hair was falling into her face. She wore no shoes, her skin being almost as white as her dress had probably been. But what really stunned him about her was that she seemed to be carrying something on her back, something big and white, somehow fluffy looking, resembling... wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Alex thought to be crazy, seeing an angel laying in front of him. Then he noticed white feathers were scattered around the girl. \"Could it be?\" he whispered. Looking around, he noticed nothing seemed to be broken by the explosion, only dust had been whirled up. He was curious, but at the same time scared. And in disbelief. An angel? Could this really be true? No, impossible. This was impossible. Still, he was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he managed to get to his feet. He really seemed not to be hurt, though he was send flying at least five meters. Carefully, he moved towards the girl, each step seeming to take an eternity. His heart was pounding. As he got closer, he was confessed the white things on her back were really wings, each one being at least the size of her body. Finally, he stood in front of her, his feet nearly touching her face. Alex waited for a moment, then knelt down, his head now inches away from hers. He reached out his hand - it was shaking. After hesitating one last time, he pulled her hair out of her face, fixing it behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's eyes were closed, she was probably unconscious. Her face didn't really look like he imagined it: Surely pretty, but not heavenly beautiful like to be expected it from an angel. He scratched his head, trying to put together what had just happened, when suddenly, she opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, Alex immediately fell back, his heart beating even faster now as he quickly crawled backwards. He was scared even more when he noticed her eyes were different coloured, her left one being red while the other one was blue. He tried to calm down, which ultimately failed as he saw her hair colour was getting lighter, until becoming completely white. No doubt about it now: This was not an ordinary person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Alex noticed something as he looked at her face again: She was scared. Biting her lips, she looked at him as if he was a lion and she a wounded animal. He put together all his courage, opening his mouth: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry, I-I w-won't h-harm you.\" He actually wanted to calm her down like a father, but if his words really eased her fear, then only because she knew now he was at least as scared as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence. The birds had not returned yet, no wind seemed to be blowing. Sweat was dropping from Alex' face. His heart was not racing anymore; actually, it felt like it was not beating at all. No one of them did or say anything. They just looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a breeze came up, blowing leaves off the trees. He could hear a bird chirping in the distance. The angel or whatever she was rose her head slightly. Alex swallowed. \"Um...\" He felt like he had to say something, but didn't know what. Finally, at the risk of saying something wrong, he just spoke out what he was wondering about the whole time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you an... angel?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex' heart nearly dropped. Her voice was... strangely normal. If you took out the wings, the strange eyes and colour-changing hair, this could just be an ordinary person. But she was an angel, she had said she was and he believed her. There were truly strange things in the world, which led to his next question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have... have you fallen... have you fallen from the sky?\" he asked. A pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she finally answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause. \"I...\" She was lowering her head, looking at the soil. \"I...\" Her hair started to get darker, over dim grey to completely black. Shortly after, he could hear her sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-never mind!\" he quickly said, thinking about something else to ask. \"Um... A - are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed her tears, nodding slightly. Alex, still sitting on the ground, got back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I bring you to a hospital?\" he offered, noticing he wasn't stuttering anymore. The angel's arm moved to her face, wiping the tears from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She paused, not looking at him. \"Well, I... my injuries... they... they will heal up themselves, but... it may need a few days, so...\" Her hair was turning white again. \"If... if you would... it would be nice if you could... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a place to rest, huh?\" he finished the sentence for her. She nodded, looking nervously into his eyes. Alex scratched his head. What should he do now? Find a hotel for her? But if she was injured, he couldn't leave her alone. Maybe he should take her to a hospital... on the other hand though, hospitals were expansive, and if she really healed up by herself, it was a waste of money - probably his money, as he couldn't imagine an angel to carry money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he made up his mind: \"Okay, you can stay at my place for a few weeks if you like. But I'll warn you: My apartment's tiny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile came into the angel's face. \"Thanks.\" she said. Her hair was changing colour again, this time turning blond. Blushing, Alex looked away. Now she really looked like an angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can you stand up?\" he quickly asked. She looked down at herself, her hair becoming brown now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... afraid I can't... not by myself\" Alex walked over to her, trying to help her up, but her wings were too heavy. \"Wait.\" She moved her arm towards her chest, pressing her thumb against it. Her wings started to glow, like they were made out of light, then vanished inside her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got on her feet, he put an arm under her shoulder, leading her to his car. \"I'm Sarina.\" she suddenly said. He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex.\" he said \"Nice to meet you!\" She smiled back at him, her hair turning blond again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he was angry and in a rush, it took only an hour to get from the city to the hills. Now as Alex was carrying someone injured, it took two hours before he even was back on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther cars constantly passed him as he was driving with minimal speed, cautious not to hit any bumps. When not watching the traffic he was glancing towards his co-driver: Sarina was sleeping peacefully, her head resting on her shoulder. Her hair had turned gray again, just like when he found her. He figured her hair-colour was somehow depending on her inner status: It had turned dark when she started crying, so black probably represented sadness. Whenever it was white she seemed to be scared - just like people loosing their colour when facing something really scary. Blond - well, pretty obvious: Blond was happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't place brown though: She had turned into a brunette without displaying any strong emotions. 'Maybe brown is neutral.' he thought. Gray seemed to be the her \"inactive\" colour, when she was sleeping or unconscious. He wondered what other colours her hair could take. Did they turn red when she was angry? And could they get unnatural hair colours, like blue or purple? Maybe it turned green when she was jealous? But then again, could an angel even feel envy? It seemed they could be scared though, so why not envious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then, for a moment, thought about how weird he was acting, if not even wrong: An angel had fallen from the sky, landing right behind him, asked to stay at his home and what was he doing? Thinking about her hair-colour. There were definitely more important things to ask himself. For example: Why had she even fallen from the sky? Maybe she had broken a law. Was she a criminal? Had she even killed another angel?? Was he driving a murderer??? For a second, he believed to may have made the biggest mistake in his entire life, helping an over-natural being which may intent to take over the world. But when he asked her about it, she had started to cry, and the tears seemed to be real(he was kind of experienced, Alice often faked tears). Would an evil world conqueror really start to cry in this situation? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late afternoon when he saw the city appearing on the horizon. He accelerated, careful not to wake Sarina up. Thinking about it now, she didn't look like she was injured. She seemed exhausted and was dirty, but she had no open wounds, no stains of blood or anything. But then again, she was an angel: Just because he couldn't see any wounds didn't mean there were none, not to forget she could have internal bleeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed the city limits, the sign greeting \"Welcome to Univer City\", and headed towards the inner city. Alex got nervous: He didn't want to wake Sarina up. Luckily, as he turned off into his home street, he could see from the corner of his eyes her hair was starting to turn brown . As he stopped the car, she opened her bi-coloured eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have we arrived?\" she asked, looking out of the window. Her eyes opened wide as she looked at the sky-scrapes around them. \"Wow.\" she whispered, her hair becoming dark blond. Alex figured this was the first time she saw a city. He left the car, then helped her getting out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk alone?\" he asked. She nodded, still watching her surroundings in awe. \"I still would prefer to help you up until we are in my apartment. I live on the third floor, and the lift is broken, so we have to take some steps.\" She just nodded again, appearing more like a little girl than a being from heaven. Another thought suddenly came into his mind: What if this explosion had damaged his mind, and he had just imagined everything? Nervously, he looked around. The people on the streets were turning their heads in his direction, but he calmed down: He could hear whispers like \"What is this for a dress?\" or \"Mommy, why is this girl wearing no shoes?\" Relieved he was not hallucinating, he took the overwhelmed angel by her arm and carefully led her to his flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: Okay, long setup, time to get the breast expansion in. The only question is: How?</span></div></div>",

Her hair still being dark blond, she was impressed by everything she saw, no matter how vulgar and ordinary it seemed to Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his keys out of his trousers, trying them at the lock. After two failures, the third key vanished inside the lock. He turned it around. 'Click' - the door opened. He led Sarina into his apartment, closing the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nothing special, but it was his home: A living room including a kitchen, a small bathroom with a shower, and a bedroom where also his computer was located. His TV wasn't big, but also not small; his couch not luxurious, but comfortable; his home, in one word, average. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are.\" he introduced her. \"Make yourself feel comfortable. It's nothing special, but ...\" Suddenly, something hit his head, making him fall to the side. Stumbling, he grabbed the closest chair, trying to return his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex rubbed his forehead. \"Ouch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry!\" Sarina apologized, turning towards him. He heard something falling down, then crashing on the floor. As he looked at her, two questions he had asked himself were answered: First if Sarina's hair could take unusual colours - it had turned pink - and second, what had knocked him off: Coming out of her back, Sarina's wings nearly reached from one to the other side of the room. Behind her, he could see his favorite vase on the floor, broken to pieces, the flowers resting in a puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry...\" Sarina repeated. Her blush got stronger, her hair turning deep pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.\" he sighed, getting back on his feet. \"But why did you bring out your wings? Do you want to fly away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! My body is in a too bad shape for that! I can't probably fly for at least a week. It's just... you said I should make myself feel comfortable, and walking around without wings feels so... awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did say that, and could imagine it must be uncomfortable for her not to have her wings spread out. If, for example, he walked around with no arms, it would definitely feel unfamiliar to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he said \"just be careful.\" She nodded, pulling in her wings a bit. \"By the way, what's with your hair?\" he asked, noticing it was turning brown again. A confused expression on her face, she looked at the hair falling down her shoulders, then gave him a puzzled look. \"I mean, why does it change colours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She looked quite surprised. \"Now that you mention it... I didn't notice yet your hair always keeps it's colour. Is this normal for humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean...\" Her hair lightened up. \"Does this mean humans... are emotionless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Alex refused \"No! Our hair just doesn't change with our emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How's that possible?\" she asked, her hair turning brown again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's normal for us. Do all of you angels have this... \"mood hair\"?\" She nodded. \"Thought so. Well, I figured white was for fear, blond happiness, and gray when you're sleeping or unconscious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sarina interrupted, looking surprised. \"I never knew it turned gray when I'm asleep... yes, you're right. Whenever I am in any kind of good mood, my hair turns blond; when I am worried, scared or nervous, it becomes white. If I'm sad or in any other bad mood, it gets dark, and when I'm embarrassed... well, it turns pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about brown? I couldn't figure any emotion when it's brown, like now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The colour changes are different for each angel. Besides our mood colours, everyone of us has her own hair colour which we turn to when feeling no or only weak emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, actually, you are a brunette?\" She nodded. He too a look at her figure, not skinny but slightly slim. \"By the way, are you hungry?\" A thought crossed his mind. \"I mean, um, ... do angels eat?\" She giggled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, we do. Actually, we are mostly usual life forms, needing to sleep, eat, drink...\" Suddenly, a loud rumbling echoed through the room, it's origin coming from Sarina's belly. Again, her hair turned pink. \"And yes, I am hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex couldn't resist to smirk. \"Okay, I'll drive over to the mall. You can serve yourself anything from the kitchen meanwhile. Is there anything special you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a finger on her chin, her hair turning back again. \"I'm not very familiar with human food. I usually only eat raw fruits and vegetables.\" A vegetarian. He could have figured that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then I'll bring you some carrots, tomatoes and asparagus. As for fruits, there is a basket in the kitchen.\" Alex pointed towards his small, round kitchen table. \"I'll be back in about an hour. Just be careful not to break anything.\" She nodded, blushing slightly with her hair. Smiling, he waved her good-bye and left. When he closed the door behind him though, Alex wondered if it really was a good idea to leave his angel-friend alone in his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Alex had left, Sarina wandered around the apartment, cautious not to touch anything with her wings. Everything in this world was so different and strange for her! She had read a few books about earth, but in real, it all seemed so... well, real. 'What a strange world' she thought 'What a strange world indeed!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach then reminded her how empty it was. She walked over to the kitchen, taking a look at the fruit basket with her two-coloured eyes. There were bananas, grapes and other fruits inside, but one caught her attention: A big, red apple was resting between the other fruits, presenting itself to her. It's peel was shining, as if it wanted to say: \"I taste delicious! Eat me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated. Not because she didn't like red apples, she had just never eaten one before. She had eaten green and yellow apples, but never red ones. She had not been allowed to. There was a strong belief in symbolism where she came from, and red apples were symbols for seduction and temptation, crimes in her world. Though there were red apple trees in her home which they couldn't bring down as Angels were forbidden to kill - which was why nothing was damaged when she landed on earth except for her - , but she was forced not to eat them. She had often stared upon them, watching the flowers grow into fruits; then fall to the ground, rotting as no one picked them up. Now, there was one before her, not rotten. And there was nobody telling her not to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled. Should she do it? She was banned from heaven after all, theoretically free from it's rules. But then, she was still an angel. The elders had always warned bad things would happen when angels went against heaven's rules. Her worries made her hair turn white. She turned her eyes off the fruit, looking if something else was in the kitchen. On a bench near the refrigerator, there was a glass full of a white liquid next to an empty bottle displaying the image of a cow. This had to be milk. Milk was also very symbolic in heaven's teachings: It represented prosperity alongside honey, making it very valuable. No angel who possessed milk drank it as it was too precious to simply be consumed. She had never seen it before. She had read somewhere though milk was an ordinary drink on earth as humans could easily drain it from cows. In heaven, this was much more difficult as angels did only milk cows when those agreed, and cows were quite stubborn animals. Here, however, she could probably drink as much milk as she wanted... or eat as many apples as she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and helpless, she stared at both items in the kitchen, her red eye reflecting the apple in the basket while the blue one mirrored the full glass and empty bottle of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, she would break one of heaven's conventions - but which one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(NOTE: In both cases, of course, her breasts should expand^^)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarina debated with herself for several minutes regarding the apple, becoming so engrossed in her moral dilemma that she forgot that there was food anywhere else in the kitchen. Her hunger pains were winning out over her fears, and her white hair slowly gained a violet tint out of concern for herself. Her hair reminded her that not everything was quite the same in Heaven; if that applied to the people there, might it also apply to the foods?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her stomach growled again, this time accompanied by some pain, Sarina leaned on that justification and grabbed the apple. She hesitated one more moment, staring at the rich red color of the fruit, before biting into it. Her hair, which had been completely purple out of worry, suddenly turned fully blonde as she tasted the apple. It was just as delicious as any other apple; no, it was more so! She tried to chew it slowly, to savor its flavor, but the taste and her hunger forced her to devour it, leaving only the barest hint of core remaining. Bizarre, pleasurable sensations shot throughout her body, tantalizing her senses. The feelings continued to grow stronger, forcing Sarina to sit down as streaks of violet appeared in her blonde hair. It felt so good, but the intensity of these entirely foreign feelings troubled her. The sensations grew stronger, centering in her chest. Her head lolled back as she let out a soft, sweet moan of pleasure, confused as to what the sound was and what it meant. She had never moaned from pleasure before, so the cause-and-effect relationship did not immediately dawn on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina felt her dress rubbing against her chest, and she smoothed it out before fluffing it. It rubbed against her chest again, and when she lowered her hands, they brushed across lumps of flesh. Her palms brushed over her nipples, causing them to harden while pleasure shot through her body. Sarina sat bolt upright, staring down at her swelling breasts, the nipples lancing through the fabric of her dress. They continued to swell, her sensitive nipples rubbing against her dress and pleasuring her, her dress riding further up her calves as her growing breasts demanded more fabric to cover them. They had already passed D-cups in size, and were only now showing signs of slowing. When the growth finally stopped, Sarina decided to hazard touching one of her nipples. The sensation felt good, so she began to rub it. Immediately, she became rigid, squealing with pleasure as she rubbed her thighs together; all of these sensations were completely new to her, and she began to feel a moistness between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world?\" Sarina asked aloud, before clapping her hands over her mouth and squeaking in surprise. Her voice had sounded...different. \"Um, Our Father, who art in Heaven...\" Sure enough, her voice was different. It was slightly lower, and possessed of a more...seductive tone. Using the shiny plastic of a nearby object (actually a TV remote, but how would she know that?) as a mirror, Sarina noticed that her lips had become slightly fuller, and the angles of her face had slightly sharpened in some places and softened in others, resulting in an overall sexier, more tempting look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Heaven happened to me...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though drinking milk was seen as a waste in her home, it wasn't a crime. Sarina walked past the kitchen table, her red eye glancing one last time at the forbidden fruit, before she turned her head towards the glass of milk. \"Bio milk - 100% natural, from happy cows\" was written on the empty bottle next to it. Slowly, she reached out her hand, her hair still being white. The thought of actually drinking milk made her nervous - milk was of equal value in her world to that of gold on earth. No, even higher: Honey was equal to gold, drops of milk were like diamonds. Most angels never even saw a drop of milk in their entire life while a glass full it was now directly in front of Sarina. If she returned home with this, she would probably be the richest person in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand was still hanging in the air, shaking nervously. Sarina touched the glass with her fingertips. It was cool. Carefully, she pulled her hand forward, grabbing it. The glass set off from the bench, slowly moving towards her mouth. Finally, it touched her lips. She lifted the glass a bit, letting a small amount of milk flow into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair immediately became blond as the liquid touched her tongue. A small smile grew on her face as she swallowed down the milk, enjoying every single gulp. She didn't take off the glass before the last drop was inside her mouth, holding it above her head at the end. She finally put it on back on the bench, leaving nothing but air inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhhh, that was delicious.\" the girl from heaven declared, licking her lips. A grumbling in her belly reminded her though milk may be tasty, but was not useful to still hunger. She struggled again with eating the apple when suddenly, a strange feeling came over her. 'Must be because of the collision.' she thought, her hair turning back again. She put a hand on her forehead, staring at the floor. Her eyes grew wide as she looked down her body. It almost seemed as if her chest was... growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her bi-coloured eyes, she thought she was imagining things. But now she could also feel her nipples pushing against her loose dress. Her hair turned white. Sarina watched in fear and confusion as her flat chest turned into a pair of small breasts! Those continued to inflate, smoothing her wrinkled dress as they gained volume, taking up space in her clothing. Starting to panic, Sarina grabbed her breasts, trying to push them back inside her body. Instead, her white flesh orbs started to form a small amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" she shrieked. Her bosom continued to curve out, lifting up her skirt slightly since it needed more fabric. Her cleavage grew larger, first being just a small crate. Slowly, the gap grew deeper, exposing more flesh as her breasts pressed against each other in her meanwhile top-tight dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt rose higher, her cleavage grew deeper, and her breasts expanded further. Meanwhile, her chest started to show itself not at only at her front, but also on the sides of her dress. Helpless, she took a look at her shadow. Her chest stood out at least 10 inches from her figure, and it seemed to be an accurate image of her. She turned her gaze towards her cleavage which was at the height of her nipples by now, each of her breasts being as big as a football. Her skirt was covering her right knee, but as it was uneven, showed some of her left thigh, it's white skin shining brightly. \"I should have known!\" she screamed hysterically, groping her breasts. \"I shouldn't have drunken the milk! I'm sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stopped. All of a sudden, her breasts had stopped growing. Confused, but grateful, Sarina wondered if this was because of her apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it'll turn back now.\" she hoped, waiting a few moments. Nothing happened. \"Or maybe the milk was bad and I am only hallucinating.\" She started to rub her breasts, praying they would vanish if she only wished so. Instead, she was tickling herself. She pulled her hands away, but then back on her chest again in hope she would get back to normal if she continued this long enough. After a while though, the ticklish feeling forced her to close her eyes. Unintentionally, Sarina let out a slight moan. Her nipples erected, starting to poke through her dress. As she accidentally touched one, she fell a chill going down her spine, and her nipples immediately grew larger. Coming back to senses, she quickly pulled off her hands, opening her two eyes while her hair turned pink. Slowly, the fallen angel began to realize this was real, and that she was stuck with her new figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina felt like she was going to cry. She wanted to scream towards the sky, yell to the heaven. Was it not enough for her to be baned? Was she not punished enough? Did this day really had to get even worse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, her hair was getting white again as a strange sensation suddenly hit her chest.</span></div></div>",

Not again!\u201d The fallen angel watched in panic as her breasts bulged out again, growing rounder. But as the feeling grew stronger, she found to her surprise it was different from before: Not only the growth was way slower, for the eye only barely visible, it felt this time as if her large breasts were filling up with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, after a while Sarina did recognize a pressure in her chest, and it was increasing by the second. Also, her breasts weren\u2019t getting bigger anymore. Scared, but also curious, Sarina carefully slipped a hand beneath her toga. Touching herself, she found her sensitivity had increased once more, sending a warm pleasure through her  - for a moment, her hair turned from white to red. But she quickly regained her senses, shaking off the pleasure while her hair turned brown. \u201cStay calm, Sarina!\u201d, she commanded herself \u201cYou are still an angel!\u201d Her hand on her breast, Sarina felt her massive orbs had become a lot more buxom than directly after her growth. Staring down, she also noticed with a blush her nipples were slightly larger than before, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith reserve, she groped her breast slightly to test its firmness. Suddenly, her nipple grew even bigger as Sarina pressed something fluid out of her them, wetting the fabric of her toga. Shrieking, Sarina immediately pulled her arm out, her hair turning white from the shock. From the wet spot of her dress, a white liquid began to drop down on the floor. A bit unsure, Sarina took one drop on her finger, examining it. She could tell by looking at it already, and when she smelled at her finger, there was no doubt left for her: This was milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope began to rise in Sarina: If this was the milk she had drunken, maybe she would shrink back when she pressed it out of her breasts\u2026 A smile formed on Sarina\u2019s face, her hair turning blond out of excitement. Quickly her arms slipped out of her dress, which slid down then and  revealed her bare breasts. She then looked out for the glass she had drunken the milk from. Positioning herself so her breasts were above it, she grabbed her massive milk jugs, small waves of pleasure surging through her, while pointing her nipples at the glass. Then, she pressed the milk out of her body, watching happily as the white liquid dropped from her nipples. To her dismay though, she found it was going rather slowly: After ten seconds, not even the bottom of the glass had filled. Some of the milk landed on the bench, but still, Sarina found this could go a bit faster\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the fallen angel remembered to have read once human farmers massage the utters of their cows to get more milk out of them. \u201cMaybe I should massage my breasts, too\u201d, she thought aloud. With cautious motions and pink hair, Sarina began to fondle her breasts. Her firm breast flesh only hardly moved under her hands, so she pressed with stronger force. Under the constant kneading, her breasts eventually grew softer, Sarina\u2019s fingers smoothly plowing through her breasts. She then had to tremble as numerous sensations hit her body, her hair turning from pink to a more reddish tone. Feeling a rising pressure in her chest, Sarina happily recognized then her plan was working out: With growing force, streams of milk began to flow out from her breasts, until the milk was practically shot out from her nipples. She stopped her massage, her hair turning blond as she watched with a smile the glass filling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, her hair turned white again: Even when the glass was almost full, the stream of milk didn\u2019t grow weaker. Also, though her breasts were a bit smaller than before, it didn\u2019t really seem as if they were shrinking. When the milk swam over the glass and the stream was still not coming to an end, Sarina began to panic: Stepping back, the milk mercilessly shot out from her body as she helplessly stumbled around. Her wings then slid over the kitchen table, wiping off the fruit basket. Gasping, Sarina turned around, spraying the milk over the entire kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d, she screamed, putting her hands on her nipples. She quickly put them off though as the milk now splashed around in drops, most of them hitting herself. Resigned and drenched in milk, she let herself fall on her butt. With bleak hair, she watched from the floor as the milk spilled throughout the entire kitchen, unable to do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, and much to her relief, Sarina felt the streams lost force. The straight lines turned into curves, growing weaker until nothing was left but a few drops falling from her nipples. Sarina sighed, but her hair had no chance to regain its colour as she looked at what she had done:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shelves, the table, the floor - everything was covered in milk. It dropped from wherever it could, the puddle slowly making its way towards the living room area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! Did all of that come from ME?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina felt hopeless: She had just ruined the home of Alex, the human who had saved her. He would definitely throw her out once he saw this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, she had no choice but clean up this mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she had once read humans had developed various items to help cleaning their houses. Heaven was a bit off in that category: Their teachings stated everything had a reason for being where it was, including dirt. As such, the homes of most angels - including her own - were very untidy. It was rather embarrassing as most humans imagined heaven to be a shining, perfectly clean palace for the purest souls in the entire universe, not a catch basin for mudlarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina remembered humans tended to store there cleaning stuff in small, separate rooms. Slowly, the fallen angel stood up, moving carefully due to the bare, massive endowments she carried. Back on her feet, she pulled her dress back over them, then drenched the milk out of her hair - since she had relaxed a bit, it was turning brown again. Looking around, Sarina found a door in the kitchen that seemed rather promising. She made a step towards it, but immediately stumbled forward as her breasts were throwing her off balance. She managed to remain on her feet by flailing her arms, causing a small earthquake on her chest. \"Okay guys, it would be nice if you cooperated with me\", Sarina demanded, throwing a strict glance down herself. It still felt awkward when she saw two large orbs of flesh instead of her feet. With cautious movements, Sarina walked towards the door. She used her wings as a counter weight to her breasts, keeping her body in balance. Each step caused her humongous bosom to wobble, a slight blush mixing into Sarina\u2019s hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the effects of gravity on her body, Sarina suddenly slipped while walking over the milk, making her fall backwards. Knowing she would be helpless like a turtle when lying on her back, she quickly grabbed the kitchen table. Her butt hid the ground, the impact unleashing the full jiggle potential of her body. Luckily, she managed to hold onto the table. With a sigh of relief, Sarina got back on her feet, though she almost fell again as the floor was spilled with milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing her way, another worry hit her as the milk dropped from her skirt: What should she do about her clothes? She only had this dress, so what should she wear while washing it? After all, she couldn't run around in milk-drenched clothes. \"I should focus on cleaning the kitchen for now \", she eventually decided, saving her other problems for later(including a plausible explanation to Alex).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Sarina reached the door. \"All right, I just have to find everything I need and clean up this mess!\" Hope returned to the fallen angel, her hair taking on a blond tone as she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt quickly turned back though when she had to avoid an avalanche of brooms, mobs and bottles coming from the closet. Staring at the pile of cleaning items, she tried to find out which of those she needed to clean up the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... might take longer than I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ __<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex entered the building, carrying a bag full of vegetables and fruits in his arms. It was already past six - he had spent nearly an entire hour buying food. Since he didn't know much about vegetables, the saleswoman had to advice him. She turned out though to be a chatterbox, giving him all kind of information on every single plant, even where they were grown and what vitamins were inside. Alex had ended up with buying a few from everything - he would see what Sarina liked or disliked, and consider it next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he automatically walked towards the lift, until he remembered it was broken. Cursing, he began to go up the stairs, wishing he had bought a flat on the first floor. As he climbed up the way to his home, Alex wondered what Sarina had done during his absence. His apartment wasn't very big, containing a living room and kitchen, bedroom, bathroom \u2013 that last thought made him wonder if angels had to go to the toilet. Sarina had said they had to drink and eat, so it was plausible they also needed to let out what they consumed. Anyway, she had probably discovered everything in his flat after ten minutes, so what had she done after? 'Hopefully she didn't break anything else', he thought, but quickly dropped the idea. It didn\u2019t seem like Sarina was the clumsy or problematic type. He guessed she had probably sat down at the window and watched the street, maybe eating an apple from time to time while patiently awaiting his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the last steps, Alex reached his floor, exhausted from the climb. Panting, he put his bag on the floor, pulling his keys out of his trousers. \"Everything will be like when I left\", he assured himself, unlocking the door. As he entered, his apartment was...</span></div></div>",

As he stepped onto his floor, carrying his groceries in his arms, everything looked just like how he left it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t notice the baskets were filled with milk-soaked handkerchiefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back\", he said, closing the door behind him. There was no response. \"Sarina?\" Alex walked into his apartment, looking for his heavenly guest. As he put his bag on the kitchen table, his nose caught a small scent of milk. He then remembered to have put a glass of milk on the counter, and thought that was the cause. Indeed, a glass of milk was still standing on the counter - he didn\u2019t know though it wasn\u2019t the milk he had filled into it. \"Hello? Sarina?\", he called into the room again. He was about to worry when suddenly, a head poked out behind the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back\", Sarina greeted him. She was smiling, but her hair wasn't blond - instead, her brown streaks seemed to have a slightly white undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked at her in surprise. \"Sarina, why are you hiding behind the sofa?\" Before she could answer though, his cell phone began to rang. \"Excuse me for a moment.\", he said, turning his back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at the number, he saw it was his girlfriend, Alice(see first chapter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately he answered the call. \"Alice, I'm so sorry for before! I didn't want to hurt you!... What?!... No, I don't wanna break up with you!... Alice, darling, you are beautiful, really, I swear... Huh? You wanna come over and talk?... Um, can\u2019t that wait a bit? I have a guest here right now... No, of course I love you, but... yeah... yeah... right... Okay, if you insist. Where are you right now?... Fine, see you in ten minutes, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up his phone, sighing. \"Was that a 'telephone call'?\", Sarina asked, having never seen a mobile phone in her life before. Alex nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my girlfriend, Alice. She'll be here in a moment.\" He turned around, seeing she was still hiding behind the sofa. \"Sarina, could you do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you act like you were a relative of me? Alice and I had a pretty bad argument today, and I don't want to give her the slightest hint to have met another woman behind her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I love her!\" He put his hand on his face. \"I mean, it was such a stupid argument! She caught me when I stared at a woman with massive hoot\u2026 um, I mean with a large chest. We started to shout at each other, and now she thinks I prefer big-breasted bimbos over her! I really love Alice, but why has she to be so sensitive? Okay, I said some mean things, but... Sarina, are you all right?\" During his talk, it seemed like her hair had gotten bleaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you had an argument with your girlfriend over the size of her chest?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now she believes you would rather have a girlfriend that was a bit... bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, we have a problem.\" Slowly, Sarina came out of her hideout. Her legs trembled as she tried to stand, while her torso bend forward. With some effort, she managed to straighten her back, looking nervously at Alex as she showed him her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cell phone fell on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his jaw, Alex\u2019s eyes shot wide open as he stared at Sarina\u2019s enormous bosom. Her dress was lying tightly around it, showing off a deep V-neck while leaving the sides of her breasts uncovered. They must have been as big as cantaloupes, probably even bigger, making the woman from the mall look average. And Alice, in comparison\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shook his head, thinking to be hallucinating. But now matter how often he looked, her breasts remained huge. \u201cWHAT THE FUCK?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina\u2019s hair turned bright pink. She put her hands over her eyes, not daring to look in Alex face. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry! I know I shouldn\u2019t have drunken the milk, but\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilk? What are you talking about?! What happened to you?!? Wait, you can explain me later, just get normal again, quick!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d, she screamed. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to pull them back inside me, just like my wings, but it doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Both of them were driving into a hysteria. \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs if I knew! Alice mustn\u2019t see you like this! She wouldn\u2019t even believe me if I told her you were an angel, but that your chest just grew while I was shopping is just ridiculous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the truth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just like the earth being a globe, but no one believed it until Columbus sailed around it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina looked at him in confusion. \u201cDoes that mean that Alice will have to\u2026 sail around my breasts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex started to walk in circles, trying to think of what to do. He was constantly getting distracted though by Sarina\u2019s massive endowments, occasionally peeking at them. Not only were they huge, they also looked appealingly firm and spherical, creating a full cleavage in her revealing dress. Also, they were neither saggy like an old woman\u2019s bosom, nor overly pointy like artificial breasts tended to be \u2013 despite their enormous size, they appeared to be natural, and in their best years. \u201cCould you stop that?\u201d, he asked into the room after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing where he was staring, Sarina gave him a puzzled look. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have nearly answered \u2018looking so hot and sexy\u2019 when the door suddenly rang.

The chamber was even more narrow than it had looked earlier.

She was wearing a blue mini-skirt, a jeans jacket and a yellow T-shirt beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his dismay, she seemed rather angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even greet her, Alice forced herself past him, entering his apartment. \u201cYou just talked to somebody?\u201d, she casually asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex closed the door, noticing his hands were slightly shaking. \u201cOf course not\u201d, he lied. \u201cI just talked to myself a bit.\u201d Snorting, Alice looked around the room, Alex nervously watching her.

Her hair changed to a blond color as she began to smile, feeling a tear in her own eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her breasts slipping out of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful not to make a sound Alice straightened up again, her back aching under the tremendous weight of her bosom. The closet was so narrow she couldn\u2019t even move her arms properly, forcing the fallen angel into a quite uncomfortable pose. She tried to listen what was going om outside, but it seemed the two were still kissing each other.

If he could only stall some time to think, find something that would calm her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze then landed on the glass of milk standing in his kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, would you like some milk?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, who already had the doorknob in her hand, stopped. \"Milk?\", she repeated, looking back into the kitchen. There was actually a glass full of creamy, thick milk standing on the counter, the kind she loved most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to understand how milk could have brought a woman to forget that her partner is possibly cheating on her, one has first to understand the special relationship between Alice and milk: When she was a baby, her mother couldn't produce milk for her, so she had to complement her diet with dried milk products. This lead to a halting aversion of Alice against any kind of milk products up to her sixteenth year of age. It was then on a birthday party when she came first  into contact with real milk: During a \"truth or dare\", one of her tasks was to drink a full bottle of milk as her friends knew how much she hated it. After some hesitation however she managed to easily gulp down the entire milk to every ones' surprise (including her own). Since then, she had developed somewhat of a milk obsession, and dairy products had become the major part of her diet. During their argument, Alex even had tried to calm her with milk, though she was so angry back then, not even that had worked. But now\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice tapped her fingers on the doorknob, glancing at the milk. Seeing the desire in her eyes, Alex knew this was his chance. \"Look, the sneeze probably came from the guy next door. He is a nightguard, and easily catches a cold. But in the closet... I'm storing your birthday present, okay? And it would be really sad if you spoiled the surprise now just because of such a stupid suspicion. So please, Alice: step away from the closet, drink some milk, and then calm down inside my arms. You know the only person I love is you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned her head towards the door once more. \"You promise me there is nobody in this closet?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex warmly smiled at her. \"I promise there is no woman in this closet I cheated you with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stared at the ground for a moment. \"Okay, I believe you\", she finally said, grinning at her boyfriend. \"Now give me this milk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina meanwhile had listened to the entire conversation, her hair turning bleak from shock. 'No!', the angel thought in panic. 'This is my milk!... I mean the milk from my body!... I mean if normal cow milk does have that effect on an angel, god knows what's gonna happen if a human drinks angel milk!' Pressing her ear against the door she heard Alice walking over to the kitchen, thanking Alex as he gave her the glass. He had told Sarina to stay inside the closet, but...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having drunken half of the glass Alice spurted the milk in her mouth out, looking with big eyes at the woman that had come out of the closet. Not her white hair was what startled Alice most, and neither were her bi-coloured eyes or even the strange dress the woman wore. The only things Alice noticed were the two large lumps of flesh hanging from her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex face was just as pale as the angel's hair. \"Sarina!\", he said with a hoarse voice. \"Why did you-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asshole!\" Shaking from rage Alice slammed her glass on the ground. The splitters flew through the entire apartment, while the milk spread all over the floor beneath Alice. \"You stupid, perverted asshole!\u201c, she screamed with tears in her eyes. \u201cHow long are you cheating on me already? ! Or did you just pick up the woman with the largest breasts you could find after our fight? You're really-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alice\u2019s stomach began to rumble. \"Wh-what's that?\", she asked, holding her belly. Bubbles seemed to form inside it, and it felt like they were spreading through her entire body. A horrible thought then crossed Alice\u2019s mind. \"Did you poison the milk, Alex? Do you want to kill me because of that slut?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous!\", Alex shouted. He tried to hold his girlfriend, but Alice pushed him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t touch me, you filthy swine!\", she yelled, pointing at Sarina. \"Tell me, who is tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turmoil in her belly grew louder, Alice feeling like she was about to puke. She tightened the grip on her stomach, while an electric tingle went through all of her nerves. Afraid she would die any moment Alice screamed in horror, nearly fainting from the sensations that took over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Screeching like a siren the young woman felt like she was pierced with a thousand needles. She waggled around in Alex\u2019s arms, her whole body steadily growing numb to any feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for one part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly Alice turned silent, feeling a sting in her chest \u2013 not a painful one, but a very intense. Her breathing grew harder, sounding like she was about to bear a child. Worried to death Alex took her hand. Alice mindlessly grabbed it, holding tight on the person she had just called an asshole. Throwing her head into her neck Alice then let out one more scream, the sting in her chest turning into a tingling sensation. Slowly, Alice felt it spread out around her small breasts, reaching out from her body, while at the same time a rising weight seemed to be loaded onto her chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while before she realised what this meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelieving Alice looked down on herself. Her chest was going up and down from her panting, which got even faster once her eyes confirmed what her body had felt: Beneath her clothes, she could see two bumps forming inside her jeans jacket, slowly ascending from her body. With wide, frightened eyes Alice watched her zipper go down, steadily revealing her yellow T-shirt. The few wrinkles her clothes possessed were quickly pressed even by her swelling breasts, while at the same they were pulling her shirt up. Inside it, a increasing area of her chest began to rise up, the flesh quickly overflowing her brassier. Bit by bit her bloating mounds grew closer to one another, pushing up her clothes as they curved out. Her zipper meanwhile was resting on the top of her bosom, rising alongside Alice\u2019s bustline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex openly stared at his girlfriend\u2019s growing breasts, his expression a mixture of shock and embarrassment. He looked over at Sarina who was making the same face, plus her hair was a mixture of pink of white, a light pink. He immediately looked back at the woman in his arms though when he heard her scream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, are you all right?\u201d, he asked. \u201cI mean, aside from, you know \u2013 Alice, do you hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrengthening the grip on his hand Alice began to make some husky sounds. With a frightening accuracy she could feel the gap between her grapefruits was closing, until the twin orbs finally touched each other. Her bra didn\u2019t cup her assets anymore, so her full domes pressed unhindered against each other, the contacting skin sparkling with ticklish prickles. Growing more intense by the second the feeling lured a moan out of Alice, and soon another one. It wasn\u2019t a painful sound, but one of the kind that made her boyfriend all jittery every time he heard it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to keep up anymore her zipper rolled down the descent of her breasts, which allowed them to push away her jacket. With only her tight T-shirt to cover them one could clearly see the firm roundings of her new curves, the stout spheres growing off from her torso as they gained the size of small pumpkins. Another loud moan then shot out of Alice, while at the same time a loud snap let her breasts surge slightly forward, adding a little bounce to them. Now that her bra was gone it seemed like her breasts were expanding at a faster pace. The sound of tearing seams could be heard from the smooth fabric of her shirt whenever it wasn\u2019t drowned by the increasingly sensual moans of Alice. Alex knew she was in pain and really did feel sorry for her, but couldn\u2019t completely deny this was turning him in a strange way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder loud ripping Alice\u2019s breasts finally tore her shirt apart. The strained fabric gladly slid over her bosom\u2019s roundings, until it looked like Swiss cheese was covering her bosom. Luckily, a few threads still held on, so Alice wasn\u2019t completely bare-breasted. Also, as her breasts weren\u2019t packed that tight into her shirt anymore, the sensation it had caused started to decrease a little. And although it was slowly taking up again as the growth forced her breasts to squeeze each other, Alice soon didn\u2019t have to moan anymore, her breath going back to the panting from the beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her mind began to take notice of her environment again. She saw Alex\u2019s face before her as he was holding her, her half-naked boobs that were still blowing, and beyond them Sarina who was still standing before the closet, though the sight on her steadily diminished. She felt her bra being stuck between her shirt and bust, tickling her a little, and heard as another thread on her bosom broke apart. The complete lower half of her right breast was free, while on her left, it was a large hole at the side that showed most of her skin. Then, the numbness in her limps slowly dissolved, alongside the sick feeling in her stomach. After staring at her swelling rack a bit longer, she finally couldn\u2019t see it not growing anymore, now only moving from her heavy breathing. Still panting Alice inhaled a large amount of air, almost damaging another thread, before she let out a relieved sigh.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange silence fell over the room. Alice was still lying inside Alex\u2019s arms with breasts the size of globular CD\u2019s, and Sarina was still standing around with pink hair(and breasts of twice the size). After a while, the red-haired human woman looked first at her boyfriend, then at the fallen angel, before she asked: \u201cOkay, could someone explain me now what exactly is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's damn well strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarina's an Angel,\" Alex said bluntly. Silence, but Alice was waiting on Alex to continue. \"She's an Angel that fell from Heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Alice muttered, rolling her eyes at him. \"Don't angels have wings normally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she does. Show her.\" Sarina backed up a little, before allowing her wings to open outwards. Her left wing scraped one of the vases on the mantelpiece. Alice was amazed at the sight for a few moments, before her reasoning came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I touch them? To assure they're real?\" Sarina nodded at her. Carefully, Alice manourvered herself so she didn't step on Alex, nor touch the fallen Angel's breasts to her wings. With one hand, she felt the wing, and felt the softness of the feathers, and the heartbeat that pumped blood into them. \"Huh, so you ARE an Angel, after all. Still doesn't explain the boobs though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is where it becomes bizarre, even for me,\" Sarina answered, folding her arms over her bountiful breasts. She folded in her wings, but the tips still scraped the ceiling. \"My breasts started to grow when I ate an apple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice remembered her old religion classes from junior school. \"An apple, huh? The same kind of apple that Eve was tricked into eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina nodded. \"That's what I'm thinking. I haven't a clue on how an apple makes my breasts grow, but that's what happened. After a while then,\" she continued, slowly pacing the room, her breasts jiggling back and forth with each step, \"milk started coming out of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stared at the empty glass next to her as she realised what had happened. \"Are you telling me that I drank your breast milk?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice glared at Alex with fire in her eyes. \"You damned pervert! Why the hell did you make me drink her milk?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked hopeless. \"I don't know! I just had to stop you from getting in there, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For all the wrong reasons,\" Alice grumbled in answer. \"So an Angel's milk will make a girl's breasts become the wet dream of teenagers, is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less,\" Alex answered. \"But at least it's not that bad. At least you aren't her size,\" he added, jutting his thumb at Sarina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed. \"Well, I believe you. But don't go thinking that we're all OK Alex. You still lied to me about her being in the closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe,\" he said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not accepting it,\" she replied. But she then added, \"Well, not yet,\" when she saw his ashen face. He looked up at her in hope, but she still huffed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina's hair turned back to normal from her earlier white, and lightly chuckled to herself. \"You two love each other dearly, don't you?\" Both Alice and Alex looked at her in shock, then at each other. They then both laughed at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say something like that,\" they said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment though, there was a gurgling in Alice's stomach, a very loud growl. She and Alex looked at each other in fear, knowing what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, help me get this off!\" she yelled at Alex, trying to get her shirt and bra off before they began to grow. Her clothing was actually quite expensive. They got them off a mere few moments before they started to push outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already large breasts grew slowly outwards and slightly downwards, with the added volume. However, they didn't sag down, but merely grew in proportion to the breasts. Her nipples were already hard, something all three were very alert of. Alice didn't mind Alex seeing her nude self (since they were still with each other) but it bothered her that Sarina was present. However, it was perhaps a good thing, since she had a comparison in sizes. Each breast was the same as Sarina's mounds, both in width and volume. Alice felt as if she was on model-like cup sizes. The weight of them however was strange, in the fact that it wasn't heavy. More than anything, they were comfortably light on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was panting by the end of the growth. \"Damn, these are...are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big,\" Alex finished for her. He threw her a blanket for modesty. She covered up her front, but her nipples still pushed through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are big,\" Sarina said, examining them closer. This made Alice feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop looking,\" Alice muttered, feeling self-conscious of herself. Sarina apologised, and backed up from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[What now? Two choices here:<br>\r\n1st: Alice leaves for her own home, and tries to sort out her new breast sizes. We follow her home, and watch herself make a fool of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd: Sarina and Alex will now try and figure out a way of reducing Sarina's chest, from rituals, to meditation, and other things. However, somewhere in his heart, we see that Alex secretly wishes that they would stay the same, or maybe even bigger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's for the future. It's your choice.]</span></div></div>",

Alex couldn\u2019t help but constantly look from Alice\u2019s bosom over to the well-filled toga of Sarina, and back again. \u201cSo?\u201d, Alice finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex turned his head towards his girlfriend, trying to focus on her face. \u201dSo what?\u201d, he asked, looking a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed. \u201cSo, what shall we do now?\u201d Holding the blanket against her body she shifted her upper-body, granting Alex a look at her out-standing bosom from all sides. \u201cI mean I can barely go out like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here then?\u201d, Sarina offered, but Alice shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go back and feed my cat\u201d, she explained. \u201cBecause of our fight I\u2019ve been gone all day \u2013 she must be very, very hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pause. \u201cW-well, let\u2019s first get you some clothes\u201d, Alex said after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked down at her volley-breasts. \u201cYou thing you have something my size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina pondered for a moment. \u201cI have an idea!\u201d, she suddenly said. She grabbed one of the holders of her dress and dragged it over her shoulder, Alice\u2019s and Alex\u2019s eyes growing wide as she slowly revealed her bare, light-skinned bosom. Alex especially watched carefully as the fabric slid over her curves, her cleavage steadily slipping deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you don\u2019t need to give her your dress!\u201d, he quickly told her. Just before her dress slid over her breast-warts she stopped, much to Alex\u2019 relief \u2013 though he couldn\u2019t deny he was a little disappointed. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a large sweater lying around somewhere. It might just fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina pulled her holder up again, her hair turning a little pink while Alex went to his bedroom to get the sweater. \u201cSo you\u2019re an angel?\u201d, Alice asked as the girls were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina nodded. \u201cUm, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve fallen from heaven?\u201d Again she nodded. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair brightened slightly. \u201cW-well, I\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her relief Alex returned, carrying a grey woolen sweater that looked like a grandmother had made it. Alice wasn\u2019t really thrilled, but didn\u2019t complain. Turning away from Sarina she dropped the blanket to the floor, revealing the massiveness of her bosom. Alex couldn\u2019t help but stare bluntly at her naked breasts, which both angered and embarrassed Alice. Of course Alex had seen her naked already many times, but that was before her breasts had blown up like balloons. Also, the had never stared at her like this, not so... intensely. Irritated she grabbed the sweater from him, quickly pulling it over her head. It took some effort to drag the itchy fabric over her chest, but after a while she managed to pull it down to her belly. The sweater was hanging rather loosely around her waist and arms, but on her chest the fabric was skin-tight. Every breath stretched the fabric to its absolute limits, her sweater looking like it was about to dissolve and burst open any second. \u201cYou\u2019re right Alex\u201d, she said, looking over herself. \u201cIt JUST fits.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice needed some time to get used to move around. Despite the enormous weight they must have contained her breasts wobbled and bounced at each of her step, and her sweater soundly stretched every time she moved. For some reason Alice suddenly felt a blush coming into her face. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t really want to go\u201d, it came out of her. Quietly she walked over to Alex, standing so close he could feel the woolen fabric at his chest. To his surprise she put her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him. Her sweater sounded like it was about to rip apart as her breasts were squeezed between their bodies, Alex being glad she leaned her face against his shoulder so she couldn\u2019t see his stupid face. \u201cI\u2026 I wanna be with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Alex shook his head to get a clear head again. He put his hands on her head, softly stroking her red hair. \u201cYou can stay if you want\u201d, he offered her. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure your cat won\u2019t starve before tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Alice lay quietly inside his arms. Sarina\u2019s hair turned bright blonde as she watched the two, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve got to go\u201d, Alice eventually said, taking a step back from him. \u201cAlso, I don\u2019t think your apartment is big enough for us all.\u201d She then blushed slightly as she realized the ambiguity of her words. Alex found he wasn\u2019t really reluctant to the idea of Alice staying overnight, but of course she was right. Alice saw he was a little disappointed, and whispered into his ear: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be back right tomorrow morning, as early as I can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled. Once Alice had left he was alone with Sarina inside his apartment again. The sun had already gone down, and night had fallen over the city. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a nice girlfriend\u201d, Sarina said, her hair still shining blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her when she\u2019s really angry yet\u201d, Alex sighed. After a while Sarina\u2019s cleavage automatically picked up his attention again. \u201cA-anyway, do you know any way how we could reverse this whole breast growth thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina\u2019s hair turned normal again, the angel putting a hand on her chin as she thought about it. \u201cWell, if milk affects my body, then maybe other symbolic objects also have an effect on me\u201d, she said after a while. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how we could heal Alice though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure that out once we\u2019ve gotten you back to normal.\u201d Alex scratched his head. \u201cTo be honest I don\u2019t really know much about the bible or god. But if milk makes your breasts grow because it represents prosperity, then maybe a symbol of poverty shrinks them down again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoverty?\u201d Sarina seemed a little confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, in heaven, something like poverty probably didn\u2019t exist. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just look it up on Google. And don\u2019t even ask what that is. In the meantime you can...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her white dress was a little bleached and full of brown stains, while her whole body was covered in a thin layer of dirt. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u201d, she said after she had inspected herself. \u201cWhere\u2019s the next river?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lifted her head again she saw Alex was giving her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I mean your\u2026\u201d She pondered for a moment, trying to remember the right word. \u201cBafroon?\u201d, she asked. \u201cI think you\u2019re calling it like this, right? The place where you take care of your personal hygiene?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex laughed. \u201cBathroom\u201d, he corrected her. \u201cIt\u2019s the door over there.\u201d Sarina walked over to the door he was pointing at. \u201cDo you know how to use a bathtub?\u201d, he quickly asked as she was about to open the door. \u201cOr, um, what a bathtub is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve once read a book about it\u201d, Sarina calmed him. \u201cYou have to turn a\u2026 shelve, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called valve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, I think I\u2019ll recognize it once I see one. It was a picture book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex thought about following her into the bathroom to help her, but quickly shook off that thought. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll handle it\u201d, he assured her. In the same moment he hoped not to regret this as visions of his flooded apartment and a trial with his renter popped up in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina gave Alex a comforting smile before she hushed into the room and closed the door behind her. Looking around she found that compared to the living room the bathroom was a rather small place, and even the living hadn\u2019t really been big: A toilet in one corner, a basin with a mirror in the next, and on the opposite wall an old-fashioned bath-tube that also could be used as a shower. It wasn\u2019t quite looking the one Sarina had seen in the picture-book, but after a while she could figure the use of most objects in the room. The angel leaned over the bathtub, her dress filling with cleavage as she took a look inside. She didn\u2019t quite understand why the humans didn\u2019t just bath inside rivers and lakes, but had invented such a strange machine for it. After looking around a little she found the valve, but then stared a little irritated at it. There were two apparatus\u2019s to turn, one with a red dot and another one with a blue one. She tilted her head, wondering what the colours meant. After hesitating a moment she turned the red one. A stream of water shot from the valve, Sarina\u2019s hair turning a little bleak as it startled her at first. Once she had calmed down she put her hand under the stream. The cool water ran against here fingers, some splashing on her dress. With her bi-coloured eyes she closely inspected it, as if she was checking on its cleanness. While she held her hand under the valve the water suddenly began to warm up, steadily getting hotter. Quickly she pulled her hand back and took a step away from the tub. The sudden moved caused her breasts to bounce heavily inside her dress, rubbing against the fabric. \u201cW-what\u2019s that?\u201d, Sarina asked aloud. \u201cWarm water?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she had seen and felt warm water before in her life. However, it was mainly in the form of tea or other warm drinks. She had never imagined somebody would want to bath in warm water as she had always cleaned herself in cold rivers and natural springs. Slowly the fallen angel made a step forward again, holding out her hand towards the stream of water. Upon touching it she immediately pulled it back, finding it had turned from warm to hot - looking closely she could even see some steam surrounding the stream. She tried to cool it down by turning the valve into the other direction. The stream was getting a little weaker, but as she put her hand under it she painfully noticed it was still not colder from before. Her eyes then got caught on the valve with the blue spot, and after hesitating a moment she began to turn it. The stream of water became stronger again. As Sarina put her hand under it she found this time the water had cooled a bit, being pleasantly warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment if she should try to make the water completely cold, but as it run through her fingers she found the warm water felt really good. As she looked into the tub though she noticed the water was running out through a hole. She searched for something she could put inside, and eventually found a small round object that looked like it would fit perfectly into the hole. The water began to fill the tub as she plugged it in, Sarina waiting until it was high enough that it would cover most of her body. Pulling the holders over her shoulders she then began to strip out of her dress. The stained fabric slowly slipped over her humongous bosom, bit by bit revealing her firm charms, before falling over them to the ground. Without anything to cover her buxom figure she stepped out of her dress, and bent her leg above the tub. As her toe touched the water she found it felt very conveniently warm, and with a smile Sarina stepped into the bathtub, standing a foot deep in the water. Carefully she sat down inside the tub, the arm water engulfing her legs and her butt, before she sunk with the rest of her body into it. Her hair dipped into the water, changing to a satisfied blond as she her body was covered by pleasurable warmth. A small tingle went through Sarina as her breasts touched the surface, making the angel shiver for a second. Slowly and with slightly pink hair she plunged the rest of her bosom into the water until only the tops were looking out in the air. The little sensations forced a small moan out of her mouth, echoing through the walls of the bathroom. Lying back Sarina placed her hands on her tingling breasts, closing her eyes as she stroke her sensitive assets. Slowly the tub was filling with water, washing the dirt from Sarina\u2019s body while making her feel more and more comfortable. \u201cSo that\u2019s why\u201d she murmured, answering the question to herself why humans didn\u2019t bath in rivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Alex was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sitting on his couch he stared on the little screen in front of him, tapping with his feet on the floor. \u201cA friggin angel\u201d, he murmured as he remembered the events of the day again. He could then hear his heavenly guest in the bathroom as she moaned softly. While a blush formed on Alex\u2019 face the desktop appeared on the screen of his laptop, and he hastily opened his internet explorer. \u201cOkay\u201d, he mumbled as the Google popped up, and began to type into the keyboard. \u201cSymbols of poverty, let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched through the various results that Google offered him, feeling a little embarrassed as the moans of Sarina reached his ear from time to time. None of the suggestions really seemed to be helpful in his situation: The most common symbol was a pair of cupped hands that formed a begging bowl, but that didn\u2019t really help Alex. He needed something Sarina could consume. Other common symbols were real begging bowls as well as dirty and ripped up clothes, but Alex highly doubted Sarina would eat those. Though considering how na\u00efve she behaved\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Alex shook off the thought, and continued searching. After clicking on at least forty different links he finally stumbled across something that seemed like it could be helpful: According to a cooking website several hundred years ago in Italy when it was first baked pizza originally was food for poor people. It wasn\u2019t exactly a sign of poverty, but easy to get, and, most importantly, edible. He actually even had a pizza lying around in his freezer. \u201cDefinitely worth a shot\u201d, he said to himself. \u201cAnd better than feeding her old, dirty clothes.\u201d He stood up and walked into his kitchen corner, where he prepared everything for the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sarina\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her breasts were mainly below the surface, like most of her body, only a small part around her nipples being still in the fresh air. The colour of her hair had become very bright, almost platinum blond, and the fallen angel was smiling from ear to ear as she lay in the steaming water. \u201cHow refreshing\u201d, she sighed. Feeling more relaxed than ever before in her life Sarina almost fell asleep. To keep herself awake kept her red eye open, searching the room for something interesting. Right above her, on the edge of the bathtub, there was a small weird-looking plastic bottle in the shape of a pear. Sarina remembered to have read something about certain liquids the humans had invented to put into their water to make it even more comforting. Back in heaven she had also often thrown rose petals into a pond before jumping into it, but that hadn\u2019t nearly been as comfortable as she it was right now for her. Instantly she began to wonder what it would feel like to bath in those lotions if it was already such a pleasure without them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious and a little careless due to the hot water Sarina grabbed the bottle. She didn\u2019t bother reading the etiquette, but directly fumbled around the top to open it. It took a while until she uncovered the secret of its mechanism, but as she did immediately flipped the bottle over. A white creamy substance flowed out of it, pouring down as a stream before landing in the water next to her chest. The cream tickled her slightly as it graced her breasts, Sarina watching anxiously as the cream slowly dissolved inside the hot water. Sarina was so absorbed by the process she accidentally used up all of the bubble bath, being a little shocked when the bottle was suddenly empty. \u201cWhoops!\u201d Her hair took on a mixture of white and pink as she was both nervous and ashamed. \u201cI-I hope Alex doesn\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d She put the empty bottle back on the place where it had been standing, and because the water level had fallen slightly turned on the valve again. As she did white fluffy foam formed around the stream of water, slowly spreading through the entire bathtub. Sarina felt as the tiny bubbles approached her sensitive bosom, closing her eyes as it began to surround her bosom and form ever larger towers around. \u201cHow refreshing\u201d, Sarina repeated, her hair being blonder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn\u2019t know was the bubble bath \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly the white fluffy substance was spreading through the entire tub, blocking the sight on the angel and even the top of her \u201cheavenly\u201d assets. Her entire face soon was framed by large mountains of foam. Smiling Sarina sunk her head even deeper into water until her entire hair was completely below the surface, only her face sticking out. \u201cThis is simply divine\u201d, she sighed, feeling completely satisfied. Rising relaxation settled into Sarina\u2019s body, a tingling sensation crawling over her skin. She shook her body slightly, her trembling bosom sending little waves over the foam-covered surface of the water. With their sensitivity Sarina could feel the comfort the warm water and the lotion caused especially inside her breasts, her pleasantly prickling perkers granting her feelings she had never felt before in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026though for some reason it did feel strangely familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she pondered about it another sensation suddenly materialised in her chest: Though they were floating gently in the water the inner sides of her breasts began to rub a bit harder against each other, and she could feel their tops poking out a little more out of the water than a moment before. And with each second that passed they squeezed tighter against each other while sticking out further from her, the towers of foam above them shaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright blonde colour of her hair quickly changed into the bleak, while her bi-coloured eyes widened in shock. \u201cOh no!\u201d, Sarina shrieked, quickly raising her head out of the water. Hastily she grabbed the edges of the bathtub. Her wet hands slipped off a few times, but eventually she pulled her torso through the foam, her drenched hair slapping against her back as she sat up inside the bathtub. Immediately she stared at her breasts hanging from her, though the term protruding would have been more fitting at their level of firmness. It was barely, but Sarina could see the curves already large balls of meat bulging outwards, spreading out into every direction while her cleavage narrowed even further. The more her breasts rubbed against each other the stronger the tingle in them became, Sarina\u2019s white hair gaining a soft shade of pink.

Immediately she jumped over the edge of the bathtub, causing her breasts to jiggle into every direction. Water dripped from her body as she stood naked in the bathroom, especially from the bottom of her bulging breasts. Following the flow of the water foam also ran down her growing curves, arousing her slightly as the tiny bubbles stroke her sensitive skin. Swallowing down the upcoming pleasure the angel looked down on her bosom as it steadily bent outwards, growing from volleyball-sized into the territory of basketballs. The pressure between them rose with each cubic millimeter of circumference they gained, her feminine orbs still sticking proudly out from her body as if they were made out of rubber or some other solid substance. With their heavenly support the top of her bulging breasts ascended through the height of her neck, Sarina pulling her head back a little as her cleavage approached her chin. After the front of her bust had moved out an inch further away from her body than before the tingling sensation in her breasts began to subside. Sarina felt as the last ounces of flesh rolled into her mammaries, her bosom becoming wide enough one could have seen it when looking at her back before the growth stopped again. She took in a deep breath, blowing up her bust a few millimeters further, before it settled down again as she sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the entire situation still discomforted her enough to keep the colour of her drenched hair somewhere between pink and white.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly had just happened? Nervously Sarina pondered about it for a moment. Was it still an aftereffect from drinking the milk? And if it was, would there be more to come? A shiver went through her as she imagined herself to continue growing like this for the rest of her life, which since she was immortal would have been\u2026 forever. She then noticed she did not only shiver, but also goose-bumps were forming on her skin, and felt a slight chill. Realising she was stark naked and wet in the bathroom she quickly pulled her arms around her body, pushing her bosom up a little while pressing her legs closely together. She needed something to dry herself. Quickly she took a look through the room, eventually finding a piece of fabric hanging from a metal bar on the wall. \u201cIs that a towel?\u201d, she wondered, taking a step towards and a closer look at it. It appeared to be a towel, but its surface was so\u2026 rough. Uneven. Little hairs were standing from it like the fur from a wild animal. \u201cDon\u2019t humans have something softer?\u201d, she wondered. The towels in heaven were all made out of smooth silk, a pleasure for the skin. Sure, silk wasn\u2019t the best material to rub off water, but in heaven you have the time to thoroughly rub every inch of your body with a soft, cool towel of silk\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina frowned upon the thought of rubbing herself with something that looked like a piece of bear skin, but reluctantly she grabbed the towel. Carefully she began to clean herself, cautious the rough material wouldn\u2019t damage her pure, sensible skin. Luckily it seemed the towel was really a lot more efficient at drying than the ones in heaven, so she didn\u2019t need to rub it hardly over her. One problem though occurred when she reached her bosom. She had saved this part for the last, and was even more careful and slow as she moved the towel over the curves and slopes of her mammary melons. But no matter how cautious she was, feeling the rough structure of the fabric gliding over her skin send shivers down Sarina\u2019s spine. Her hair blushed in a shade of deep pink, the angel closing her bi-coloured eyes as she cleared the water from her bosom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The movements of the towel were bit by bit getting slower, Sarina rubbing it with increasing fondness over her breasts. With the high sensitivity of her globes she believed to feel each individual hair that stood out from the cloth stroking her skin, her hair taking on an ever deeper shade of pink. \u201cHm\u201d, she hummed in satisfaction, her mouth opening to release a soft moan from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her concentration being focused on her chest she could hear as someone knocked on the door. \u201cSarina?\u201d, she could hear Alex\u2019 voice from the other side \u201cIs something wrong in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Sarina dropped the towel, jumping in surprise while her hair turned from pink to bleak. She was so startled she accidentally released the seal of her wings. Spreading out from her back they hit the wall behind her hardly, some of the white feathers falling off. \u201cOuch!\u201d, Sarina shrieked. Simultaneously the tip of her wing graced the various bottles on the shelf above the bathtub. Most of them fell off and splashed into the water, destroying some of the towers of foam.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSarina, are you alright?\u201d, Alex asked again through the door. She could hear him grabbing the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Sarina pulled her wings towards her body. \u201cY-yeah, I\u2019m alright!\u201d, she replied, her hair gaining a pink tone again. \u201cI just, um, released my wings, and er, bumped against the wall!\u201d That wasn\u2019t even a lie. Just half the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side of the door she could hear a sigh. \u201cBe careful with them!\u201d, Alex told her. \u201cI know it must be awkward for you to walk around without them, but I\u2019m afraid my apartment is too narrow for you to walk around with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina leaned down to pick up the towel again. \u201cY-yeah\u201d, she replied, her wings moving back into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I think I have found something\u201d, she could hear him say. \u201cCome out when you\u2019re done and we can test it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay\u201d, Sarina said. She then could hear him stepping away from the door, and sighed in relief. Her sigh however immediately reminded her of the \u201clittle\u201d problem she had. From her chest stuck a pair of breasts even larger than before, the meat rippling slightly with each breath she took. Gulping Sarina began to dry her wet hair with the towel, still wondering what had caused this. And how she should deal with it. An most importantly, what should she tell Alex? Maybe though she thought while looking down on them he wouldn\u2019t notice. The increase in size wasn\u2019t that striking, each of her orbs being roughly one inch in diameter wider than before. If she managed to stuff them into her dress in the right way, there was the possibility he wouldn\u2019t see they were bigger. That would have been a lot less embarrassing then explaining that she had just grown while taking a bath\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathtub. Immediately Sarina threw her glance towards the full tub with the huge piles of foam on top of it. Of course! That must have been it! She had grown a few moments after she had put the lotion into the bath! Maybe it had been the cause for it? Again Sarina sighed in relief, her hair becoming even a slight shade of blonde as the tension of possibly getting bigger breasts for the rest of her life was taken off from her. Still though, her long strains kept a mixture of white from nervousness and pink from shame as she continued to rub the towel over them, still wondering if she should tell Alex about it\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anxiously Sarina looked down on her bust. Though the difference was noticeable it really wasn\u2019t that striking. Maybe, if she was lucky, she could try and act as if nothing had happened. Also Alex had said he may have found something to help her \u2013 no reason to worry him any further if he had already found a solution to her problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had dried her hair enough she put the towel back on the bar where it had been hanging before. Automatically her long strands smoothly fell down her back again, leaving no signs they had been completely soaked with water a few moments ago. Taking a quick look around her she found where she had dropped her dress to the floor. As she bent down to pick it up her breasts of course hung down from her, making some slight circling motions and bumping a little against each other. Sarina\u2019s hair blushed as she quickly picked up her robe and straightened her back again, her bosom making a small bounce as it fell down on her ribcage, though of course still protruding firmly out from her. As Sarina inspected her dress three things immediately struck her: The first was that her even larger bust would fit even worse into it, probably lying a bit tighter around her chest while exposing a generous amount of cleavage. The second thing was that while her body was all clean now after her bath the formerly white dress was still full of stains, dirt and dust. And lastly, with the originally loose structure of her dress it was unlikely she could hide the results of her last growth with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit frustrated Sarina sighed. Her hair at least was returning to its \u201cnatural\u201d hazel colour again as she was feeling no great nervousness or embarrassment anymore, flowing down to waist and framing her face. As she casually glanced through the room a large basket in the corner caught her attention. It was stuffed with all kinds of shirts, tank-tops and trousers as well as other kinds of clothes Sarina didn\u2019t know. \u201cThese must belong to Alex\u201d, the angel concluded. A thought then struck her mind: As a man the shoulders and upper back of Alex were broader than Sarina\u2019s, although he was far away from being something that could be called \u201cmuscular\u201d. Still, and even though they would probably fit pretty snuggly around her bosom, maybe one of his shirts would be able to hold back her mounds just enough Alex wouldn\u2019t notice a change from before. Then again, would it be okay to just take some of his clothes? In a way, she would be stealing them, and stealing was definitely against the rules of heaven. On the other hand, as she had though at some other occasions on that day, she was banned already. What more terrible thing could happen to her anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look down however reminded her what happened the last time she had thought that...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually Sarina shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just clothes\u201d, she told herself, dropping her dress to the floor again. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got so many I\u2019m sure he can spare some for me.\u201d Also, she added in thoughts, she would see him in a minute again. If he really minded her wearing his clothes he would tell her, and then she could put her dress back on again anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe still naked angel bounced over to the cloth basket, her breasts jiggling along. She didn\u2019t want to snoop around in Alex\u2019 stuff too much, so she just took the shirt that was lying on top of the pile. It was black with a red rose on the left side of the front, short-sleeved and looked actually rather robust. Not the worst attribute Sarina thought considering the pressure it would have to endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she had only been wearing dresses in heaven her first impulse was to try putting it on by moving the collar through her legs. She couldn\u2019t even get the hole past her ankles however before it got stuck, and as she had to lean down her large breasts gave her trouble with her balance. \u201cUngh\u201d, she moaned, her body tilting on the spot. After unsuccessfully trying to pull it over her legs she stripped her feet out of it again, holding the shirt in front of her to examine it. \u201cThere must be a better way to get it on!\u201d, she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a series of similarly fruitless attempts to pull it the other way around over her legs, then through the sleeves, then with sleeves and collar through her arms before she finally reached her head, although she also first tried to get her collar and sleeves through first until she managed to pull it from bottom to top over her head down to her waist. But it still took a while until she managed to get her arms into the sleeves and her head through the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs head and arms each had found their respective holes Sarina took a look down herself. As to be expected her sight was met by the black fabric hugging the orbs on her chest tightly, the red rose on top of her left breast being stretched over it. The shirt emphasized the curves of her bosom very well, even showing some of her cleavage through the material that was lying taut across the sink between her breasts. Below and on her arms the shirt felt a bit loose, but since Sarina was used to wearing breezy outfits she didn\u2019t mind. It actually helped a lot to make her breasts look less dominant and therefore not as big. The angel smiled for a moment, but then frowned. She took a look down her back, seeing her brown hair falling over the fabric that covered it. It was lying neither really tight nor lose over her back. For her entire life however she had never worn anything that covered her back because of her wings. Feeling fabric where usually her wings would protrude from her body felt kind of\u2026 awkward. That reminded her also not to release her wings while wearing it, or else she might destroy the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she glanced down her back she also noticed her cute little bum was still completely naked, and on the direct other side she felt things weren\u2019t much better. Blushing a bit again Sarina remembered that humans mostly wore pants to cover the lower sections of their bodies. She didn\u2019t quite understand why all didn\u2019t just walk around in dresses, and especially why the men didn\u2019t, but there was no use thinking about this in that moment. She took another look into the basket, searching something to cover the rest of her intimate areas. Searching through it she found a piece of cloth that caught her interest. Curiously she pulled a white small piece of fabric out of the basket. The angel tilted her head as she held it in front of her, examining it. It looked a bit like what Alex was wearing, only - shorter. As in there was nothing to cover the legs, only the part around her hips. \u201cMaybe this is for very warm days?\u201d, Sarina, who never had seen a slipper or any other piece of underwear in her entire life figured. With a lot more ease than the shirt she pulled on the supposedly pair of pants. The white fabric was lying tightly around her butt, an odd feeling to someone who had never worn anything so tight on that part of her body before. Feeling a bit uneasy Sarina turned on the spot, looking down on her newly clothed body. \u201cHumans are weird\u201d, she finally declared \u201cIf I would walk around like this in heaven everyone would laugh at me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was then knocked out of her thoughts as Alex knocked on the door again. \u201cSarina, are you really okay?\u201d, he asked once more. \u201cYou\u2019re taking quite long in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d, Sarina quickly replied and dashed to the door. Her bust rubbed against the fabric of her shirt while bouncing up and down, before coming to a halt as she reached the door, only jiggling slightly for few seconds afterwards. The angel took in a deep breath, trying to calm herself so much no shades of pink or white were mixed into her hair. She embraced knob of the door, slowly turning it around\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could hear her dashing through the room to the door. He crossed his arms over his chest, watching as knob got turned. While she slowly opened the door he turned his head towards his small kitchen counter. A simple pizza margherita was resting on a small plate, steaming slightly. \u201cI hope this works\u201d, he murmured to himself, turning his gaze back to the door. \u201cCan\u2019t think of anything bett-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Sarina the young man abruptly froze. Standing in the door frame his eyes were met with a sight that could simply be described as divine sexiness: Instead of her dress the angel had put on one of his shirts \u2013 a shirt that immediately drew Alex\u2019 attention towards the large melons resting beneath it. Their curves, being both well-sized and \u2013shaped prominently stretched the cotton around them, the top resting on her breasts like a second skin. Though still deep black the fabric was considerably strained, the red rose on the front being noticeably wider than usually as it tried to follow the slopes of Sarina\u2019s bust. The fact that the top was lying loosely all over the rest of her body made its tightness around her breasts even more apparent. Despite being so baggy the sheer size of her bosom caused so much of the shirt to be wrapped around it he could take a small glimpse at the slippers Sarina was wearing, just at the bottom of her crotch. Only occasionally however Alex\u2019 gaze shifted away from the gargantuan globes that pointed proudly out from Sarina\u2019s chest. He hadn\u2019t really realised <i>how</i> huge she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve took some of your clothes\u201d, the angel\u2019s soft voice pulled him out of his paralysis. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex raised his glance from Sarina\u2019s buoyant bosom, looking at her bi-coloured eyes. He suddenly realised how pretty her face was: Her contours were tender, her cheeks and chin nicely shaped, her lips slim and appealing, her eyes despite their different colours beautiful. A quick look over her body he found it to feature attractive features from top to bottom: Cute feet, smooth slender legs, filigree fingers, a rosy skin, long voluminous hair \u2013 and on top of that the probably biggest and firmest pair of breasts both in heaven and earth, resting inside a tight black shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina curiously looked at Alex as he intensely examined her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d, she asked. \u201cIs something behind me?\u201d She spun around on the spot, looking back in the empty bathroom. The momentum caused the hem of her shirt to go up, and as she turned her back to him he could take a look at her firm bum hugging the fabric of his slippers, the white garments slightly sinking into the sink between her cheeks while the edges of her butt were uncovered. Although not in size the shape of her posterior could definitely keep up with that of her perky bosom. From face to rear Sarina was beaming with sex appeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarina turned back to Alex, her bosom wobbling in her shirt she noticed the expression on his face had changed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To Sarina\u2019s confusion Alex\u2019 face had changed its usual colour to a bright red, his cheeks almost glowing. Additionally the look on his face had changed, staring with wide eyes at her. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d, she asked, looking a little puzzled at Alex. \u201cOr is it normal that humans suddenly get red faces from time to time?\u201d, she inquired further, not knowing any other kind of blush except for getting pink hair when being embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good as possible Alex tried to regain his composure. \u201cIt\u2019s all right\u201d, he quickly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina\u2019s hazel hair took on a blond streak, the angel being happy Alex seemingly hadn\u2019t noticed her extra growth. \u201cGood!\u201d, she exclaimed, her hair turning full blond in hope as she asked: \u201cSo what have you found that might make my breasts become normal again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the blink of a second a small voice in the back of his mind told Alex to somehow distract from this topic. He quickly shut it up. \u201cIt\u2019s here\u201d, he replied, pointing at the plate with the pizza. As Sarina walked past him he not only got to see her breasts from a lot closer, but also got a look at her figure from the side, his eyes nearly popping out when he saw how much her bust was actually pointing out from the rest of her body. Plus he got another small glimpse at her bum. Her firm bum. Firm and sexy. Sexy. Sex\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarina was turning her back to him he frantically shook his head. No, he thought. No, no, no, no! That was wrong beyond anything! She was an angel, and he had a girlfriend. He tried to call the image of Alice into his mind. But the only image that popped up was that of her huge breasts she had obtained after drinking Sarina\u2019s milk, which didn\u2019t really help to calm him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alex was locked in an inner struggle Sarina curiously looked at the pizza. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d, she asked, bending over the plate. This time it was more than a small glimpse Alex could take at her butt as the hem of her top rose up, showing her perky backside in all its curvaceous glory. She even flexed it a little as she bend forward, the edges of her slippers sliding further over her butt slopes while the fabric sunk a little into the gap, pronouncing her curves even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at her revealed bum for some time Alex slapped himself, trying to regain his cool. \u201cPizza\u201d, he finally replied, quickly walking to her side so he couldn\u2019t look at her butt anymore. Though in this position he had to resist looking at Sarina\u2019s breasts hanging from her body against the fabric of his shirt as she still leaned over the plate. \u201cIt\u2019s a meal that used to be eaten by poor people in Italy. I figured if milk symbolizes prosperity and make your breasts grow, maybe something which represents poverty may make them shrink down. It\u2019s a rather stretched guess though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Alex\u2019 relief Sarina straightened up again. She looked down on her ample assets, slightly tugging the fabric around them. \u201cI\u2019m certainly willing to try it out\u201d, she murmured. A loud growling suddenly emerged from her tummy. \u201cAnd I could really use something to eat\u201d, she added with a slight pink shade in her hair. Alex had already cut the pizza in eight parts, and since the angel naturally ate everything with her fingers she automatically took one of the pieces into her hands. The warm temperature startled her, causing her to make a small jump. \u201cHot!\u201d, she screeched, her bosom bouncing from her motion. Feeling blood rush into his face (and some other parts of his body) Alex turned his head away from her, trying not to look at Sarina\u2019s jiggling udders as she tried to eat a slice of the pizza. \u2018Please let this work out\u2019, he thought, praying silently this pizza would make her shrink down to a modest size. He didn\u2019t know how long he could keep himself under control with so much lightly dressed hotness in front of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Sarina pushed the tip of the piece into her open mouth. Her lips twitched slightly as they touched the hot slice, the angel pulling them back as she took a bite. Taking the slice from her lips long threads of cheese were stretched between her mouth and the pizza. As they broke Sarina carefully slurped the noodle-like pieces of cheese while at the same time she chew on what was already in her mouth. The taste of tomatoes, cheese, herbs and dough combined felt awkward to her, Sarina needing a while until she got used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pizza was crunched to a pile of mush Sarina swallowed. As Alex heard her gulp he turned his head back towards the angel. Both of them looked at her breasts, waiting for something to happen. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Intensely the two of them stared at the angel\u2019s breasts. Alex especially watched the lumps of flesh rise and fall with Sarina\u2019s breath, the fabric stretching and relaxing around them in a steady pattern. The holder of the magnificent charms herself only looked out for any signs of a decrease in size. \u201cCome on!\u201d, she whispered. She put the slice back into her mouth and bit off another piece. Her bosom wobbled slightly as she tilted her head to the side, ripping of the cheese from the pizza before she quickly swallowed everything in her mouth down. Again she hopefully looked at her breasts. Her enthusiasm however gradually depleted the longer the firm melons in her top remained as stout and proud as they were, making no signs to shrink down. Almost desperate she shoved the entire rest of the slice into her mouth. She chewed on it as fast as possible, little crumbles falling from her mouth on her outstanding chest. Most of them bounced off or rolled over her curves down to the ground while some of them remained on the wide slopes of her bust, a sight that made the already flustered Alex blush even deeper. After Sarina swallowed the entire slice she instantly checked her bosom for changes again, putting her hands on its sides to feel for even the slightest change in volume. Watching Sarina grope her own breasts and make the crumbles on top of them dance Alex gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while however her hands stopped moving, lying motionless on the curves of her bosom. \u201cLooks like it isn\u2019t working\u201d, she remarked. Her voice was clearly frustrated, and her hair turned from euphorically blonde to a disenchanted black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed, not knowing himself if out of relief, disappointment or anything. He turned his body to the side to avoid staring any longer at Sarina\u2019s breasts. \u201cWell it was a far stretch anyway\u201d, he admitted, rubbing the back of his head. \u201cI mean no one probably ever saw pizza as a sign for pover\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut off by a loud shriek from Sarina. Her black hair brightened up, the look on her face became more stressed, her bi-coloured eyes opened widely. \u201cM-my breasts!\u201d, she gasped, her hands stiffly crooked around her lush charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Alex turned towards Sarina. \u201cDid it work?\u201d, he asked. A stone fell off his heart as he felt sincere joy the suffering of his friend was about to end, with no lecherous thoughts remaining in his mind. \u201cAre they shrinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing accelerated, turning into laboured panting. \u201cN-no\u201d, she stuttered. \u201cThey are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t finish the sentence. But there was no need to. As Alex cast his eyes down on her bosom he could watch as it slowly started to inflate inside her grip, the fabric soundly stretching around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCopying Sarina\u2019s mimic Alex\u2019 eye grew wide, while his face took on a shocked and disbelieved expression. \u201cBut how can this\u2026\u201d Suddenly it struck him. \u201cOh no, the cheese!\u201d, he shouted, slamming his hand against his forehead. Out of a thousand pizzas that had only imitation cheese he had picked out the only one with real milk. Still, this didn\u2019t make any sense: Even though cheese was made out of milk, if it was really the symbolic meaning of prosperity that caused Sarina\u2019s breasts to grow shouldn\u2019t it be restricted to pure milk? As Alex could watch the orbs of the angel swell against the confines of his shirt though this didn\u2019t seem to be the case. Did she react like that to anything that involved milk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind didn\u2019t stay long on this question however as his focus was quickly swallowed up by the massing mass of meat in front of him. With bleak hair and a panicked look on the face Sarina looked down on her ample bosom as it got even more ample, vaulting out from her body like bread rising in an oven. Lying already taut around them the black fabric gradually stretched over her bulging breasts as they charged forward, their curves spreading out into every direction. As their surface increased the skin of her globes rubbed against the inside of the shirt she wore, a feeling growing more peculiar the more impressive the bulk of her bust became. Nervously her fingers twitched on top of their flaring flanks, growing millimeter by millimeter to the side and leaving her shoulders and hips steadily further behind. The little pizza crumbles on top of her mounds moved slightly as the \u201cground\u201d beneath them ascended, the top line of her rack climbing up her neck while their curves evenly vaulted upwards. Almost symmetrically the bottoms of her bosom were bulging as well, becoming wider and reaching further down while keeping their round hemi-spherical shape despite the increasing mass of her mammaries. Without sagging down their fronts moved steadily forward as if they were running away from her body. As the peaks of her perkers conquered new territory they dragged ever more fabric from the rest of her body over them. The hyperventilating Sarina could feel the hem of her top rising upwards, slowly moving over her bonny butt as her bust wrapped ever more fabric around itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-dear lord!\u201d, she whispered, unbelievingly staring at her massive globes. They were leaving scales at which they could be compared to basketballs, transcending into medicine ball dimensions \u2013 small medicine balls, but ones that were gradually getting pumped up. \u201cIn the name of the lord, stop!\u201d, she screamed at her breasts. Harshly she pressed her fingers into her firm flesh, as if she was trying to shove them back into her body. Her already tense top creaked even louder as she pushed her breasts up and down, left and right with her hands while rubbing their inner curves against each other. The black cotton turned a little grey around the center of her chest, her cleavage starting to shine through. \u201cPlease do something Alex!\u201d, she screeched, growing more panicked by the second and rubbing her breasts more hysterically with each cubic millimeter they gained. \u201cHelp me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t hear her. His whole mind was set on the growing globes in front of him, arching into his direction. It had been a shock as he had come home and seen his heavenly guest had turned into a buxom bombshell. He was even more shocked when Alice had accidentally drunken her milk and grown from flat and plain to one of the bustiest women he knew \u2013 actually the bustiest alongside Sarina. And this time, an already spectacular set of knockers was growing EVEN bigger right in front of his very nose. His eyes hectically moved as they scanned every detail of Sarina\u2019s angelic globes: The divine firmness of her curves... their godly size... the black fabric hugging them... the little crumbles on top that one by one rolled off the steepening slopes of her bosom... their motions as Sarina tried to stop their growth by wildly rubbing her hands against them\u2026 the line of cleavage subtly shining through the most stretched segments of the fabric\u2026 and it was all increasing by the second, becoming lusher, stouter, larger \u2013 and sexier. Staring at her billowing breasts Alex could barely contain his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis glance shifted for a moment from the large lumps to the kitchen counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven slices of pizza were still lying on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven slices rich with cheese...</span></div></div>",

Was is Pregnant, and why would I be it?\"  She says with confusion in her voice.  'I understand heaven makes angels naive to things, but she doesn't know what pregnancy is, really heaven?' He thinks with an anime style sweatshop forming on his head.  \"Ok, ruling out pregnancy, sense this is the second time this is happening, I would assume you might know what caused this the first time.\" He says, a blush forming on his face (somehow only just now gaining it).  \"The milk I had earlier,\" She offers, remembering what the glass of milk she had a bit ago had done, \"it caused me to produce milk, which I still don't get why it happened.\".</span></div></div>",

Alex waved it off and smiled as he began to finish up the final touches on the set up the ritual circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy said we had a chance to do something big!\" Alex assured his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, that doesn't sound in anyway safe. We're just a couple of low-level summoners, not even good ones at that!\" Alice questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And wouldn't we want to get better if that is the case?\" Alex raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and him were just a couple of average folk about three months ago, until they stumbled upon some scrolls among the mountains near their city. Not knowing what they were, the duo decided to act out a particularity evocative drawing on one of the scrolls. In short, this opened their minds to the mystical world and allowed them to read off the scrolls with ease. Although, they couldn't exactly use any of the higher spells on the things....until tonight that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand how summoning a \"Bright One\", will help us with anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, let me show you something.\" Alex walked off to get his backpack, which currently housed ancient scrolls of power. Opening it up, he took out a scroll wrapped in purple ribbon. He flicked it open with a swift motion of his hand and put his finger on it. Scrolling the images and words down like an I-pad. Finally he stopped on an image that showed off a humanoid being bathed in light. \"You see the description of these beings describe it as giving good luck, massive knowledge, and, oh gee, summoning true names! And the ritual allows it to be called down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will it be angry that we did that?\" Alice said worryingly.\" I would be pissed if some guy called me from wherever I was at to go work for him with no reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you see here it describes these \"Bright Ones\" as being open towards new things. Though the description does say we have to keep a close eye on them, but it doesn't outright say it will result in terrible happenings or something of that nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, no evil or horrible things will happen once we summon this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None that I know of, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Alice briefly struggled with her own inner intuition before she shrugged. \"Alright, get on with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Alex sat down, across him, Alice did the same. Taking out the scroll, Alex began to recite the following:<br>\r\n\"Come bring the <i>crack </i>of dawn to the world.<i> Shake</i> in ecstasy for the entire race of man to see. Call upon the <i>full-moon</i> and bring the great chasm to this earthly realm. I call upon you now shining sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash blinded him for a second and Alex heard Alice yelp in surprise. Slowly did his vision return to his eyes, he saw his circle had completely disappeared and in its place was a armored figure of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most surprising thing about that, however, was the fact the girl had large wings. White as snow and perfectly crafted that Alex gasped in the beauty that radiated from it. Besides that, her armor was silver with intricate markings and was a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would've been impressive, if not for the fact her rump was in the air like she was offering it up for anyone to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that an angel?\" Alice's voice caused Alex to yelp in surprise, briefly forgetting about her due to the sight he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a 'bad guy' thing to do? In books and TV shows this is like something an evil wizard would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, you ass.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both women were laying against the roof of a small cabin, which aside from a rundown barn beside it was the only standing structure around for miles. Becky took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High point of our night, I guess.

She had a multitude of small cuts about her body, and a number of burns. Her eyes were closed and her face in clear pain. Beneath her, she lay on two massive, flawless wings. Well, normally flawless - one was bent out oddly, and they were now covered in mud. They were at least doing something by keeping the woman from laying directly on the ground. The night wasn't cold, but it wasn't warm either, and the woman didn't look like she was going anywhere fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....happened...\" the woman asked, her throat dry. She tried to swallow a couple times. \"Think, Sarina....\" everything was a blur to her. Shock, shame, rage....she couldn't even remember which were her emotions and which were the others....or His. She knew she was on Earth. But she also knew (couldn't help but know) she still had her wings. That wasn't right. Had He not meant to cast her out? Had she even been cast out?

Her body ached as her mind continued to cloud and the angel hobbled forward. Her flawless, save for some mud caked within, hair became a dark, navy blue. Her hair fluctuated in color based on her emotions, like a mood ring. Even among angels, this was a rare characteristic but one she'd had secret pride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to pant. The wounds on her body began to flare up. They felt as if they burned as the pain seared into her body and mind. She couldn't see anything except for trees, mud and more trees and the light of the stars in the sky. Sarina tried to remember why she fell, why He cast her down but the pain searing in her body also seared into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina began to stumble more, feeling warmth spread through her body as blood trickled down her body from her opened wounds, wincing in pain as she felt dirt and mud cake within the wounds and flare up the pain inside of them. Her eyes began to become unfocused as she saw what looked like a different section of land in front of her. It looked black with lines of some kind on them. She could see better as a light shone from her right, revealing it to look harder and more solid then the rest of the ground and the light came from some large boxy...Sarina didn't know what to call it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her mind and body wane, stumbling and finding herself falling to the ground. Sarina managed to catch herself, but she felt pain rise in her weakening arms as they began to go numb. What looked like a door on the side of whatever strange chariot lay before her opened after it came to a halt. A figure, shaped like a person, ran before her. Before Sarina could react in any way, everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...er seen...ing li...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May be...few....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina could swear she saw people standing above her, talking. There were bright lights around her, not like in His Domain, but more glaring. Everyone was dressed in white and wore similar uniforms. Two women stood by her sides, one with blond curly hair and another with short, raven colored straight hair. In front of her was a man with a thick, squarely trimmed mustache that was the same shade of reddish brown as the short, simple hair on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...acle...n say...IVs for a...i..e..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer consciousness faded again as Sarina felt herself slip. She remembered hearing people move, muffled voices, but above all that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pleasant breeze, accompanied by a feeling of comfort. Sarina stirred, looking around as her tired, differently colored blue and red eyes focused. She was in a somewhat small room that was nondescript looking. The walls were a pale blue painted color and there was an open window with green framework next to where she sat. She found herself in a queer looking bed that was arched up an an angle, leveling her head and back. She found her elegant gown had been replaced with a more plain blue one that oddly seemed to lack a back to it. Her body had gauze applied on multiple sections of her abdomen, her forearms and her thighs as well as her back, mostly along her spine, though she couldn't see those. Next to her was a metal tray on a thin rail of some kind with old, dirty looking bandages and a brown bottle next to it. She looked at her left forearm and saw a strange plastic tube, connected to a clear plastic bag next to her suspended on a similar rail of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina wondered what had happened to her, when a woman came in, clad in a white dress that ended in a skirt that reached past her mid-thighs, as well as heels. Her hair was blond and curled in a salon-fresh hairstyle and she had cornflower blue eyes as well as a delicate, but partially aged face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you're awake...\" The nurse said in some form of minor accent Sarina didn't recognize, but what we knew as a southern accent. Her tone was nervous and easily reflected the fact she knew little of what to think in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...am I...?\" Sarina asked innocently with a dreary tone in her voice. Was it her weak from whatever happened or was it the reality of the situation bearing down on her? She didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in a hospital sweetie...\" The nurse laughed nervously, trying to form her ruby red lips in a smile as she spoke \"Then again, uh, I guess Heaven doesn't need hospitals does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina looked down despondently. Reality further sunk in as she looked at her injured body. It was true; His Domain was a place of peace, free of all pain and woes. But here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we were worried you wouldn't pull through. Er, pun unintended, but the doctor said it was nothing short of a miracle you survived. I guess being an Angel means healing faster than a human. Anyway, you've been kept on IV for a time so you're probably hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fallen angel looked over at the tube in her arm? IV? This strange object?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse brought Sarina food she'd never seen before. It was different then the fruits in His Domain, but had a humble quality to it. Not only that, she needed utensils to eat some, like the 'mashed potatoes' and steak and the \"jello\" the nurse brought her after for dessert. It had felt strangely compelling, eating like this as she sat in the hospital like this. She would call for more food at times. Seconds, even thirds, for almost every meal of the day. She would ask for snacks regularly, partaking in the wonder that was human food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this of coursed caused her to gain more weight within less than a week. Her body looked a tad softer and she had lightly more feminine features, as opposed to her rather androgynous figure such as curvier and wider hips as well as slightly more defined breasts and a softer belly that her fingers seemed to lightly sink into as she pressed against it. After a while, however...</span></div></div>",

A pair of wings spread out just in time to right the form, which may not have been the best idea, as it fell face-first into a snowdrift after setting itself properly for being in the air. \"Ungh....\" Came a feminine voice from the hole in the drift, as the figure inside; a woman with a pair of wings, lay unconscious. The fall would have been deadly had the snow not been there, but now, if she wasn't fished out, her odds would be just as grim. But luck was on her side today, as a woman dressed in thick furs dragged the mysterious winged girl to a warm log-cabin, a fire roaring in a hearth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl woke up to find she was lying on a couch, covered in a blanked and her warm wings. She looked around, and spotted the girl, who now had her hood down, revealing  Long black hair that went to her waist, and a fair, beautiful face. \"Who are you?\" The girl asked, the woman jumping a bit, before she realized the girl had just woken up. She went and fetched a pair of mugs filled with warm tea, and sat beside the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kana, but I feel I should be asking you that question...\" the Woman said, handing her a cup, which she gratefully took and drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sarina.\" she said between sips, feeling the warmth return to her fingers and face, and slowly her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarina..A wonderful name. Tell me, are you what I think you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An angel? Yes...Fallen, to be exact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, fallen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was kicked out of heaven...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible! Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A crime I was accused of, but never even committed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How horrible! What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Sarina began, not sure where to start. \"I was always known as a fun-lover, a wild-card, or a trickster among the angels. My antics were the joy of some, the annoyance of others. Then, one day, I met a girl who looked just like me, but she didn't have a pair of wings like I did, and her hair always stayed the same color, unlike mine, as you can see...\" she continued, her hair changing colors as she went through different thoughts as she recalled the story. \"She also only had blue eyes. But still. She was holding a scepter. She ran past me and knocked me over before anything could be done. It took me a moment to realize what the girl had. She had taken God's own scepter....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my....\" Kana said, sitting forward in her chair to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina nodded, and continued. \"It was then that a group of armed angels overtook me and grabbed me. They chained me and took me back to God's court. I was accused of stealing the scepter. I was unlucky, as the judges particularly disliked my tricks, and I was sentenced to be cast out, even though I told them I had done nothing, that I would never dare steal God's scepter, that I didn't even know where it was.\" Her eyes teared up as she finished, and her hair turned pitch black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry...\" Kana said, leaning in and giving Sarina a gentle hug. Sarina cried for a short while before composing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways...\"she said, pushing herself out of the embrace quietly. \"You have saved me, and even though I'm no longer welcome in heaven, I can still grant wishes to mortals. Ask me anything you want, even ask me for more wishes, but don't ask me to be your slave. That is the one request I can and WILL refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thought had never even crossed my mind.\" Kana said honestly. \"I want you to live with me and grant my wishes from now on. You need a place to stay, and I could use some company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever, but I like you. Done. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like you to be my friend. A real friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be glad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like my house to be moved someplace warmer, and close to a city. It's hard to live out here on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a moment, I'll do that now.\" Sarina said, and the house was engulfed in a white light. When it faded, they were in a field not too far from a small town. \"There, is there anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for now, just one more thing. I.........I would like you to become bi-sexual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.......What?\" Sarina asked, a bit startled but fairly sure she had a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, that's how I am, and while A boyfriend is nice now and then, I would like to have a female friend or two I can get close to without them freaking out. Don't worry, I won't do anything you don't want to. I respect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I know, I'm just afraid of what I WILL want you too. Still, I accept.\" she said, reformatting her brain to fit the new sexuality. \"There. You know, that wasn't much of a change, except now I find you a bit attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you.\" Kana said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to get some rest. I'm still not fully healed.\" Sarina said, yawning before she laid back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you go to sleep. I'll just go to town and get a few things.\" Kana said, stepping out the front door into her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3 weeks after the falling.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarina, I'm home!\" Kana called, walking in to find Sarina cooking lunch for the two. They had grown to be almost sisters over a span of 3 weeks. Albeit one sister had mood-hair, two different eyes, wings, and magical powers, but sisters nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Kana.\" Sarina said, pulling a nice-sized chicken from the fire and setting it on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something Sarina...\"Kana said, looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just now noticed how plain you looked on the outside, despite your wings and hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, no, I'm not making fun of you, I'm just saying, you should be as beautiful on the outside as you are on the inside.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, you have the power over that.\" Sarina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\nOk, time for Sarina's makeover. Let's go with:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Kana wishes Sarina had a bit of a rear and breasts, which she grants, and Sarina admires herself, and makes a few more adjustments. This leads to the two enjoying themselves a bit too much, modifying each other and having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Same as #1 but instead of getting an hourglass figure, Sarina casts the wrong spell and packs on a few pounds, which both the girls find nice, and the process of gaining the weight that fast is exhilarating.</span></div></div>",

Finals had passed and he'd finished his engineering courses with top marks and a paper already published. And now all that hustle and bustle was finished. He could finally just lay back and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed perfect that this coincided with the day Murphy's Comet would pass by the Earth, as is does once every 96 years. Alex had seized the opportunity to pack a lunch and drive out to a secluded field that he knew only a few minutes from his apartment. There he could watch the spectacle in piece, the wonders of the universe arcing through the sky above him as the Comet's trail left a meteor shower in it's wake. It was marvelous to see.<br>\r\nBut then something caught Alex's eye. One of the faint twinkles that signaled a meteor burning up in the atmosphere didn't go away. Quite to the contrary, it seemed to glow brighter every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard it; a low rumble steadily growing louder. The light glowed brighter still. Was it getting closer? Alex knew something was definitely wrong. The Comet shouldn't be losing any debris large enough to even impact the Earth, but the flaming ball of rock heading straight for him said differently.When the ground started to tremble, fight or flight instinct kicked in. He tried to scramble to cover, but the meteor impacted the ground before he got far. The was a tremendous explosion, and Alex felt himself sent flying before the world went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She landed on the top of a fairly tall hill, her body badly bruised as a result of the fall. The fallen angel barely managed to get herself up with the power of her wings, dusting herself off after she did so. She then took a look around here and wondered where she was, unsure of what planet she even landed on. The angel scanned her surroundings and came to the conclusion that she was alone\u2026but she wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina soon noticed a little boy no older than 9 hiding behind a tree, scared by the angel\u2019s earlier crash. He looked to be about 4\u20195\u201d or so, with short red hair, blue eyes, and a very skinny build. He was wearing a red cap, a blue shirt, jeans, and dark red sneakers. The boy slowly walked up to the fallen angel, still hesitant to even touch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I won\u2019t hurt you\u201d, Sarina comforted the boy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, little one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Alex\u201d, he replied, looking scared still. \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Sarina. I\u2019m a fallen angel who came down here from Heaven\u201d, she replied, pointing up at the sky above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Really, Miss? You came from all the way up there, above the clouds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how come you\u2019re down here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina\u2019s earlier smile changed to a frown when asked that question. She wasn\u2019t quite ready to talk about that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t tell you right now\u201d, Sarina explained to the boy as she walked up to him and patted his head. \u201cBut could you tell me where I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on Earth, silly!\u201d Alex explained with a joyful, yet also annoyed tone. \u201cAnd this is Dalesburg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarth\u201d? Sarina heard of that planet before when she was still a full angel, but she never explored it. Apparently it was full of life, as well as strange animals and people, or so she remembered from her studies. Meanwhile, Alex was further exploring Sarina\u2019s body, starting with her two different colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Miss, how come you have two different colored eyes? Did you paint one of them?\u201d Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called heterochromia. I was born with these eyes\u201d, Sarina replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also notice that your hair changes color. Earlier when you fell it was dark brown, but now it\u2019s blonde. Why\u2019s that? Do you have mood color hair?\u201d Alex continued to badger Sarina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes. My hair color changes depending on my mood. When I\u2019m happy, it flashes bright colors. When I\u2019m unhappy, it turns dark. It also changes to other various colors depending on my other moods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool. And your white dress is really pretty, as are your wings\u201d, Alex further commented, causing Sarina to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure are a boy of good taste!\u201d Sarina snickered as she blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want something to eat, Miss?\u201d Alex wondered, holding out a bag of fruit snacks his mom gave him as a snack for the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Thank you\u201d, the hungry Sarina replied as she wolfed down the snack in one big gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow!</i> Alex gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, I hate to intrude, but I need a place to heal before I can do much else. Could you perhaps recommend me a place to stay, or perhaps\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust come to my house!\u201d Alex said. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you explain everything to my parents, they\u2019ll let you stay. Besides, I always wanted an older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really\u201d, grinned Alex, who was then playfully smacked upside the head by Sarina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>At Alex\u2019s house</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a lot of struggle to get Sarina to stay at Alex\u2019s house. She had to promise his parents to do chores around the house, as well as baby sit Alex, in order to earn her keep, and even then they only allowed her to stay for 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the house was only built for 3, so Sarina only had two options; sleep on the couch, or sleep with Alex. She chose the latter option as she talked to Alex\u2019s parents outside of their son\u2019s bedroom later that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex still gets scared sometimes of the dark, and even now he wets his bed\u201d, explained his mother Amanda, a 30-something housewife with long, red hair and blue eyes. \u201cIf you could be there to protect him, it would help us so much, Sarina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, Mrs. Alex\u201d, Sarina promised, bowing before her. \u201cYou opened your heart enough to let me stay here. Protecting Alex is the least I can do to repay you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a nice woman\u201d, added in Joe, Alex\u2019s father, a 39 year-old newspaper editor. \u201cThough I\u2019m confused why you always wear wings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, she\u2019s an angel. Remember?\u201d Alex yelled from inside his room to remind his father, who just shook his head. \u201cOf course she has wings. And they\u2019re real!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, go to bed! It\u2019s 9:30 P.M. You should\u2019ve been asleep by now\u201d, Amanda scolded her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d, Alex quietly replied, not wanting to make his mother angry. Sarina then opened the door to his room and sat on the bed beside the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, are you okay with a girl sleeping in your room?\u201d the angel asked the boy, who looked a little confused but happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I slept with Mom on and off until I was nearly 7. Besides, your wings are so soft!\u201d the cheerful boy replied as he rested his head on the angel\u2019s right wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Alex! I promise I\u2019ll make up for this whenever I can!\u201d Sarina told the boy, but he was already fast asleep. Sarina soon joined him, resting on the boy\u2019s surprisingly soft bed and sleeping in a manner of a few minutes. Neither one was aware of the events that were to happen over the following days.</span></div></div>",

Not only did the two play together, but he even wrote her a love poem of sorts when they were playing on the same field they first met at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roses are red,<br>\r\nviolets are blue,<br>\r\ncandy is sweet,<br>\r\nbut not as sweet as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Alex!\" said Sarina as she hugged the young boy. Her hugs seemed to get warmer and a little tighter each day, though Alex had not yet noticed that Sarina slowly grew as the boy's fondness for the angel did. Originally 5'2\" when she arrived on Earth, Sarina now stood at 5'9\", her dress getting a little tighter each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the next week it was more noticeable; Sarina was at that point over 6 feet tall! She kept bumping her head on the ceiling, and her feet stuck out of Alex's bed. The angel and boy talked in the latter's backyard that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarina, are you growing??\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems so. It seems that the more you like me, the more I grow\", Sarina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So if I said you were beautiful and a godmess..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess\", corrected Sarina, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..you'd grow even more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably\", Sarina said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it when you grow. You get prettier and kinder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said a red-faced Sarina, now 6'4\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, Miss Sarina, I love you!\" Alex confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-L-L-Love?!?!\" flushed Sarina, her height quickly escalating upwards from 7 feet..then to 10...then to 20...and even higher up to 65 feet, which it stopped at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!!!\" the boy gasped at the beautiful giantess angel. \"You're the prettiest girl ever!\" The comment caused Sarina to grow even more, this time to 68 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, thank you so much!\" Sarina told the boy as she kissed him on both sides of his face. \"You have helped me more than you could ever imagine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to have helped..but you're too big to live with me now\", Alex sighed as she hugged the angel's left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...but what should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

Good thing for her the landing was soft because she felt like she would have broken something otherwise. She stood up and wiped some dust from her toga. That's when she met a recently heartbroken guy named Rob. He just stood there staring at the fallen angel in complete disbelief at what he'd just witnessed. She stared back at him almost expecting him to run away. That's what most angels did in heaven was run from her. Yet he stayed to her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who or what are you?\" He finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a fallen angel, Sarina.\" Sarina responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fallen angel? Shouldn't you be a little more... Voluptuous like some sort of fantasy drawing? What did you do to deserve to fall from all this heaven stuff that most people believe in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only just got kicked out on terms of receiving potentially useful powers from Satan. I didn't even know it was one of Satan's powers but now here I am on earth. I can't answer you on the voluptuous part because like I said I just got kicked out. And thinking about it maybe it was worth it. I mean punishment is either be whipped by God for all of eternity or get kicked out of heaven, never to return. I don't know about you but it doesn't seem worth the so called eternal happiness isn't really accurate. I mean it wasn't like I was miserable all the time but I was almost never happy. From what rare rumors I heard hell wasn't pain and suffering until the end of eternity like God said it was. I've also heard of demons and dark angels having a pretty good time in hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an atheist actually. I don't believe in any of that biblical stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could see the logic in that. Hey what was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I remember hearing about a Rob who looked just like you. He had some sort of problems with his cheating girlfriend or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's me. I swear she only goes out with guys just because of how attractive they are. She also gets laid too much. When she isn't having sex with one guy she's having sex with some other guy. It's like she wants to get pregnant. She says she doesn't but she also said she wouldn't cheat on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww I'm sorry. I still have my powers so I could do something pregnancy related if you want. I've wanted to be pregnant before believe it or not but I can tell you honestly that I wouldn't go around getting laid at every turn just to try and get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know. That just doesn't feel right. I mean we literally just met and now you're talking about magically getting yourself pregnant.\" Doesn't that seem a bit off to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfectly normal to fly around heaven and get magically pregnant with angels you've just met actually. God doesn't mind if angels are pregnant as long as they didn't have sex in order to get pregnant or become to pregnant to function what so ever. It's one of those weird things that you wouldn't expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I for a second? Aren't you cold? I mean it's the middle of the night during mid fall and you're only wearing a toga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of but nothing I can't tolerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I want you to stay at my place for a while until we can get you up to speed with modern culture and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright if you say so.\"</span></div></div>",

She is an average height woman, not skinny but not fat, pretty much flat in every way. The only thing that sets her out is the fact that she has wings (Don't most angels?). The story begins the same way; she falls from heaven and lands somewhere, badly injured, and must heal up before anything can happen. Why she was cast down can be explained in individual story sections. Her long hair of color that changes to fit her mood (don't ask me why, it just does), reaches down to her waist. Her eyes are red and blue individually.<br>\r\nShe may be a demi-human or a regular human. <br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1)female expansion only (I'm sorry, but this is focusing on a female angel, so keep the expansion female.)<br>\r\n2)While other women may expand, the focus should be Sarina<br>\r\n3)ANY type of expansion is allowed.<br>\r\n4)Sarina must appear as the above description portrays.<br>\r\n5)If Sarina gains weight, she does not develop rolls and extra chins, as would be realistic. She is an angel, so her angellic beauty keeps wrinkles and skin folds from appearing, which applies to fat rolls, even if those are considered to be beautiful. She gets round, her cheeks get full, but she doesn't get rolls.</td>",
