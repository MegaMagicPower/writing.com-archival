It's 10:13. I'm late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you know why I didn't want to get up today? Because today is Monday, August 20th. Do you know what it is about Monday, August 20th that makes me not want to get up? Because Monday, August 20th is the day that my parents are making me go <b>outside</b>. To look for a <b>job</b>. Well, that, and the fact that I hate getting out of bed on any day. But that makes today especially annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI throw on an old beat up punk outfit and hop onto my raggedy bike, ignoring personal hygiene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I guess I have to introduce myself. The names Eddie. Eddie Mayneri. Occupation: Professional Freeloader. When I was little people called me a \"problem child\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm currently living in a one bedroom apartment, which is paid for by my parents. The only catch is, I have to try looking for employment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I'd never actually get a job. I have no work ethic, and I don't see what's so wrong with that. Most people never know true freedom. Most people are brainwashed. Are you truly free in a society where if you don't serve your master 8 hours a day, he won't give you your green paper, and your family will starve to death? Get real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I pretend to try my hardest, send out tons of resumes, then butcher any job interview I get. That way my parents think I'm really trying, and I get to keep my freedom. That's what I plan on doing today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I'm cycling along the road, something intriguing catches my eye. It's an old dirt road, that leads into a forest. Nobody ever uses it...I think. I don't think it goes anywhere either....but for some reason it seems to be....calling me. I feel like I should explore, but I can't just miss these interviews....\"Meh, I have time to check it out real quick.\" I think aloud as I start cycling down the dirt road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only go for a short while before I come to a halt. There's a tall wired fence with a sign plastered to it that says \"PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO TRESPASSING. YOU WILL REGRET.\". \"You will regret?\" Does that mean they're going to shoot me? Or turn me over to law enforcement? Or did I stumble into a 90s horror movie? Pretty crude, but whoever posted this sign seems pretty badass. I suppose a smart person would turn around now. But I'm not smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI toss my bike over the fence, and then climb over it myself. I get on my bike and start peddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes, the atmosphere around me....changes. I feel sorrowful for some reason, and the forest seems....dead. But, I can't stop peddling. \"What the fuck is this place?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 more minutes, I come across some strange pit. I get off my bike, lean over and take a look. In the pit I can see a faint green light...is this a mining operation or something? But I don't see any ladders, or mining equipment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happens suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a push. I'm falling. This is really happening. Someone definitely just pushed me. I'm definitely falling. And I'm definitely going to die here<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I can do is laugh. What a shitty life I had. And I'll never get another one. Ah, well. It's really funny, I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'm about to hit the bottom, I lose consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, I wake up. \"I'm not dead?\" I think to myself. \"How am I not dead?\" \"I'm alive?!?!\" I try to move, but I can't. I try to scream, but nothing happens. I can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste, but I can't move or speak. After examining my surroundings I seem to be in....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sets it down next to you and picks you up, \"I'll be ready in a second mom,\" she hurries to put you on as your view switches to her soft young undeveloped face, to her smooth legs, the towel falls off her right before she steps through you, how does she do that? You wish you had a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You could tell when she pulled you up her legs that you were her panties, but what color you might not know, your face was pressed onto her little ladyhood before it got dark. Then it got even darker when she dressed herself with other clothing, she ran downstairs which jostled you up and she ran into the kitchen. \"Ready mom,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, take a bite of cereal and then we will go.\" She moves again and then you finally feel her slow down from a run to a skip. They were probably heading into the car now. During the car ride you felt a soft embrace from every direction though unlike the light clothing, you felt your sister who felt way too heavy, you couldn't move a muscle sadly.
