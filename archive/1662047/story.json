Everyone came over to celebrate it, including all of your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many hours, your friends go home. After that, your mom, Lynda, comes in with the mail and says, \"Nate, package for you\". You tear it open after your mom leaves. From inside the package, you pick out a jar of candies. \"What are these?\" you ask in confusion,  You see that there is a note with them. It says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are magic candies that will grant your every wish. Wish wisely and Happy Fifteenth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be a joke\" you think. For the heck of it, you decide to give it a try.You pop one of them in your mouth, noticing that they have a fruity taste to them. \"I wish I had 30 dollars\" you wish. Nothing happens. \"Figures\" you say. You place them down on the dining room table and start to go upstairs. Then, you suddenly felt something in your pocket. You pull it out to reveal 30 dollars.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Erin immediately begins pestering her - \"What's in the bag Mom?! Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda smiles coyly. \"I got... Candy!!\" She dumps the contents of her bag on the kitchen table. Snickers, Reese's, Twix, M and M's... The whole lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Why?\" You wonder. Suddenly, you realize. Erin's wish came true...<br>\r\n You glance over and realize that she has come to the same conclusion as you. Uh-oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a smirk on her face, which you know is bad. What is she up to? As she strolls up the stairs to her room, the jar of wishing candies in hand, you can't help but feel nervous.

He's a little bit older than you, 17, but still enjoys spending time with you. He loves to mess with you every once in a while and he's a really funny guy. You know that a few of his jokes will be enough to lighten the ominous mood that comes from knowing that Erin could make a wish on you at any given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh is also a pretty good-looking guy, and he's got a girlfriend to show for it. Her name's Anna, and she's 16. You find her super attractive and you've had a crush on her since middle school, but there's no way anything would ever happen between you two. After all, she's way out of your league and you'd never do anything to hurt Josh. Still, you can fantasize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you've noticed that Josh and Anna have been fighting lately. You think they might break up soon, and this might impact Josh's mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he responds. \"I'm kinda busy at the moment... how about tomorrow night we hang out.

It took a few moments before he realised what happened. <i>I\u2019ve shrunk! It must be Erin! Grr\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to find her when he felt a big itchy sensation in his chest, went back and tried to make it stop. Whether rubbing, scratching or applying ointments, it was all powerless before the omnipotent itch. <i>What the hell is going on?! Was it something in the food? Urggg!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe collapsed onto the bed as the horrible sensation continued, and as it gave signs of letting up he felt the painful sensation of his bones shifting and rearranging themselves. Unlike the itch, this pain passed quickly and he looked down only to find that his arms were extremely skinny. <i>I doubt food poisoning could cause something like this, it must be the candy!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nHe went towards the door once more to interrogate Erin, but he lost his balance and tripped, not realising the full extent of the changes to his body. He attempted to get up from the ground when suddenly his lower body got extremely hot. <i>What\u2019s happening now?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost all sensation of his lower body, and the heat disappeared as quickly as it came. Little did he know that Erin\u2019s figure was peeking through the door and watching. He panted from the exhausting ordeal and hoped this would be the end of it. Alas, it was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a strange sensation go down his back, but he ignored it as it was insignificant compared to everything else. He walked over to the door again, but as he did so, he passed a mirror, glanced at it, walked forward, and then he turned around to look at it again. <i>What in the world?! What have you done, Erin?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflected in the mirror was an adorable twelve-year-old girl wearing a black blouse, skirt, and legwear. Her developing chest poking at her clothes. A terrifying possibility passed through his mind as the missing sensation below came to mind, and he went to check. <i>Nooooooooooooooooo!!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did this happen? Erin had been dissatisfied with being below him in the family totem pole for years, and decided that she would make her way up by turning him into her new little sister. As insurance, she made a wish that he would never make a wish to turn back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went to change her outfit, but she found that most of the outfits were as girly as that one or more so. Sighing, she gave up on changing her outfit and went out to find Erin. <i>Why\u2026?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of tears even poured down her face, the transformation apparently effecting more than just her appearance, but also making her extremely emotional. She ran past a couple of family members, but they acted as if it was perfectly normal for her to be like that which made a disturbing thought rise up in her mind. <i>It couldn\u2019t be that powerful, could it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to Erin\u2019s Room, and caught sight of Erin grinning on her bed, \u201cHey, little sis. Like my present to you? You get to live as Anna, my little sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought went through her head saying that being her little sister might not be too bad, and that he\u2019d live a much better life than as a man, but he quickly discarded those thoughts. <i>What the hell am I thinking?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChange me back! Where are the candies?\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. You will be my little sister forever, ehehe,\u201d her sister replied. She was about to reply to her sister when she started talking again, \u201cThese candies are great. Look\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister hovers above the ground as if gravity doesn\u2019t even exist and flies around freely, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a magical girl! And I get a little sister too, this is great, ehehe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease change me back,\u201d she politely asked. <i>Why won\u2019t she change me back? She\u2019s never been like this. Is this that important to her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, little sis. Relax, we\u2019ll have lots of fun together,\u201d her sister giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew memories from this reality started to sprout one by one next to her old ones, and as she compared them she began having thoughts that being her little sister might not be all that bad. <i>When I think about it, my old life was really dull and boring. No, I\u2019m a boy! I can\u2019t do this\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want\u2026 To be,\u201d she started replying before she stopped. <i>Why change back? It\u2019s so much better like this, stinking male pride. I\u2019ll just get rid of it.</i> The last vestiges of her manhood gradually slipped away, until she completely accepted her new identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2026Yeah\u2026 You might be right, Big Sis. Wanting to go back is a stupid idea, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhehe, I understand, why don\u2019t we play tonight and have some fun?\u201d her sister suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2026Okay\u2026\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It almost sounds like you're a little kid. At least you can walk normally and have your thumbs back so you can open your own presents, and no one seems to notice any of the changes that have happened to you. Maybe you can get a candy from the bag Kate left on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then one of the girls runs up holding a box with a big pink ribbon and says, \"Open mine next.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kate licked on her leg, while Nate grabbed a candy unaware to Erin, thinking in her simple cat mind something along the lines of, \"Wish... human... play...\" Erin squatted down and began to rub Kate, wondering why she was doing this, before eating a candy, disregarding the salmon flavor, and exclaiming, \"I wish I could hear what you stupid cats were thinking!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, her mind was filled was the sounds of cat thoughts, but they were in the tongue in form of cat thought, thus they sounded like cat mewls and gibberish english.

Suddenly, a black tail busts out the rear of Nate's mom's long skirt as her ears became furry and pointed. Guess if Nate's a catgirl, then genetics and all... Oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were still returning to a humanoid form, Nate's mom turned to Erin, and looked at the cat that was her (now second eldest) daugher and figured she had to turn her back as well, but said, \"She disobeyed me, and got herself turned into a cat as a result. Since she likes being a cat...\" She suckles on a candy and says, \"I wish that Erin, my second eldest daughter, er... um... I guess...\" Nate's mom swished her tail as she puzzled on how to phrase this punishment of a wish. \"...was some kind of anthropomorphic cat, since she like disobeying me and turning herself into a cat so much...\" She watched as Erin grew in size as well, but not as much as Nate or Kate, and saw only small blotches of fur shed away. Her shirt and skirt found itself back on her, but under her shirt was six C-cup breasts, and sprouting from the low collar of the shirt was a thick tuft that grew from her cleavage. Most of her back, all of her hands and forearms, feet and shins, inner thighs and groin, and a line down the center of her abdomen across her navel up to her cleavage was all covered in fur, while the rest of her was smooth and the domain of striped skin. Her legs were still digitgrade like an animal, her feet looking more like paws, while her hands looked like a mix of paw and hand, tipped in retractable claws. Erin's face seemed closer to human, but had the slightest, minutest signs of muzzle distortion, her nose close to flat on her face and resembling a cat's wet pink nose, with whiskers down below., her mouth filled with sharp canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's mom picks up the candies and puts them in a small bowl she had brought with her. She smiles to Nate and says, \"I see you had an interesting 'accident.' I've returned you back to a form that allows you sentience, but next time, be careful... however, now I got to worry about whether or not I'm going to be a grandmother at the age of 29...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate suddenly remembers what they did as cats, and blushes profusely, then says, \"Mom, how did you know what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tells Nate, \"Before I gave you the candies, I used one to allow me to know if you guys got into trouble, like you got in a dangerous predicament and were out of candies, a wish went awry and someone got hurt or worse, or like this case and you got your minds wiped or, more precisely, suppressed, because you turned yourself completely into animals, and would let me see what happened to you. Erin was supposed to turn you back, but she didn't listen, got herself turned into a cat, and well, cats will be cats... So that's why I did that to her... Speaking of her...\" She turns to Erin. \"Young lady, there's some dishes with your name on them...\" She points at the door, and Erin tries to argue, but can only mew in disagreement, the human tongue something she didn't get back in the wish, and decides not to argue, obeying her mother this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then interjects, \"Wait, you're not 29...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derrr... Magic candies.\" Nate's mom quips, popping one in her mouth and melting away the years, before handing them back to the duo. \"Now, don't do anything dumb like that again. You're already probably a daddy, Kate. However, let's not dwell on that. It's Nate's birthday, or should I say, Natalie? We're here to celebrate!!\" She goes to leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor runs up just as your mom is leaving. he appears to still be all human, and is yelling, \"Why isn't Natalie downstairs?! She's missing her own party!! <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">I want cake.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate smirks and says to Nate, \"Well, what now, <i>Natalie</i>?\"</span></div></div>",

Then the fur started to recede into her tail until a beautiful pink was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the now gray cat ears on her head started to lose definition and become larger and flatter.

She looked at you and said \u201c there now this is less ordinary\u201d she then starts to inspect her new body. She looks at you and smiles and says \u201c So Nate what do you think of me now?\u201d striking some sexy poses for you to look at.

Luckily, it was so small, it only left a crater that destroyed the four-way intersection. Nate ran out to investigate, feeling almost compelled to do so. Going down into the crater, Nate finds a tiny orb with circuitry all over it. When picks it up, a gas spritzes the girl Nate and causes her to gag. Suddenly, her ears and spine feel weird, as her ears rose up her head. With a loud rip, a black furred tail tore out the back of her pants, and then without warning, her breasts jumped up four cup sizes, to a F-cup. She also feels her muscles grow stronger and more flexible, but not larger in the slightest bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Nate's mind was bombarded with ancient alien knowledge. She was now a nekomimi, the first in the resurrection of a long dead peaceful race killed off when space wizards sicced zombies on them. All the ancient neko science and technology flowed through Nate's mind, but more importantly, the means to revive her new race. It would seem nekomimi can reproduce like humans, but also have a once every three year estrus they enter where they become extra fertile. Also, whenever nekomimi go into \"season,\" they also generate a virus they spread through bodily fluids like saliva or the dander and fur on her tail (Sweeping their tails under another's nose was usually a very good way to spread the disease). It would turn the infected into a neko themselves, but since the entirety of the nekomimi race was female (they mated with a more anthro all-male feline race back on their old homeworld, and could bare children with many other humanoids, including possibly humans, but their children born to non-feline fathers, though always female and had a tail, resembled their father race much more [meaning nekos with human ears and cat tails]). It was another way to shore up the race's numbers seeing as the race was a female-only race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate tried to come to grips with the fate this orb has bestowed on her. Finally, she decided she would bring back this long lost race, but at the same time, try not to destroy, or anger, the human race. She decided she was the right thing... And it just so happened that Nate was \"in season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did Nate go to first...?</span></div></div>",

For the next five hours, you get to be a playful boy bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach back to find you even have a bunny tail sticking out of a hole in your jeans. \"Ha ha, funny joke. What am I supposed to do now? I can't go out like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1. You also have a rabbit's foot with all the good luck protecting you from harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2.

Your feet became perfectly arched for heels as your toes smoothed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? I only wished to show my breasts off\" you said to yourself. However, the wish wasn't listening as your thigh muscles became stronger and womanly fat and tissue began to buildin your hips, stretching them out. Your hourglass figure began to form as your black swimshorts started to shrink, showing off more of your soft legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's gone too far. I didn't want it to go that far\" you said to yourself. Then, you started thinking about how good your legs looked and how many men would stare at them. You then realized how bad the situation was. You were also mentally changing. You didn't have the candies with you so you couldn't reverse this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes continued as your butter expanded outwards to compliment the hips. Soon enough, they were luscious enough for any man to hold as they stretched out your changing shorts. They almost looked like bikini bottoms now, except for the bulge where your manhood was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour waist shrank inwards, completing the hourglass figure. Your body became lean and slim, your stomach flattening and thrusting out a bit. Your breasts stayed the same at a C-cup. Your arms thinned out with lack of muscle with small hands. Your fingers extended slightly with your fingernails becoming longer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop. This can't be...Wow do I look hot\" you said with a smile as your new personality began to take over. You were slowly losing your mind and it scared you at how things had come to this. All you wanted was to experience a girl's life for a bit. Now, you might become one forever. Your voice became higher to a nice girl tone as the changes extneded to your face. Your lips puffed out and your cheeks became softer. Your eyebrows thinned with the lashes becoming longer. Your eyes became a beautiful shade of green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, your brown hair flowed out of your head, becoming a long mane of waist-length hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your penis dissappeared into a new vagina, your last thoughts as Nate were <i>'How things could go wrong so quickly'</i>. That's what you thought as Nate merged into a new female soul, creating a new 24-year old woman. Your plan had backfired and you didn't have the candies to reverse it, molding you into a new woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steph, you coming?!\" yelled a girl from a ways down the beach. You, now called Stephanie Cook, smiled at the sound of your friend's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" you said as you ran down the beach, your breasts bouncing as you did. You were truely showing them off now, in a way only a true woman can. You remembered graduating college with aspirations of being an actress. You actually were just casted into a new movie that would begin filming soon, and you were enjoying time with friends from college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life is good\" you said with a smile as you ran down the beach, ready to start your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Home*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that, despite your belief that your wish had gone too far, it was actually a wish made by your sister, Erin. She wished for you to become a beautiful actress to enjoy a good life and get out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he remembers me at all, he'll thank me eventually. Sure, he's not a part of this family anymore but now he's set for life. And I get these to myself\" said Erin as she looked at the jar of candies in her hands.</span></div></div>",

As you've come to learn from your experiences so far, the candies did grant your every wish, but with little twists here and there; It was a scenario very much resembling the old saying \"Be careful what you wish for.\" Well, whatever, you simply closed your eyes as to brace yourself for whatever scenario the candies had in mind for you and your new 'accessories.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You could see a bright white flash from your closed eyes and, out of the blue, you could hear the chitter and chatter of voices. You opened your eyes and found yourself in an unfamiliar bathroom. There wasn't much to describe about the restroom, it looked just as any would. This left you with no indication as to where you were. The only hint was that the restroom was rather large and very clean. You looked about and walked around as to get a feel; The restroom was about the size of your own bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow.\" You sighed in awe, impressed. \"Whoever's place I'm at, they must be pretty well off!\" You exclaimed. You quickly put your hands to your mouth in an effort to hush yourself, not wanting to bring yourself attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked down to yourself, relieved to find the candies hadn't turned you into anything. No, you were exactly as you left yourself; Your sleek looking black bra, your pair of men's shorts and a pair of white socks on your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Then, you recalled. \"The candies! Where are they!\" You panicked, looking about the large restroom, searching from their laundry basket, to inside the shower, inside any cabinet. You practically cleaned the place out before recalling where you left them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You reached into your pocket and felt the bag of candies there. \"Phew!\" You breathed, wiping a sweat from your forehead in a relieved manner. Now all that was left to do was... Go into the chatter of voices you heard beyond the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"This is it...\" You nervously moaned, looking into the mirror to check over your breasts one more time. This was what you wished for, to show off your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You slowly turned the doorknob and pushed the door open. The place, the party you guessed, was filled to the brim with people. People here, people there, everywhere! There was one detail that you noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     All of the party's guests were...</span></div></div>",

From what you could tell, it wasn't too big like a mansion, but probably a bit bigger than your own house. You had never seen so many adults in one spot before though, being that you mostly went to parties involving a lot of teenagers. This was definitely a bit outside your comfort zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, you weren't really dressed that well. You looked down, seeing that you just had the bra over your breasts on your torso. Beyond that, you had your dark shorts and underwear, followed by plain white socks on your feet. You looked bad, even for casual wear. What if you went out like this? Would they laugh at you? Then again you wanted to show your breasts off. Man, were you really fixated on those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, can I use the restroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a male voice say that politely to your face, as if nothing was wrong. It reminded you that you were standing in the restroom, looking like you were lost. You then shook your head and allowed him to enter. When that door closed, you looked out to the crowd, happily talking with each other. You took a deep breath, not knowing really what to do. There seemed to be a kitchen off to the left, and other rooms such as the family room over to the right. You looked down to your hands, seeing the little jar of candies still there. Should you wish for something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I feel so anxious right now.\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely even thinking, you reached in and grabbed a candy, popping it into your mouth. However, you didn't immediately think of a wish. You just wanted something comforting. The people didn't pay you much mind, attending to their own business, even as you began walking. You sidestepped between some people, although you had no sense of direction in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a bit messy.\" you said to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifferent thoughts began coming into your head, with the candy still in your mouth. Without even thinking about it, your lips began moving to one specific thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat thought was that?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One thought seemed to be coming to mind. Just one thought process. One thing you noticed was how much taller the adults were. You were just a teenager after all, and the adults were pretty tall and towered over you. Even the women, with their high heels, looked taller than you. You didn't have anything like that on your feet. You just had your socks, that looked very ill-fitting for this occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was taller.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words came right out of your lips; right as you thought about how tall everyone was. Part of you wanted to fit in here, so you had to fit in some how. Perhaps you could gain a few inches or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" You winced to yourself as you almost one-hopped for a second. You suddenly felt a little bit of squishing on your feet. Luckily, no one noticed you acting weird, or maybe they were just used to it. After you got your foot back down, you looked down at your feet, your eyes widening a bit as they did. Your socks seemed to be morphing right before your eyes, shifting and twisting around your feet. As they did, they seemed to be pressing more around your feet, making them feel a bit squished. First of you, you noticed how the hem of the socks on your ankles began shrinking, showing more of your ankles as they did. In addition, you saw the socks beginning to divide down the middle; the smooth upsides of your feet beginning to be shown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" You heard a voice from behind you; seeing some random guy behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around a bit to let him through as it caught you a bit off-guard. Right as you spun around to let him by, you heard a <b>*CLANK* *CLANK*</b> on the ground, right near where you were judging by the sound. You looked back down, seeing the tops of your feet totally exposed. However, underneath your socks, a solid footing had formed, giving you that sound from earlier. Before you could think about it, the socks as a whole began hardening, squishing your feet even more as they solidified. A solid black coloring washed over the socks, taking away their former grey look. To be honest, they almost looked like ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these doing on my feet?\" You asked yourself. Still, you had to admit.....they were a bit cute. You shook your head a bit as you thought that, wondering where it came from. Right after that, the front of both shoes, as you could call them that, opened up, showing two pairs of toes. Both of them looked....how could you put it.....prettier than before. They were smooth and the nails were perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what is....WOAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt yourself prop up, as you seemed to grow about a few inches. Almost immediately, you seemed level with most of the people, although you had trouble trying to remain balanced for some reason. You looked down again, and you saw that at least 3 inch heels had sprouted beneath your newly-transformed socks; turning them into, frankly, into a cute pair of black high heels. Your feet twisted and ached a bit, as they gently curved into the heels, giving them a bit of a natural and feminine curve to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, these are like Mom's.\" You said agape, although you closed your mouth soon. \"Still, they do make me taller. Perhaps I could actually talk with someone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your heels clack along the ground, you got more used to them with each step, although you had to move your legs in a certain way just to keep yourself from falling down. The fact that you were wearing women's shoes didn't seem to affect you at all.</span></div></div>",

Your feet strongly resembled a woman's, reminding you much of your Mother's preference in shoes. You looked down once more, your feet were truly perfect, from your toes to the arched shape your feet now had; they fit in well among the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Feeling a bit less insecure about your appearance, you tried your best to put on a smile and walked along, the clicking and clacking with each step was still something to get used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"OOH!\" you cooed in a certain exhilaration as you continued. \"Look at those! That's a really nice style of heel! Those are definitely a must-have in my collection...\" You said to yourself, envying another woman's heels, a royal blue colored pair of pumps. Your newfound interest in high-heeled shoes weirded you out a bit, and, you had not the slightest idea what it was you were talking about when you said 'collection.' But, you decided to just shrug it off and go about your business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You took a pause from your walking and stood still, finally beholding what looked to be a living-room type area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Great!\" You chirped. \"I could use a seat.\" You smiled, walking over to one of the sofas there, placing your rear end as to sit. It felt good to finally grab a seat amidst all this oddness. You sat there, alone, no one else you knew, in this strange, new environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you sat there, you pleasantly crossed your legs and crossed your arms across your chest. You looked around, seeking some sort of interaction, this loneliness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...\" You stood silent. You even began to grow envious of a couple that lay about the sofa across the room, in front of you, parallel to where you sat. On that couch across you was a man, sitting up straight, with a woman lying down in front of him, her legs on the man's lap. The man and woman looked to be a couple, both looked happy, content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you saw the woman laying there, that feeling of self-consciousness arose again. You were no longer envious of company, but... As strange as it may have sounded, her legs caught your attention. Her smooth, long, beautiful legs on the man's lap. They were absolutely gorgeous, the woman's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked around, attempting to put the thought out of your mind. But, again, self-consciousness. A small group of women were standing about, talking about this and that. Each of these women donned beautiful dresses and heels, and great pairs of clean-shaven beauties called legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You decided to look down to yours, and beheld the exact opposite. Your own legs were still clearly male. For some reason, you thought they looked absolutely disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Eeew...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You rubbed your legs, feeling the forest of hair that was about them. You hated the feeling. They were hairy, rough, big, muscled; Nothing like the women of this party. You knew what had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You smiled, popped a candy in your mouth and wished, staring at the legs of the group of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I wish my legs were longer and smoother, like the women at this party.\" You spoke, sucking on the candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your eyes then glued to your legs. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dud.\" You sighed. They were still hair-covered, rough legs of nastiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Giving up on the thought of better looking legs, you sat in your solitude, staring into space. As you stared out into the party, something a bit peculiar caught your eyes. In the crowd of people, there stood a man, his eyes glued on you for some reason. You raised an eyebrow in utter confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What could he be staring at?\" Even as you looked to him, he continued staring. He probably didn't even notice you were looking to him. You looked around. No one was in that area the man was staring into but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Me?\" You asked yourself. You looked to your legs, flabbergasted at what you found there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Gone were those big, masculine legs of yours. You looked to find clean-shaven, curvaceous pale white legs of beauty. You rubbed them, humming in delight as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nice.\" You smiled, feeling up your thighs, which were now covered in the womanly fat that replaced the muscly contents you once called your own. Now, the legs you had perfectly matched your heels and the delicate feet they covered. Again, your legs reminded you of those one of your teachers was well known for. Ms. Wilson, your math teacher, of 25 years, with whom every guy in your class, including you, had a crush on, if only for the fact that all she wore were dresses that left just enough leg showing for the males to yearn for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked back to your legs, then to the man, right into his eyes. This time, you know he noticed. His eyes widened, he blushed a bit until he finally fled from your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You simply smiled, got up and continued browsing the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to the bag of candies and laughed. \"You and I are going to have a whole lot of fun tonight!\" You laughed, your heels clicking on the tiled floor in synchronization with your steps.</span></div></div>",

The question though was what to do next. You were now wearing sexy heels with your nice feet, and you had a nice pair of legs. What could you do next? There were quite a few candies left, so there was no danger of running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you enjoyed the little bit of attention you got thanks to your legs. It was the same attention the other women got, although they still got more than you did. Still, it wasn't so bad. However, you still didn't even know what the party was for in the first place. You were thinking so much about it that you actually didn't notice yourself popping in another candy. You didn't really have a lot of company here. Even though the adjustments you made helped with your ability to fit in, there was still a piece lacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I at least had some company I knew.\" You sighed to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, although no one else seemed to notice, you could have sworn you saw some kind of brief flash over in the little hallway to the side. Most of the partygoers weren't there, so you wondered what it could be. Candies still in hand, you walked over to the hallway, avoiding some of the other people, and looked around the corner. You gasped a bit as you did. You saw a familiar girl there; about 13 years old, 4'11 in height, blue eyes, and shoulder-length brunette hair. It was Erin, your little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, what are you doing here?\" You asked, almost as if you forgot your wish. Erin seemed as confused as you, although her eyes widened at the candies in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate, is that you?\" She asked you, looking at your clean-shaven legs and nice heels. \"Wow, you did a nice job with your legs. I'm digging the heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You smiled at her. \"I thought I might fit in better with them. Everyone else was getting some good attention with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did that to get attention? Wow.\" Erin said to you, before shaking her head. \"Anyway, that's not the point. Did you wish me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm aware of your candies. I saw you use them. They're definitely magic.\" Erin said to you. \"And you wished me here for some reason? Actually, where is here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's some kind of party, although I'm not sure where. I'm enjoying it enough though.\" You shrugged your arms. \"I guess I did wish for some company, and apparently you fit the bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Just great.\" Erin sighed as she looked over herself. She looked like someone who was just lounging around at home. She was still wearing socks, much like you were, and her light blue shorts and plain t-shirt. Kind of boring for a party. Then again, you only had a bra on your own chest. \"I don't look ready for a party. Besides, what if Mom and Dad are worried about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just wish back or something, but I'm enjoying this so far.\" You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could use the break as well.\" sighed Erin. \"Although I don't think you should use those candies so much. Are you eating one right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really a worrywart. That's not like you.\" You said to her. Perhaps it was the new part of you talking, but you wanted Erin to really enjoy herself here. Sighing, a new train of thought came as your lips began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish.....\"</span></div></div>",

She proceeded to put both hands in front of her, in a halting-like gesture. \u201cSlow down there, Bro!\u201d She continued. For whatever reason, you obeyed, promptly and without question, your lips yielded with your unspoken wish. In your halting, you accidentally swallowed the candy held in your mouth. \u201cThere goes that\u2026\u201d You thought to yourself, gulping down what was left of the candy. One wish, gone with a gulp.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat the heck, Erin!\u201d You cursed. \u201cI just wasted a wish \u2018cause of you!\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cHey! Where\u2019s the blame coming from?\u201d Erin calmly asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to swallow the candy, I just told you to slow down.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You took a deep sigh. There\u2019d be no winning this argument with her. Just like she had since the two of you were tots, she managed to turn the tables on you, and victimize herself in the process, making you appear the villain.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI guess\u2026\u201d You sighed, again, defeated. \u201cSo, why\u2019d you stop me then?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI saw where you were going! Don\u2019t take me for some kind of moron.\u201d She said. \u201cI saw the look in your eye, the way you spoke to me. You were going to wish on me! And don\u2019t even tell me you weren\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201c\u2026\u201d You stood silent. Defeated, again.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You looked to Erin, and there she stood, in the typical \u2018annoyed-woman-pose,\u2019 as you called it. Her arms were crossed about her chest, and her hips leaned leftwards. All the while, her eyes handed you a disapproving stare.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      \u201cYour silence says everything.\u201d She finished. \u201cBut, I can\u2019t say you\u2019re wrong\u2026\u201d She continued, offering a smile. Now you were confused, shaking in your heels.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI mean what I say. You\u2019re right! I mean, we have magic, wish-granting candies in our hands. If Mom or Dad begin to worry, or something, we can wish ourselves back at home, just like that! And, I guess I have been needing a break! This is a unique opportunity!\u201d She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a way out of my monotonous old life for a while!\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Just as you were about to speak up, Erin snapped her hand towards the bag of candies you held, swiping one, right from your hands. Erin wasted no time in unwrapping it and popping it right in her mouth.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cHey!\u201d You protested, stomping a heel to the ground, unknowingly.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     She gave a small giggle and a smile, a devious smile. Just like Erin, the typical teenager; Cunning and snake-like. What she\u2019d do with that candy is beyond you. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Just then, Erin looked down to her feet, wiggling her toes in her white and blue striped socks. Then she looked to your heels.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI wish that I had shoes that fit this scenery!\u201d She chirped.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOh no\u2026\u201d You worried aloud. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat?!\u201d She entered. \u201cMad that I used one of your candies?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cThen, what are you freaking out about?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYou know how these wishing things are! They\u2019re like in the movies, you have to be really specific! There\u2019s nothing specific about what you just said\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     At first, Erin looked completely fear-struck. Then, out of the blue, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOoh!\u201d She chimed. \u201cI felt something tugging at my feet!

Your eyes looked down to her, as you were quite anxious to see the beginning of what would become of your sister. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOh!\u201d Erin happily exclaimed. \u201cThey\u2019re amazing!\u201d Erin chirped, beholding the black heeled sandals that dressed her feet. Her petite feet were left exposed, in the open. Erin liked this, liked this a lot, do did you\u2026<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWow.\u201d You said in a sort of awe. \u201cThose are quite nice\u2026\u201d You sighed, a bit enviously.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Erin raised an eyebrow and looked to you in what could only have been described as extreme bewilderment. No one else seemed to pay your comment any mind. Heck, you hardly noticed anything wrong with what you\u2019ve just said. It was just your sister who seemed a bit disturbed by your comment.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      \u201cUhm\u2026 Did you say what I think you just said? My heels are \u2018quite nice?\u2019\u201d Erin inquired.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYes, I did just say that, actually.\u201d You justified.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cUhm\u2026 Are you alright, Nate?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNever been better!\u201d You stated. \u201cI should be asking you the same thing.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Erin asked, now beyond bewilderment.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone react so strangely to just a simple compliment. I just said I like your heels! They\u2019re gorgeous!\u201d You continued, not noticing your speech. \u201cThey show off your legs and all that so well!\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Erin\u2019s perplexity seemed to die right there as she blushed a little at your comment. \u201cYeah, they do show off my legs, don\u2019t they? Thanks!\u201d Erin chimed, suddenly dismissing her brother\u2019s attitude. <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     \u201cSure thing!\u201d You chirped. \u201cJust one tiny thing, though\u2026\u201d You said, continuing to look over your sister. \u201cThose clothes\u2026\u201d You sighed.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     Erin began to get a defensive look about her. \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with my clothes?\u201d Erin defensively questioned.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWell\u2026 It\u2019s not that anything is wrong with them. It\u2019s just that, they\u2019re not exactly what I\u2019d call suited for a party like this.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cReally?\u201d Erin asked self-consciously. She looked over her blue gym-type shorts and pinched her plain white tee.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWell, if you wanna be like that\u2026\u201d Erin began, \u201cI could say the same thing about you! Heck, you\u2019re still in those boxers and that bra!\u201d Erin argued, not noticing her sudden personality change. Never had she been the type to really care about clothes all that much; Neither had you, up until now. Here you two stood, from kids to the fashion police. Neither of you seemed to mind, strangely enough.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWell!\u201d You stepped back, taken back by her comment, left in shock. You looked over your clothes, suddenly feeling awkward in your clothes. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWell\u2026 I guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d You shrugged. \u201cThese things are so unsuited for someone of my likes\u2026\u201d You sighed, defeated, pulling on your shorts.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Erin stood proud in her victory, for only the shortest of moments before realizing that you, too, had a point. She looked over herself once more and sighed, conquered. <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     \u201cI guess you had a point, as well\u2026\u201d Erin murmured. There goes her personality changing. Erin was definitely the sore-loser type, one who would never admit defeat. And, her vocabulary was definitely more refined than the usual. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     Erin looked to you and giggled a bit.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYou\u2019re clothes are unfit for this, my clothes are unfit for this occasion. So, why not change it? But, here\u2019s the twist! You proceeded. \u201cI wish on you, and you wish on me! Just for the fun.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Erin grinned. \u201cOoh! That does sound like something fun! Sounds fine to me!\u201d She laughed, popping a candy in her mouth as you did the same.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I want to go first!\" Erin was perhaps a bit too excited for this, which made you laugh a bit. Here you two were; standing oddly in some party wearing casual clothes and high-heels and yet you both seemed excited at the prospect of more wishing being done. It kind of made you wonder if anything could go wrong from it, but you seemingly just shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right, go ahead. Just don't do anything crazy.\" you said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would be the fun in that? I thought we were going with the letting loose thing.\" smiled Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you have a point.\" You weren't sure overall. You wanted to go along with it, although you still kind of felt weird about it all. On one hand, you felt like really enjoying yourself here, like Erin said. On the other hand, you knew that you were a guy wished here by accident. Still, you felt good about yourself regardless, seeing your long and feminine legs ending in a pair of black high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now no more talk about that.\" Erin then looked at you closely, putting on a thinking face. \"So, what to do about you. You've got heels and some very nice legs. Still look kind of weird with just that bra on though. Hmm.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin seemed to really take her time with this, while everyone else still walked all around you two. Then, her eyes popped open with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" She said excitedly. \"I wish you had a lovely dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened a bit as she said that. As much as you wanted to say something, you couldn't as you felt the changes coming very quickly. You gasped a bit as your shoulder bra straps retracted to your bra cups, creating a strapless bra. However, it didn't stay that way for long. The bra soon tightened a bit against your chest, holding your breasts firmly. Slowly, the material softened from bra material to something more like satin. Then, the bottom of your bra began to coast down your torso, flowing along and covering your belly button. At the same time, your shorts were rapidly turning the same shade of black as the bra, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped a bit as you heard ripping along the inside of your short leggings. The ripped shreds then weaved together, taking away the separation between your legs, allowing your long legs to feel each other. The material then softened to the same material as the bra, becoming black satin as well. Eventually, the hem of the extending bra reached the \"shorts\", fusing together into one garment. Then, the skirt part extended a bit, going down to about your knees. Just like that, you were wearing a sleeveless black dress, which really hugged on your slim and still manly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh.\" you said to yourself. The dress was....gorgeous actually. The way the tops of your breasts could be seen through the top felt so nice, and you felt a lot of freedom from the skirt part. \"This is amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it.\" said Erin with a smile. \"That dress looks so flattering on you.\" There was that fashion police thing again. Erin never cared much before, but she was really liking it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I like how it shows my breasts a bit.\" You said, still smiling. \"I wonder if someone will notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy were you thinking this much about your breasts? You liked them for sure, but this was a little far. To be honest, your memory of how you got here was getting a bit hazy as well. You remembered Erin and the candies and all that, but how did you get here again? You shook your head, hoping that it just the heat of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reviewing yourself, you had heels and a dress now, though you still had male underwear beneath. Your legs were long and feminine, but it ended there with your still male hips and butt. As for Erin, her only change was her high-heeled sandals. So where could you go with this? You began to think of what you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as you did, words seemed to dance upon your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you could fit in with everyone else here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly the most specific wish, but it seemed to have the desired effect. Erin seemed to freeze a bit as her clothes began to contort and twist, joining in the middle as one garment. A soft blue color washed over the material, which in turn seemed to turn softer with each passing second. The bottom part flowed out into an impressive a bit flowery skirt, dancing around her thighs. The tops were just two straps over her shoulders with an impressive dip into her chest. As you would expect, there were no sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" As the changes died down, Erin looked at her \"grown-up\" dress. \"I never got to wear one of these before. Mom would always say I wasn't old enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there aren't age restrictions on these.\" you smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. This is really cool.\" said Erin, who seemed to be really having fun now. Though, she seemed to have a thoughtful look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Erin?\" you asked.

Were the two of you too far gone? Within no time at all, these once burning questions, too, simmered in the environment. You dismissed both the questions, and the extreme enthusiasm your little sis had about her. This was, after all, a party, a chance to get away from it all and mellow out, even if it was but for a single evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"All right!\" you squeaked, feeding, like a parasite, off of the zeal of Erin. \"Who goes next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Erin laughed in amusement, shifting her focus from the dress to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know exactly what goes next!\" She smiled in a particular exuberance. \"Remember, we're taking turns here!\" she continued, swiping a candy from your hands and plopping it into her mouth. \"By the way, just by looking over your dress, I can tell that you're still wearing mens underwear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"How could she have known that?\" You asked yourself. Well, no matter how she knew or could have figure it out, this much you needed, and knew to be necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She furnished a devious smile across her face, looking to your hip/butt region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I wish you had the hips, butt and undergarments that would ideally compliment that absolutely dazzling dress you've got there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       If ever there was a specific wish, this was probably it. The last thing you noticed before the effects of the wish commenced was Erin's vocabulary, the way she wished that wish of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Absolutely Dazzling...?\" you knew your sister to be nowhere near such heights in the realm of vocabulary. You knew her vocabulary to be that of most any teenage girl, using words like 'totally awesome,' or 'so cool,' rather than \"Absolutely dazzling...\" But, despite  whatever you were pondering on the subject of Erin's vocabulary the beginning of your changes cleared away those thoughts as an eraser to the written word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Though you could see nothing, you felt your rear bubble up and inflate, almost as a balloon. Once the inflation ceased, you decided to grab for a feel. What you felt there left you speechless. All you could feel was a firm, lovely butt that you'd imagine most women would dream for. It felt just as you imagined any woman's would feel. Going by the size of the butt, by no means was it underside, but, at the same time by no means was it oversized, either. Proportionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The next change you could see, thankfully. Your hips graciously expanded and widened, having rid of the male bulkiness you had come to know. The hips widened and thicker, perfectly pairing up with the thighs and legs you had come to develop in the hour, giving you a nice curve about your body. This also left you with the bottom-most portion of the hourglass-like figure, you, as a man, knew men loved to see. Why you considered what men would want to see was beyond you, but, this, too, you simply brushed aside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n      As for the final change, you could only feel it. You felt your large, almost short-life underpants shrink and shrivel, retaining their cotton material, into a nice, delicate pair of Women's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So.\" Erin smiled, looking you over, proud of her work. \"What do you think of your modifications?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You stood there lacking in words, simply feeling up your butt and staring down your hips, and the way they amazingly cooperated with the dress, in a certain awe. The dress, at least from the hips and butt down, looked absolutely amazing. The curve your hips made, the legs and thighs, the way it all worked so well with the dress, tight at the hips, but flowing and liberating below, leaving a nice breeze to brush your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"This... is... amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I must say...\" she said, \"You do look lovely, brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       For one reason or another. this sent you blushing violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well. Thank you!\" you proudly responded, feeling the sides of your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You looked to Erin, who stood there, providing you a curious look and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"So, what happens next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       What was to come next? In your mind, you still questioned whether or not the two of you were too far gone, too vastly changed. Would things ever be the same, after this whole affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Once more, you simply dismissed it as...</span></div></div>",

You were fine when you wished for breasts earlier, but now you and Erin were really getting into new territory here. Where you both really too far gone by now? Your bottom half was completely that of a woman except for your manhood, which your new panties seemed to contain well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this was fun, so you decided to dismiss it for now as.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? What? What was going on again? Right as you thought that, your mind seemed to fog up a bit, disorienting you from what was happening. Your head didn't exactly hurt, but it was discomforting to say the least. You put a hand up to your aching head, getting Erin's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother? Are you okay.....\" At the same time, Erin began grasping her head a bit too, groaning a little bit as she held her head. \"I.....I..I'm going to go for a little walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this mental state where no one really know what was going on, Erin ended up taking the jar of candies. You didn't really seem to mind or notice though as you leaned against a wall briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What....what was I doing again?\" You still remembered who you were mostly, but your mind just now seemed incredibly cloudy. You had to work to keep yourself balanced on your heels as you leaned against the wall. Actually, you couldn't really remember the events of just a few minutes ago. In addition, it seemed to be spreading, as more events seemed to cloud up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I have too many candies...or..what?\" It was really confusing, though it looked like the party guests left you alone for now. You staggered along the wall for now, trying to reach the bathroom. You did just that, making it in your own way there and opening the door. After closing it, you looked into the mirror, seeing that nothing major had changed. Perhaps it was just your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even as you decided to leave, something seemed off. Internally, you knew that you were 15 years old. However, for some reason, a different number seemed to be in your brain. 20? 20 years old? Did that make much sense? You were too disoriented to really tell. Your body did feel older though, since you grew another inch and your breasts got just a tiny bit bigger as did the hips, becoming a tiny bit more adult-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really sure how to handle this. Though, you did have one more candy with you before Erin walked off. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      You held your head, firmly, rubbing it in a circular motion in an attempt to console, to alleviate, the storm that had ravaged your mind, your memories being among the debris. You considered all that had happened thus far, you remembered things like the candies, Erin wishing on you, you changing from the hips down, growing breasts, suddenly finding yourself donning a dress... This much you knew was certain, though... The foggier parts of your memory were a bit more difficult to explain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     For one reason or another, you settled on your age being, more or less, 20, despite the fact you knew your true age to be 15. 20 just sounded right, and, the body you called your own was certainly not that of a 15 year old boy. Despite your dress, your butt, your breasts, you were reminded of your gender by the bulge that came from underneath the crotch area of your dress. However, this was the only reminder of your manhood. And, for one reason or another, you just... Didn't feel like you were... You. Almost like you were somebody else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You stopped rubbing your head forthwith, the disorientation slowly, but surely, fading. That monster headache was gone, at last. The moment you stopped and looked around for a bit, examining the clothes you wore for a bit, you looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Looks like the party's still going strong...\"  You scratched the back of your head, noting that more people had definitely showed up to... Whatever this get-together was. As per the time you and Erin had been here, the party was filled with adults, most of whom you assumed to be men and women ranging from late 20's to, at least, mid-30's. Then again, this was only an assumption... Then you thought in a certain urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"ERIN.\" You exclaimed, turning a few heads, viciously searching the room, completely struck with panic. \"Erin?! You around?!\" You called, now roaming the halls of this mystery house, checking every nook and cranny, every slightly open door... It was at this point when you realized just how many people were here. This only made you wonder what sort of event this was, relatively young men and women, all looking incredibly spiffy, formal, well-dressed. The women wore amazing looking dresses, the men donned suits, almost business like, and, you hated to admit it... But, they did look... Handsome... What sort of event was all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm certain she walked this way...\" you stopped in your tracks, in the middle of another packed hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Maybe you can help me out here... Take Erin and I home...\" you sighed, opening the palm of your hand to reveal the last of the candies in your possession, seeing as Erin, wherever she went, had with her the remainder of the candies, leaving you with only one candy, to be used carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just as you were about to slip the candy in your mouth, without any warning whatsoever, you felt a hand grasp your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, you!\" The womanly voice chirped, looking into your eyes with big, blue eyes. You stood still, absolutely frightened. You scanned this mystery woman from head to toe... She looked to be in, more or less, her early 30's, strongly resembling the look of your mother when she was around that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The next thing to stick out was that long, blonde hair that seemed to be of a perfect shade, not too dark, but not overwhelmingly bright. As for the clothes she donned, she wore a somewhat tight maroon colored, sleeveless dress, a pair of flats on her feet and all put together by the perfect amount of makeup about her and a small, dark brown belt hugging her waist. Her lips were perfectly coated in a light-red lipstick, which looked to be an ideal, perfectly kissable size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     For one reason or another, you recognized her, and didn't recognize her, simultaneously. You knew for a fact that you had never known, or seen this woman, but, you felt as if you had seen her before, in a manner similar to deja-vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh...\" You started, speechless, looking down to her, despite the height difference of one inch, she looked to be about 5'5\". \"...Hi.\" you sheepishly greeted, extending your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, come on! We've been looking for you all night long!\" She laughed taking you into her embrace, leaving you awkwardly returning the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where have you been, anyway?\" The mystery woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Just... Around, Ma'am.\" You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"MA'AM?!\" She questioned, wrapping an arm around you as she walked you off somewhere, effectively detouring you from your search for Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Please, we've known each other for, like, ever! Call me Liz, like you always have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Okay, Liz...\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good...\" Liz laughed as she looked you over, you noticed that her eyes stopped on the candy held. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh! You shouldn't have! How'd you know I've been craving something sweet!\" Liz chirped, swiping the candy from your hand, the very last candy you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Liz! NO!\" You called, reaching for the candy as she unwrapped it and tossed it in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Calm down, girl!\" She called, defensively. \"It's just a little piece of candy!\" She assured, finally stopping, leading you into a group of other women, three other women, excluding Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You have no idea...\" you thought to yourself. Perhaps it was over for you... Maybe you were too far gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The other women looked to you, wide grins and twinkles about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, Hi!\" One squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, girlfriend!\" Another sung, walking over to you, handing you a peck on the cheek, a ritual among adult women that you noted among your mom and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The third and final woman looked to you, a gleam of light in her green eyes. \"Good of you to join us!\" She smiled a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...Hi...\" You waved as Liz and this small group of women conversed about who knows what, paying you no mind. Why had they dragged you here in the first place? The three other women, too, looked to be in their early 30's...Though, again, for one reason or another, all of these women, not just Liz, looked familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Despite their subtle familiarity, despite the fact that Liz continued to suck on the candy as she spoke with the other women, perhaps she'd never know that they're capable of wish-granting... Perhaps she'd just eat the candy like any other candy, without wishing... Since the women paid you no mind, perhaps you could silently slip away and find Erin, and put all this behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the women continued speaking, you backed away, slowly, thinking yourself to be a master of subtlety. Just then, Liz, continuing to suck on the candy looks your way, a twinkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, Nat!\" She called to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nat?\" You asked yourself, muttering under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Y'know...\" Liz began, walking over to you, a sway about her hips. \"You've been acting really weird all night, ever since we got here...\" Liz sighed, continuing to suck on her candy, looking at you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You gave a gulp before she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I wish...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*****Meanwhile*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the candies in her possession, Erin was dealing with some headaches of her own. While Nate was just getting out of his own headaches, Erin was still feeling woozy. Honestly, it was beginning to make her quite afraid. She began to worry if things were going a bit too far. Some thing that were coming in to her head seemed a bit foreign to her, although she couldn't quite make them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry!\" She said as she sidestepped someone who she nearly ran into, who didn't pay her much mind. She seemed to be a pretty crowded part of the party, which caused her to maneuver around for a bit. It was a bit cumbersome to do so though. To be fully honest though, she began feeling really weird once she finally got out of the mob, leaning around a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, got out of there....Oh!\" She suddenly looked towards a closed window, which seemed to show her reflection pretty well. However, it wasn't the one she was used to. Was she....older?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be true, right?\" Her hair seemed a touch longer, more like a woman in her early 20's, and where her breasts bigger too? She was only 13 before, but those budding breasts of hers now seemed closer to a high C-cup. Looking down, Erin immediately saw the weight difference, her breasts showing rather well through her dress. She truly looked like someone in college. However, her mind still felt very muddy. Perhaps it was just an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just a little woozy right now. Nothing to be afraid of.\" Erin assured herself, smiling. Surely, nothing was really going on, even though there were still some shifting feelings on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she began to feel something small on her left hand. Taking a quick glance, she nearly tumbled over in shock. What should she do? Nate knew better right? Perhaps she should find him and fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause what was beginning to appear was a wedding ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Back to Nate*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you'd join us ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately gasped a bit at those words. \"Why would you say that?\" You asked that low enough where the others wouldn't hear, but Liz could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you've been acting really weird. I don't know where the wishing part came from, but I felt like saying it. What does it matter anyway.\"Liz didn't seem bothered at all by what she said. \"We've known each other since high school after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you had no idea what Liz was talking about, you suddenly felt like someone punched you in the gut. Lunging over a bit, you excused yourself from the ladies for a little bit. They felt as if you needed to use the bathroom, so they felt no problems, but they wanted you to come back to them afterwards. Staggering a bit, you found the bathroom again, closing the door. As you did, you felt like the insides of your groin were shifting around. You put a hand gently to your groin, but where there used to be a sizable lump there, you slowly felt it slipping away. The more it went on, the more you felt new organs forming in your gut. Given everything so far, you knew that it was ovaries and a womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it was gone....you felt nothing there. In a sudden rush, you pulled your skirt up a bit and pulled the panties down briefly, and there you say it. No manhood there, just the sight of a womanhood, nothing manly about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...I'm a woman....I'm actually a woman..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you had sometimes thought about it when you wished for the breasts, but really feeling it was something you had never expected. You certainly felt more flexibility, given the new structure down there so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you had to remember what you said earlier. Perhaps you should rejoin the others now. With that, you began to exit the bathroom to find....</span></div></div>",

You took a step back as Erin panted and gestured to the jar of candies, then to their bodies. Confused, you proceeded to walk right by her, as you passed her by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nate, hold on...\" Erin caught her breath as her voice, face and body in general continued to age, now appearing as a woman, more or less, 25 or 26 years old. \"This has gone too far, all of it... The bodies, the candies and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You offered her a look of compassion as she took a breath. \"Yeah... IT, if you know what I mean, is gone...\" You gestured to the area between your legs as your voice raised an octave or two, immediately sounding more womanly and feminine as your lady friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"See what I mean!\" Erin exclaimed as the aging process continued, signs of age about her face, her voice and body continuing to mature, her hair finalizing at a length just below the shoulders. \"This has to end...\" She looked to be about 29 years old at this point. \"We have to end this...\" Her voice shook as she scratched at the strange feeling that occupied her ring finger on her left hand, the feeling becoming more solid as if something were forming around it. You watched in horror as the changes overcame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"E...Erin...?\" You struggled to recall the name of the woman, your... sister...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I would like to change back...\" Erin sighed as aging continued. \"I know we have to, the candies are right here, in my hands...\" She gestured to the jar of candies. \"...We have to go back to the way things were, me, a teen girl and, you, a teen boy... Even now as I speak, it's getting harder to recall memories and such... I know it has to end, but, I can't... bring myself to take the candy and wish. Please!\" Erin cried as she aged to 30. \"You, you have to wish us back since I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You soon aged to 24 within this time, as your features facial became more feminine, soft as your voice continued to elevate. With a nervous gulp, you realized all this was true. Harder and harder was it becoming to recall any of this, the wishing, your sister, your family... You finally attempted to reach into the jar and pull a candy. Just as Erin foretold, this was an impossible task. It was as if some unknown force disabled them from wishing. You tried once more, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Erin pulled herself together, now appearing as a full-fledged 30 year old woman, and tried again. No luck as the ring about her finger neared its end, the only thing left with the ring but to form the centerpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You didn't even try again, nor did Erin. Both of you looked to each other and knew this would be it, the two of you had been lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Erin...\" You struggled, your voice now completely feminine as your brown hair lengthened mid back as a waviness came about it, cosmetics finely applying itself to your face and lips. \"...It's over, we've gone too far with the changes... There's no going back...\" You sigh as your age finalizes at 28. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Erin looked as if she was about to cry. But, she didn't, nothing could be done. She looked to you, you looked to her, both of your eyes offering a soft, comforting look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"So, what do we do with these...?\" Erin looked to the candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Those kids at home...\" You sigh, attempting to recall a couple of names. \"Our... sister and brother, Trevor and Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Erin took a moment to attempt to recall these names. \"Oh!\" Erin sniffed. \"The little ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"We should wish these over to them, maybe they can use these things for... Something better.\" You smile, Erin joining you. Effortlessly, Erin reached into the jar and pulled out a candy, laughing. \"Now it works...\" The two of you laughed as both your changes neared the end. Wasting no time, she plopped the candy in her mouth and wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I wish these candies were with Trevor and Nicole Wilson...\" Just like that, without any warning, Erin held nothing, the jar having departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The two of you looked to each other. \"So, what do we do now...?\" Erin asked, nearly on the edge of tears, he age cutting off at 31. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Maybe we can be all poetic and lose ourselves together...\" You sigh, offering a small smile, Erin returning it as you two embraced each other tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... Maybe...\" You begin, memories foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes... Nate?\" Erin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Maybe this is how things were supposed to work out. Maybe this was the plan the whole time, maybe... maybe...\" Your memories grew doggies as you barely recalled who it was you were clinging to, this mystery woman... For seconds fleeting, your memory came back to you, if only for a while too short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"... Well, these dresses really are nice, aren't they?\" Erin asked, attempting to make lighthearted the situation. \"Maybe we'll meet again someday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Someday...\" You added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The two of you clung to each other, shared one final laugh as memories fleeted altogether. The ring on Erin's finger finalized, a nice diamond placing itself on the center of the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... Who are you...?!\" You asked the strange, brunette haired woman before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Who am I?\" The woman once Erin asked. \"I should be asking you the same thing, young lady! Why were you holding me like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Gosh, I don't know... Well, I'm Natalie, Natalie Grayson.\" You answer the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm Erin Bailey, and, if you'd be so kind as to excuse me, I'm kind of looking for my husband right now...\" Erin walked right past Natalie, having a personality as snooty as that ring on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ooo-kay...\" You sighed as you walk off your own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Honey! There you are!\" You hear that Erin woman call. You look back and, sure enough, there she is, taking a man into her embrace. You roll your eyes and continue towards your friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nat! There you are! Where have you been all this time?\" Liz asked, taking you into embrace.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     \"Hey, Liz!\" You chirp. \"The strangest thing just happened...\" You begin to explain...</span></div></div>",

Both were in the family room right now on their own; Trevor with his toys and Nicole with her doll. Both of them had no idea there their big siblings were, but they figured that they were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Erin?\" Nicole asked randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably out somewhere.\" Trevor shoved off. \"She's probably off with her friends.

He turned to his left, seeing a jar of candies that weren't there before. Trevor remembered them from Nate's birthday, but he thought Nate had those with him. And what was that flash? Still, they were just sitting there unguarded, and Trevor didn't want something to go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nate's candies are here!\" he said quickly as he got up.

Those are Nate's.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he shouldn't have left them here then.\" Trevor reasoned, making Nicole sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, he won't notice one or two missing ones.\" Trevor continued, taking two candies out of the jar. Might as well do it while Nate wasn't there. Nicole just sighed again though. Why did Trevor have to cause trouble every time he got the chance? Still, she took the candy, putting it in her mouth like Trevor did. It had a nice sweet taste as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It's pretty good.\" said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Nate's lucky if he keeps to keep these.\" smiled Trevor. As they did though, something seemed to come to mind for both of them, like something on their mind was being brought out. Nicole went first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....we could play around much more if Dad wouldn't interrupt us most of the time. I wish he'd go somewhere else.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mom's the same way. I wish she could too. Imagine if we got some time to ourselves.\" Trevor replied, both in agreement there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them probably weren't totally sure of what the implications of their words though, but it was too late to go back as things were set in motion once again. And it all started with Mike in the backyard, suddenly feeling like he had a stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....that was sudden...did I eat something odd.\" He said as he clenched his stomach a bit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      \"Ugh...\" Mike continued to groan as his stomach, come to think of it, his entire belly began to rumble. \"No... this isn't food poisoning...\" He told himself as a small shock ran down his spine, after which, his height decreased an inch or two, dropping to 5'11\" from his native 6'1\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Better take a seat...\" He continued to hold his belly as he stopped cleaning the pool to take a seat in a nearby chair amongst a table, all of which underneath a decorative umbrella Lynda couldn't pass up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...\" The pain in his belly continued to rage on, as a storm, clearly the clenching of the belly aided nothing. \"I should take a look here, it's probably nothing.\" Mike justified as he raised the end of his shirt and took a peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... I could've sworn there was a little more hair... And that I had a little more weight...\" He noted his smaller, softer looking belly, considering that it certainly looked a bit tighter than before. His frame was shrinking, developing a certain coke-bottle-like curve about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now the hips!\" Mike grabbed at his hips as it felt as if they were swelling widening. \"Man, I really am getting old! It must be age...\" He rubbed his hips in a circular motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Look at me...\" He attempted to get to his feet to continue working. \"Already complaining about back and hip problems... And I'm only 37...\" He rubbed his hips as they widened a bit more, his height falling steadily to 5'9\". He failed it notice, but, his hair seemed to be fading from all about his body, almost appearing to go straight to his head, wear hair grew longer, almost feminine. His shorts, which once left in the open hairy legs, now exposed but a portion of smoother legs. By no means bald legs, but, smoother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Speaking of shorts, Mike did find that they seemed to be fitting a but tighter, and as if they were riding up his legs. But, this he blew off as he continued to struggle to get back to work, trying to overcome the curveballs his biddy threw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Man... What is wrong with me today?\" He said, his voice raising only slightly, sounding like a younger man. \"I just... can't... get back to work!\" He groaned as he slumped back in his chair, defeated, as his hair grew a smidge more, now reaching about the tips of the ears, the color of the hair lightened up as well, now a light brown color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike eventually came to stop trying to get back to work. Whatever was happening to him, his body wouldn't allow work. Within only seconds, the desire to work completely fell. For whatever reason, he felt he had obligations elsewhere. Where these obligations were, or, what they were, he knew not, but, this place wasn't where he was supposed to be. With that, the changes about his body were suddenly peaceful, unknown to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     His hips continued to expand. He knew nothing. His butt inflated, unnoticed. His hair continued to lengthen, only slightly. Nothing. Facial features softened and signs of age fell. Nothing. Two mounds began to swell about his chest, and, manhood shrank. Not a card in the world. He just sat back and continued to enjoy the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Man, what a day!\" Mike sung, his voice raising more, now sounding more as a young man. A feminine young man. He leaned over to rub his aching feet, which shrank, became ever fainter as he did. Same with his hands, which softened, becoming long and slender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Until I remember where I'm supposed to be...\" Mike sounded, a foggy mind about him. \"I might as well enjoy the day!\" He smiled as the wind brushed his more exposed legs, covered by completely black shorts, which now looked more like really tight capris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"What to do...\" He thought, as facial hair regressed back into his skin, in subtleness.</span></div></div>",

The Wilsons did have a pool after all, and it perhaps the perfect time to just relax for a bit in it. Perhaps that could help Mike get over what problems he had as well. With that decided, he walked into the house to get ready for it. His skin was silky smooth now, with not a hair on him except for his head. His hips had a distinctive sway as he walked, with his butt bouncing a tiny bit with how big it was. Just large enough for any woman to be jealous of, but Mike didn't think of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked up the stairs though, his shirt actually started to tighten on him, even starting to darken to the same black color as the shorts. Everything felt really tight on him, though he didn't seem to mind as much as he should have. He just focused on getting the few things he needed for a little swim. He went to the closet and picked out a towel for himself. He considering changing his clothes, but something told him that he wouldn't need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought that, his body made another creak, decreasing his height down to 5'6, where it seemed to stay. This didn't seem to bug him as he just continued walking down the hallway. As he did, his tight shorts continued to work up his thighs, exposing them to the world as well. They continued to climb, until his legs could be seen entirely, with them just covering his butt. They were now a full black bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this tightness didn't bother Mike. It actually felt even better than usual, making him smile a bit. He finished heading back down to the lower level, his legs fully womanized and pretty. Even his manhood was shrinking down, though not fully gone yet. As he opened the back door again, his shirt finished turning to the same dark color as the bottoms, even beginning to ride up his waist, which exposed a flat stomach and curved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, the work I've done has really paid off.\" Mike said to himself. Though part of him wondered why he said that. He couldn't tel how much weight had now been shaved off of him now. He kind of wondered where all that fat could go anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, best not to think about it.\" smiled Mike, his voice going up another octave as it did. It almost sounded like a young woman now, though not completely. If someone had to guess, Mike looked closer to a 30-year old now, maybe even younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, he set the towel down on the chair nearby, coming his now neck-long hair out of his eyes, which had stopped at a nice light brown color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, in we go!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Mike let out a feminine giggle as he gracefully dived in the pool before him. his voice raised only slightly more, still not quite at the voice of a young woman, though very, very close to it. As he dived, his long, soft, slender legs, which were emphasized and complimented by his bikini bottoms, shone in the sunlight emanating from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With a loud splash of the water, and a moment of silence as Mike remained underwater for only a second, a laugh emanated as he rose to the surface. \"This is great! The water... the sun... all of it!\" He laughed as he continued to regress in age, now looking to be, more or less, a 27 year old. A 27 year old what remained uncertain. Hints of masculinity remained about him, but, soon, these would b taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That's it!\" Mike laughed as he basked himself in the water. As he soaked in the pool, muscle mass all about his body fell, or, rather, moved, leaving him with a petite womanly body. Mike paid no mind to the sudden shift in weight, all of which seemed to be focused at his chest, where mounds continued to swell until formed were a pair of high C-cup breasts, perfectly complimented by a black shirt shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes...!\" He smiled with a graceful wave of his hair, waving it behind him behind him, as he did, his neck-length light brown hair reached the shoulder blades. While his hair shone in the sunlight, while he brushed his fingers slender through his wavy hair, one final growth spurt of the hair put his hair a couple of inches above his mid-back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Just to fix these...\" He laughed as he adjusted his shirt, pressing it against his baby-soft skin. Simply with his soft touch, his shirt tightened a bit more and rose to the ends of his breasts, hugging his body, effectively leaving him with a black bikini top, completing his bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hmm!\" Mike smiled, looking at the completed bikini top. \"It all makes sense now!\" His voice rose and his age dropped, sending him to a 25 year old with the gentle voice of an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It all makes sense now!\" He sung in his new, charming voice. He looked down to his chest, then sown to his legs long, feet dainty, that floated with him. \"These clothes, this body, this voice...\" He said as he kept himself afloat, observing his body, all the while, his facial features manipulated themselves to match who he would be. Cheekbones rose, his nose became as a button, chin, smaller , eye lashes emphasized, lips became modestly plump, not overdone, but, just right. His blue eyes became bigger as an epiphany made itself known, the man-hood that lay under his bikini departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm... I'm Mi... Mi... Me... Melissa. Yeah, Melissa Rivers! Yeah, I came to this little town for a calendar gig that would surely send me among the big league models! Everyone buys into swimming models! Why wouldn't they, with a body like this, I've got the world on my own personal string...\" Melissa laughed, closing her eyes and continuing to bask in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Even though I still have no idea whose house or pool this is, I'm sure they won't mind playing host to a soon-to-be-famous model like me. At least until my modeling-partner in crime gets here, as I'm sure she will...\" Melissa smiled, eyes still closed as she heard footsteps near the edge of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Excuse me?!\" A certain Lynda Wilson interjected, tapping a foot against the ground in her heeled sandals as she gripped her hips. \"Who the heck are you?! Where's my husband?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Relax, lady!\" Melissa continued swimming around the pool. \"Sure, I don't know where your husband is, but, I'm sure he's dining fine!\" Melissa exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You still haven't answered my question. Who are you, and, what are you doing here?!\" Lynda firmly continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"There you go again. I'm just using your pool for a bit. Can't just let pretty little me burn in the sun!\" Melissa answered, scanning the mean before her from her head to her toes. Currently, Lynda wore a simple purple blouse and black, knee length skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Speaking of using the pool...\" Melissa began. \"How about you relax, get into something more comfortable and join me!\" Melissa finished, leaning back as to stick a foot out of the pool and wiggle her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Lynda continued to look tense. Melissa playfully rolled her eyes. \"C'mon, lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Lynda!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Fine, Lynda!\" Melissa laughed. \"I'm a model, a swimming model. Believe me, I know a thing or two about kicking back and having fun. You look like the mother-type. That's cool. But, don't you ever wish you were like me? A young, pretty model with her whole life ahead of her?\" Melissa continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now, how about it, Lynda. Pool?\" Melissa mused, showing off her youthful legs and body, brushing with her fingers her hair elegant and wavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...\" Lynda was about to sharply retort as a strange chill ran down her spine.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't catch that.\" said Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda felt a little light-headed from that shock, almost as if something just shifted within her. It felt quite strange, like something taking over rapidly. She barely even noticed as any traces of age were slowly beginning to wither away, as more youth returned to her softer features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right...I guess I can.\" said Lynda, even beginning to take her blouse and skirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" cheered Melissa. \"Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda wasn't sure about this, but she didn't seem to mind even when her undergarments suddenly stiffened. The material became a little sturdier, more befitting a bikini as they became a nice violet color. Lynda slowly walked into the pool, as Melissa smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Feels nice, right lady?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Lyn....ugh.\" Lynda started to say but stopped, confusing Melissa for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all seemed to be familiar to Lynda, as memories of this Melissa girl were started to become more pronounced, even as Mike seemed to become less pronounced. Wait...who was Mike again? She surely wasn't married right? Her head still felt messed up, and she kind of forgot to stay above water as she did, causing Melissa to keep her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Watch out there!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda then looked at Melissa again, as something flashed into her mind. She knew her. Someone that she met at...where was it? Oh yeah, one of the local modeling studios. They had met there some time ago, as Lynda was a bit older. Any traces of age were gone now, as Lynda looked the part of a 27-year old woman. Her prominent features still remained the same though, but she smiled at Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Melissa. I guess I kind of zoned out there.\" she laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Lyn! What are friends for?\" The two of them now didn't seem to mind sharing some stranger's home right now, but they didn't seem to mind. They just enjoyed themselves for a while, before deciding to dry off and put their normal clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should get back. Don't need someone else to see us here.\" said Lynda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed with that.\" smiled Melissa, as the two young models left together, heading towards the front of their house where their car now was. While they happily left to head to their job now, they didn't know who saw them leave. Trevor happened to see them, and for lack of a better word, he and Nicole were a bit nervous now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were they?\" asked Trevor, seeing the women leave. He never saw them come in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but where's mommy and daddy?\" asked Nicole. Obviously, neither kid knew what their wish had done. All they knew right now was that they were now left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd quite frankly, it scared them quite a bit.</span></div></div>",

Both were in the family room right now on their own; Trevor with his toys and Nicole with her doll. Both of them had no idea where their big siblings were, but they figured that they were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Erin?\" Nicole asked randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bothering us.\" Trevor shoved off. \"Probably off with her friends. Nate must have gone out as well, now that I think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like she's been gone a while though.\" said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna look through her diary?\" Trevor laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as he said that though, he saw a brief flash out of the corner of his eyes. He turned to his left, seeing a jar of candies that weren't there before. Trevor remembered them from Nate's birthday, but he thought Nate had those with him. And what was that flash? Still, they were just sitting there unguarded, and Trevor didn't want something to go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nate's candies are here!!\" he said quickly as he got up, completely forgetting his earlier mischievous plans. Nicole looked up and slowly followed him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably shouldn't touch them. Those are Nate's.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he shouldn't have left them here then.\" Trevor reasoned, making Nicole sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, finder's keepers, as they say.\" Trevor continued, taking two candies out of the jar. Nicole wanted to sigh, but that was a little funny. What was he going to do though when Nate got back and found out Trevor ate all his candy? Still, she took the candy offered to her, putting it in her mouth like Trevor did. It had a nice sweet taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!! It's pretty good.\" said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have got a good piece then, because mine tasted like poo.\" whined Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be one of those jars with the all sorts of flavors, I guess.\" quipped Nicole. \"Just don't eat that color again.\" Nicole paused, then, \"Wait... What do you know what poo tastes like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... Alright!! It was only one time, and I thought the dog was making chocolate, okay!!\" Trevor hastily admitted. Nicole snickered at her older brother's admission. Meanwhile, as the candies hit their gullets, something seemed to come to mind for both of them, like something on their mind was being brought out. Nicole went first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our parents are no fun, ya know. Dad's always working, then he says he's too tired to play. Also, just what does a... \"system analylist\" do?\" Nicole saying the last part with difficulty as the words were foreign to her vocabulary and hard for her to say. \" I wish Daddy was around more, and doubled the fun!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor piped in saying, \"Momma's sort of the same way. She's always focusing on the older kids, and whenever I tell jokes, she never seems interested, and we're always only doing boring things, like going shopping, and she won't let me have a dog either!! I kinda wish Momma was more exciting myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they uttered and envisioned in their minds had set into a series of events they did not anticipate, and the wheels of fate were already at work... Speaking of work, the candies first take hold of Mike in his windowside office cubicle. He felt spacey for a moment, felt entranced to look out the window. \"Wow, that looks amazing!!\" he moaned, before coming to, feeling an odd tingle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had Mike looked at?</span></div></div>",

I was trying to think of medieval times, but that exact number came up in my head instead. Odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Mike, his hair had been growing longer, and now possessed streaks of navy blue in it and his eyes were now a strange <span class=\"cteal\">teal</span> color. However, his head was hurting more and more.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike's skin was tanning before his eyes. \"W... What is going...\" Mike's sleepiness coupled from the pain in his head made him faint for a moment, falling back against the elevator wall. When he came to, his whole body was darkened from top to bottom. *DING* The elevator opened and Mike came to, the doors opening. \"Must have just been a fever dream. I guess I'm more tired thanst thou first thought.\" Something in that statement bugged him, but this time he couldn't place his mind on it. \"Thou must return home quickly for a brief respite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike headed out to his car, only for head, and now his back to ache out doubly so. \"Maybe I should not drive while like this. I may hurt someone. Besides, methinks thine automobile will be safe here until tomorrow.\" Mike puts away his keys, and begins hailing a taxi instead, wholly ignoring the fact his car now had diplomatic plates for some reason. Mike was also distracted too much by his aching back and head to notice two mounds growing on his chest, or that his hair was now mostly dark blue and down past his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA taxi pulls up, finally, and Mike gets in, directing the driver to take him home. \"So, calling it an early day there?\" the taxi driver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believeth so...\" Mike holds his head as another wave of pain rips him from the conscious world again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you're not the chatty types. I hate the chatty types.\" the taxi driver says, putting earbuds into his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept, his facial features softened into a sensuous female visage, replete with small nose and larger eyes. His lips darkened, now appearing to be stained black. His hips flared under his suit as waist shrunk, and those orbs on his chest - they were nearing the D range now. An unnoticed pull in his groin as he flopped about in the seat, no thanks to the driver's bad driving, in the realm of slumber signaled an end to his manhood, replaced with something from the female persuasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, now clearly a she, twitched and moaned, slumping over, draping her now waist-length hair over her face, hair that now was all midnight blue but had had a strange ethereal property to it, floating in parts like it was defying gravity and had sparkling twinkles in it that made it look like you could see the cosmos in it. Doubled over, drenched in sweat, Mike was now showing giant bulges on her back and rear, when about that time large midnight blue feathered wings tore out the back of the suit. The taxi driver was far too busy horribly butchering, \"Rock the Casbah\" to even notice. Another rip, and a long tail coated in the same ethereal hair as her head flooded out from her expanding rear. Mike's clothes then seemed to mend themselves and resized to fit her more petite frame. A black bra formed under her shirt as her underwear shifted to a lacy number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that pain in the head though that made her shoot up, eyes wide open, as a navy blue horn broke out her forehead, possessing a counter-clockwise groove in it running from the base to the tip, said tip growing out some ten inches from her forehead, nearly puncturing the cab's roof. Like a vent blowing off steam, much of the pain Mike had been experiencing was now gone, thought she still felt sleepy, and her hearing seemed off. It faded out, then roared back to life, even sharper than before. She scratched her head, just missing the new horse-like ears poking out her hair, coated in navy blue fur. People who had been watching the moon's wild flight noticed its movements were beginning to stabilize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cab finally pulled up to Mike's house, the driver saying, \"That'll be $16.73.\" Mike, now looking like some sort of humanized Princess Luna in a women's business suit, reached into her jacket pocket for what she had thought was going to be her wallet, but instead found a hefty coin purse. \"When did I get this? Thy memory betwixts me.\" Fidgeting with the knot on the purse proved hard in her tired state, finding it too tight. \"Open, why don't you...\" Unconsciously, her horn began to glow, and like a third hand was helping, unraveled the knot with ease. \"Alright then... That was...\" She began to pull out the currency within, only to be a bit surprised as it was all solid gold coins that bared her likeness on one side, and the moon on the other. \"Where is thy credit card...?\" Then an idea hit her, \"Maybe he will take these as reimbursement.\" Handing him 17 of the coins, the driver states, \"Hold on there, you got to hand me real money...\" About then, he shook his head, looked at the coins again, then turned back and saw his passenger. \"Whoa, how did I forget who my fare was? Sorry about that, Princess!! That'll be no charge!! Wow, I have real life princess in my cab!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?\" Mike thought, when she saw her reflection in the glass. Seeing herself changed so caused her mind to be overwhelmed by new thoughts and memories, as well as a sizable knowledge of the arcane, and video games for some reason. Mike tried to grasp at her own memories, but they were beginning to feel more and more like a dream. All she could seem to hold onto was that she lived here and had kids and... a wife!! Lynda!! With this, her old and new memories merged into a strange hodgepodge, merging her old identity with her new one. Upon this event, hidden below her pants legs black splotches grew on her outer thighs, like giant birthmarks, and a dull glow appeared in the middle of the sea of black, a white crescent moon appearing in each inky mark. \"Nopony has called thee princess in a long time, not since thy abdication. You may call me Luna.\" Luna smiled as she left the cab and went to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the door and walking in, she declared in her Royal Canterlot Voice, \"<b>THY PRINCESS HATH RETURN HOME!!</b>\" before passing out asleep on the floor, dead tired, snoring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor and Nicole stand over her, puzzled. \"Who is this, Nicole?\"</span></div></div>",

She gave out a cute yawn as she gracefully got out of bed in her pink pyjamas. She got dressed in one of her frilly pink dresses with pink tights accompanying it. There was likely more pink in this room than in any other room in the world, and even the wallpaper had frills along the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories from the party suddenly struck her at once. <i>Erin got turned, ehehe. I have to thank Nicole for saving me from there and showing me the true splendour of girlhood, ehehe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer small breasts were visible pushing against her dress, as she happily pranced out of her room. Her long ash blonde hair swaying back and forth. The return of her memories merely showed how vastly inferior her old life was to this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gracefully walked downstairs as Luna began to wake up, and she could already guess that her sister either transformed Lynda or Mike, \u201cLynda or Mike?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike. How\u2019s your new life, ehehe?\u201d Nicole giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Thanks so much!\u201d Her melodious voice rang out, and she cheerfully smiled, the happiest she\u2019s ever been. She walked over to the candies, swallowed one and made a wish. I wish Erin was here and back to normal. And I wish that we were extremely close sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin materialised, ran to Anna, embraced her and started crying, \u201cI thought I was going to be stuck like that forever\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere art Lynda?\u201d Luna asked and Nicole had a cold chill go down her spine.

Liz had always been a worrier, you remembered how you could always expect Liz to be late because of her incessant worrying about this and that.  Worrying about being late on the other hand never occurred to her.  That made her endearing to you.  When you assured her you was OK, she led you back to your group of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered them all now.  You knew each of their names and the details of your friendship with them.  You remembered how you met each and every one of them.  You remembered the things you had in common with them and the secrets you shared.  Your mind had been changed so that you now had several things in common with each one of the ladies and they were all now your dearest friends.  There was no place else in this party that you would want to be than with the ladies and you now joined them willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour personality had changed to make talking with them completely natural and comfortable.  You couldn't help to notice how each was dressed and you made sure to compliment them accordingly.  This brought of the topic of fashion and you could talk about that like a pro.  The topics drifted from fashion to relationships to politics to an event that had recently happened.  You talked about people you hadn't actually met but thought that you had known for years.  You were more expressive in your conversation using your hands to make a point or touching your friends to express an emotional but in no way sexual connection.  You laughed at inside jokes that before tonight held no meaning for you.  You was now just one of the ladies and this is where you absolutely belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was so comfortable that you didn't even think you had another life besides the one you was living now.  These were your best friends and you loved them all to death and you knew they loved you.  It was in the midst of this revelry that Erin finally found you.</span></div></div>",

Your head was still a bit woozy from everything that had happened so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin came right up to you as you were talking with Liz and the girls, grabbing your arm as she mouthed a \"Sorry\" to the other women. She immediately pulled you over to the side, stopping you abruptly and showing you a candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate, are you in there?\" she asked urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think I am...somewhat.\" You said with a little weariness. To be honest, there still was that female side of you. It was kind of mixed up with the male side right now, but you couldn't tell which was which in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better be, because we need to get out of here. This place is messing with us.\" Erin obviously wasn't in a waiting mood. Heck, she had already placed that candy in her mouth. You wanted to ask why she was so antsy, but there wasn't any time before her mouth began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to undo all of the wishes of Nate and myselfl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those words left her mouth, you immediately felt limp as darkness took your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the cold hard floor of your bedroom as your eyes slowly began to wake up. You felt someone shaking on you a bit, a bit urgently too. Slowly looking up, you could see Erin, in her usual teenage self, looking at you with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E...Erin?\" You said in your male voice. Erin immediately sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you're back. I do NOT want to go through that again.\" Erin said with a small smile. Judging by the sunlight, it felt like it was morning right now. \"Mom and Dad are out on some errands right now. I'm not too sure what happened, but I hope that the whole party thing was just our imagination now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Erin left the room, content for now. The jar of candies was left in your room, since they were YOUR present after all. However, even as you got up, you felt a bit odd. Your body seemed normal enough now, and you were indeed in your normal room. However, you still remembered Liz and the girls from before. You looked down at the gym shorts you were wearing, seeing the normal underwear underneath. However, one look underneath the underwear showed something else- a womanhood still there, even after everything that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that didn't feel odd to you. The only thing that did feel odd was that this normal pair of underwear was not properly suited for your current plumbing so to speak. You needed something more practical and suitable.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking about it for a while you decided it just didn't matter if your underwear had a hole in the front or not.  But what did concern you was your sister's apparent distress.  She seemed actually shaken by the \"Candy's Experience.\"  With a new found empathy you hadn't had before you decided to help your sister out.  You took a new piece of candy in your mouth and said, \"I wish Erin didn't remember anything about what happened last night.\"  Then continuing, \"I wish that Erin would never eat another piece of these magic wishing candies again.\"  \"There,\" you thought, \"she won't remember that anything had ever happened and she'll never get into that type of trouble by accidentally eating one of the candies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that taken care of you could get ready for your day.  On the floor were the jeans and shirt you was wearing before all this began.  Normally you would put the old clothes on for another day or at the very least simply leave them on the floor.  Today, not only did you fetch out a new outfit but you picked up the clothes on the floor and put them in the hamper on the way to taking a shower.  Even though the clothes you picked for your day was just a pair of jeans and a t-shirt.  You didn't pick the first pair of each you saw.  You considered each article of clothing for a moment before taking them out of the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower you washed your hair and the rest of you like any other day although you did decide to use the conditioner for your hair which you had never done before.  Other that that a shower is a shower.  You didn't even pause to examine your new genitals.  Why should you, they were a part of you now like your arms and kneecaps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower you dried yourself off and brushed your teeth.  Nature called and you sat down to pee not because 'you was a lady now' but because that was the only way to do it with the equipment you have.  The used towel was also placed in the hamper instead of being left on the floor and you did wash down the soap scum from the tub so it would be nice for the next user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went down to make breakfast.  Usually you would just have a bowl of cereal, but today you decided you wanted to cook some eggs.  While retrieving the eggs, you saw the cheese and decided your eggs should be an omelet.  You wanted some coffee to go with your breakfast, but you was alone in the house except for Erin and you didn't want to make a whole pot so you could have one cup of coffee and throw the rest out.  You poured yourself some juice instead.  After eating you decided to wash the couple of dishes you had used.  In the sink was a cereal bowl.  You assumed it was from Erin's breakfast.  You washed her bowl along with your dishes and put them away in the cabinet.  Erin was busy in her room and didn't notice or care that you had taken a much more mature attitude towards your breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then called your best friend Liz.  You wanted to see her in person to apologize for having to leave so abruptly with Erin.  You picked up the phone and dialed the numbers that you knew by heart.  Liz answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Liz,\" you said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nate,\" Liz said with equal cheer, \"what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we could meet at the mall and do some window shopping, if you aren't too busy.\"  Window shopping meant that you weren't planning on buying anything.  If you wanted to get something you would have said shopping or some other keyword that Liz would have known exactly what you meant.  In your head, you and Liz had been best friends for many years and knew what each other meant instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I have nothing cooking that can't wait.  What time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about eleven, we'll walk around the mall, see what's on sale and then have lunch...then of course more shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see ya then.  Love ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luv ya too.\" and you both hung up.  You didn't have to tell her where to meet you at the mall, you had done this hundreds (or even thousands) of times throughout the years.  You had a little time before you had to head out so you decided to watch some TV.</span></div></div>",

With her memories of the events gone now, she seemed to have gone back to her more carefree self. Seeing that did make you smile to yourself. That experience was pretty bizarre, so it was probably best for someone like Erin to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, looking at the clock, it was 10:30 right now. Perhaps you should get going. Just for any particular situation, you grabbed 2 or 3 of the candies, just to keep yourself prepared should something happen or come to mind. To be honest, you hoped there wouldn't be, and it would just be a nice day with your friend. With that in mind, you said a brief good bye to Erin, who waved back a bit before you left the house, leaving in your car. It wasn't too long before you could see the central mall in the distance, turning off the road and into the parking lot. You found a nice spot that was close enough to the mall, and got yourself out. You couldn't see Liz initially, but you didn't expect to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you smiled as you just entered the mall, being welcomed by a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nate!\" Liz smiled at you as she left go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Liz, nice to see ya. Sorry about the whole party mishap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem. You had something to take care of after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" You smiled before walking beside her. \"So, shall we get going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you both began walking side by side as you began your little tour of the mall. As you would expect, Liz did a lot of the talking, mostly about current events and what she thought, which did allow you for some discussion as well. At times, you both started pointing out things at the various shops, which pretty much involved everything. You briefly pointed at the little sports shop to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor would probably love to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would. He's very much like his dad isn't he?\" smiled Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\" You replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther shops and came and passed by, many of them clothing shops and other such places. It was very much like how you always spent these leisurely days with Liz, and that was how you liked it. Though, as you were both walking, you went into one of the smaller clothing stores, just to look around for a bit. There were nice clothes of all sizes, for men and women of course. However, as you were looking through the many aisles, you happened to look upon a set of women's panties. Granted, what you were wearing right now felt good enough for your day. Still, it might help to have something just in case. It sounded reasonable enough in your mind, and there was a discount too. Why wait?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Liz, looks like I found something after all.\" You said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably the first thing you've bought here in a while.\" Liz said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good to be prepared.\" That was reasonable enough as you paid for said clothes, having them put inside a bag. You both had spent a good amount of time looking around, and as you left with your purchase, your stomach rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we know what time it is.\" Liz laughed a bit, making you laugh and agree as well.</span></div></div>",

When there was no answer she assumed that everyone had gone.  She took this opportunity to enter the kids rooms and tidy up a bit.  It was an almost daily ritual to go into the kids rooms and to pick up what was on the floor and just in general clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged up stairs into Erin's room first.  It was as she expected.  Stuff all over the floor, cups on the dresser and an unmade bed.  Typical for a teenager regardless of gender.  Lynda picked up what needed to be picked up.  Put the used clothes in the hamper.  Made the bed and did what ever else needed to be done.  Soon the room was in her mind presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she went to the bathroom and found it spotless.  The used towels had been replaced with fresh ones on the rack.  The used towels were in the hamper.  The tub had been scrubbed, even the toilet seat was down.  \"Wow,\" she thought, she hadn't seen this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went to Nate's room and found the room also well maintained.  It was obvious who cleaned the bathroom as Nate's room was in perfect order.  The bed was made and nothing was on the floor.  It looked as good as Lynda's room herself.  Since everything was in its place, the jar of candies which was the only thing new in the room stood out.  She opened it and looked inside to see the treats.  She decided to have one and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the den to finish her needlepoint she wondered what had gotten into Nate.  But she thanked god for small favors.  While the candy was dissolving in her mouth, she was still thinking of the miracle that was Nate cleaning his own room.  She thought to herself, \"I don't know why he did it, but I wish that Nate would continue doing what he is doing and that whatever got into Nate would also get into Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Erin who was with one of her friends listening to music found herself transported (without her noticing anything different) to the mall.  She was about to have lunch with her brother Nate and her friend Liz.  They had been best friends for as long as she could remember.</span></div></div>",

You must have gotten separated from her while shopping but she knew where you were all meeting for lunch.  \"Where have you been?\" you asked Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just walking around, you know I would lose my head if it wasn't attached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hostess asked you how many were in your party and you put up three fingers to indicate the amount.  Soon a table was ready and you followed the hostess to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin wondered what you had bought and you showed her your package.  Inside were the panties.  There were three loose pairs of full brief style panties each in a different soft pastel color.  \"Pretty,\" she said.  Although from her tone you could tell that she didn't like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say anything was wrong,\" Erin said trying to put a what who me tone into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that tone.\"  Now that you and Erin were both suffering from the same \"I wish you would join the ladies.\" wish you had become very close.  You were no longer brother and sister...well you still were physically but your relationship had changed to one of adult sisters who had shared everything since infancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they are in just such bland colors.  They are all soft pastels.  They have no oomph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who is going to see it anyway.  Well besides you and mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Liz spoke up.  \"I think that Erin has a point.  What if you meet a man, would you want him to see you in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be sexy, if you don't feel sexy?  And those panties won't make you feel sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they are comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be sexy and be comfortable too.\"  Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen your panties, you should talk.\" you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My panties are prettier than yours.\"  Which made sense since in reality he only had male briefs at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember Margaret?  She used to only dress for comfort like you, but I talked to her and we did a makeover.  She found a man immediately.\" Liz stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I am looking for a man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone who is not married should be looking for a man.  You should find one and settle down like me and Carl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I am ready.\"  Which was true he is only fifteen even though he acts as if he is a woman nearing thirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have known you and Erin forever and I know you are ready....That goes for you too Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handsome waiter witnessed the end of this exchange, looking for an opportunity to take their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You had to admit that too, though you weren't sure about that glint in Liz's eye. Right from the moment she talked about hoping you could settle down like she did, you knew that her mind was set on it. Though, as you all began to order what you liked from the menu, Liz began to add her \"extra thoughts\" to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, anything else I can get you?\" the waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have something I'd like to ask you.\" smiled Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uh oh.\"</i> you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're name is Jeff, correct?\" she asked, remembering his introduction from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. Jeff Hartford.\" Jeff said, sounding as polite as he could,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great.\" smiled Liz. \"I'd like to ask a particular question if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, ask away.\" Jeff smiled sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'd just like to ask: What do you think of Nate here?\" What the heck kind of question was that? That was on your mind as you gasped at Liz before turning hesitantly to Jeff. Did Liz have any subtlety? Apparently not to ask a random guy a question like that. Jeff seemed a little hesitant himself, like he wasn't sure what to say, but he did answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what I can tell, you seem like a nice lady.\" He said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well thanks.\" You tried to be as polite. Sheesh, did Liz have to put you on the spot like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't have any plans tonight, how about you two do something together? Heck, if you have any friends, perhaps you could ring up one for Erin too?\" Liz continued on, making you groan. Jeff seemed to have recovered from his surprise earlier, and he had a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's alright with you ladies....\" He kind of trailed off a bit, as if he wasn't sure as to your answer and Erin's. However, Erin answered for you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd be delighted.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well great.\" Jeff smiled. \"I'm off work in a few hours so I think I can ring up one of my friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be wonderful.\" said Liz. From that point, there was a little exchanging of information, from a few phone numbers to your address. To be frank, you felt like hiding yourself. Why did Liz have to be in charge of your love life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are going to have A LOT of fun this afternoon.\" said Liz. Erin seemed to nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we've got preparations to do!\"</span></div></div>",

Jeff was cute, but you didn't know if you were ready for a serious relationship.  Plus you did have school on Monday.  You decided that you would just go out with Jeff and see what happened.  At least you would get a free dinner and movie out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Erin were much more excited than you were.  You didn't know what Erin was so excited about, at least you knew who your date was, her date was going to be a blind date.  After lunch, Erin and Liz insisted you return your new panties and get something for your date.  You told them, it was just a date and that Jeff wasn't going to see your panties...not on a first date.  But Liz insisted, you had to feel sexy for a date and to feel sexy you had to be dressed sexy from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had selected panties that met with their approval, you went to buy a new dress for you and Erin for your date.  Liz insisted on paying so you couldn't back out.  Liz also told you that you were lucky that you didn't have boobs.  You could wear the tightest, low cut fashions without having to wear a bra.  It took some doing, but between the three of you you found a dress that flattered your boyish figure.  A similar dress was selected for Erin, she had a similar problem to you since as a thirteen year old, she hadn't developed yet.  But even some real thirty year old women didn't have a curvy body so if you looked long enough the perfect dress could be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz drove you and Erin home.  You ran up to your room, only pausing briefly to greet your mom.  The preparations had started to get you excited for your date.  You got dressed in your new outfit and then you realized you didn't have shoes to go along with it.  You didn't have time to run out and get some, so you took your candies and said, \"I wish I had everything I needed for my date,\" then thinking again, \"and Erin has it too.\"  Soon you found all you needed for your date, not only the shoes that went with the dress, but also a purse, makeup, jewelry and of course some perfume.  Soon it was the appointed time and the bell rang.  You knew who it was and like everyone in your position you made him wait even though you were ready.  Soon you and Erin came down stairs to greet your dates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

This might be quite natural for you, there were many occasions where you and your 'friends' such as Liz and the ladies wore dresses and you had to too or you would be out of place.  But this was new for your mom.   She said, \"Why are you wearing that dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that your mom wasn't asking why are you wearing a dress in general, but she was criticizing the choice of dress.  This galled you since it took you so long to find the right dress.  It isn't easy to find a dress that fits you right, since you did have narrow hips and a flat chest.  Also, you really couldn't wish to be older.  No woman in Liz's group wished to be older.  They were all doing their best to look younger.  And what about your date, would he still like you if you were suddenly older?  No you couldn't wish that.  Then you hit upon the perfect wish.  \"I wish mom always believed what I tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mom,\" you said, \"you never ask me where I am going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Nate.  But what about that dress?\" your mom inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just bought it, I think you should just love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.  Have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen because your mom was criticizing your dress, you told her out of spite.  \"You know mom, Erin and I will be out of the house for a while..\"</span></div></div>",

But Trevor might not think to play those games with his mom.

Mom will be playing like a little boy all night.  Then it occurred to you. \"What would happen if Trevor wanted to play doctor?\"  Well if he does, then he'll learn a lot to night you thought as you got into the car with your date.

So, she ran to the nearest bed and started jumping up and down on the bed, excited with how rapidly her boobs jiggled. While this was going on, Trevor walked by.

Lynda replied, \"It's fun! i don't know why i never realized it before! Come on, jump with me!\". With no hesitation, Trevor joined her in jumping around without a care in the world\". \"Mommy, are you supposed to be doing this? Isn't this, uh, against the rules or something?\". \"Poopy!\" Lynda replied, \"I'm the mommy! I MAKE the rules!\".

There was more room for people to walk around making jokes and talk the gossip throughout their peers. Everyone did not pay attention to you that much despite your current appearance because of the candies. Maybe you had to make the first move for someone to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I will be seen.\" You mumbled to yourself, hoping someone will notice you. You still haven't left the bathroom door though. No one had their sights looking at the bathroom as it was something they would ignore unless they have to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to make the first step onto the wooden flooring with your sock. It was a little slippery when you begin to walk onto the floor. You weren't sure if it was your socks that were trying to make you slip. The light shining down onto the floor made it seem that it was recently waxed. I'm sure this was kept tidy 24/7, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you adapted from not slipping, now it was time to make your move. \"A strong-willed posed should help you stand out from the crowd\". This was something your father had told you as a child when you had wanted to be picked for a game of kickball in school. You adjusted your posture up right as you justly walk through an empty area of the floor that was free from teenagers blocking your path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass by, you started to get a couple of glances from teenagers who weren't engaged in a conversation--which were the single males attending the party to try and get attention for themselves. They were curiously looking at your breasts which the upper part was exposed by your bra. Then they looked at your face which was masculine because you were a male after all. They disregarded this as a hallucination and continued being the silent people drinking their sodas off in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, this was a success somehow. You at least got noticed by some, but not the majority of people. I'll need to step up my game, you thought. It was probably time to use another wish from a candy in your purse. Before that, your throat was starting to become parched. The drinks were in the kitchen as you saw from several feet away. Silently, you walked over to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was empty to your surprise. The parties you go to had many different people chatting around near the counter, but here, is was practically empty. \"Might as well hide my wishes secretly,\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an assortment of different drinks; you decided to pick the fruit punch which was the most popular choice as there were empty bottles piled up to the side. You fill the drink up in your cup and sip as you think up of a plan for everyone to notice you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I make myself more seductive? You wondered. You looked sexy as you are now because of your chest. However a wish from a candy can make you much more noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr do I catch a lucky break? Maybe for someone to notice you, it had to be a \"random\" moment. Probably you could stumble upon someone and you would get recognized without having to make a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered your choices...</span></div></div>",

Inside, Lynda was instructing everyone where to go. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Mike and Trevor go to the tux shop to rent some tuxedos while Erin, Nicole, and I will be going to the salon for manicures.\" Surprisingly Lynda didn't even say your name. At least she didn't want you to go all girly because you were wearing a dress. \"Nate,\" she said. \"Here's fifty dollars. You can go to the store and buy some new clothes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" you reply as you head out to the clothing store. Why does she want me to buy new clothes for myself, you thought as you continue walking. In the store you decide where to go to buy new clothes. I think I'll buy some new t-shirts, you thought. It would be nice to buy some t shirts since your old ones are wearing out. At the teens section, you pick out your t shirts and try them on in the dressing room. Inside you remove your shirt and replace it with the new clothes. You notice that it was small size that it shows your cleavage. \"Maybe I should buy this,\" you say. \"So I can tease the guys. What am I saying?\" You shook your head and pressed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be $ 14.99,\" The cashier said. You hand her the cash and went to the benches. Let me see, you thought. You had $35 dollars left to spend on clothes. Maybe, you thought, I guess I should buy some girls clothes as well. You regretted the idea for a minute, but you had other weird stuff that happened to you recently such as you had wishing candies. Then it just hit you. You brought some of the mints and realized you forgot all about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had more money,\" you said as you ate the mint. Then, a $100 dollar bill appeared in your pocket. Realizing you had that much money you could buy extra clothes and other stuff as well. \"Let's shop,\" you say. What happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At home, you placed your new clothes inside your closet. Meanwhile, it was almost time to go to the party and you put on your dress and high heels. You went up to the mirror and looked at yourself. You can't believe that you are wearing a dress. \"Wow you look great.\" you hear Lynda said as she got dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the jar of candies and grab a few of them for yourself and went to the car.</span></div></div>",

At that point, the colors of both started to fade, turning black in color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black color spread until the entire garment was black. Then, the leggins of the shorts joined together to form a skirt, which only went to about mid-thigh. It hugged tightly against them. Then, your arm sleeves began to crawl up, exposing your arms totally. Then, the necklince plunged as your upper body began to be exposed. The garment stopped just before your breasts, exposing a bit of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish it off, a big belt formed around your waist, tightening it. It was odd against your still male waist, but it was good anyway. Also, the material changed, becoming silky to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, unreal\" you said to yourself in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe I should show this off to other people.

He could still feel his IQ dropping, lower and lower, as the problems made less and less sense. Reality shifted a bit, but by some cosmic twist, Nate suddenly became aware of the universal changes.. He looked down and realized that his hips were not right, and his body had been altered, and for some reason, he kept getting dumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate began to panic to himself \"how much longer until I'm just a drooling... uh... um.. what's the word? uh.. oh! Idiot!\" Then he clapped, having forgotten the panic halfway through the sentence and happy merely because he got the word he was looking for. While clapping and jumping around, his breasts suddenly swelled out to a C-cup, and he became endowed with the envied hourglass figure of a woman, which complimented his ass, breasts, and legs nicely. Nate's face also became far more feminine, and his arms became weaker and smaller, losing all of their muscle mass and hair. Nate suddenly began to forget who he was.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started panicking, trying to hold desperately on to any memory or though that he could.. attempting to keep parts of himself.. but his focus became more and more limited, so he could concentrate on less memories at a time. As this occurred, as soon as he looked away from a memory, it either completely vanished, or was replaced. Nate was becoming less and less himself, and more and more Natalie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie/remainders of Nate screamed in a voice high and prissy \"I AM A BOY, NOT A GIRL!\" Everyone in class stared at you, laughed hysterically, and then went back to what they were doing when the teacher got angry and yelled. Natalia however, looked around the room, dazed and confused. \"A boy? No, I'm pretty sure I'm a girl, actually. Like, why did I say that?\" The teacher replied \"Natalie, get back to work and stop talking to yourself! I know you have the brain of a goldfish, but seriously, I don't care as long as you try! *stupid*\" he yelled, and then whispered the last word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling and humming, Natalia started doodling hearts on her paper where her answers belonged. Then, she felt something incredibly weird. There was an odd movement between her legs.. She got up and said \"I've to got the bathroom, Mr. Teacher sir!\" As she ran out, the teacher said \"you mean, I've 'Got to go to the bathroom,' not 'I've to got' or whatever you said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran out, panicked, and went into a girls stall, pulled down her now semi masculine pants (which were starting to turn into a skirt now) and looked down to see an erect penis between her legs, 4 and a half inches long, and throbbing. She screamed \"OH SHIT! I HAVE A DICK!!!!\" before covering her own mouth, realizing that screaming <i>might</i> not be a good idea. Looking between her legs, she figures 'why not' and begins stroking herself. As she does so, she feels the tingling good feeling intensify, and result in a male orgasm, which caused her to accidentally spray seed into her own face and all over her denim skirt. Suddenly, a bra formed around her boobs and her t-shirt turned into a blouse. Jewelry and necklaces began to form on her, and she was now fully female, save the penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to have a second go, and started fiercely jacking off, almost getting to an orgasm. As she did so, she felt a shifting inside of her, and as if at the drop of a dime, her balls ascended within her, leaving only a loose, but tightening empty sack. Her penis was just at the orgasm, when suddenly it slipped through her fingers, between two new folds of flesh between her legs. She watched as it shrank from the remaining tiny stub into a barely seeable clitoris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured \"Hey, this is how it's supposed to be\" so she pulled up her skirt and thong (just previously boxer shorts) and got up to leave the bathroom and goes to class..</span></div></div>",

His boxer briefs are beginning to change in color to black and shrink into a cotton thong and a black cotton bra is beginning to wrap itself around his chest.  Other changes are more subtle as his back pack is still black, but some of the things inside are different more feminine things ie: make up, brush, etc., and a new blackberry are inside which she has silenced. Class finishes up and they both leave going to their next class. As they move they still talk and stop to check their make up and it's as if Nate does it on autopilot. They head to advanced chemistry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Michelle are also talking to some of the other female athletes, when his testicles are moving up becoming ovaries as his empty scrotum is tight and swallowing his penis, it's becoming the rest of his/her anatomy it separates becoming a fully functional clit, vagina, uterus, and f. tubes.

Under his coal black hair slicked down on his head, his dark brown eyes seem to sparkle as he speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think magic is real?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" the girl exclaims, and the boy shrugs and says, \"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't you box up some of those candies and send them to someone with a note saying they are and see what happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl springs from the chair calling, \"I know just who to send them to,\" as she pulls a small box from a a cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's that?\" the boy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy that lives on Holland Street. It's Nathan's birthday in a couple days. It would be a great surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she filled the box from the candy in the bowl, the room faded and you found yourself back in your room. The man was gone, and you wondered if he had ever been there. Just because two kids thought about it doesn't explain why you received these in the ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my!</i>\" you thought realizing that you live on Holland Street and your name is Nathan - Nate for short. But these kids sent that box at least fifty years ago.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything she does makes you feel wonderful, and you're so glad to be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she slows down her talking as the two of you walk into a small cafe, and you stop so she turns and faces you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie, thanks for taking me to the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate,\" she starts looking at you then glancing down as she blushes. \"I'm so glad that we finally had this date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze her hand and use the other to lift her chin so your eyes meet. Staring into those deep green pools, you realize that you could really go for her as your girlfriend even though she's still your cousin. The way she acts and talks just like Kate makes you smile until you get a brain twitch of what's happening: She only changed the two of you back physically. She's still under her spell to act and talk like Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you pull a candy and pop it in your mouth before this all gets out-of-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Annie would not act or talk like Kate.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Annie uttered though words, light began to glow from her eyes and hands. She lifted up into the air as Nate watched the events unfold. To begin, her short auburn hair cascaded down to her rear, and save for one streak, turning all snow white. Then her body matured slightly as her hips blossomed and her bust, er, exploded, going from A-cup to E-cup in seconds. Her abs toned up as her waist trimmed further and bum plumped. Her exaggerated hourglass shaped arched back as her clothes began to shift, her jeans dissolving at the knees, the lower half becoming very loose kneesocks draped over black sneakers, while the top half started to fuse together and rode up her thighs, eventually becoming a tiny low-hanging pleated miniskirt that barely hung halfway down her thigh, barely covered her rear, and bordered on micro mini territory. Her panties became a black thong, and a thin pink belt with a large rectangular silver buckle with a ruby heart on it threads through her miniskirt's belt loops while a second, much thicker double-threaded red belt drapes over her left waist and down on her right hip, bearing a gold buckle with a diamond star on it. Her shirt fused to her bra and became a black bikini top that barely held her new burgeoning assets. On her forearms were black and red striped sleeves that drooped over her wrists. Magic light created a crimson scarf for her to sport, bearing black Wiccan/Pagan pentagram (not to be confused with Satanic/Evil pentagrams) on the ends. On her head a large classic black witch's hat comes to rest on her crown. Dangling angel wing-adorned heart-shaped earrings pierce her ears. Finally, as she begins to descend, her changes coming to an end, a pentagram tramp stamp appears just above her slightly visible butt crack, while a pearl wand tipped with a jewel encrusted gold star atop a winged heart appeared in her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate ran over to nab the formerly mousy girl, but found she needed no help setting foot back on the ground. Gazing in the mirror, Annie looked at herself... then did a double take... then a triple take... and in the quadruple take was juggling her own breasts. \"Apparently, witches have changed since the 'Wizard of Oz...' or \"Charmed,' for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate said, \"You kind of look like one of those mahou shojo - magical girls...\" Annie squats his hand as she caught him trying to reach over to examine the sweater meat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie said, \"I don't remember Sailor Moon wearing THIS skimpy. So much for being 'Little Witch.' However...\" She looks herself over in the mirror. \"I could get used to this outfit...\" She squats Nate's hand again. \"For the last time, this isn't hillbilly country!! I thought I dealt with that whole 'kissing cousin girlfriend' thing already!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're so hawt now... Maybe you could change it so we weren't cousins?!\" Nate blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought of this before, haven't you?\" Annie coyly shot out in a monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask what triggered it?\" Annie quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saw you blush and hesitate before you hugged me, so I figured you had a crush on me, plus last year at the beach when your top was nabbed by that pervy dog you just stood there and let me see your chest for a full thirty seconds before running off.\" Nate listed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie blushed vehemontly, and barked out, \"One, you got that free view because I froze up with embarrassment. If it wasn't for that fog horn reminding me I was outside and making it worse by standing still you might still be staring at them!! Two, that hug was platonic, PLATONIC!! I hesitated BECAUSE I recalled that beach incident. Giving a hug, an act that could press my chest into another, to the cousin that just stared at my cans instead of helping or getting me something to cover up with or even simply looking away was just awkward!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were my first boobs!!\" Nate blasted. An awkward silence filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie finally breaks the silence a minute later. \"Okay... That didn't help.\" Another moment. \"Well, now that that unpleasantness is out of the way...\" She catches Nate staring at her breasts. \"<i><b>AGAIN?! THAT\"S IT!! I'M FIXING THIS!!</b></i>\" Acting on witch instinct, she twirled her wand and summoned a spellbook into her right hand, eyes glowing. Pages tuned on their own, and then Annie began to read a spell in an odd tongue. Nate fell on his butt and tried to crawl away backwards, but hit his closed door. Annie took her hand from the glowing book, which levitated in place without her hand, and lifted her hand, bearing a glowing gold fireball in the palm, toward Nate, flinging the flame, creating a golden ray that connected with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell...</span></div></div>",

This is a Familiar's Contract spell... Uueeee...\" She comically loosens her scarf. Flipping to the appendix, she looks up familiars. \"Despite common folklore, familiars aren't demons or spirits, but mortals that apprentice to witches. Unlike children born of witches, the only ways mortals have to gain a witch's power is through a magical artifacts, or by becoming a familiar to a full-fledged witch for 100 years. When a mortal enters into a Familiar's Contract, there are three things to remember. The first is that <i><u>ALL FAMILIARS MUST BE FEMALE. THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE, AS WITCH'S MAGIC IS CONDUCIVE ONLY IN A FEMALE FORM</u></i>.\" Annie saw that Nate was already well on his, er, her way to femdom, her hair blonde, and down to her chin in an A-line bob. However, she was hunched over, so the other details couldn't be made out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading on, Annie saw, \"Second, all familiars are part animal. Typically this means ears, tail, and enhanced senses. The animal they merge with is wholly random, but most often the average house cat, thus the mythos of cats as familiars. Familiars are also lycanthropes that fully transform on full moons and solar eclipses.\" She was looking at Nate again, and saw she was sporting a very bovine tail sticking out a pair of short shorts, along with floppy cow ears, small nubbish horns, a little udder just below her navel, and... four giant breasts?! They were all in a t-shirt, but were clearly F-cup, at least. \"When familiars graduate, they are cured of their lycanthropy, and they can shed these animal parts, <i><u>IF</u></i> they elect to. Some new witches elect to retain their animal parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirdly, a Familiar's Contract cannot be rescinded until the familiar graduates or the mistress witch dies.\" Annie gulps. \"This sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate gets up, and says, \"What was that for?\" She then sees her reflection and screams. There was a cowgirl with four giant breasts and an udder dressed in short shorts, tight tee, and sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guess you'll need a new name.\" Annie said. \"How about Ophelia?\" Nate's sullen face warmed a little. \"Let's not sulk about this though. You have a birthday party going on downstairs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Let's have fun.\" Ophelia said. She grabs the candies on the way out of the room...</span></div></div>",

Ophelia's <b><i>crazy</i></b> aunt Bethany, who works as a chef, becomes the first to break the silence in earnest by pointing at Ophelia and blurting, \"OMGWTFBBQ!! Is that an udder?! ...Let's eat it.\" Everyone looks at her for suggesting possible cannibalism, then back at Annie and Ophelia. Martha screams, \"Annie, you go get out of those skank clothes this instant and then get over here!! Don't think you're too big to have your ass tore up!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Ophelia's classmates that came, Kiki Strutters (yeah, that's actually her name...), a brainy genius-IQ level 12 year-old tsundere girl (raised by parents that are both vapidly dumb bimbo-ish strippers [and while still loving her parents, strives to be their opposites in every way]) with blonde hair in twin pig-tails dangling to her knees and ginormous breasts for a girl her age (E-cups?), wearing a white blouse, necktie, black suit jacket, and black suit pants (She loves suits), came up and grabbed Ophelia's udder and nursed a teat, getting a faceful of milk. \"What in the world are world are you, and where did you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia, the only person you know from school, had a different response to Annie and Ophelia, especially Ophelia. \"<b>BURN IT WITH FIRE!!</b>\" she screams as she cracks a broom over Ophelia's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie, in shock, says, \"I don't think they recognize us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia exclaims in her concussion filled daze, \"Ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie goes, \"Let me fix this!!!\" She summons her spellbook, which only serves to spook the already apprehensive partygoers, and elicits a \"She's a witch!! Burn her!!\" from Erin. Finally, Annie closes the book with a disappointed sigh. \"Witch magic can't change reality. It simply doesn't have that power!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia opens the satchel of candies and eats one, saying, \"But I know what does!! I wish everyone that knows us would accept Annie being a witch as perfectly normal, as well as me being turned into her cowgirl familiar... by accident.\" With a wave of light, the panicking or mobbing masses vanished, and history changed to a reality where there appearances were perfectly normal. Martha goes up to Annie as says, \"I'm proud of you being a witch, though I wish having to dress like a bimbo wasn't necessary to 'convene' with the cosmic astral lines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie grinned nervously and answered, \"Mom, I know, but for some reason clothes interfere with the flow of mana... But there isn't anything I can really do about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda runs over to Ophelia. \"How's our birthday... girl? I'm still getting used to that, you accidentally forging a Familiar's Contract with Annie. But hey, you get to learn magic now, and... <b>FREE MILK!!</b>\" Lynda reaches for an udder teat when Ophelia smacks a hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!!\" Ophelia exclaims in a whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know... Not in public. However, I know how you like to get milked every morning before school, and before bed.\" Ophelia blushed profusely at the words, feeling the milk sloshing about in her four breasts and udder, at how weird it was to hear her mom say such things. However, she remembered she wasn't all that specific in the wish, so a slightly kinkier mom that liked to monitor her daughter's milking regimen may be a side effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lynda wandered off, Annie said, \"Now, wanna liven this party up now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the light died down, Nate saw a note on his bed written on a sheet of sketch paper. He leaned over and nabbed it up, Scribbled on it was a simple message in his own handwriting; \"Eat a candy and say, 'I wish I knew what was going on.' Trust me. - Nate.\" On the piece of paper with the message was a doodle he was mostly done with, but yet on this sheet of paper it was complete. Nate scrounged about and found his original doodle, untouched, and compared it to this finished work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate flashes an odd look on his face, but figured he shouldn't doubt a mysterious that appeared out of the blue addressed to him, signed by him, and written in his own handwriting. If it worked, he'd get his answers. At the very least, it'd be a tasty treat. \"Down the hatch.\" Nate said popping a candy. He then did as he was instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's sight blurred, his head reeling in the throes of migraine-level pain. Suddenly, all the memories of everything he did, and all the events that led up to him becoming 'Sandra' came flooding back into his mind, as well as knowing the errant wish by your father that started the chain reaction. \"Disturbing. Okay... So these things have a monkey's paw mentality to them sometimes. If you don't phrase things right, horrible consequences will unfold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" a familiar voice said. Nate turned and saw his mother in his doorway. \"Maybe this time you'll keep a better eye on the candies. I honestly didn't like the idea of calling my son 'mom.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was flabbergasted. \"Who? Wha...? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made these, durr.\" A tape player appears in her left hand in a puff of smoke and she and replayed the line, \"Now remember to not waste these and think about what you do. I don't want to have to take them away to fix things.\" While dismissing the tape deck, she adds, \"I thought you'd recall me saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a witch?\" Nate asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witch is a such a dirty word...\" There is an awkward silence, then she adds with a blase tone, \"I'm actually a freed djinn.\" About a minute later, when Nate woke back up, Lynda kept explaining, \"See, while I lack all the powers of a captive djinn, I still have quite a bit of mana coursing through my veins. As for my children... only my female offspring will ever exhibit any special powers, and Erin is only a birthday away from discovering her mana. To be fair, I made these 'Candies of Change' for my boys, candies made with my concentrated essence, so it's like seeing me back in my prime when I was bound to a lamp with each treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate uttered, \"Why didn't you tell this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing is believing, and the candies were my way of getting you to see.\" Lynda told her child. \"Speaking of seeing...\" she adds, \"While I'm a firm believer of the 'Many Worlds Theory' of time travel, just to cover our quantum bases, maybe you should send the note back to yourself now.\" She flicks a candy to Nate. \"A freebie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... okay.\" Nate hastily jotted down what was on the now present note and finished the doodle, then said with candy in mouth, \"I wish this piece of paper was on my bed ten minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that is done,\" Lynda explains, \"Before I let you enjoy your day, I should suggest a wish to you and explain how these things work.\" She sits down in his desk chair, which she has amazingly place on the ceiling. \"First, obviously, there's the 'no wishing for more wishes' thing. However, the bag has 1000 candies, so I don't think you'll be running out anytime soon.\" Nate looks at the tiny sack that looks barely deep or tall enough to put your pinky in, wondering how it can hold so many candies. \"Stable Einstein-Rosen bridge, if you're wondering. That's right. There's no candy in there, just a wormhole to where the candy REALLY is.\" Lynda says to sate his curiosity. Going on, she says, \"Second, you can't intentionally kill someone through wishing. Now I haven't got to test it yet, but I think you can't accidentally kill anyone either, but I'm not sure.\" Nate gulps. \"Going on, be specific. As you learned in the previous reality, vague wishing leads to weird results, like you becoming your dad's wife, and having your memories and personality changed. That brings me to my suggestion to the one wish you should definitely make; 'I wish by no means my mind or personality can be altered by any means, natural, magical, or technological, in perpetuity throughout time, until the end of time.' That way, even if, say, Mike were make the same wish again, you'd only change physically. While the universe would change to fit the new world order, your mind would stay intact, and allow you to undo or modify the damage, and not lose yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that detail.\" Nate utters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Lynda goes on, \"never, NEVER, <b>NEVER</b> wish for things to 'be normal,' 'go back to normal,' or anything involving the word normal. It will make the world as is the status quo.\" She gets up, and finishes, \"other than that, enjoy. Cake will be ready in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lynda left, Nate considered all he could do. He popped a candy and...</span></div></div>",

Your short brown hair slowly starts to extend, flowing past your neck and down your back. Eventually, it went down to mid-back. \"Buch better\" you say. You then look at your hair shampoo and shake your head slightly. \"If I'm going to have long hair, I really should use some scented shampoo to give it that fruity smell\" you say. You grab yet another candy and suck on it. \"I wish my hair shampoo was scented\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you see your normal men's shampoo turn into a women's scented shampoo. \"There we go\" you say and you start washing your hair with the smell of watermelon filling the air. Eventually, after a while, you drained the tub and stepped out. \"That was fun\" you say and grab a towel. You dry yourself and put your bra on as well as a new t-shirt and shorts.

The leggings merged into one, forming a skirt. The skirt extended to your knees. A variety of blue and black designs decorated the skirt. Your clothes were now very sexy but it wasn't done yet. Your socks completely vanished, leaving just your shoes on your feet. Then, they changed material. The top opened up to reveal your feet and became a bunch of straps. First, a few straps covered most of your toes. Then, the other straps converged around your ankles, keeping them on. Then, a big change. A heel formed under them forcing you upwards. It was quite a few inches long. You stumbled on the heels a bit but caught your balance. Here were your new clothes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/include/Zoom.jsp?PRODUCT&amp;#60;&amp;#62;prd_id=845524446250318&amp;FOLDER&amp;#60;&amp;#62;folder_id=282574490296619&amp;bmUID=iGtSaN4\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/include/Z...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, very nice\" you say in approval of your new clothes. Then, Mike exited the bathroom and was stunned at your appearance. \"Wow Nate, you look fantastic!\" he says. You kind of blush a bit and twirl your hair. \"Thank you\" you say.</span></div></div>",

The skirt made you feel so free. while the heels hurt your feet a bit, you liked the feel of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, because of Mike's wish, you did change a bit without you using the candies. At lunch, Mike went to go get food while you waited. Strangely enough, you crossed your legs in a feminine manner. Then, you could see yourself changing. Your feet started to shrink and smooth. They became dainty. Your toes also shrank and smoothed, becoming hairless. Your heels adjusted to the new size. Since that, you really loved the heels now because now you can show off your beautiful feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, night came. \"That was a fun day!\" you said. \"Yes it was\" says Mike. You took off your top, skirt, and heels, leaving just your bra and boxers. As your dad went into the bathroom, you started thinking. \"Maybe I should wear more than just a bra and boxers' you think.

You pulled your boxers down to see your penis down there. \"You know, I'm discovering so many things about women, but how can I explore this side with this thing?\" you say. You grab a candy from the bag and suck on it. \"I wish my penis was gone and replaced with a vagina.\" you say. The odd feelings come up as you make that wish. Looking down, you see your balls shrinking and going back into your body. Inside, you turn into a pair of ovaries. Then, your manhood slowly shrinks into your body, leaving nothing but a slit, forming a full vagina. Inside you, a womb with eggs form, completing your new reproductive system. \"That's better\" you say and finish your business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you get out and Mike enters the bathroom. Then, you discover that your boxers don't fit anymore. \"I need something to better fit me now\" you say as you pull out another candy. \"I wish that my boxers became panties\" you wish. Your boxers then started to change. The leggings climbed up your legs and disappeared. Then, it all faded to a black color and turned into a lacey material. The top of the boxers became just a line as they turned into a black thong.

That is how the second day went out, just a day at the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the trip through the mall however, you felt some strange feelings.

For some reason, Natalia sounds better to you than Nate. \"Yes it is\" you answer. You get a towel wrapped around your torso and are lead to the spa area. First, you got messaged and than a mud mask for your face. Once those were done, you were lead to the woman's hot spring. Now, going into the woman's room felt more natural to you. Inside the spring, there were two other woman around your age. A brunette named Jessica and an asian named Rebecca. \"Hi, I'm Natalia\" you introduce yourself. The three talk talking about girly things. You got more and more engrossed into the conversation, as if you were already a complete woman. By the way, your lips finished becoming fuller, becoming kissable. Also, your skin was now silky smooth. Also, your arms and legs were smooth and slender. Your hands became petite with long fingers and longer fingernails. That wasn't all. Your eyebrows were now thin and your eyelashes became longer. You were nearing complete womanhood and you didn't even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was said and done, you and Mike left the spa. \"That was fun!\" you said. Your voice was still male.

As he walked away, it felt as if your heart melted at his smile, It felt like it was turning you on just thinking about it. \"Well, he is pretty hot\" you said to yourself. Maybe, you two should do a little evening fun before you both leave to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you walked into the ladies room as you weren't a man where it counted anymore. You walked in and found many ladies that were mostly half-naked at the time. However, you thought nothing of it. You thought of them as women and didn't think about them the way you used to. Anyway, you sat down and pulled out your swim trunks. You had forgotten that they were still male trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to change that\" you said with a smile as you took out another candy. \"I wish my swimtrunks were a nice bikini.

You smiled in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mike\" you said and kissed him on the lips again. This time, it was a little longer than usual as your lips were fully kissable and kissing Mike seemed like something you both enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both layed your towels across the sand and set some chairs and umbrellas up. You asked Mike to put the sun lotion on you as you layed down. He obliged without a second thought. You felt a little arroused as he put the lotion on you. One of his hands grabbed your butt a tiny bit but you seemed to like it, thinking that he was cute when he was naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went by quickly. You more often than not lated down in the sun to work on yoru tan. When not doing that, you and Mike took walks and talked. You enever noticed that your conversations with him seemed to be changing. No longer were they things for father and son, but rather husband and wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, night came and you both went back to the hotel. You put your nigthgown on and layed down in the bed. You both really enjoyed that trip to the beach and made sure that you both would have something fun to do on your last day here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, it seemed like you had aged a bit again to stop at 30 years old, close to your dads, in which you would officially become his new wife.</span></div></div>",

You just stood there, looking a little worried as she looked at you, standing there with C-cup breasts in a black bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hi Mom....you notice anything? You asked her, a bit worried. What would she say about this? Apparently not much though, as Lynda didn't look at you much differently. She just said that you looked normal, which made you sigh in relief. So they don't notice anything new? That was something to keep in mind as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****A Day Later*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enjoying your newest birthday gift with giving yourself breasts, it was time to head back to school now. You sighed at that, as you wanted the weekend to last longer. Still, you had to get going. Your breasts were still there, and you had yet to show anyone outside the family about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you got on a nice red shirt, although you looked odd with the C-cups poking through so obviously. Your shirts weren't that long either, and your bellybutton could almost be seen underneath. Other than that, you just got on some normal shorts and your shoes. You did put one or two candies in your pocket just in case. Saying good bye to your parents, you headed towards the bus stop. It was still the most convenient way to get to High School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how the others might react to these.\" You said to yourself. How would your own teachers see you now? What about Kate, the girl you had a major crush on? Oh, you could just see her face if she didn't think breasts on you were normal. Then again, you honestly felt a bit more confident now. You had talked to her at times, though not too much. Perhaps now could be the time. You had tried to advance on her at times, but you imagined she was cool with it. She was really nice after all, so what could she hold against you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of thought, you heard the bus come in. You got on with the rest of the students there, though you had no idea how things would turn out for you on this day.</span></div></div>",

You looked down one more time at your chest, seeing your assets poking through. No one seemed to be noticing so far, not even Tommy, who was your best friend. He was right behind you, but he didn't seem to notice anything. He just looked at you silly when you asked if anything was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you ended up sitting down in your normal seat. Right across on the other side, you saw Kate sit down as well. You had crushed on her for quite a long time, about as long as you and Tommy had been friends. Why wouldn't you? She wasn't popular in that sense, but many people liked her for her personality. You did as well, as she was as nice now as she was in Kindergarten. She was about average in height, about 5'3, but she had nice green eyes and long dark hair. It really fit with her fair complexion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually had some friends around her, but it looked like she was on her own this time. Perhaps you could finally talk to her? She likely had no idea that you had breasts either. Or at the very least, she didn't think they were weird at all. Perhaps this time you could talk to her. You had tried to advance on her in the past, but nothing came from them. Still, you had to try. Kate was nice enough where she didn't hold much against people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when the bus stopped again to pick up another batch of kids, you slowly came over to Kate's side, to which nobody really paid attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kate.\" Kate suddenly turned and was a bit surprised to suddenly see you there but she recovered, smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Nate. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing fine. I see you're well.\" you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm doing fine.\" Kate felt a tiny bit uncomfortable as you were sitting there; your breasts partially seen through your shirt. She remembered how you tried advancing on her in the past. She mostly just smiled you off, as you knew you since Kindergarten and kind of knew how you normally acted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fully honest though, as you actually began talking about stuff as best you could, she was a little bit frustrated with your constant advances. Could you take a hint that she wasn't really interested right now? Perhaps that's how boys always are. Kate sighed as you kept talking, which surprised both of you with how much you could talk. Sheesh, did a pair of breasts really give you that much confidence? Just as Kate was thinking, she felt something fall into her hand. She looked down to see a candy there, which happened to fall out of your pocket. She wasn't quite sure what it was, given that she had never seen the candies before, but she felt the need to pop it in her mouth. So, she did just that, putting the rather nice-tasting treat into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that happened though, you just happened to ask if she was free later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate.....\"</span></div></div>",

The only thing you\u2019ve ever considered is what move you\u2019re gonna use on me today!\u201d She continued, the passion in her voice observing a crescendo.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cThere it is\u2026\u201d You thought to yourself. \u201cI guess this is what they call \u2018friend-zoned\u2026\u2019\u201d You proceeded in the back of your mind. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cSo, Nate\u2026\u201d She said coldly. \u201cI mean what I said. I wish that you\u2019d put yourself in my shoes\u2026\u201d She finished, unable to look you into the eye. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cWell\u2026\u201d You said to yourself, in the mind. \u201cAt least we\u2019re friends\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d You sighed mentally as the brakes of the bus screeched, coming to a slow halt. The doors opened and the students around you dashed out of the vehicle<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cBye\u2026 Nate\u2026\u201d Kate swiftly said, still not looking you in the eye, sliding herself past you in order to get out. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI don\u2019t get\u2026 I just don\u2019t get it. There she goes, using the word \u2018wish\u2019 again\u2026\u201d You said to yourself, under your breath, butterflies fluttering about in your stomach. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     \"Women.\" You plainly justified as the reasons behind the peculiar way she was acting.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     You walked out of the bus, and there stood your best friend, Tommy, who stood with that strange smile he always had about him. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cTime for class, bud.\u201d You told him, as the two of you began on your way to class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've known Kate just as long, and she's always been a bit uncomfortable trying that sort of thing.\" He said, trying to be helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Perhaps I just thought that it would work this time.\" You sighed. Guess you just didn't understand women like Kate. A thought briefly went to the candies, but there's no way you would use them to do anything like that. Still, nothing made you feel much better as you and Tommy entered the school building together. However, he didn't stick around for long afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bud, I gotta get something done quickly. See you in 1st class!\" And with that he was off, making you sigh. That guy always procrastinated, but you did too at times so who were you to judge. After Tommy disappeared from view, that left you to just head to the Freshman Hall to your own locker. You went up the stairs to the 2nd level and went down that hall, passing by all the other students. You didn't see Kate at all, so perhaps she was already here. You didn't have her until 4th period, which was the last one of the day. You didn't have many chances to talk to her in the first place, so that made things harder. Should you apologize? Perhaps that would be a good idea. At least mend what happened so no one can talk of it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked down to your locker, doing the lock and opening it up. As you switched out which books you didn't need, you couldn't stop thinking about the Kate incident. After that, you shook your head, as you just wanted to put it behind you. Yet, the memory didn't seem to want to do away. It got so hard that you actually started combing your hands through your short hair quickly. Right as you realized that, you chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, combing my hair like this. Kate always does that when she's frustrated. Always found that kind of cute.\" You said to yourself. Kate always had that nervous habit of combing her hands through her hair when she was frustrated or nervous. Old habits never die apparently. Anyway, after finishing getting your books, you closed the locker and began heading out. You needed a quick bathroom break before class, so that was your next destination. You headed straight to the bathrooms down a level, heading in and doing your business. Eventually, you heard the flushing sound and went up to wash your hands. You were a bit frustrated as the Kate event wouldn't leave your mind. However, it seemed to be getting weirder. Brief images of the event were coming into your head, but it was almost like you were seeing them from Kate's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\" However, when you look up to dry your hands, you nearly did a double-take. Your eyes were normally a nice blue, but when you looked in the mirror, they were now a striking green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck? What's going on?\" You put a hand to your eye, seeing if the reflection was true, and it was. Was it just a trick of the light? Or were you just going insane? Yo had forgotten about the candies right now, as your mind was on many other things. Besides, you had no idea Kate made a wish.</span></div></div>",

Speaking of your hair, something else caught your attention as you glanced into the mirror, horrified\u2026<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      \u201cAnd I know that my hair isn\u2019t this dark!\u201d You exclaimed, staring at your hair, which certainly was a few shades darker. You couldn\u2019t quite put your finger on it, but\u2026 The hair color, the color of those eyes they looked a lot like\u2026<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cKates!\u201d You frantically wailed. \u201cThe hair looks like Kates, my eyes, too!\u201d <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     You stood there for a few more minutes, violently inhaling and exhaling, in a panicked state. But, as the minutes passed, the longer you stared at yourself, your fears and anxieties of whatever was going on suddenly died where they stood. It\u2019s not that you quite thought of these aspects, like the hair and eye color, normal. You just became more and more comfortable with it.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWell\u2026\u201d You calmly sighed. \u201cI think those are the only things that have changed\u2026\u201d You said as your hyperventilation slowed until finally retracting to a steadier pace. And, so, the vicious cycle continued. The longer you stared into the mirror, those slight feature changes became less and less apparent to you. Heck, you didn\u2019t even notice your frame shrink the slightest bit. Also to skip over your attention was your height dropping from 5\u20196 to 5\u20195. It all went unnoticed, as you subconsciously continued to comb through your slowly elongating hair.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat am I even doing here anyway?!\u201d You exclaimed, snapping out of your little trance. \u201cI\u2019m nearly late for class!\u201d As you darted towards your first period class, in this case, English with a particular Ms. Judith Brooks, a young, go-getter type teacher. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You continued to rush down the crowded and clustered hallways, the chatter and various conversations taking place around you, combined with the rush in your steps, left you with a small headache and a foggy mind. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cLeft! Right! Another right! Down these stairs, up these!\u201d You said in your mind, guiding yourself to your classroom, no slowing in your speed. You could not be late to this next class.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cAnd\u2026 Bingo!\u201d You chimed, slowing down as you walked inside Ms. Brooks\u2019 classroom. You found yourself a bit shocked. Why was this? You feared you\u2019d be tardy. No, you were certain that you\u2019d be tardy! Yet, the classroom, Ms. Brooks aside, was empty! You looked to Ms. Brooks, who shot you a surprised look.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNate? Why so early?\u201d She asked as she sat at her desk, grading papers.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You cleared your throat. \u201cUhm\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I just didn\u2019t want to be late or anything y\u2019know?\u201d You answered, proceeding to your desk.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Ms. Brooks continued to offer you her peculiar look. \u201cI suppose, Nate\u2026 You do know you\u2019re ten minutes early, right?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You immediately turned your head to the clock that hung on the wall. 8:00 A.M. You were indeed early\u2026<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Ms. Brooks started, gaining your attention. \u201cI\u2019m just not used to seeing you here early, Nate.\u201d Ms. Brooks smiled before returning to her grading.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     This early arrival of yours reminded you of a trait a particular girl possessed. \u201cKate.\u201d You said under your breath. Kate certainly was the type who hated, loathed, even, tardiness. If she were late on something, she would be bothered by the not knowing of what she\u2019d missed. It was something you never understood, but, definitely did find to be cute. She wasn't exactly the super-nerdy type, but, not some delinquent, either.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     The more you thought about it, the more you began to empathize with Kate\u2019s reasoning behind being early. Never before had you understood it, but, now, her earliness made perfect sense.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Before long, more and more students began to slip into the classroom, until, right before the bell, students flooded the classroom as to avoid a tardy. You noticed that Tommy hadn\u2019t yet arrived. That was so like him\u2026<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cHe really ought to change that ugly habit of his\u2026\u201d You sighed, failing to notice the change in your vocabulary and view on your friend, Tommy. Heck, on a regular day, you\u2019d be late right along with him. But, unknown to you, this was no regular day.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     As Ms. Brooks began to call out roll, that headache returned, with a vengeance. You closed your eyes, breathed in, breathed out and attempted to relax and have rid of this storm in your head. Your mind became mistier and mistier, memories\u2026 They became distorted. All the times you\u2019ve had with Kate, of all people, you began to see from her perspective, like the conversation you had with her this morning. As the headache and fog continued to crescendo, escalating in violence, Ms. Brooks called your name and grabbed your attention.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Ms. Brooks looked to you, holding a clipboard with attendance sheet and called.. \u201cNate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ms. Brooks had just called you \"Nate Smith\", right? Where did that come from? Kate's name was Smith, but yours wasn't. You had a thought about asking Ms. Brooks if she had it right, but something in you chose against it. The more you thought about it, the more you seemed to get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Ms. Brooks suddenly called up the previous night's homework. You groaned at just the thought of it, as you knew that you didn't finish all of it. Your birthday plus the candies really made you forget about a few things. Still, you had to turn something in, so you took out your homework folder and pulled out what you needed. What you pulled out though shocked you. The page was completely done, and with neat handwriting too. Where did that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate, your paper?\" You turned up to see Ms. Brooks asking for said homework, which you turned in slowly. You were a bit apprehensive about it, but she took it without problem. As it did, you suddenly began seeing something. It was you writing homework, all of it, and in a different room than you're used to. For some reason, it seemed like you got it done before last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything just seemed like a mess, though a growing part of you was growing okay with it. There was a side of you that was trying to calm you down, and it resulted in you combing your hands through your hair again. Why did you keep doing this? That was Kate's habit, not yours. In addition to that, as Ms. Brooks gathered her things at her desk, you subconsciously crossed your legs. Since you couldn't see them underneath your jeans, your legs had gotten a bit longer now, with any hair they had just falling off gently, leaving smooth skin behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right everyone, if you turn to page 23...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe English lesson had begun, so you whipped out your book along with everyone else. However, once you did, you also eagerly got your notebook out, writing some quick things down. You were okay with notes usually, enough to get by, but right now you were writing stuff that you normally don't think of. You didn't know this and that happened in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lesson went on and your furious note-taking continued, your feet began to shrink and curve within your shoes. A gentle curve formed, made by wearing heels at some point, and your feet became much too small for the boy shoes, but also softer too. To be honest, it felt like your clothes were hanging a bit on you, like your t-shirt which was almost long enough for a short dress at this point. Still, you didn't seem to pay it much mind as the teacher droned on about the lesson. It felt as if you were the only one really listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the bell rung, signaling the end of 1st Period. Ms. Brooks gave out the next assignment, much to everyone's chagrin, and you packed up your books and notebook. What was the first thing you noticed after putting your backpack on?</span></div></div>",

Just a few shades darker, but certainly noticeable... And, your eyes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"They should be... Blue?\" You asked, continuing to pace the room, guys giving you a strange stare as they walked past you. You certainly must have looked a bit strange, almost insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Quickly, you ran to a mirror, paying the guy washing his hands next to you no mind. You needed another look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Green! That awesome shade of green Kate has!\" As you stared into your eyes in the mirror. And, the bathroom did seem just slightly taller than usual... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That's it! I must be going insane! That's all it could be, insanity! All this stress with Kate must be getting to me... I'm so infatuated with her I see her all the time... Even in me!\" You said, glancing to the mirror once more. \"...Like... I even remember this morning, but... From her view? I see me, but from her point of view...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Or! This is all a trick of these crappy lights!\" You said, placing the blame on the dimming, beat-down lights of the lavatory. \"Yup, that's it! That would explain it all! The hair looking darker, the eyes appearing a different color, the... room being tall? The memories? No... The lights probably have nothing to do with that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I need a second opinion!\" You said, darting out the restroom doors, straight to your classroom. You would've asked anyone in the restroom, but, the way they looked at you. They must've thought you to be insane. You needed someone who was unaware of your insanity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You continued to consider all these things... The point of view, the height, the hair, the green eyes, the way you combed your hair in anxiety... All of those things screamed Kate. Her signature, beautiful eyes, her elegant mane of hair, her rather petite height, those cute little mannerisms of hers... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What is going on?\" You asked yourself as you darted through the halls, finally arriving to your class; Ms. Brooks English class. You slammed the door open, relieved to find that students were still trickling in. Only a few people were currently in the class, Ms. Brooks sitting at her desk, her feet resting on the desk as she played about with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"There's my second opinion!\" You thought, taking a deep breath before walking to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Ms. Brooks?\" You asked, your voice sounding a bit more high-pitched. This made you step back a bit... \"That's new...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Ms. Brooks looked to you, a smile on her face, removing her feet from the desk, placing them on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure, Nate!\" She chirped. \"What's up?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I might sound a bit crazy...\" You whispered, leaning in a bit. She followed your actions and leaned in, to, sensing the discretion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What is it, Nate?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... What color are my eyes...?\" You asked, slowly, fearsome of what would be thought of your sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhmm...\" She mouthed, gesturing that you look her way. For a moment, she looked into your eyes, you looked into hers, and she immediately replied... \"Green, Nate...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You gulped, her answer sending your heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright... What about my hair? What color's that?\" You inquired, combing through your hair, which now seemed the slightest bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"A darkish shade of brown... Ugh... Why are you-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You cut her off, offering her yet another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And... Do I look a bit shorter to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She scanned you up and down for a fraction of a moment and finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well... You do look a bit short for a boy your age, but, it's fine! I'm sure you'll get there eventually! Now, is there any reason you'<br>\r\nre asking me these things, Nate...?\" She inquired, sounding almost concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    There was an air of silence for a few seconds until you finally uttered. \"... No reason. Just asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ooooo-kay...\" She dismissed, gesturing that you head for your seat. As you made your way there, the room being unusually tall was definitely there. And... It seems that you weren't going insane. These changes were truly happening, leaving you to wonder what in the world was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     By the time you got comfortable at your desk, the entire class had already appeared, including Tommy, who sat behind you, copying off of somebody's homework at the very last minute. You rolled your eyes at his gesture. While you sat here changing, into who-knows-what by some unknown-to-you-force, some things, like Tommy's habits, never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alrighty, class!\" Ms. Brooks chirped. \"Hope everyone's doing well this morning!\" She smiled, looking to you. \"Now, if you all recall, we have an assignment due today, if everyone could pass their papers forward...\" She continued, as your mind lay in other places... Like what in the world was happening to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

You rolled your eyes as Tommy's paper was passed up to your row. It looked so incoherent that you almost had a headache just looking at it. When will he ever learn? Well, it was bound to come back to bite him eventually. All you could was watch until it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right class, now that that is settled, please turn to Page 20....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, the class went into the discussion for the day. Honestly, you weren't quite sure what it was about, as English was never your best topic. You could read just fine, but reading between the lines so to speak was never your best quality. That was perhaps what you envied a bit about Kate; she was pretty good at that sort of thing. Perhaps you could actually ask about it sometime if you ever worked up the nerve again after today's rejection on the bus. Well, at least it was enough to try and get your mind off of the weird events today. The last thing you really wanted to do was remember your lack of height, green eyes, and darkening hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So class, what is the author implying on this paragraph? Harold, how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great, it was that time again. You really weren't into volunteering for this kind of discussion. Not really your thing. You were okay with mingling, but trying to talk about something you had no clue about wouldn't be good. Still, you at least tried to take good notes. You could hang your hat on that at least. Though, to be honest, as you kept writing, your hands began to feel pretty different. During one answer, you looked at your right hand, holding your pencil. Your palm seemed kind of smaller than normal, and your nails were nice and straight, not too long or anything. Your left hand was much the same way, not an imperfection in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did I clip my nails this morning?\" You made sure to whisper that comment so no one else could hear that. You weren't sure what to say about this, though it honestly didn't feel that bad. Sure, perhaps a little awkward, but maybe Erin messed around with you during the night or something. She wasn't the pranking type, but don't push it. However, in addition to that, as you were wearing a t-shirt, your arms felt smoother too. You worked out every now and then, so you weren't exactly stacked or anything, but the skin on your arms seemed more fair now, with your muscles a bit smaller. Was that a trick of the light too? Or has it just been longer than normal since the last time you worked out? Being in class right now, you weren't too sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can get a better look later.\" You whispered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you felt a little awkward in your seat, though it didn't seem like your body was any different. You tried shifting in your seat a bit, but something still seemed off. You looked down at your clothes: a normal t-shirt with shorts. To be honest, your shirt seemed a tiny bit closer to your body, so perhaps it was catching on something and constricting you a bit. You reached down and tried to sort it out. However, as you tugged on it a bit, the result greatly surprised you. The hem of your shirt was connected, almost like glue, to the hem of your shorts!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"What the...?\" You confusedly asked aloud, attempting to conceal the question under your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Curiously did you tug at the edge of your shirt, which certainly did appear to be attached to your shorts. As you gave that tug, you took notice that, along with your shirt, your shorts, too were being tugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"...\" You sat silent, speechless, as you slightly tilted your head downwards as to get a better look below your desk, particularly, your clothes. It was true. The shorts and shirt were now one cloth, almost like a dress. The 'short' part of the 'dress' retained its khaki, beige color while the top half of the 'dress' retained the dark green color of the former shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     One other thing caught your attention as you peeked below... \"And... Are my legs... Smoother? They look a little more slim, too...\" You whispered, again, in a failed attempt of discretion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Mr. Wilson!\" Ms. Brooks called, at which point you immediately turned her way, only to find her handing you a stern glare. You turn around, only to find the entirety of the class staring emptily at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You thought to yourself. \"I guess it is true what they say about whispers being louder than normal volume...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Mr. Wilson,\" Ms. Brooks began. \"Are you following our discussion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes! Yes I am.\" You nervously said, your voice trembling a bit. You never did deal well with being at the center-stage, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She handed you a devilish smile. \"So, then. Would you mind picking up where we left off?\" She asked, sure you'd fail at this, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Of course...\" You sighed. As you scanned the page, attempting to recover the last words you heard, you felt something brushing at the side of your face. Particularly, at the midst of your cheeks. You brushed the hair behind your ears instinctively. As the class, and the teacher, continued to stare you down, you freaked out and reached for your hair. The skin about your face felt notably smoother as well. And, as you touched your face, the way the touch of your hands felt. It felt familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It's longer.... and... DARKER.\" You thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes, Mr. Wilson, your hair is very nice...\" Ms. Brooks coldly said, igniting chatter and laughter about the remainder of the classroom. \"...Mr. Wilson, I'd like to speak to you after class...\" She sternly continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Ms. Brooks continued leading the discussion on whatever in the world it was they were speaking of, you looked back to find much of the class continuing to hand you their eyes, in a mocking way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So embarrassing...\" You thought, blowing off the distinct sound of Tommy's chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After what felt like an eternity, the bell rang it's ring, effectively dispersing the class. You and Tommy attempted to blend in with the crowd, trying to avoid Ms. Brooks' wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I haven't forgotten, Mr. Wilson!\" she called. You halted, wasting no time in doing so. You turned around, expecting to find Tommy waiting for you, as a friend should... No sign of him. Long gone was he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That little...\" You muttered as you dragged yourself to her desk, where she stood, tapping her foot in frustration. The toes of her heels clicking as they tapped the ground below reminded you of the trouble that certainly awaited. You looked down to your feet, attempting to avoid eye contact. Something else caught your eye, instead. Your shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You're kidding! Not the shoes!\" You noted your white sneakers... They certainly looked to be changing color and material. The white looked more like a beige-esque sort of color, kind of like the bottom half of the dress-like cloth you wore. And... your clothes looked a bit shorter, certainly a little tighter, and, most certainly more flowy at the end of the cloth. And, just like earlier, most of the hair about your legs had vanished, leaving mostly smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Up here, Mr. Wilson!\" You looked to her. To your disappointment, you matcher her height almost perfectly. You know for a fact that, on a regular day, you were two inches, more or less, taller than Ms. Brooks. This left you standing at a short, really short, 5'4.\" At least short for a boy your age.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt so bad right now, and to think it actually started out well enough. Now, Kate turned down another advance from you, and you got in trouble with Ms. Brooks. Not to mention all the weird things about your body. Right now though, you were staring right into her eyes, easily 5'4 now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr. Wilson, are you really feeling alright?\" She asked you, which seemed both stern with a touch of worry for her student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well...why do you ask?\" You tried deflecting the comment, though your hands started fidgeting with the \"shorts\" part of the dress. The material of your shorts felt a bit thinner now, and the pockets looked even smaller than usual now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're acting in a way I'm not familiar with. I'm not exactly mad with you, but I am concerned about your actions all the same. Is there any particular reason for those odd questions you asked me earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, you weren't sure how to answer those, especially as you continued to feel really weird. Still nervous, you brought a hand up to her hair again, but you immediately stopped after that. You felt something against her back, so you stole a look backwards, having to keep yourself from gasping. Your hair was now even longer, flowing down past your shoulders to your mid-back, flowing in long dark brown locks of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my gosh! My hair is so long!\"</i> You thought. This was way beyond just missing a haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wilson! Did you hear me?\" asked Ms. Brooks again in slight frustration, bringing your attention back to her. Apparently, whatever was happening, she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm really sorry Ms. Brooks.\" You tried to say to her. \"Um, I just....kind of woke up on the wrong side of the bed today. I haven't been feeling as well as usual.\" You hoped that would be a good enough explanation, considering you just made that up on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Are you sure you're not sick? If you are, you probably shouldn't be here.\" Ms. Brooks commented sincerely. However, you weren't sure if going home would be good right now. If Ms. Brooks didn't notice anything wrong, who knows if your parents would either. Not to mention, considering you weren't sick, they would get really mad. You were sure that you weren't sick, so that was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I'm fine. I'm really sorry for the interruption.\" You tried again, being as sincere as you could. Ms. Brooks seemed to lighten up a bit, actually giving a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're sure that you're alright, then it's fine. You're not a troublemaker, so I'll overlook it this time. However, do make sure to take better care in the future.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you were free to go, thankfully. Once you exited the classroom, you immediately rushed your hands back to your hair. It looked really nice, much more than any man's hair, like it was taken care of daily. To be honest, it even looked a bit familiar, but then again, many girls had long dark hair, so who was to say about that. However, you only had a few minutes until the next class came, so you probably should be on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began walking though, your legs continued to look more smooth underneath your clothes. By that time, there was not a hair on them, leaving fair skin in their place. You began to wonder just what could be behind this, but you couldn't draw any reasonable conclusions. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"Great, this is just great...\" You said, continuing to nervously comb your hair with your ever-more-soft hands. Now that you thought about it... Your arms, as well as your legs, had lost a bit of muscle mass. Mind you, you never were the 'manly-man' type with huge arms and always being at the gym. But, you weren't a total-loss, a slob, either. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     \"Well, there goes that class... She officially thinks I'm insane...\" You sighed, continuing your rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you continued through the crowded halls, the people passing by brushing you as you walked along, you rubbed your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hairless...\" You sighed, noting the daintiness that had overtaken your arms. And, you didn't even want to examine your legs. The last observation you made below the waist proved you were growing more soft, less masculine by the moment. The reason, beyond you. But, for some reason, you looked down there, anyway, if only for the purpose of curiosity. That, and you felt something riding up your legs, slowly and softly, much like the feeing of a bug crawling about your skin. In this, you made the decision to finally look over your lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At this point, you hardly cared for the dress-like cloth you wore; the shock had passed. You noted the shrinking sleeves, the tightening of the cloth above the waist, and the flowiness of the cloth at the waist and below... It certainly resembled something like a dress, the colors of the cloth, respectively, the former-shirt and former-shorts, now certainly seemed to be shifting into a darker color, most definitely black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh!\" You exclaimed, covering your mouth immediately in surprise. The unmistakable bulge that was your 'manhood'... It was... Smaller than before, no doubt about that. You did a double take over your shoulders, quickly cupping a feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Definitely smaller!\" as you felt there, it seemed o be fleeting with every passing second. You ignored this and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You raised an eyebrow towards your socks and shoes, as your eyes settled there. Your shoes continued to darken in color, surpassing the beige color that was present earlier, now a light brown, looking to become darker by the minute. You tapped a foot on the ground. The material was also changing, surely into something more solid, harder... The thud you made as you tapped indicated this. And, as for your socks, at this point they were completely beige, and growing longer, now reaching a few inches above the ankles.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     \"Well...\" you sighed, continuing to comb the mane of hair now yours. \"...I guess that explains that crawly feeling...\" You murmur, continuing walking along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Finally, you arrived at your destination! Chemistry with a certain Mr. Lucas, a slightly overweight, balding middle-aged man. As you neared the classroom, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary, just the usual chatter could be heard emanating from inside the classroom, seeing as class had yet to start. And, also not out of the ordinary, stood three girls, also taking that class, standing outside the classroom, talking about subjects typical; Boys, who's dating who, fashions and the usual gossip these three could be heard discussing to no end, particularly, in Mr. Lucas' class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     These three, respectively, Heather, Cassie and Hannah were among the popular type, the cheerleader, jockey type, infamous for passing classes solely due to their popularity; that, and the connections they had with the nerds who often sold their services in homework and answer-getting for a claim to popularity. Which, all too often, went unanswered. The three always spoke of such nonsense, infamous for sitting in the back of the class and discussing, paying the class no mind. The teachers often did nothing about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The three of them usually paid you no mind, much like the rest of the popular crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you passed them by, almost entering the class, one foot in the door, one of the girls' voices caught your attention, successfully catching you off-guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Hey, Nate!\" The leader of the trio, Heather Cunningham, chirped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked around, confusedly. \"Is she talking to me...?\" you wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Finally, seeing no one else around you, you pointed to yourself, silently asking \"You mean me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, you!\" Hannah chimed. \"Join us!\" Cassie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nervously, you walked over, as you did, you noticed your hips began to instinctively sway with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yes...?\" you anxiously asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"We just wanted to, like, tell you how much we totally love those leggings you've got on!\" Heather complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Leggings?\" you asked aloud, completely lost as of now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah! They're totally awesome!\" Hannah entered once more. \"Where'd you get 'em? I could so use a set of those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh...\" You sighed, looking down to your legs, fearing what may await. Sure enough, they were right. You stepped back, shocked by their observation. Just as they said, there, covering your more shapely, smooth legs like never before were beige leggings. Again, slightly familiar... But... From where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well?\" Cassie entered in, \"where'd you buy those things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh...\" you continued muttering, combing your hair. As you did, you looked down to your body once again, this time noting that your chose continued to contort and shift, continuing to change material, color, into a darker brown, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, at least answer this, Nate...\" Heather sighed, \"Did you get it at the same place you got that dress and make up you've got on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      This much was enough for you to hear. With that, you darted into the restroom, conveniently located right in front of Mr. Lucas' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Upon entering, you dashed to the full body mirror that stood at the end of the restroom. Again, much to your dissatisfaction, they were right. What you donned now was surely a dress, black, sleeveless, and flowing most gracefully below the hips. Speaking of hips, they, too, looked much more defined, as did your thighs and legs, which the dress definitely complimented. The dress itself was tighter above the hips, while the flowy part of the dress extended a few inches above the knee, meeting the criteria clothing had to meet in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked into your presently green eyes and were met with a face perfectly decorated in a modest amount of makeup. A little bit of blush, and not much more than that. Your eyelashes were bigger, more emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Now, after all this, everything looked familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"How have I not noticed!\" You exclaimed, again, attaining a few awkward stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It all made sense! The dress, the leggings, the hair, the modest amount of makeup, the eyes, the mannerisms. All of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Kate!\" You muttered under the breath, registering it all.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

The dress, which looked very nice for a young woman, formed your body gracefully, with the skirt flowing over your hips. They seemed a bit bigger, though not quite to the size of Kate's own hips. For a while, you briefly considered whether or not you should go to class now. The girls in there didn't seem to notice anything strange, but that in itself was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" Right there, you clasped a hand over your mouth, as you heard a somewhat softer tone than before. Given everything so far, you had to imagine that you were getting her voice too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how is this happening?\" You asked yourself this as you slowly exited the bathroom, heading back to class for now. Was this some kind of wish? You didn't make any. However, as you were thinking of Kate, something suddenly made you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wish you would know how I feel!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it all made sense. Kate wished for you to know how she felt, so you were becoming her? But how could that be? Did she have wishing candies too? Who were you to say. Perhaps you could confront her at lunch, as you and her shared lunch period next, before 3rd and 4th period. Right at that moment though, you heard the bell ringing, forcing you back into class and to your things. The girls from before immediately asked if something was up, but you said nothing. Whether you were Kate or not, you didn't like talking to jocks like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right class, thanks for coming.\" said Mr. Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class began much like the previous one, though you were more distracted now. The dress was complete, which meant that your shorts were now a skirt, and your larger hips now rubbed against each other. It almost made you feel naked, making your face turn a bit red. Maybe it was out of instinct, but you crossed your legs, perhaps trying to show less or something. However, as you watched, you saw more changes. Your shoes made larger sounds on the floor, as it becoming sturdier. This was true as they were now a brown color, conforming against your feet more as they began to rise up your legs, ending a bit below the knees. It was Kate's favorite pair of boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess these do look cute, just like Kate always said.\" You slapped your head as you said that to yourself. Come on! You weren't supposed to be agreeing with Kate on girl's fashion! You were a guy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, judging by the shrinking feeling in your groin, that time was short at best. It certainly didn't help when you began feeling an itchiness on your chest. It was not even too long when you saw your dress beginning to push out halfway through the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\"</span></div></div>",

You was in a hurry, you needed to see Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Nate.\" You suddenly turned and you was a bit surprised to suddenly see Tommy there but you recovered, smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tommy. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing fine. I see you're well.\" Tommy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm doing fine.\" You felt a tiny bit uncomfortable as Tommy was walking with you.  You tried to just smile Tommy off, as you knew Tommy since Kindergarten and kind of knew how he normally acted.  Tommy kept talking about this and that.  You wanted to get rid of him, what you had to talk to Kate about you had to do in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy kept talking about this and that, you couldn't pay attention you had other things on your mind.  Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere Tommy asked you, \"Are you doing anything later?  I have, uh tickets to, uh, that show I know you like and I was hoping you would go with me.  We'll have dinner first, I'll pay of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that Tommy was asking you out.  You didn't feel for him like that.  Despite your appearance and your friendship with Tommy that went back a decade you didn't feel that way about him.  How could you, you was really a guy.  Then it hit you, memories of Tommy hitting on you since you were kids.  Well maybe not kids, more like as soon as puberty hit.  You didn't like him that way.  You were just friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy,\" you said with a sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is hard to say,\" you started, \"but I have put up with your amorous advances for as long as I can remember and I don't think....\"  Tommy couldn't bear to hear what you was about to say.  He didn't have the confidence you had because you had had the candies.  he suddenly fled down the hallway.  \"Whew\" you thought, you didn't really want to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had forgotten for a moment what you needed to do.  You sort of just stood there gathering yourself.  Then you saw Mitch Green.  He was such a hottie, but he didn't know that you was alive.  At least Tommy was your friend, he could be with you and talk to you.  But Mitch was just gorgeous and he didn't know you existed.  You couldn't even go up to him and ASK HIM OUT.  Some girls could do it, but not you, you wasn't that type of girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you, you wasn't any type of girl.  You was really a guy.  But Mitch was coming closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

A class filled with the boring, the uneventful, and the sounds of the useless chitter and chatter that erupted from the mouths of the popular girls from the back of the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The class was largely uneventful. The teacher often gave a brief, 10 or 15 minute lecture on whatever the topic of the day may have been, leaving the remainder of the class (mostly) free. Mr. Lucas insisted that the free time, the non lecture time, go to the assignment provided that would serve as homework due the next day. Of course, much of the class ignored his request and spent the remainder of the class at their leisure, effectively rendering the class a glorified recess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And, seeing as you burned the lecture time freaking out about your changes, and, simultaneously, adoring the boots you now donned, time flew and the free time was yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And, as the class remained in anarchy, as the teacher sat at his desk, doing nothing about, seeming not to care, there you were, soaked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...My chest REALLY itches...\" You sighed, aloud, noticing your voice continuing to raise in pitch. As you scratched at your (presently) flat chest, you felt something happening around your throat, voice-box area, as if the area was contorting in some way... For only a second, it felt as if you were choking. In this brief moment, you grasped your throat, as if choking, and coughed a bit. It felt like something was missing from the throat area. But, just as fast as it all happened, it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Man, what was that all about?\" You asked, quickly placing both hands over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I officially sound like her! I have Kate's voice!\" You panicked, removing your hands from the face area. But, at the same time, you admired the voice you had. The sweet, musical, enticing voice of Kate that one could listen to all day long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"So, what happens now...\" You sighed, in your new, more feminine voice. As you pondered the situation, you stretch your legs out in front of you, staring at the boots decorating your feet. But, as you sit, you felt something at your rear... As if your butt was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...Inflating?\" You asked aloud, turning behind you to stare at your rear-end. Sure enough, the butt was swelling like a balloon, morphing into the magnetic tail of hers. As this happened, your hips, too, expanded, completing the hourglass figure Kate was famous for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhm... Sir?\" You asked, fearing he'd notice the voice not your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes, Mr. Wilson?\" He answered, rising from his desk as he answered, un-noticing of your changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Can I... go to the restroom?\" Yu inquired among the chaos ever-present in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes, Mr. Wilson, just, be back before the bell.\" Before leaving, you picked up your backpack, which hadn't changed, thankfully, and walked on. You took the bag in case you didn't return in time for the bell, contrary to Lucas' instructions. But, he paid you no mind anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With that you strutted out the door and back towards the restroom. As you walked, at this point, you had already gotten used to the sway of your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you entered the restroom, you drew a sigh of relief as you found that there was no one present, leaving the room all to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I really hope that this all ends soon!\" You cried, as your boots tipped and tapped simultaneously with your footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your face then turned to that of anger. You stomped over to your backpack, reached into one of the pockets, and pulled out the candies, handing these inanimate pieces of magic a hateful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You!\" You cursed. \"This is all your fault! I'd still be me were it not for you!\" You continued, before stopping, realizing you were telling off pieces of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"This is clearly driving me insane! This absolutely must end!\" You shrieked, pulling your longer hair in frustration. You stopped, for a moment or two, and cooled down from the rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As if prompted by your surroundings, nature called, the bladder was to be emptied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Instinctively, you waltzed to the urinal ahead of you, maneuvered your skirt around, getting ready to pee, reached for your 'male companion' and found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"...\" You continued to search between the legs. \"... Wh-... Where I-is it?\" You asked, freaking out feeling nothing. As you continued to feel around, you felt a structure there, something like a clit, there between the legs. As you felt this, you felt a strange sense of arousal, but, quickly got over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"...It's gone! My manhood!\" You screamed in terror, your feminine, soft voice, emphasizing the scene. \"It's gone...\" you sighed defeated, now, officially a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But...\" you murmured. \"I still have to pee...\" you said, walking over to the stall, preparing to learn how the other half eliminates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After a few moments, it was done. There was struggle, there was discomfort in your skirts, but, you made it past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ah!\" You chirped in relief. \"Finally done!\" you happily sang, walking over to the sink to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Oh, the difference relief makes!\" You smiled. Suddenly, there died the happiness as you looked into the mirror to find Kate's form before you... Well, all except your face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You continued to stare into the mirror at your figure. You scanned all, the clothes, the soft hands and legs the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Breasts...?!\" You freaked out, as your ever-itching chest violently itched and bubbled. Out of impulse, you scratched at your chest. The more you scratched, the more your chest inflated like balloons, in a very similar fashion to when your butt inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"NO! NO! NO!\" You shouted, stopping your scratching as your breasts continued to inflate, filling In the chest area of the dress nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, it came to a halt. There, in front of you, you possessed the chest, the breasts of Kate. You weren't the breast expert but, it felt safe to assume that these things were a high C-cup. But, this was only an assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You played with your breasts for a moment, purely out of shock and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where did I go...?\" You asked in Kate's soothing voice, in a voice that trembled a bit, as if tears were about to burst. You always found her 'sad' voice absolutely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There you stood, clad mostly as Kate, defeated. You looked into the mirror, noticing all that was left was the face. You displayed no signs of hesitation as the changes finished up at the facial area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your eyes became bigger, pools of beauty, actually. The nose you donned shrank, becoming small and button-like. The lips you called yours puffed and swelled, but, not too much, as the lips became a perfect size, the lips you had always wanted to call your own, but, not like this. The masculine mass about the face softened greatly, cheek bones lifted, eyebrows became smaller, femininity took reign. Lips were slender, as was the nose... A generally ovular facial structure... By the end, the only words to describe your face would be 'soft' and 'beautiful.' Only two of the adjectives you attributed to Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you stood there, in your defeat, you exhaled heavily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, it's over... I'm Kate... How am I supposed to go out into the world?\" You inquired, fearsomely. \"How do I explain this to friends, to my family, my sister, my mom, my dad...\" All these questions flowed through your mind to no avail. This was the definition of anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And, right there, at the worst possible time, the bell rang, effectively ending second period, commencing first lunch. The lunch with you and Kate in it. The lunch where your crush would come face-to-face with her clone... You.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You drew a deep breath, grabbed your bag, placed the candies back in a pocket, and walked out to meet what lay next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the transformation now complete, you began your walk towards the cafeteria. Mr. Lucas probably didn't care much that you didn't make it back. He wasn't a bad teacher at all, but he wasn't the most proactive. Well, you weren't complaining. No, you had many more things to complain about. In addition to everything, as you had left the bathroom, you tried adjusting your new panties. Boy, did they feel weird compared to underwear. Not nearly as loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, you felt angry at many things right now. Those magical candies had now made you into one of the prettier girls in school, so how in the world could you fit in now. In fact, how in the world was everyone so calm? There were two Kates now, unless nobody thought of you being another Kate. Reality was so confusing at times. Actually, part of you even felt angry at Kate. She was the one who wished this on you, though she was totally unaware of it. It wasn't really fair to blame Kate, especially when this wouldn't have happened had you not advanced on her. Still, part of you just felt like lashing out. Your life could never be the same now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the 1st lunch period would last a good 45 minutes give or take, which was plenty of time for you to find your target and get this mess straightened out. How you would straighten it out was a mystery to you, but now that you were Kate, something had to be done. Some people tried to say hi as they passed by you, and you waved back while retaining your hurry step. Your hips and butt just swayed with each step, which felt so bizarre. Well, might as well get used to it. They were yours now, technically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you neared the end of the hallway that lead right to the cafeteria, and your eyes widened at who you saw coming down the stairs in front of you. It was Kate! Well, the real one anyway. You wasted no time in walking up to her, immediately trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Kate immediately turned and suddenly recoiled backwards. \"W-Who are you? Why do you look like me?\" She looked quite frightened, which wasn't your intention but there was no time for subtlety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I need to have a talk. Now!\" You grabbed her hand, pulling her along to the other side underneath the staircase where there was at least some kind of privacy. You let her go once you got there, but Kate wasn't in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who the heck are you? Are you trying to mimic me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I certainly didn't want to.\" You tried saying to her. Thankfully, Kate wasn't an alarmist, so she didn't scream and beg for help. \"It's me, Nate.\" You hoped that simple sentence would get her attention. It did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate? Nate Wilson? Do I look stupid? Nate doesn't look anything like me, especially since he's a guy.\" Kate defended. That was not a surprising answer. The only reply? Say something only you would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but Nate knows that you accidentally had a wetting problem in 1st Grade and he swore to not say a word to anyone else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's jay dropped straight to the ground. Jackpot! \"B-But, I never that to anyone......Nate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the flesh....or your flesh I guess.\" You said almost nonchalantly. Kate's look of confusion only worsened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...w-what is going on? Why do you look like me?\" Kate asked. You put your backpack (which surprisingly was still yours) on the ground, looking at the candy jar inside. You loosened it and took one candy out as you stood up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this look familiar to you? Perhaps something you found on the bus maybe?\" You asked. Kate looked confused, until a slow look of realization swept her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I saw something like that when you approached me. I picked it up and felt this weird urge to put it in my mouth. Once I did.....\" Kate didn't look like she was enjoying remembering this. \"I said something. Like, I wished that you would know how I felt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you got your wish. Now I am you.\" You said with surprising calm. \"I got these for my birthday. Apparently, they are wishing candies. You can make wishes on them, and now you see what they can do.\" Realization swept across Kate's face, but her look of surprise soon turned to sorrow as she realized what the implications were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Nate I'm so sorry.\" She looked like she was about to cry. \"I...I didn't mean any of this...I just...wanted you to think of us as friends.....I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, your anger began to slip away. Who were you to make her feel any worse. You then put the candy back in the jar, offering her a brief hug of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. You didn't mean me to become your clone.\" You said as she accepted the hug. Getting hugged by someone who looked like you was weird, but it worked. Kate smiled and seemed to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Nate....You're a good friend....Really, I've always thought of you as a good friend.\" She said with a small smile. Surprisingly, you smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think perhaps I see that now. I'm sorry for being persistent like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no worry. All men do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, both of you began to lightly laugh. The dark mood quickly evaporated, as the two of you were now on the same page. How you suddenly went from lamenting your fate to laughing with Kate confused even you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we laughing?\" You asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.....but those boots look cute on you.\" Kate smiled, making you remember what you thought before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I happened to briefly think the same thing back in my last class. Not to mention, your hair is a bit of a pain to deal with.\" With a look that said that Kate knew how that felt, there was a bit more laughing. Thank goodness for the privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" asked Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have no idea what everyone thinks of me. Everyone keeps calling me \"Nate\" still, but that doesn't exactly fit me now.\" You said with a sigh. Kate seemed to give it some brief thought, before she smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea. How about you become my sister?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"Your sister?\" You asked in a certain confusion. Here you stood, in the body of your crush, talking to your crush, and suddenly she pops this question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Why your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, come on, Nate!\" Kate laughed. \"You know I've always wanted a sister! Please! Do me this one favor, this one time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You rolled your eyes and combed your hair as she stated this. You know this much was true; Indeed she had wanted a sister for quite some time. Being an only child, and the daughter of a single father, her mother having passed on quite some time ago, you could only imagine the sorrow and solitude she felt. You yourself had siblings, and, despite their annoyances and their shortcomings, they were people whom you could confide in, people whom you could tell anything. Except Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      This made you wonder, how Kate has done it her entire life. No one to confide in but her father, who was loving, caring and a good dad and all, but, there are some things that you know you wouldn't want to let your parents know of, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you pondered this, attempting to avoid eye contact as you thought, you turned her way and found Kate handing you 'puppy eyes,' complete with a wide smile and the twinkle in her beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright, fine! I'll be your sister...\" You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah! Thanks, Nate!\" She warmly, genuinely pronounced. \"This'll be fun, I promise!\" she peeped, taking the piece of candy you held in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At first, in the way she looked to you, you could tell that she thought you didn't like the idea, given your hesitance to answer. You felt the desire to make light of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I already look the part, anyway...\" You looked to her and smiled, the two of you sharing a laugh in the isolation of the underside of these cold stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So...\" Kate began, placing the candy in her mouth and beginning to suck on it. \"...You just say 'I wish' while the candy is in your mouth, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ok... I wish you were my twin sister!\" She wished. As she did so, you shut your eyes and braced yourself for whatever change might come barreling towards you. But, after a few seconds, you opened your eyes and looked about yourself, finding yourself still in Kate's body and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"What was that all about?\" Kate asked, mesmerized by the way you braced yourself like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh! It's just that... I was kind of preparing myself for a change... But, as you can see, i'm still me! I mean... You!\" Apparently, just like that, the two of you were now sisters. No special effects, no dramatic lights, no changing forms, nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She gave a small giggle at your remarks. \"Maybe this will work out...\" You smiled, thinking to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh! By the way...\" You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, Nate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...Could you wish me up some new clothes?\" You asked handing her a candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, sure, but... Why?\" She inquired. \"Are you saying there's something wrong with the way I dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your eyes widened, realizing the way that may have come across. \"NO! It's just that, I'm new to this whole 'being a girl' thing, and, wearing a dress like this is kind of a big jump...\" You answered, lifting the ends of your dress slightly as if curtsying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Fine.\" She said. \"I wish you had different GIRLS' clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With that wish, the clothes you wore began to undergo a quick and steady transformation. The dress you wore melted apart into two separate cloths. The top half retained the black color, the tightness, and the lack of sleeves, shrinking only slightly to form a plain, black tank-top.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     The skirt of the dress remained a skirt, but, became less formal, shrinking in height until it reached a few inches above the knee, resembling a modest, school friendly mini-skirt. The material remained and the color changed from black to a baby blue color, definitely looking more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As for the shoes and leggings, the beige leggings faded from existence, shrinking downwards until they imploded, leaving you sockless. The boots began to act the same way as the leggings, shrinking until they became but a platform for the feet, like sandals. The tops of the boots morphed and contorted until they became the straps of the sandals, the color, ultimately, remaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And, just like that, there you stood, clad in a mini-skirt, a tank top and sandals definitely a step up from that formal stuff Kate wears, but, still, too feminine for your tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You stood there and observed yourself, scanning yourself from your head to your now exposed toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You couldn't have given me, like, jeans or something? And, what's with the sandals?\" You asked, gesturing to the sandals, wiggling your toes on cue. \"A simple pair of sneakers would have been nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well.\" Kate sternly said. \"I personally find that outfit to be really cute on that body of mine, well, yours. And, now that your a girl, you're gonna have to get used to those types of clothes. If anything, I hope this whole experience teaches you something about what a girl goes through to get some attention from guys like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, at least tell me how the wish was so specific without you saying anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"... Actually, i'm not sure how I did that. I just... Thought about it and then Boom! There you were, standing in my sandals and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You stood confused for a bit, eventually shrugging it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, it's lunch, and I'm seriously starving.\" You said, gesturing to your growling belly. \"So, how about some lunch?\" You asked, leading the way towards the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Right behind ya, sis!\" Kate laughed, following your lead.</span></div></div>",

You both lost a good 15 minutes or so with your little talk, but you still had plenty of time to eat together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, we girls will do many things for a little attention. Don't you boys go for a bit of leg?\" smirked Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tommy does.\" You smiled back. \"I was more of a face guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you both walked in, Kate pointed out a good spot for you both to eat. Kate had her usual friends, but she wanted to just eat with you today. After all, this current situation demanded more attention. You both sat down and brought out your packed lunches. You were pretty simple, with a sandwich, soda, and a couple other things. Some of it was junk food, but you were not going to be denied just because you were now a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be taking it in better.\" You said to Kate as she began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I still feel bad about it, but you helped me feel a bit better. If I'm not being too shameful here, I am a little glad now. Truth be told, I was a bit envious of you. You have 3 siblings to hang around with. I never got another sibling after my mom left us.\" said Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but Erin never listens to me. Trevor I can relate to, and Nicole seems to idol me a bit. They're a handful but it all works.\" As you said that, you looked down a bit. \"I wonder if they know me now. Did they forget me, or am I a stranger to them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate saw that you looked kind of sad, so she reached over and grabbed your hand assuredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know me, so as my sister, I'm sure they know you. Maybe not as their son, but as a good friend at least.\" said Kate. Truthfully, it did make you a little happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks....sis.\" Just hearing the word made Kate smile as she went back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll have to wait until we get home to see if our house changed to include you in the family. My room is pretty big, so I wonder if there are two beds now. Guess we'll have to wait and see. Maybe you'll even be in our family photos now.\" said Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be odd. I don't know half the things you did with your family.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if worst comes to worst, perhaps we could wish it in so you \"remember\" those events. We don't have to of course, but it's an option. Those candies of yours seem to have limitless potential.\"Kate seemed to be getting excited about this. \"I wonder what else we could do with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's cool down a bit. I need to go a while without changing. I've got enough adjusting to do already.\" You said with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" As they kept eating, something same to mind for Kate. \"By the way, did that wish give you a new name? Perhaps you should check your planner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good idea.\" Curious yourself, you brought up your backpack and brought out the school planner that had your name inside. You opened to the first page, your eyes widening a bit as you looked. \"Katherine Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it did. Wow.\" said Kate, truly surprised before smiling. \"Perhaps Kathy for short?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicknames already?\" With that, both of you laughed a bit, like any sisters would. It was truly an interesting start to this kind of lifestyle, though you could only imagine when the next curveball would come. With these candies, probably not too long.</span></div></div>",

It seemed that Kate had seen right through you, on this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...\" You walked along, lacking in answer, the only sounds being the mindless jabber of the students leaving home for the weekend, and, the flapping noise your sandals made as you moved along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I must admit... It was kind of awesome... If you don't mind my saying! I didn't mean to offend!\" You quickly apologized, raising your hands in front of you and giving a slight wave, as if to assure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate gave a soft laugh before speaking. \"Relax! It's cool! I know that you only have the body of a girl... Not necessarily the mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You could say I enjoyed it!\" You laughed, joining Kate. \"... My only gripe is the shorts! After this whole thing, I'll respect every girl who wears those over-exposing shorts! I felt almost naked, my legs being out in the open like that... And, the other guys in the class kept on staring at them, along with my chest! It was weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate laughed and raised an eyebrow. \"Well, now you know how we feel, putting up with your dirty little minds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There was a momentary pause, as you two continued out the school's front doors. Shortly after which, you continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Plus, what are the odds that I had the exact same schedule! Nothing went changed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I guess the wish made you my sister and nothing more...\" Kate replied as the two of you boarded the bus that await.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The two of you continued along and Kate pointed you to her usual spot, a seat located in the middle of the bus, perhaps closer to the front than the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The two of you sat down, the both of you instinctively holding down your skirts as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...\" You looked to her in a certain silence. \"So, this is where it all began.\" You plainly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... I guess so!\" Kate laughed. \"But, hey, I guess everything works out the way it should, right?\" She proceeded, looking to you with a soft, comforting smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, think about it.\" Kate began. \"It's fate! What are the odds that all these things happen? That I somehow, by some strange coincidence, encountered those candies of yours. Why on this day? Why that wish? Why this outcome? Why are we both enjoying it all this much?\" She whispered, almost poetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Oh. Well, I never thought about it quite like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Like I said,\" Kate said. \"Everything works out as it should.\" A certain silence, a poetic aura created itself between you two, you looked to each other, not speaking a word, simply handing each other a small grin, a small beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, here's Tommy!\" Kate chirped, as, sure enough, Tommy walked in the bus, the doors wasting no time in closing, after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, Tommy!\" Kate called, as you were too afraid to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh... Ugh... Hi, Kate. Hey, Kat...\" He waved, coyly, respectively looking to the two of you, clearly awkward about speaking to the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...What was that all about?\" You asked, referring to Tommy's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I was kind of expecting that... Remember how it was Nate, you, who introduced me to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She was right in saying so, you introduced him to Kate around, more or less, 4th or 5th grade. And, come to think of it, the way he acted just now strongly resembled his actions then, all those years ago, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So... He hardly knows me, us?\" You asked, your voice trembling a bit. Of course, this sort of teary-eyed reaction was unintentional, it had too have been those female hormones of yours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No, hey! It's all right...\" Kate calmly reassured, handing you her embrace. \"Things are going to be fine...\" She warmly whispered, slowly, but surely, putting your sorrows to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thanks, sis.\" You looked to her, simpering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, look at that! We're home!\" Kate said, grabbing her things and rising from her seat, gesturing that you do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You sniffled a sniffle and spoke up. \"Your place?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No, ours! Joyously she cried, as you picked up your own belongings, the two of you sprinting out the doors of the bus, the doors fuming violently as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And, as the bus rolled on behind the two of you, you two stared at the house, you in a certain awe, that you'd now be calling this your home, at least, for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The house was a decent sized house, of about an average size. The driveway had room enough for two vehicles to fit in, in front of them, a twin pair of garage doors. The cement that paved the driveway, off to the right side, veered off, forming a walkway leading to the front door, a large, dark brown wooden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The house itself was two stories tall, and, boasted several windows, portals to and from the outside world. The home was composed of exposed, red brick. Plant life decorated the borders of the home, as well as the borders of the mailbox, walkways and the driveway, the plants gleaming in reds, yellows and shades of green and blues...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Pretty sweet place!\" You smiled, staring in awe about the home, now yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come on! It looks like Dad's not home yet...\" Kate gleamed, leading you to the front door, where she reached into one of the pockets of her backpack and pulled out a single key. After a stab of the key into the door, and proceeding a turn of the key in a clockwise direction, the door silently widened, exposing all inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Home sweet home!\" Kate laughed running up stairs. \"Follow me!\" She called. \"How about we head to my room, see if anything's changed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Eager to see what lay in this newfound home, you dropped your backpack where you stood and darted up the stairs. Upon arriving upstairs, you knew, even as Nate, where Kate's room was. From the end of the stairs, a quick right turn until the last door straight ahead would lead you to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You opened the door and found her room, a comfy , rather large room that could have easily been mistaken for a master bedroom. The walls were painted a sky blue color. A TV lay across from the bunk-beds. The TV was held by a set of shelves, among the shelves various artifacts such as pictures among decorated frames, movies, books, other knick-knacks of nature unknown. Against one wall was another, rather large door, what you assumed was the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, look!\" Kate smiled. \"Bunk beds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You grinned widely and laughed. \"I call the top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You call the top?!?! In your dreams!\" Kate echoed, darting for the top-most bed of the bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Beat ya!\" She called, laying at the top. \"Feels good to be on top! But, you wouldn't know, would ya, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate lay there, her legs crossed, anticipating an answer. Upon failure to receive any answer of any sort, she looked about the bottom-most bed, the bed below her. Empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Kat?\" She asked, worriedly. Just then, she turned towards to where she kept her pictures and found you among them, curiously staring into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate walked up to you, from behind, and joined you staring into the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You were right, after all...\" You sighed. \"... I am in the pictures now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate looked among the images in their frames, alongside you. The pictures were strange, surreal, telling stories you could not recall, given your lack of memory on these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey! There's you, me, and Dad at the beach!\" Kate exclaimed, pointing to a picture just in front of you, at chest height. The image seemed to have indeed been taken at a beach, as the ocean stood in the background of the image, the sands looking to be a sort of platform on which all was held. There, in the picture, you, in your female body, stood next to Kate, a single arm wrapped around her, Kate's Dad to the left of Kate. Just the three of you. Kate, in the picture, was giving you 'bunny ears' behind your head. The two of you donned simple bikinis. The picture looked as if it were taken somewhat recently, too. But, what stuck out the most was the love in the picture, the happiness. You looked so... Happy, as did Kate, and her father...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But, pertaining to the picture, Kate looked happy like you'd never seen her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow... I wonder what happened that day that made us all so happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate looked to you and smiled a mischievous smile. You raised an eyebrow and slightly cocked your head, as a confused dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wanna find out?\" She asked, holding up a piece of candy, which seemingly popped up from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I have my ways, now, do you want the memories of Katherine, or, not? It's totally your call, sis...\" Kate offered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What to do, what to do...\" You thought in your head, combing your hair with your fingers as you did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know it's so funny that you have my nervous habits too.\" smiled Kate as she saw you comb your hair like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's something I could do without.\" You smiled back before coming up with an answer. \"All right. Yes. Give me the memories of Katherine, but be careful alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate seemed really joyful at that answer. \"Alright, cool! I can't wait to see what these memories are. Even I don't know what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kate popped the sweet candy into her mouth. She had to phrase this right, given how her previous wish turned out. \"I.....I wish both of us knew who Katherine Smith was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, a rush hit your head, almost causing you to fall down to the floor. Kate seemed to experience a similar rush, though not to the same degree. Part of you wondered if your memories would be replaced, but instead, something else was happening. It was like there was a second set of memories forming, not interfering with your memories of Nate. To your surprise, a smile graced your lips as you began to remember. That day at that beach happened a couple months ago, and it was you and Kate's first trip to the beach in a very long time. You two had so much fun that day, from swimming in the ocean to even some beach volleyball, which you were not very good at. It was truly a day of fun. From the look on Kate's face, you could tell that she was thinking the same thing now, and both of you shared a little laugh together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that now behind them, both you and Kate unfortunately had to face the inevitable and work on homework. Thankfully, the large room allowed for a bit of privacy. Heck, the only class you both shared was gym, and there wasn't any homework with that. Trying to finish up your Chemistry homework was the worst, but Kate didn't really know much about it either. Kate actually really refused to do much else until she was done. Hey, she was a straight-A student for a reason. She wasn't exactly the party type either. She was just your average nice girl who kept out of trouble, something you kind of wished Tommy and a couple other male friends of yours would learn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Dad is the one who makes dinner I presume?\" You asked, a bit surprised at how you just called him \"Dad\" so easily. Kate glanced you a smile as she looked up from her notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he is, and a very good one too. He really tried hard to cook better once Mom left. He didn't want his \"daughters\" to grow up on fast food until college. I sometimes help out though.\" said Kate before she went back to her studies. You went back to your own. Truth be told, there actually wasn't a whole lot to cover. It was just really annoying. Still, giving it a couple of hours straight helped. As you wrote in your last sentences, you surprised yourself with how you focused on it non-stop for 2 hours. You kept good grades, but never did that much in one sitting. Did you feel like you had to live up to your new sibling? The very thought made you laugh to yourself as you put your books away. As you did, and Kate was finishing up too, you happened to spot something in the bookcase. It was one of those baby books that everyone generally has detailing their early years. You did have a set of memories now, but you didn't know the finer details. Kate could see where you were going and came over, taking the book down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even titled \"Kate and Katherine Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even my book changed.\" Kate smiled. You smiled back as you opened it up, wanting to see what it was about. You were both greeted with a baby picture of you now as Katherine. The picture showed you and Kate, newly born in a little hospital bed. There were even the stats about your birth: one in particular that made you groan a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 4 minutes younger than you are.\" You sighed. You were at least 4 months older than Kate when you were Nate. Kate smiled while putting a hand on your shoulder. She tried to be sympathetic, but you could tell she liked the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny to see how much has changed, and there are so many candies left.\" noted Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but if just one can turn me into your twin, then who knows what more can do.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Kate really seemed excited at the possibilities. \"Like, maybe we could be in charge of class or just goof off at the beach. Really, we could do anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we wait until I fit in a bit better?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sis.\" Kate smiled, as you two shared a brief hug.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"...\" You lay on the bottom bed of the bunk bed in a perfect silence, tossing and turning once or twice, every now and then, but, not to the point of discomfort. It was then when some horrifying noise, a noise that sounded like some foul creature, a monster, even, awoke you from your slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You slowly opened your eyes, raised yourself up, looked about the bed, around the room, to investigate this strange sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You gave a yawn as you stretched your arms and legs where you lay. \"...Nothing...\" You groggily sighed, scratching an itch on your thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Slowly did you get to your feet, planting them softly on the ground below, still attempting to get used to your newfound height. With one more stretch of the ol' limbs, you raised yourself to your sister, Kate's, bed to get a peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So that's where it's coming from...\" You giggled. Sure enough, there lay Kate, sprawled about the bed in a rather uncomfortable looking position. She was laying on her belly, her legs looking contorted, almost to the point of where it looked painful. A pool of drool soaked a fraction of the pillow she hugged, held to her face. All the while, a violent snore flared from her mouth. Of course a girl as attractive as her would sleep like a man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Time to end it... KATE!!!\" You hollered, immediately gaining her attention. She quickly composed herself together and looked to you, looking horribly frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"HUH? WHA-?\" She asked, maintaining the shock of waking up on such an alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Just wakin' you up, sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate looked to you, still half asleep, a certain sleepiness in her eyes, as if that Mr. Sandman took his toll on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate shook gave a stretch, and, looked completely at peace, relaxed, a small smile about her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Man, that was an amazing night of sleep!\" She yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, as soon as I hit the bed, I just knocked out!\" You added. \"Let me tell you, 'Dad' can really cook! That was one awesome pizza he made!\" You laughed, you can still taste the toppings and that delectable sauce, that warm crust. Delicious, the foods of the gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"See, what'd I tell ya? We are his little angels, after all!\" Kate laughed, you joining her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Last night, that is, an evening between just you, your sister and 'Dad,' was something special. It was just the three of you, jumping from topic to topic. From various events, big and small, in everyone's day, to school, to Dad's work, to absolutely nothing; Just the three of you joking around, having fun. You really felt like you were part of a family you could get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Of course, this only made you miss your true family that much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Aside from how much you enjoyed it, you saw a certain twinkle in Kate's eyes, a twinkle you've never before seen in her. She was happy, truly happy, having a (mostly) complete family. And, the way she looked to you ever since you changed, she looked to you as if you filled some enormous crater of a gap in her life. This was something special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, as you and Kate stood side by side, in the restroom, brushing up your teeth, she dropped all she was doing and provided a look of great surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Kat.\" She plainly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah?\" You asked rinsing your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It's 9:15! We're an hour and fifteen late for school! The bus left way back when!!!\" She freaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"OK... OK... Calm down, we're gonna be fine.\" You made your best attempt to keep your composure, finding Kate's reaction to be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"How could I have let this happen?!?!\" Kate bellowed. \"I'm a straight-A student! A perfect record! No absences, no tardiness! Never late! Never ever!\" She ran to the closet, throwing on the first outfit she found, throwing some clothes your way in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And, how are you so calm about this?!\" She looked your way, accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, you!\" She pointed a single finger to you. \"You're so calm about this! Where's your drive?! Where's your care?! Oh yeah! I forgot! You're still a boy in there!\" She uttered, running into her closet to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You gave her a look of surprise, raising an eyebrow, picking up the clothes she threw your way, a skirt much like the one you wore yesterday, only this time black, and a shirt donning your school's logo and your graduation year, As far as footwear went, you found a pair of ballet flats, black, and the socks that matched. Again, something particularly feminine. You changed where you stood, seeing as you were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to the closet, hearing the doorknob twist, surprised to see her come out, in something nowhere near as feminine. Just a pair of jeans, a duplicate of the shirt you wore, and a pair of converse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What's up with that?!\" You uttered, going off the handle. \"I get this and you get that?!\" You gestured to your skirt, then her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, so, that's what gets you to lose your mind! Not being centuries late to school, but the dang clothes!\" She shouted, handing you a brush for your hair, as she brushed her own, simultaneously grabbing her backpack, gesturing that you do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come on! Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The two of you tearing out of the house, Kate taking the lead as you followed behind, much more calmly than her. Thankfully, you and Kate lived but a few minutes (10-15 minutes) away from the school. This left you wondering why the two of you take the bus, anyway? But, this was a question for another time. The two of you arrived to the front of the school only to find emptiness... You came to a halt, your skirt flowing about the wind as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Great!\" Kate fumed. \"Everyone's in class, which we're totally late for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You simply stared at her, enjoying the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What do we do now! How are we supposed to get in there without anyone saying anything! It'll be so embarrassing! I've never been through such a traumatizing experience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It seems to me that you're forgetting that we have magical, wish-granting candies at our disposal...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sweet!\" Kate gleamed. \"We can use the candies to make it so that we were right on time! Nice!\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"We could do that... Or, we could make things more interesting...\" You smiled, handing her a mischievous, almost devilish look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... I don't follow...\" Kate uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I was thinking about what you said yesterday, how we have a seemingly infinite amount of possibilities to go about with these things... I was hoping we could...\" You smiled, pulling out a candy, Kate looking to you in a certain fear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Teachers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we have the candies to do it. Besides, given your fanaticism for school work, it seems to be up your alley.\" You added a little laugh there for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't do it because I love it. Who knows if I'll get into a good college if I mess up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again, fanaticism.\" You added. \"To be honest, I actually really considered taking us to the beach or something, but you'd probably freak out too much and not really have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be too calm about this? School work is very important...\" Kate began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to say that I don't care as much because I'm a guy, my grades are very good too. I just don't hold the same fascination as you do.\" As you said that, you actually pulled Kate aside, seeing one of the staff members pass by. Hopefully they didn't yell you guys raising your voices. \"Boy, that was too close. Since you'd probably freak out at the beach, I say we get out of this mess and just be teachers. Hopefully, that should clear our names and keep your record clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how exactly?\" asked Kate. As she said that, you popped the candy into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I say we just roll with it and see what may.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how you ended up my clone?\" Kate said plainly. That was just ONE example of a non-specific wish. However, you just wanted to clean this situation up so your \"sis\" would stop freaking out. It was 9:40 now, close to the end of 1st Period. You didn't want to drag this out longer or get caught. In your haste, you made your desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that Kate's situation would be resolved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kate could say anything, a bright flash of light engulfed both of you, to the point where you couldn't see yourselves well. However, you felt tingling all over the place, including something lifting you up under your feet. However, one thing you felt for sure was that Kate didn't seem to be next to you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate heard you make the wish before she could say anything. That wish wasn't exactly specific and you didn't even mention if they could keep her record clean. The very thought was frustrating, but it felt minor to the tingling feeling the wish had caused to flow over her. However, she suddenly felt herself on ground again, seeing herself on the top floor of the school now. Immediately, she noticed that you were nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat? Where are you?\" Suddenly, you put her hands to her mouth. It sounded like her voice...yet different. Her hands looked slightly different too, and she couldn't feel her hair down her back like usual. She looked down at her body, seeing her modest cleavage in a nice dress. Were they a bit bigger too? That aside, the dress was modest enough for school, with a pair of small heels on her feet. She couldn't tell for sure, but she felt a bit taller, outside of the heels. Poking around her head, she could tell her hair was in a ponytail. To be honest, she almost looked like an older version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, did I get old?\" Well obviously not too old. She didn't look that much different. However, looking to her left, she could see her 1st Period classroom right in front of her. Without even another thought, she walked right in, seeing tons of eyes focus on her immediately. However, none of them looked condescending or anything like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Ms. Smith. Thank you for joining us today.\" Mrs. Harris, her 1st Period English teacher, welcomed her with a smile. \"Please get your things settled here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Kate walked right over and....wait, where was her backpack? All she had was a folder or two with some supplies...and a purse too? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now class, as I told you all last time, Ms. Smith is a student teacher and will be giving a presentation today. I expect her to give her your utmost respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate nearly gasped at those words. A student teacher?! Her?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that crazy candy do this time?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     In a fashion not unlike that which Kate had gone through, you, too, after a momentary lapse of emptiness and darkness, felt your feet make contact with the ground after floating, seemingly in mid-air. Though, as you landed, you heard a familiar sound, the click of women's heels stabbing the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What the...?\" You asked, looking around. \"... I wasn't wearing anything with heels...\" You sighed, also noting that the voice you spoke in was not your own. It sounded familiar, though. Having already shifted physical form before, you didn't freak out all that much. This was your idea, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked around and found yourself, alone, in a women's restroom. You looked to your shoes, first, and, instead of the ballet flats you donned this morning, a pair of heeled sandals, black and brown in color, decorated your feet, which were perfectly pedicured, the toenails flawless and painted a dark blue color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Wear your skirt and shirt once were was now a dress, a dress that extended a little below the mid-thigh, exposing a little bit of the smooth, more matured legs now yours. The dress, again, was sleeveless and colored in a blue that matched your toes. On your head was dark-brown colored hair that reached to about the shoulder blades, slightly curled.  Your eyes were now a light, caramel colored brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You knew this beauty of a teacher! You knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"My voice...\" You began in your soft-spoken voice. \"This dress, these shoes, these legs...\" You knew this woman all too well, you could recognize those legs, that bosom anywhere. This teacher was the favorite among the boys of your class, for reasons obvious; She looked absolutely amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm Ms. Brooks!\" You sung in your new, flawless, matured voice. \"I'm sweet, lovely little Ms. Judith Brooks!\" You smiled, hugging yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You absolutely adored this teacher, Brooks. She was kind, gentle, looked amazing, and, despite these looks, quite the profound teacher, whose teaching methods really worked. Her English/writing class was one you could actually attend and learn something from, unlike too many of these futile high-school level classes, whose goal was only to prepare you for the BS procedure that was standardized testing. Nope, she was a true, dedicated, hot teacher. Writing had never been your subject, by no means were you a poet. While she didn't make you a poet, Brooks did help, ALOT, making her a godsend to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"WAIT!\" You exclaimed. \"I have to teach... What a buzz-kill...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You dragged yourself from the restroom, to what you recognized as the staff break-room, a setting you knew due only to the fact that you, Tommy, and other associates, often snuck in here to use the soda machine in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You continued walking to your class, un-deterred by the fact that you were late to your own class. The more you thought about this, though, the more it bothered you, something completely unlike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I have to speed up! My students are waiting!\" You exclaimed, picking up the pace, finally arriving to your classroom.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     With a  quick turn of the doorknob, and a slight push forward, you walked in, your hips swaying as you did. The moment you walked in, you stood still, frozen. All eyes were on you, especially the eyes of the guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm no teacher...\" You thought in your head. Again, out of nowhere, you composed yourself quickly and proceeded to your desk, the head of the class, as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good morning, Class!\" You chirped instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The class looked completely dead. Half, if not, completely asleep. People were texting, some were drooling about their desks in their sleep, a few looked to you attentively which, for some reason, made you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright, so let's begin!\" You smiled. \"Now, if you recall, everyone here has presentations to present!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The class gave a groan of discontent, which you dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, which brave soul is gonna go first...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You could actually hear the crickets chirping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...Or, am I gonna have to pick someone...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And, just like that, a brave student, a girl who sat at the front of the class, one of the smarter in your class, stood up and walked to the front of the class and began speaking about who-knows what. You only knew because, yesterday, you heard Ms. Brooks speaking of some project due today. You didn't do it, which made this little change that much more worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"This teaching thing's going to be a cinch!\" You thought to yourself, smiling contently, unknowingly kicking off your sandals and crossing your feet to rest upon your desk, a habit Ms. Brooks was famous for. You simply sat there, and listened to the girl speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thank the powers that be that I'm young and awesome looking!\" You said, watching the student present, pretending to be attentively listening, as you played with your polyester dress, referring to Ms. Brooks 27 year age. At the same time, for a reason unknown to you, a part of your mind actually carefully observed the students presentation, checking off an imaginary rubric, seeing if this student's work met the criteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...Wonder how that sister of mine is doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

At first, she had no idea what in the world she was supposed to be doing, until she opened up her folder. Once she did, something seemed to be coming to her, like what she was supposed to be talking about. Apparently, being an aspiring teacher in this field, she had a few views on these stories that weren't covered normally. She kept getting quite a few hands every time she asked for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" She smiled as she picked on someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Kate was actually really having fun. She was aspiring to be a teacher after all, given her record, and she was enjoying this really even more than she thought she would. In fact, she almost entertained the thought of asking you to just let it stay like this. However, she knew that couldn't happen. She didn't want to lose close to 10 years of life just like that. Anyway, after a while, her presentation was over, getting an applause from the class and some gratitude from Mrs. Harris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work Ms. Smith.\" she said to her, making Kate's face almost go red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on your side, the entire class period mostly revolved around the students giving presentations. Tommy actually had something this time, if not a bit clumsy in execution. Still, going off your mental checklist, he actually did a reasonable job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good job class....\" You said as you got off your chair, moving on to the book for the remaining class period. To be honest, you felt like winging it, since you weren't overly sure, and sometimes the body felt like it was moving on its own. Walking around a bit in just your bare feet felt kind of odd. You began to wonder why she always did that, but guess you couldn't complain right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the bell rang, allowing everyone to leave. You gave one last shout out assigned pages and wished them luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the intermission, both you and Kate just stayed in your respective classrooms with your materials. You both had to do your thing one more time for the next batch of students in 2nd Period. You felt a bit apprehensive about it, while Kate seemed like she couldn't contain her excitement. One thing that was consistent in both classes: you both got good looks from many of the males, though you seemed more capable of shaking them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as it were, 2nd Period started, with Kate actually doing her presentation earlier this time, much to similar reception. She hoped that she would be able to retain this information even once you all were back to normal. For you, the procedure was the same, relaxing as the class went off and presented their topics. The overall quality was a bit higher than the previous class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the class bell rang, signaling the first lunch period, as well as lunch break for both you and Kate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, class.\" You sighed, having reached your absolute capacity with these presentations. Presentation after presentation, nervous speaker after nervous speaker, the lack of volunteers, time and time again... It was truly a vicious cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever didn't present today...\" you started, getting to your bare feet and slipping on your sandals. \"... You got lucky, for today.\" You finished, attaining a laugh from the class, making yourself laugh in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But, seriously, be ready to present tomorrow.\" You finished as the students dispersed. Within a matter of seconds, all had fled the scene, leaving you in your solitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath in, and exhaled, your eyes, closed in a certain relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, it is finally over!\" you claimed, clasping your hands together and looking up. \"Now, I can finally get Kate and move on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You dusted off and smoothed out your dress, having rid of all the wrinkles. The brown, leather purse that lay on your desk, once your backpack, you made a grab for.  From one of the purses pockets you pulled a set of keys, all similar looking, among them, a car key boasting the Ford logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Guess I have a Ford...\" you immediately brushed this off and continued out the door, turning the lights out on the way out, closing the door behind you. \"Now, to lock it...\" you sighed, grazing your fingers over the several keys that decorated the key chain. \"So many keys... This ought to be fun...\" After trying, and failing, at locking the door with the many, many keys at your disposal, one finally did the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yes!\" you celebrated, swiftly turning as to walk away from the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Alright... If I ended up becoming my first period teacher... Kate probably became hers... Let's see... If I remember correctly, she has English, AP, with... Mrs. Harris!\" you continued, the heels of your sandals stabbing the ground with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After what was a few seconds shy of a minute, you arrived to what you knew was her classroom, the only memory being the few times you walked her to her class, as a boy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n      \"Here we go... Room 574, the class of Mrs. Harris.\" The light to the room was still on, and, there she was, Mrs. Harris, sitting alone at her desk, looking as if she was grading papers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You thought you'd surprise your dear old sister, now in the body of Harris. You playfully waltzed in, quietly, as not to gain her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       As you crept up to the middle aged, short, plump woman who must've been your sister, you finally seized the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"HEY, SIS!!\" you obnoxiously called to the woman, who jumped back on fear, almost on the verge of a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"My word!\"  she gasped. \"Judith, what in the world are you doing?!\" the woman flipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      But, Kate's charade wouldn't fool you. \"Oh! Nice try, Kate, or should I say, Ms. Smith! You're not gonna fool me, acting like the real Harris! So, how was your first day as a teacher?\" You asked, sitting on her desk, crossing your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The woman you believed to be your sister stood silent. \"Uhm... Judith? Are you quite alright? You are aware that I have been teaching for several, several years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Now you were confused. With a cock of your head, you looked to her, lost, hopelessly lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Alright, Kate. Drop the act, why don't we head to get a bite to eat or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"...\" Harris sat speechless. \"You keep calling me 'Kate' and 'Ms. Smith...' If you're referring to the new student teacher, Kate Smith, she said something about heading to the break room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Then it hit you. \"This isn't Kate...\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       With a coy giggle and a swift apology, you slowly backed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well. That was immensely awkward!\" As you darted towards the faculty and staff break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Meanwhile, there Kate sat, alone, in the break room, alone with her 25 year old self. She thought this's be a good place to rendezvous with you, seeing as, as a teen boy, you frequently spoke of how awesome this place was, with it's snack-stocked fridges, it's ice-cold, almost frosty sodas, and the eye-candy staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As she sat alone, she fiddled and played with her hair, awaiting your arrival, anxious to tell you of her experiences today, and just as anxious to hear of your going ones, she waited, not even noticing that you barged in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      At the table where she sat, you pulled up a seat in front of her and gave her a stare of relief, as you violently panted, completely worn out from that dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Kate...\" you panted, on the edge of breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Confusedly, she looked your way. This was expected, you recognized the fact that she had no idea of where you ended up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh... ugh... Hi, Ms.... Brooks, is it?\" She asked, extending her hand for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You gave a hearty laugh, or as hearty a laugh as a woman can give, grabbed her hand and dove in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Kate looked completely lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ms. Brooks? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"C'mon, Kate! It's-a-me, Kat! Formerly Nate, your sister?\" you laughed at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She had no words, and, instead, simply handed you a soft smile, accompanied by an alleviated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good to see ya, sis...\" she smiled, returning the embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow... You look.... good!\" you added, looking her over as the two of you got to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thanks!\" she grinned. \"Same to you! I love that dress you've got there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Oh! It's not bad! But, no time for chatter! I'm starving, you're probably starving, let's take Brooks' car and go for a bite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate offered a twinkle of a smile and a snicker, no words, and followed you as you moved along to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The only Ford car in the lot, you assumed had to be Ms. Brooks'. What beheld both you and Kate as you walked along was a black Ford Focus, plain, nothing special, quite the opposite of Brooks' personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You scanned the car from back to front, top to bottom, wheel to wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Not bad!\" you gave as you hit the unlock button on the keys, effectively unlocking the doors. \"I'd imagine Ms. Brooks to have a sportier car, something nicer, more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, teaches don't exactly make a lot... I guess we get what we can.\" She said as she situated herself in the passengers seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Good point.\" you concurred. \"Now, where should we eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I could do anything, really.\" Kate answered. \"But, I guess I have been craving a burger, something simple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to her. \"Great minds think alike, sweet sister o'mine! I know this great burger joint down the road, only a few minutes away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You turned the clutch where it need be and pulled out of the parking lot. It was the little things that made this whole thing great, like this; driving without your mother in the passenger's seat getting on your case, or having your own job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The conversation would have commenced on the car, but, you two arrived at your destination much faster than anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"So, how's you like being a student-teacher, or, whatever it is you did?\" you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, I was a student-teacher, helping Mrs. Harris teach the class and all. And, I enjoyed it. ALOT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, yeah?\" you asked as you held the door open for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah! I loved it, actually! Gave me an awesome chance at some first-hand experience in my dream job! After today, I realized that this is it, this is what I want to do, after college and all. I even considered asking to stay like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You frowned, disapprovingly, at this, taking a seat waiting to be served...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Of course I decided against it!\" she blushed. \"I really didn't want to lose 10 years of my life like that! But, enough about me, how was your day?\" she curiously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I've seen better days... Seen better days... When you do become a teacher, beware of presentations! Man, was that some boring stuff! And so monotonous, too! It seemed like it was the same stuff over and over. It got old really, really fast, is what I'm saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate simply laughed at this, and, the conversation continued like this for some time. The conversation had its laughs, its hysterical laughs, its smiles... it just kept going as time flew by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But, the weirdest thing... The guys in the class staring me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know, right! Little pervs... They think they're being so discrete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Exactly! Looking all over my legs and skirt... It's weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Just then out of the blue, without warning, you heard a male voice emanate from behind you, catching both you and Kate completely by surprise. You turned around, to see the man. Who beheld you was a tall man, who looked to be just an inch or two shy of 6'. He donned a head of short, clean-cut black hair and a clean-shaven face, not a trace of hair or flaw in sight, looking to be about 27 or 28, more or less the same age as Ms. Brooks. Clothes-wise, nothing but a flannel shirt, a pair of jeans and a black pair of boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dang teen boys...\" he laughed, his voice smooth and charming. \"Don't they know they can't stare at their teacher like that...\" he laughed, walking up to your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He smiled, almost in a creepy kind of way. Both you and Kate looked to this mystery man in a certain awe, waiting for him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... Only I can.\" he said, looking straight at...<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Something about this guy didn't set right with you, at all. Maybe it was the way he spoke, perhaps it was that super-high-esteem he held over himself, but, whatever the reason, it could be said that you didn't approve of the man, immediately. You never did like the jocky, 'I'm-better-than-you' type. This guy reeked of such personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You considered yourself to be a good friend of Kates, and, if anything, becoming her sister only made you a closer friend to her. Having said this, as you looked over Kate, you knew she had fallen for this guy, maybe almost as instantly as you came to dread him. Her blush was violent, the way she spoke to him was spaced out, almost stuttered, as if caught in some sort of trance over this mystery man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He was under her skin. This much you knew was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, Katie...\" He said, his voice smooth and coffee-like, who's your friend over here, he said gesturing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh... That's just a friend of mine, Judith. Judith... Brooks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You rolled your eyes, on the edge of gagging in disgust. There Kate goes, with her airy way of speaking, her stuttered, spaced speech. You knew love, these were the signs you displayed around her when you were not her sister, nor her co-worker teacher. No, these signs were familiar when you were nothing more than that friend who wanted to be something more than friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You immediately stabbed in the conversation, nearly cutting Kate off in her introduction of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, Mr. guy, who are you?\" You coldly asked. You attained a disapproving look from Kate when you spoke like this. Something wicked this way comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh! Well, I'm Paul, last name, Lewis.\" He said, not even so kind as to extend his hand for a hand-shake. Heck, when he introduced himself, he just sat there, handing you only an empty look with those eyes of his, cuddling up with Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And, how do you know my friend Kate, here?\" You inquired, Kate looked to Paul as you asked him this, too, probably curious about his role in this life of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Paul handed Kate a warm smile and a peck on the cheek, causing Kate to go deeper into feelings for him. At this point, despite her lack of words, you could tell she was all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Paul continued looking into Kate's eyes and rubbing the side of her arm, almost as if petting her. He then shifted his look your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, Judith.\" he began, matter-of-factly. \"Katie and I have been going steady since about High-School, junior year of High-School. I found that love for teaching and learning she had so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate, much to your lack of surprise, batter her eyes and continued falling, the violent blush speaking for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...And, ever since then, I've been crazy about her.\" He handed her another peck about the cheek. Much to your surprise, .she returned the kiss, causing the pair to take each other into embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      This behavior was so unlike her. Never before had you seen Kate fall in love with someone, anyone, especially someone she's just met that fast. Never had you seen her swept of her feet, figuratively speaking, of course, in such a short amount of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \",,,Or maybe I'm just jealous...\" you thought to yourself, watching the two ogle each other to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, Katie...\" He said, playing with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes, Paul?\" She inquired, looking passionately into the man's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I like burgers and fries as much as the next guy... But, I can see no one's taken your order or anything...\" He gesture to the empty table before the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Tell you what... I know this nice little Italian place down the street, really nice place. Would you care to dine with me?\" He said, grabbing her hand, kissing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She continued to redden like a tomato. Without a second thought, she peeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Of course, Paul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She looked to you, noticing the dissatisfaction you had about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, Judith...\" She coldly said. \"I'll see you at work later, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You were about to stand in protest, provide an answer of some sort. But, by the time you got to your feet, the two had already made their way out the door and into Paul's black and blue '09 Mustang, a real beauty, a car you envied, as a boy, even now. Sure beat the heck out of that Focus now your own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The car wasted no time in peeling out, boasting the power of those sweet little wheels of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And, just like that, within a matter of seconds, you plopped yourself down on the seat, speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Stood up... By my own sister...\" You sighed, tapping your fingers anxiously among the tables surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That guy was a total jerk, I could see it in him... And there she went, falling for him like a giddy little school girl...\" You sighed to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As if on cue, though a bit late, a young man, who looked around the college age, perhaps 19 or 20 walked up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With a sniffle, he lazily asked. \"May I take your order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh! Now you're here!\" You cursed, at the absolute top of your lungs, getting up, pushing him aside and walking out to your car. You unlocked the car, and sat on the driver's side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I only did this whole thing for Kate... And, just like that, she ditched... For some a-hole...\" You referred to her knight-in--shining-armor, Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I can't just let her take off like that! She was already talking about staying in that body... Paul might be the last nail in the figurative coffin... Then what will I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You sat in your seat, contemplating it all. From becoming Kate's twin, to induction into her home, to being late for school, to teaching, to now... It had all happened so fast, now it all seemed like one big blur...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I guess I have no choice...\" You slide the key into the ignition, and set the car to 'Drive.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"...Guess I'd better...\"</span></div></div>",

However, that was more than enough for you to hear, which made you jump back a bit in surprise. Did she really mean that? Was the direct approach not working?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" you asked a bit, to which Kate sighed, while trying to maintain a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really nice Nate, but I'd us to just stay friends. I don't think eiher of us is really for that kind of thing. So....please understand.\" She kind of looked away after that, like she didn't want to say more about it. You were still a bit surprised. On one hand, you were happy that Kate did consider you both to be friends. Still, the glass felt half-empty, so you were a bit deflated none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, you shifted back over to your own seat, hoping to put that out of your head. You had no idea that one of the candies had slipped out of your pockets, and you still thought that they were secure. Going on that, you had no idea what Kate had just did, or what her wish would end up doing. You didn't see anything wrong with how she worded what she said, despite her saying \"I wish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird how she happened to phrase it that way.\" you muttered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the bus arrived at the parking lot, allowing everyone to get off. You walked off alone, seeing Kate walk away from you. You could see her try to flash a smile at you, but she didn't say a word. That was one of the reasons why you liked her. Despite obviously making her uncomfortable, she didn't hold grudges, and she likely already put that outburst behind her and wanted to stay friends. The thought made you smile; she was such a great person. At least you still had that in your pocket. Well, guess it was time for school. Luckily, no one thought you having breasts would be weird at all. Perhaps in the future, you could try talking to Kate on simpler matters than dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it wasn't like you had any idea what was going to come, even as Tommy came over and gave you a friendly pat on the back for a greeting. You shared a few words with him before he had to take off to his own class. You walked straight to your locker, getting the books you needed out of it. After getting said books, it was time to head off to class.</span></div></div>",

Instead, Tommy treated you as he normally would, attempting to motivate you to finally talk to Kate. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cCome on, Man!\u201d He exclaimed, patting your shoulder with one hand in an attempt to (literally) push you to talk to the dark-haired beauty. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sitting here, talking about talking to her, but, not actually talking to her! You could\u2019ve had her already, Man!\u201d He continued.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     Meanwhile, you sat there, lost in her shining dark hair, sitting alone. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI don\u2019t know, Tom\u2026 I just don\u2019t feel ready. Anywhere near it, actually.\u201d You stated, looking your friend in the eyes, which he rolled in a sort of frustration.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI guess, Nate. I\u2019m just saying, she could be yours, whenever you want, you\u2019ve just got to go for her!\u201d Tommy claimed, as the bus came to a halt that screeched as it sowed down, nearing the school. The to the bus opened wide as all the kids you were surrounded by spilled from the bus, including Kate.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cSee! This is what I\u2019m talking about, she\u2019s gone! One more day passed, one more day she could\u2019ve been in your arms!\u201d He said before rushing out the door. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Surprised to see him in such a hurry to class, you couldn\u2019t help but wonder where he was off to. You\u2019ve known Tommy for quite the number of years. Knowing him as well as you did, you knew he never went to class until the absolute last-minute; The very definition of procrastination.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cTom! Where you going?!\u201d You asked as he neared the door.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cTest, first period! Forgot to study!\u201d He claimed, before finally darting from the bus, leaving you alone.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You laughed. \u201cClassic Tommy\u2026 Well, I guess I\u2019d better get to class, too.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     After a few moments of walking about the halls of the school, going up these stairs, through these halls, turning left and right and left again, you finally arrived to your classroom; Room 554, the classroom of Ms. Judith Brooks.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Nate walked into the classroom, and looked around. All the seats were empty, completely empty, just you and Ms. Brooks, who sat at her desk, her heels kicked off to the side somewhere. She had her bare feet, her perfectly pedicured and painted toenails, kicked upon her desk. She seemed to be on the phone, in the midst of a seemingly heated conversation.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cRob\u2026\u201d She said, closing her eyes, putting her hand to her cheek. \u201cNo, Rob! That\u2019s enough! Not another word! You and I are through! You hear me, through! What? There is no more to talk about, I have a student here!\u201d She shouted into her phone, gesturing to you, leaving you with quite the awkward feeling. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d She sternly said into the phone, hanging up, throwing the phone in her purse.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cHi, Nate.\u201d She said, trying to keep her cool, tying her strawberry blonde hair into a ponytail,  her feet still upon the desk.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     \u201cUgh\u2026 Hi, Ms. Brooks.\u201d You nervously said.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cListen, Nate\u2026\u201d She began, straightening out the skirt she wore. \u201cDon\u2019t you mind that conversation I just had\u2026 Some guys are just complete jerks.\u201d She vented. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      \u201cUgh\u2026 I guess I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n       She laughed, subtly. \u201cThanks for trying, Nate, but there\u2019s no way you understand\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked, confused.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWell, it\u2019s just\u2026 Nevermind.\u201d She said, crossing her legs on the desk before her.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     She then looked to your backpack, and saw the bag of candies you kept tucked in there.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOoh!\u201d She chirped. \u201cNate, could you be a dear and give me one of those candies? I could really use one right now, what with this ugly breakup and all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      You heart stopped right then and there. \u201cUgh\u2026 Sure?\u201d You said, reaching into the bag of candies, pulling one out, getting up from your seat and going over to her desk to hand it to her.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYay!\u201d She giggled, quickly unwrapping it and throwing it in her mouth. \u201cMmm! That is one good candy!\u201d She exclaimed, sucking on it. Each second hat passed made you more and more nervous for what she could do with it.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhere\u2019d you get these, Nate?\u201d She asked. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cUgh\u2026 Yesterday was my birthday, and, someone, I\u2019m not sure who, gave them to me.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cReally? Well, happy belated birthday!\u201d She exclaimed.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cThanks, Ms. Brooks!\u201d You smiled, attempting to be polite.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     She continued to suck on the candy, unknowing of it\u2019s power, or the breasts on your chest.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI don\u2019t have a gift, or anything like that\u2026 But, I have always liked you. Now, I\u2019m gonna give you some advice, Nate.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat would that be, Ms. Brooks?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cPlease, call me Judith.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOkay, Judith?\u201d You confusedly continued, unknowing of where all this was going.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNow, my advice to you is this: Don\u2019t become a teacher. The pay is mediocre, the students disrespect you, not taking you seriously, and, since I\u2019m a woman, the males tend to ogle me to no end! I know, being a boy, you don\u2019t have to worry about that, but, still. Teaching; Don\u2019t do it.\u201d<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     \u201cUgh\u2026 Thanks?\u201d <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNo problem!\u201d Ms. Brooks, or Judith responded. You had liked her, not in the crush kind of way, but you liked her as a teacher, and she did seem to be a nice person and all, but, she was a bit strange. There was just something about Judith that had always struck you as odd. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI\u2019m serious, teaching, don\u2019t do it. This is my second year, and, already it feels like it\u2019s been eternities.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI understand.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     She gave you a strange look and continued to suck on her candy.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You gave a gulp and looked back at her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This could not end well considering what she was sucking on. You noticed that Ms. Brooks gave you a bit of an odd look, which was likely because you had a strange look on your own face. She looked like she was about to say something. However, before any words  could be spoken, you immediately saw a bright flash of light, causing you to cover your eyes. It lasted a couple seconds, and by the time you looked again, Ms. Brooks was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you gotta be kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit freaked out right now. Your teacher just bailed and went on a vacation as the wish implied. So now what were you to do? Did this mean class would be canceled? Did anyone know about it? After all, no one noticed your own breasts, or it might be more accurate to say that nobody saw anything odd about them. You didn't really have much a way to know how this would turn out. With Ms. Brooks on vacation, obviously someone had to take her place, but how would that happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you saw some students beginning to file into the classroom, as there was about 10 minutes or so left before class was to begin. You and Ms. Brooks were the only ones in the classroom up to this point. What were you to do? Immediately, you got out the second candy that you had in your pocket and began sucking, trying to think of any solution. Soon, your lips began moving off their own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish our teacher situation was resolved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what exactly that meant. What kind of vague wish was that? You could do better than that. Still, you felt a small jolt, as if something had changed. Out of the corner of your eye, you began seeing some students leave. Confused, you walked over to Eric, someone you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eric, what's going on?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear?\" Eric replied as if it was normal. \"We're getting a new teacher tomorrow apparently. Guess we don't have this period today, not that I have a problem with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Eric left along with the others, leaving you really confused.  Did your wish just cancel class? Boy, was this confusing. Perhaps it was best to just go along with it for now. You had wished for the situation to be \"resolved\" but who knew what that entailed. Anyway, you picked up your backpack and looked over Ms. Brook's desk, or at least what was her desk a few moments ago. Her things were still there, and a couple of things stood out to you. Her teacher glasses were still sitting on the desk, neatly folded, and the other was a hair tie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich interested you more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at Ms. Brooks' desk, you saw a pair of glasses there. They weren't anything special, just normal black in color. They were pretty simple as you saw most of the time. Your hands went right to them, looking at them from all angles. Honestly, you weren't sure why you were holding them in the first place. If these belonged to Ms. Brooks, perhaps you shouldn't touch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, if she is on vacation, perhaps she won't mind.\" You seemed to convince yourself. To be honest, you were a bit near-sighted, even though you never really told anyone about it. Perhaps you could just borrow these and just say to everyone that you've been wanting to try them out for some time. They probably wouldn't even notice, kind of like what happened with your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you unfolded the glasses and placed them on your face. Instantly, things looked even better. You could see just fine before, but you could definitely see why some people wore them all the time. So, it looked like you were sold on the idea of borrowing them, at least until Ms. Brooks eventually returned, if she ever did. Well, since her class was canceled for the day, that left a whole period's worth of time for you to do whatever you want basically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should I do?\" You asked yourself as you exited the classroom. There wasn't much going on, other than some students talking about random stuff. Tommy was in his own class for now, since that was likely still going on. You were pretty much on your own, but what was there to do? Kind of boring when you thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, you ended up just laying against the nearby wall, totally bored with nothing to do. Why did Ms. Brooks have to eat that candy? Everything just got more complicated thanks to it. Of course, your wish didn't seem to help either. So much for those candies. You even wondered how the other classes would go. Ms. Brooks taught History in both 1st Period and 4th Period later that day, so there was another class that would have nothing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was so clouded that you just ended up walking forward with no real direction. If only you noticed your shoes starting to turn black...</span></div></div>",

What in the world was she thinking?! Did she think of that on her own, or does the candy somehow make a person compulsively make a wish? The thought of it kind of made your head hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why would you say that?\" You asked a bit out of fear. Part of you hoped nothing would happen, but you hadn't seen a case where the candies did nothing. Actually, the real question was what would happen. She wished for you to understand how she felt, so what would happen? Maybe you would just get some insight on how a teacher worked or something. Who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Mr. Brooks flashed a smile. \"Sorry, guess I kind of got a little crazy there. Still, I'm serious. If only you knew what kinds of things I go through, perhaps you'd have a different viewpoint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I will sometime. Then again, you just said don't be a teacher.\" You tried to lighten the mood a bit. Mrs. Brooks actually laughed a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I guess I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after that, the other students started filing in. Tommy was probably either in his own classroom right now or still rushing things at the last second. The last idea made you sigh again. He would never change, would we? Even some other guys you knew like Jason and Tim, who did share this first class with you, weren't sure. Oh well, at least you had others to talk to. Unfortunately, Tim was the kind of guy who Ms. Brooks talked about at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were in here alone with the teach? Seeing anything good?\" He smirked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, are you really going there?\" You asked him. Tim was a nice guy, but let's be real: he had quite a thing for woman like Ms. Brooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, she's pretty hot for a teacher. Especially with that chest.\" You exasperated at his comments, as did Jason. Another guy who would never change. Perhaps Ms. Brooks had a point to what she said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, that aside, it was time for class to start. Perhaps you were glad that nothing odd happened during class, since Ms. Brooks didn't act any less ordinary to the whole class. You did notice her looking at you a couple times, mostly due to said conversation. It kind of made you uncomfortable about the whole thing. After turning in the homework to start class, it was right to the books for all of you. Ms. Brooks' class relived heavily on books, so it was mostly lecture the whole way through, which most of the class wasn't that fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, for the most part, you kept your mouth shut.

She ended up not doing that, but it didn't make you any less worried.</span></div></div>",

This situation was getting way too awkward for you to just sit here, speechless. Even now, as he inquired how you obtained this new chest of yours, he didn't even bother to look you in the eyes. All focus lay undivided on your new 'accessories.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Seriously, Dad?\" you thought to yourself. \"I'm your son!\" You protested in your head. After this experience alone, you knew why women often felt harassed by men. You're not even female, aside from breasts, and you can already empathize with 'the other half.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'll tell you if you quit staring at me like that!\" You shouted in frustration to your father. Typically, if you even so much as raised your voice at him, he'd one up you and give you twice the scolding for 'disrespect.' This time, it seemed you had him under your thumb. Without a word, he immediately raised his head from his chest to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright, son! Just... Calm down and tell me what happened to you!\" He pleaded, seemingly a little freaked out. \"You can't expect me not to freak out, seeing as my oldest son has a full blown pair of breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He had a point. With that point, you gave a defeated sigh and began elaboration. You pulled the bag of candies from your jeans pockets and explained. \"These. I used these...\" you said, pointing at the candies, \"... To get these.\" You answered, gesturing to your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike now looked more confused than ever, even more confused than when he discovered your additions in the first  place. \"A bag of candies?\" He asked. \"But... How? Son, are you feeling okay? I don't see how candies could... Y'know...\" He finished, looking to your chest once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What did I say about looking down there!\" You shot to your dad. Who looked away rapidly, giving only a \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know this is gonna sound crazy... But these candies are magic. They can take any wish you have, any wish at all, and grant it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh my god...\" Mike uttered, in a shocked manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You believe me!\" You exclaimed, both happy and surprised at the lack of disbelief from your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You do sound crazy. Are you... Feeling okay?\" Clearly, the man thought you insane, from the peculiar look in his eye, to the way he cocked his head at you as a confused canine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dad!\" You plead. \"You have to believe me! I mean... How else can I have these?\" You said, firmly grasping your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Good point.\" He said, once more, looking to your breasts. You knew your father well, very well. Being stuck inside a house with this guy for 15 years will make you aware of whom he truly is. And, knowing your father, you knew him to be a complete perv; A skirt-chaser, if you will. How he ended up with the sweet-as-can-be woman like your mother. But, for one reason or another, she ended up with your father, a kind man who really liked women. You could catch him staring at other females from miles away. It didn't bother you until you were the one being stared at. The way he looked to your chest was almost an envious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well, with those things you've got there, I guess I've got no choice but to believe you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, good.\" You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"You mind handing me a candy, son?\" He asked, a hint of eagerness in the way he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Sure?\" You complied, handing him two or three candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He placed two of the three in his pocket and was left with only one. The one he held in his hand, he stared at in a particular awe and wonder; Magic actually did exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And... You say that these candies gave you those...? And they can grant any wish? Any wish at all?\" He inquired,. Something was definitely up that sleeve of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yes?\" You answer, fearsome of his intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      (What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

Life's been really stressin' me out... Your mother, bills, my job, life in general, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I thought you were on vacation right now?\" You asked. Indeed he was. Currently, your father was on a two-week vacation from the office job he held. Two weeks of him taking well deserved time off. He was a hard working man, provided for your family, a true family man. He and your mother, both, were very hard workers. Taking the work-time he put in, you could definitely see where he came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Technically, I am. But, I go back to that working-grind on Monday. And, to be frank, I really don't want to go back. Work is a pain in the rear! My boss and co-workers are total jerks! And, the job itself sucks anyway!\" He complained, still sucking on the candy. You feared where this was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now, about your 'additions...'\" He said, looking to your breasts and then back to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What about them?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"You either go all or nothing at all!\" He exclaimed at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I wish I was...!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"I wish I was a young, adult woman!\" He wished in his booming, masculine voice. Surely that voice would change, soon enough, though. All you could think to yourself, though, was how fortunate it was that, conveniently, you two were the only ones at your home. Not long after, not long at all, the changes began to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Calmly did he close his eyes, as to prepare for and endure the changes. First, as expected, his body, his height, fell dramatically, from his booming 6'1\" to the slightest bit shorter than you at 5'5\". You were taken back by how, just a moment ago, you had to look up at him. Now, you were nearly eye level with him. Next, his frame and body shrank some more; His hip area lost all the muscle there and was replaced by smoothness. He now had curves at the hips, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The next change was definitely the most awkward; You saw the bulge emanating from his pants fade away as he gained 'female components.' Now your dad was... More a mom than a dad; He now a she. From there, all her body hair died off, leaving behind smooth legs, arms, chest; All except that which was on her head, which lengthened until it reached her shoulders. Next, her arms and legs lost their muscles, becoming more slender. Her legs became more shapely, expanded at the thighs and shrunk at the feet. Then, her facial structure changed, her nose became more button-like, her lips became more defined, and her eyes became a wee bit bigger, creating the eyes any man would get lost in. Finally, she sprouted two slightly above average in size breasts; Not too much, but definitely the size that would act as a magnet to men's eyes, and make other women envious. As a final detail, her Adam's Apple departed, in order to create a womanly voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Then, the real final details, the clothes, began to make themselves known. Her rather loose basket ball shorts shrunk themselves and turned into a pair of denim shorts, hugging her thighs rather nicely, giving men a nice view that'd leave them wanting more. The now extremely large mens sandals on her feet shrunk to fit her newly sized feet and changed in color from black to sky-blue. The plain white tee she donned, now oversized, shrunk, retained it's white color and became a bra. On top of that spontaneously came a plain blue tee shirt that'd match her eyes. From here, her hair rearranged itself into a cute looking ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The deed was done. Mike opened her eyes in a slow, dramatic way, then batted them. She looked down to herself, wiggled her toes, just to make sure this was real. She put her hands to her thighs, which the shorts left exposed and slowly rubbed them, humming softly as she did. She then felt up her hips, and gave her breasts a little squeeze. All the while, you stared at her; She didn't even notice she was being stared at. From your perspective, this was just plain nasty, watching your own father feel himself up in a girls body. Oh, the strangeness of it all! Something like this was what you feared. You knew he had something up his sleeve, but no idea what; You feared something extreme like this. But, alas, the wish was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, your dad stopped the nastiness, and looked at the bag of candies she held in her hand. \"Now, this is what I've been needing!\" She chirped in her new, sing-song voice. \"I look amazing! I mean, look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey!\" She called, looking to you. You hesitated not in turning your focus to her. \"How do I look? Don't I look great?\" She asked, doing a pose as she asked. This made you a little sick, she asked you how she looked much like your sister would before a date. To think your father was now the one asking how she looked was just weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You look fine, Dad.\" You coldly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The woman before you then shot you a slightly irritated look. \"First off, don't call me 'Dad.'\" She said, doing air-quotes with her fingers. \"Look at me! Do I look like a man? Do I look like I could be anyone's Dad? No! Next, I don't have any kids, I'm only 22.\" She said, folding her arms in annoyance, again, much as your sister did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come on, Dad, I know you need a vacation, but what's Mom gonna say when she sees you like this?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Now, the woman who was your dad looked furious. \"Ugh! What's wrong with you? I'm not married, especially to another woman! I'm just a young girl with her whole life ahead of her!\" It was clear to you that your dad was just playing the part, really well, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dad...\" You started, only to be cut off by her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"For the last time, I'm not your Dad! I'm not even a man! I'm Carrie, 24 year old girl, not man, girl.\" She asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But, these candies, pretty awesome! Who knew? Magic does exist!\" She said, holding the bag of candies up in the air as if they were pom-poms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Fine, I'll play along... Carrie?\" You asked, disgusted by you're conforming to his strangeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes?\" She happily returned, a blush about her face, from hearing her new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You rolled your eyes. \"So, what happens now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"About that...\" She began, putting a finger to her chin, in thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Like I said, these magical little candies are pretty darn cool! And, for 'what happens now,' as you put it, I'll be needing them!\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She then popped a candy in her mouth and wished a wish.</span></div></div>",

Fine! I was once a man at one point! But, now I'm not now! I'm presently not a man, I don't have a wife, or kids. I'm just little 24 year old Carrie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      One question still lay on your mind. \"So, why did you do this to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Like I said, I wanted a true vacation! No responsibilities, just freedom and fun! Besides, don't I look better this way?\" She said, rubbing her legs again. \"I mean, look at these legs of mine! I had no idea how I did it as a man, with those nasty, hairy legs! EEW!\" She shrieked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But just right now you made it seem like you've totally forgotten about all that stuff!\" You exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, so what?\" She asked, making a pouting face as she did. That face rapidly died in its tracks as she continued to suck on the candy in her mouth. \"Right! I almost forgot about these things! Anyway, why should I be having this much fun alone?! I wish you were also a woman around my age!\" She declared, looking you right in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"DAD!!!!!\" You bellowed in protest. But, by then, it was much too late to turn back now. Meanwhile, she stood, staring at you, gaining some sort of contentment out of this. She crossed her arms and just enjoyed the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Very similar changes to your father, with that wish, began. Much to your surprise, you retained your height of 5'6\" You felt your frame twist and contort, creating a much more coke-bottle like physique. You felt the muscles all about your body die down and be replaced by that feminine fat that made women's legs look amazing. Your legs gained more shape, as did your arms, both gaining slenderness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You felt your rear inflate, to a size men would surely stare at. Your feet and hands became small and dainty, as compared to their former, masculine, larger selves. All the hair on your body disappeared, leaving only smooth skin. The hair on your head changed color as well, going from brown hair to a dirty blonde color, growing in length till it reached mid-back. Next, you felt your 'manhood' slip away and felt 'womanhood' enter. With the changing of the vocal area and the face, such as lips and bigger eyes, much similar to the changes your father endured, the only change left was in the clothes department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The knee length cargo shorts you wore shrunk and shriveled and became of a pair of white khaki women's shorts. The bra you wore remained, and atop that formed a black tank-top. On your feet, your socks disappeared all together and your shoes became a pair of black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"UGH?!\" You disgustedly called in your new feminine voice. \"What did you do to me?!\" You hissed in the manner all women did in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your father, or rather, Carrie looked at you, straight faced and all and smiled upon her creation. \"I made you better, Girl!\" She just called you 'Girl.' She was begin to treat you like one of her friends. \"I mean, you need to see a mirror or something, you look amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The mirror was the best suggestion Carrie had made all night, also, the only sane thing she's suggested all night. You then rushed over to your Mom's room and examined yourself in the full-body mirror she kept in her closet. \"WOW.\" You actually whispered softly, surprised by how amazing you looked. If you were a still a guy, you'd totally go for your female self. You really did look great. You looked to be older, definitely, older than Carrie... If you had to guess, you'd say you were about 26 years old. The skin you donned was pale white, it seemed that you had shed the sun-tanned skin you sported as a boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The legs and breasts you had looked great as well. You couldn't help but do as Carrie did and give each, your thighs and breasts, a little feel-up. Just a little one. You let out a soft moan as you did, compulsively. You had no idea where that moan stemmed from. \"Women have it great!\" You smiled as you continued checking yourself out in the mirror, striking different poses and facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yeah, they do!\" Carrie chirped from behind you, startling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now, don't you agree, that I've improved our bodies, Natalie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm Nate, Dad... I mean, Carrie...\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Look at yourself. Do you think you look like a Nate?\" Carrie condescendingly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You turned to the mirror and checked yourself out once more. Natalie seemed to make more sense here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I guess you've got a point, these bodies are... Pretty cool.\" You conformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What did I tell you, Honey!\" There Carrie goes again, talking you like a girlfriend. \"Improvements!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But, what are we supposed to tell Mom, and Erin, and the rest of our family when they get home? They'll be pretty confused finding two women in their 20's here, but finding their 15 year old son and father and husband absent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"What is it with you thinking of the two of us as men, Natalie?! Look at us! We are clearly two girls in their prime! And I don't know what this 'Mom' and 'Erin' you're talking about are going to do, but, for now, they're not my problem! I don't know these people! I don't have kids or a family! It's just you and me and the world, Hon! Our only concern should be what fun are we gonna have tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But, you can't forget your kids and wife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't have a family, Nat! What's it gonna take for you to get that through your head!\" Carrie then smiled a little smile and reached into the bag she held in her shorts. You gulped in fear as she popped yet another candy into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now, for the next order of business!\" She smiled, as she sucked in the candy.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

What are you doing?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This house is a bit stuffy for a couple of bombshells like us. We need to get out and explore.\" smiled Carrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say much more, you felt yourself and Carrie leave the house, traveling by magic as it were. It was such a bizarre feeling, traveling as if you were lighter than air. You almost wished it could have lasted longer. However, after a little while, you finally felt yourself touchdown somewhere. Immediately, you felt blazing heat on you. You looked straight up to see the sun above you, and sand around your feet. The sound of people playing brought your attention back down, making you see that you and Carrie were at the beach now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! I couldn't have picked a better place.\" smiled Carrie, obviously enjoying this. Not only that, you felt different than you did before. You looked down and gasped, hugging yourself a bit. Your clothes had been replaced by a nice black bikini, complete with beach sandals on your feet. You looked over at Carrie, seeing that she was wearing a dark blue bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking pretty good there Nat!\" smiled Carrie. \"Who would have thought that bikinis were so much better than boring old male swimsuits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm not sure it's a good idea.\" You tried to say otherwise, but you had to admit you liked how you looked in this bikini. Carrie just smiled again, still holding the bag of candies with her. Before you could say more, she wished for some beach bags with the same candy from the prior wish, giving them just that. With that, to your slight surprise, Carrie unloaded some of the candies into your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you enjoy yourself. I know I will. Maybe you could even spread this joy of ours around.\" said Carrie as she grabbed her bag and ran off, eager to enjoy herself. You sighed as you picked up your own bag, walking along the beach from the secluded spot. You found a spot for yourself and laid down your towel and bag. Looking inside, you did grab a couple of candies, popping one inside your mouth. Still, you didn't wish on anything, although you kind of felt like leaving. Instead, your thoughts seemed to turn to other things.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     The situation at hand was hectic, utter chaos, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Today was your birthday, a day to be celebrated. Any boy should feel nothing but joy on the 15th birthday, it's only natural. 15 is the true transition into the teenage life. Most would argue the true entrance into the teenage world was 13, but, you yourself didn't feel like one up until 15. You yourself especially thought 15 the true 'year of the teenager,' as you referred to it, because of one thing all your age held to be so sacred; the driving permit. Today was to be a day of the coming-of-age. Boy, did the coming of age happen, in ways you didn't expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Here you sat, a should-be 15 year old boy, in the body of a rather appealing 26 year old woman. Yeah, you'd say you came-of-age. The stranger part, you liked it a little more than you'd like to admit. As you examined the beach in your secluded little space, you felt a small, strange, sense of contentment. You had an attractive body, a body any male your age, or any age, would love to even get the opportunity to look at. You looked to your breasts; amazing. You rubbed your longer, more shapely legs; equally amazing. You stroked your long, dirty-blonde hair with your slender little fingers; Soft couldn't even begin to describe your hair. Even your voice had a pleasant, soft, comforting air about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Life is alright...\" You said, looking down at your legs, wiggling your toes in the sand.  The sound of your voice still excited you. \"The real magic of these candies is the flavor...\" You giggled, sucking on the candy, savoring it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You thought about your words. \"Candy...\" You repeated. That's when you were reminded of how you got here, in this moment of tranquility and contentment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Today was your birthday. Among the gifts you received was a jar of candies, supposedly with the ability to grant wishes. These candies seemed to have spawned out of nowhere. Despite your skepticism, you wished, anyway. For what? Every male's dream, breasts to do with what you'd like! Then, along comes your father. Your father, lacking in your skepticism, pops a candy in his mouth and wishes. For what? For a life away from the life he currently had. A life away from the stresses of work, wife, kids. No. He wanted his freedom back, his youth back, the fun he'd never had. So, in this, he wishes to be a young, 24 year old bombshell of a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Once he's done this, he denies ever having a family, or being a man, or anything associated with his own life, even dismissing you as a son. He called himself 'Carrie.' 'Carrie,' for whatever reason, turned you into a woman as well, a 26 year old, just as hot woman. Now, out of nowhere, here you sat, at the beach, while your spoiled, woman of a father abandoned his old life, taking you captive, forced to leave your mother, siblings and friends, all beloved behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There died your peace with this newfound form, despite that small part of you that managed to enjoy this. You were furious. No man, or woman, would dare mess with you at this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to the bag of candies that lay behind you, getting to your feet, you placed your hands to your hips, instinctively, and kicked the bag of candies. \"It's all these stupid candies' fault! Were it not for these, none of this would have happened! I would have been a boy, I would have had my crush, my friends, my family.... My father. Now, it's all gone!' You shouted, garnering  the look of a young girl and a young boy, both looking to be about 10 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to these kids, still in your fury. Sensing your anger, they went right on about their business. What was their business. They were bickering over a sandcastle. Ever since you got here, you saw a cute little girl building up a small sandcastle, or, as the girl regarded it, a proud architectural work. The girl adored this castle, then, out of the blue, this young boy came about and kicked it. You paid the children no mind, seeing it as only a small detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In your fury, the bickering continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You meanie!\" The girl yelled. \"I'm telling my Daddy what you did to my castle! Why would you do something like that?!\" The girl fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I was just playing around!\" The boy retorted. \"You were the one who got all mad about it! Plus, it was a stupid looking castle, anyway! And, if you tell your Dad, I'll tell my Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And, back and forth, the seemingly infinite whining proceeded. You've had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I wish that you two little brats would just grow up already and make up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your fury came to a halt, you covered your mouth In shock, realizing what you'd just said. \"Oh my god!\" You said in your mind. \"I totally forgot about the candy I had in my mouth!\" It all happened so fast, you didn't think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was too late. The changes quickly commenced. First, a blinding light emerged from the boy and the girl. When the light faded, both were still there, in their respective forms. Then, both grew taller, and their mass changed to match their height proportionally. The boy grew to be about your height at 5'6,\" more or less, while the girl grew to be about 5'11.\" They appeared to be right around the age 25, if you had to guess. Yes, the girl looked to be a healthy 25 year old woman, and the boy, a trim 25 year old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Things rapidly grew weirder. The boys, muscle-bound, haired legs lost all the hair and muscle about them, leaving behind perfectly shaven, smooth legs. The legs then grew incredibly shapely, becoming more defined at the calves and thighs. His feet, too, became notably daintier and arched, perfect for heels and all such things. The toes managed to perfectly pedicure and paint themselves, a cherry red shade. His muscled arms, too, lost mass and became more slender. His hands and fingers, the same fate. The nails at the ends of his slender fingers manicured themselves and painted themselves the same color as the toes. You noticed his Adam's apple fade, which would leave him a softer voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rapidly did the boy take on a coke-bottle like figure, his hips bursting forth. On his chest, breasts swelled until they reached what you guessed was a C-cup. His frame shrank all around. The facial hair erased itself, and his facial features greatly softened. His lips puffed to a perfect size, and pink lipstick there spread itself about his lips. His face then appeared to have been perfectly done in makeup and cosmetics. He closed his eyes and, upon opening them, his brown eyes changed to a forest green. His black hair lightened several shades, settling at brunette. His hair stretched slightly above the mid-back. The bulge erupting from his crotch faded quickly. You knew his manhood was gone. He was now a 25 year old woman, quite attractive, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The opposite happened with the girl. The hourglass like frame she had became bulkier, more masculine. Her chest went flat rapidly, leaving behind a trim chest. Her slender arms grew more muscle about them. Gone was that slender look. Same with the legs, which immediately lost their shape, and gained hair and muscle. The hands and feet grew larger as well, losing their feminine touch. Her long, mane of blonde hair regressed until they barely reached the tips of the ears, also, changing from blonde to brown, in the process. The soft face features grew more manly, even adding some facial hair above the lips, which lost their feminine mass. An Adam's apple then erupted from the throat area. Lastly, you saw a bulge erupt from the now incredibly tight bikini bottoms. She was a man, a handsome, fit, 25 year old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Finally were the clothes. On the former boy's, now woman's ring finger, a beautiful silver plated ring appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>  \"A ring?!\" </i>You thought.<i> \"Are they... Married?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The boy's trunks that the woman wore shifted and contorted, changing material as well, into a blue pair of bikini bottoms. The boy's plain white tee shirt that the woman wore contorted and twisted into a matching bikini top. The bikini there formed was perfect for showing off the beautiful body she now could call hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The girls one piece swimsuit the man wore changed from pink to black, and shrank down, to the point that they were only shorts. This left him shirtless. These newly formed shorts then elongated stretching below his knees, leaving much of his new, brawn legs covered. A matching ring, similar, very similar, to that which the woman formed then surrounded his ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, they're married...\" You sighed aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The newly created woman spoke up. \"Yes, we are married, just a few days ago, actually.\" She spoke in her soft, sing-song voice, looking at you. She then turned her attention to the man, who wasted no time in taking her into his strong, secure embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The woman continued. \"And I couldn't be happier...\" She sighed, warmly, clinging to his secure, manly chest. He made her feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The woman then looked up at the man, who looked down at her, into each other's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The newly created man spoke. \"I love you so much, Honey.\" He softly assured in his booming, strong voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I love you, too!\" She giggled, leaning in for a kiss. Then, the newlyweds did just that. Kissed and loved every moment of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oooo-kay... Awkward...\" You whispered under your breath, slowly getting back to your towel as to lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I can't believe I just did that... I turned a little boy into a woman, and a little girl into a man...\" you looked back at the couple, who were now holding hands and walking along the beach. \"And there they go, just walking about as if nothing happened!\" You still couldn't get over the sound of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where was I... Ugh... Well, it'll come to me eventually. For now, I'll just lay here and enjoy some sun.\" You said, digging your feet in the sand and laying on your back. Unknowingly, you reached into your beach bag, grabbed another candy, and placed it in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Uh-oh.</span></div></div>",

Before, you just saw a couple of kids arguing with each other. Then, next thing you know it, they're a married couple that just ran off happily along the beach. On one hand it was sweet, and on another, it was just so dang weird. As weird as you and your Dad frolicking around the beach as women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is so weird.\" You sighed again, laying down on the towel. The sun felt nice enough, although it didn't make you feel much better. However, after a few minutes, you saw a shadow loom over you. You only needed to see a certain smile before knowing who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girlfriend, what'cha doing?\" To say your Dad was in total character right now would be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not much.\" You sighed again. Carrie casted a knowing smile at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you didn't waste much time making a wish. Turning those little kids into newlyweds? Pretty creative I must say.\" She smiled again at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but I'm not proud of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no one's the wiser right now. As far as anyone knows, those two have always been this way. They're nice and happy, so you should also be happy.\" Carrie gave you a wink, hoping you would lighten up. Right as that happened, she ran off again. She said something about wanting to get involved in a beach volleyball game a ways down the beach. There apparently were guys in it too, so she was going to use her body to her advantage. Your former Dad had clearly figured this all out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you were by yourself, still sucking on the candy, although you had kind of forgotten at this point. You were thinking about your body. To be honest, you were really good looking. Part of you wanted to show it off somehow, and you weren't going to do it sitting around. Still, how were you going to go about doing it? You slowly got up, wish still in your mouth. You felt like doing something, although you weren't sure what. You were really indecisive right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something ended up getting your mind off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \u201cUhm\u2026 Excuse me?\u201d A small voice squeaked from behind. The small, mouse-like voice immediately tugged you away from your thoughts. You looked behind you, from where the voice emanated from, and saw nothing. Nothing but a skinny, smooth pair of legs, standing there. You looked up to see, exactly, who was standing there. As your sight moved upwards, the person whom was there became clearer and clearer.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Above the bare knees was a small pair of boys\u2019 trunks, colored in shades of blacks and dark blues. Above the trunks was nothing but a completely dry plain white tee-shirt, which appeared to be rather loose fitting on this person. Finallym your vision moved up to behold a young face, a little boys\u2019 face. The boy donned a pair of blue eyes and, on his head was a head of short, blonde hair. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You lay there, on your towel, in fear. In fear of what would become of him. You just turned two kids into a married couple. The fate that beheld this boy was beyond you, but, whatever it would be, this life would not be on your hands, so, in that, you swallowed your wish, the hard-candy dragging down your throat as your struggled to swallow. Finally, it was gone. You weren\u2019t going to have anything done to this boy by your hand.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     The boy spoke again, shyly, looking from his feet to your eyes, back and forth. \u201cExcuse me? Miss?\u201d He asked again, squeaking.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You decided now was the time to snap put of it. You got to your feet, dusted yourself off and knelt down as to better communicate with the boy.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cYes?\u201d You asked, trying to impersonate the sweet tone of a mother to the best of your ability. You sure sounded convincing.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cUhm\u2026 Can you\u2026 Uhm\u2026\u201d The boy was clearly incredibly shy, much like you were at that age, up until middle school, actually. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYes? Can I what?\u201d You asked, keeping your mom-impersonation going.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cCan you help me find my Mama and Dad? I\u2026 I went to the bathroom, and, when I cam back\u2026 They were gone.\u201d He claimed, his voice shaking and trembling as if on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You gave a soft smile and put a hand on his little shoulder. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d You softly whispered. \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright. I promise, we\u2019ll find your parents.\u201d You smiled as you rose to your feet, his eyes following yours as you rose. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      The boy simply sniffled and smiled in return. \u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You extended your hand and he latched onto it, gently, still cautious as he was talking to a \u2018stranger.\u2019 And, just like that, the two of you went on your way.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cSo,\u201d you began, happily. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d You asked as you moved on.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cMe? I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m Nicholas. Nicholas Gibson. What\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You offered a beaming grin as he asked, looking to you. \u201cNatalie. Natalie Marie Wilson. But, you can just call me Nat. That\u2019s what friends call me. Would you mind if I just called you Nick?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. That\u2019s what my parents and friends call me.\u201d He said. The two of you laughed as you continued.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     The two of you walked along the beach, as guys continued to stare at your body. You felt the eyes upon you as you swayed to and from. A few occasional whistles your way sent your eyes rolling. \u201cJerks\u2026\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     The boy looked up to you as you walked along. \u201cWhy are those men whistling at you?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNo reason\u2026 They\u2019re just\u2026 Rude.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOh. I hate it when people are rude like that.\u201d The boy grimaced. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     This made you laugh. \u201cYeah, me too!\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Nick then shifted his vision to your other hand, where you held the bag of candies. He grinned widely.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cHey! Is that candy! Can I have one?\u201d He asked. This scared the living daylights out of you. You knew this would lead to no good.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cUgh\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d You stopped walking, scratching your head as he stood in front of you, a twinkle in his eyes. \u201cWow\u2026 He really wants one.\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cPlease, please, please, PLEASE?!?! I\u2019ll have just one! Just one!\u201d Nick whimpered.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      \u201cNo\u2026\u201d You thought to yourself. \u201cI can\u2019t. If I do, who knows what\u2019ll happen\u2026 But, he really wants one, and he\u2019s lost, and it\u2019s the least I can do, I guess.\u201d You continued in thought. \u201cBut, he doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re magic! He probably won\u2019t wish at all! Everything will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cOkay, Nick\u2026 Here you go.\u201d You sighed, reaching into your bag and handing him a piece of candy.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYay!\u201d He chirped, unwrapping it and placing it in his mouth faster than you\u2019d ever seen. He really likes candy.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d He started \u201cYou\u2019re really nice, and pretty too\u2026\u201d He said, looking you in the eyes.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cAww\u2026\u201d You blushed. \u201cThank you, Nick!\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYeah\u2026 I wish that we could hang out more often!\u201d He wished as he sucked on his candy. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Your eyes dilated in fear. Your heart stopped, your jaw dropped. Fear seemed to have consumed you whole.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOh no\u2026\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cAnyway\u2026\u201d He started. \u201cWe should keep looking for my parents\u2026\u201d He said, extending his hand, reaching for yours. Without a word, you grabbed his extended hand and walked along.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You weren't sure what to make of this. From what you could tell, these wishes could do anything, and Nick's wish was hardly specific. Wanting to hang out more often? That was as vague as you can get. It also didn't help that you could see Carrie approaching, another bright smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" She flashed at you, getting just a shrug from you. She looked down to see who was with you. \"Oh, and who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some brief introductions between the group, with Carrie welcoming Nick with a handshake. After a little bit, Carrie figured out that a wish had been used, so you had to explain what was going on. Nick obviously didn't have much a clue as to what the \"adults\" were saying, but Carrie was intrigued by what could happen. Still, she wasn't going to stick around. There was more fun to be made around the beach, so she quickly left, although she winked at Nick, knowing that he was going to perhaps be beautiful by the time this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was she?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of mine.\" You replied. You definitely didn't want to say anything about the wishes. Nick would hardly understand anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's quite pretty.\" You raised an eyebrow at those words. Didn't sound like something a little kid would say. You looked down at Nick, gasping as you did. Nick was suddenly sprouting up in height, probably surpassing 4 feet at this point. He was looking more like a 10 year old now. You put a hand right to your head; another child was becoming older because of these wishes. How in the world was this going to be explained to the parents? The parents of those kids you turned into a married couple must be wondering by now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat? What's wrong?\" asked Nick, putting a concerning hand on Nat. You appreciated the gesture, smiling back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing. How do you feel?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I feel great since you gave me that candy.\" smiled Nick. \"So, my parents shouldn't be too far. Let's go find them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nick held hands again, but this time it felt a little bit different. Nick wasn't quite as enthusiastic as before, acting a tiny bit more reserved than normal. Slowly, you saw him grow up more, going past 4'6 and getting even closer to your own height. However, what made you worry was not just that. Certain...parts of Nick were beginning to get a bit bigger, like his hips and butt over everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, he's becoming a woman too.\" You sighed again. Guess the candies loved this or something. It was a bit of a pain watching this over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat, are you okay? Are you coming down with something?\" To you, Nick almost sounded like a mother trying to talk to a kid. As ironic as it was, it was charming in a certain way. You looked down at Nick again. He was still at 4'6, looking more like a teen. However, he had no semblance of male puberty. His body was still hair-free, and you could see his waist staying relatively thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you wished you could get your mind off it, but you had no candy in your mouth so that was a moot point. Nick kept holding onto your hand, as if he thought you enjoyed it or something. It felt nice in a way, but you weren't sure if you really liked it that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Nick?\" You replied.</span></div></div>",

It seems I\u2019ve completely forgotten\u2026\u201d He sighed, looking up to you as his height raised up to 4\u20199\u201d. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     This caught you completely by surprise. You had no idea what to say, clearly, something was happening to Nick, probably what had happened to you, your Dad, those kids who you turned into a married couple\u2026 You provided an answer anyway.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     You tried your best to put on a soft smile. \u201cNick, we were looking for your parents, remember? Your mom and dad?\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Nick slightly cocked his head at you, confusedly. \u201cUhm\u2026 Natalie, I came here with just you and Carrie, wherever that woman is.\u201d He said blankly, as his hips and butt continued to mature. His legs also grew womanly fat about the thighs and calves, providing his legs with great shape and curvature. He looked to be a teenage\u2026 Girl? The bulge from his trunks shrank, with time, and his voice even seemed to be growing higher. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cUhm\u2026 Excuse me, Nick?\u201d You asked in a concerned tone, squatting down as to attempt to match his height. With that, Nick rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cYou can get back to your feet, Natalie. You don\u2019t have to be treating me like I\u2019m a child! You can stop holding my hand and patronizing me in general!\u201d Nick fumed.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOkay.\u201d You said, defeated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I guess\u2026\u201d You apologized, scratching the back of your head, releasing his hand from your grasp, which he immediately retracted to grasp his hip, in a womanly manner.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cThank you.\u201d He said plainly, his height jumping up to 5\u2019. His hips, butt, and legs gaining even more maturity. His hair began to elongate, reaching the lobes of his ears. All and all, he looked to be around 14, maybe 15. The color of the hair seemed peculiar to you, too, as now it appeared to be a mixture between blonde and brunette, almost a mustard-like color. \u201cEew\u2026\u201d You thought to yourself, grimacing at the sight of the change.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNow,\u201d he started again, his voice continuing to raise in pitch, his \u2018man-parts\u2019 continuing to fade. \u201cWe\u2019d better find\u2026 Carrie, yeah, I think it was her whom we were on the search for.\u201d He said, leading the way, as his trunks began to shrink, changing from the dark blue color to black, all at once. The shrinking trunks left more leg exposed, garnering the attention of males, much to your disgust. His shirt also faded to black as it, too, shrank, revealing more of his belly area.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cI guess\u2026\u201d You sighed, defeated, following his lead. \u201cOh, the irony\u2026 Now he\u2019s leading me to find my dad\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     The two of you continued scouting the beach, now, in search of Carrie. The idea of Nick\u2019s parents finding you, and Nick, first still scared the living daylight out of you. The parents would behold their son, and\u2026 Who knows how they\u2019d react. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      As you and Nick strolled the sands of the beach, Nick\u2019s increasingly feminine looks caught the attention of men all about the place. While amongst the strange things of this scenario was that men were ogling a young boy, what managed to \u2018take the cake,\u2019 so to speak, was that the young boy seemed to enjoy it, even tossing some of the suitors winks, generally, flaunting his body.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      Nick managed to catch you staring queerly at him. He turned your way, with a concerned look about him.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cNat?\u201d He asked, in a soft, motherly voice. Nick extended his hand and delicately grasped your shoulder. \u201cIs everything alright? You\u2019ve been acting a bit strange the whole time we\u2019ve been here. I\u2019m just concerned, is all.\u201d He said. You weren\u2019t quite sure of how to describe this, the touch he offered felt warm, nice, very comforting altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh...\" You got out of your mouth, in the lack of words. You stood still, speechless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know you can talk to me about anything, don't you?\" He spoke, compassionately, his voice continuing to raise in pitch, at the same time, maturing. His hair lengthened again, extending down slightly below the shoulders, the blonde hair continued to transition into a darker shade of brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You simply nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He definitely sounded like a woman, at this point. Traces of his boyhood, childhood were all fading from existence. The 'manhood' that should have been underneath his shrinking trunks was practically gone. Speaking of his clothes, his trunks were practically short shorts, and, his shirt was a few inches away from a bra. And, was something happening to his chest? The breast area began to swell and balloon in growth. He now stood at 5'3 tall. You shook it off as he, almost she, continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good!\" He chirped, as his legs continued to develop a womanly fat about the thighs and legs, continuing to become more defined and shapely. Little details made themselves known, too. The nails on his toes and now slender fingers had painted themselves in a dark shade of green, matching his now changing eye color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now, what's on your mind, sweetie?\" He inquired, his voice getting warmer, almost sultry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"He's talking to me like he's known me for awhile... A long while.\" You thought in the back of your head, weirded out to the highest degree. You weren't quite sure what came over you at that moment,  but, you thought back to earlier in the day, when you first met Nick. You recalled a problem you were facing, a dilemma, of sorts. Subconsciously, you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Actually...\" You shyly started, clasping your hands together in front of you, blushing a bit. \"I'm not sure how to put this... Uhm... I see women all around the beach, like Carrie, showing off their bodies and just, y'know, having fun. Look at me, I know I'm attractive, but, I'm just not sure how to show myself off, put myself out there. Does that make sense?\" You asked, genuine concern present in your speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Perfect sense.\" He smiled, his voice continuing to mature and distort into that of a woman. His height gave one final push to 5'6,\" where he managed to perfectly match your height. The hair on his head continued to drop down, this time, stopping at the shoulder blades. His eyes grew bigger and had fully changed into a darker shade of green, his eyelashes gracefully growing out to a modest length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You see...\" He continued, his voice continuing to transition. As he spoke, his lips puffed out to a perfect size, luscious in looks and glittering from the sunlight. His shirt, and trunks, finalized on becoming a black, smooth-looking bikini that looked to be made of a spandex-like material. His fair skin color darkened a few shades, becoming darker, but not to the point where it looked burnt by the violent sun. His dark brunette hair gave one final push as it settled at his mid-back. The bulge between his legs had faded altogether as, all at once, his, now her, breasts puffed out, appearing to be a pair of D-cup sized breasts. He appeared to be right around 30 years of age, slightly older than yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And, there she stood, the woman formerly a boy named Nick. As she stood,  smiling to Nat as if nothing had happened, her flawless hair and skin glistened and shone in the sun. She closed her eyes and ran her fingers through her proud mane of hair and smiled softly. As a few men passed her by, whom made no attempt to mask their ogling the new woman, she turned to them, opened her eyes and tossed them a wink, sending the men off into excitement. You noted her subtlety. \"You see, sometimes you just have to improvise.\" She advised to you, in her almost seductive new voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     If you were shocked before, you were paralyzed now. Just like that, Nick was gone, replaced by this bombshell of a woman, apparently another companion of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You make it look so easy!\" You chirped, unknowingly, almost as if she had always been like this. On the inside, though, you found yourself a bit envious of her, her beautiful figure, her shape, her breasts, everything she seemed to beat you in, and you were younger! \"What a show-off...\" You thought to yourself. Immediately, you shook it off. \"What was I just thinking???? I must be losing it...\" You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, Nick...\" You started, \"I guess we should find Carrie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Please, I'd much rather you call me Nicole, Nat.\" She said looking you in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, gang!\" A familiar female voice chirped from behind you and Nicole. Nicole grinned. \"Speak of the devil!\" She laughed, looking to Carrie who then approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Oh... Hi, Carrie!\" You smiled, looking her way as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, you guys!\" Carrie chirped, placing her hands behind her back, holding in a laugh, as if she was in on some sort of secret. Carrie looked to Nicole, then to you and gave a wink. She knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What've you been up to anyway, Carrie?\" Nicole asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, y'know, just the usual...\" She smiled, digging her toes in the sand below, coyly. \"I was just playing around in a volleyball game some group was having. There were a lot of guys, a lot of cute single guys!\" Carrie laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, really?\" Nicole asked, as if she was up to something. Nicole and Carrie looked to each other, offered each other a smile and, simultaneously, in perfect synchronization, looked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nicole began to speak. \"Hey, Nat...\" She smiled, again, as if hiding some sort of top secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Didn't you mention something about wanting to show off your body?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhm... Yes?\" You asked, not at all liking where this was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Carrie grinned, mischievously. \"Oh! Did you really say that?\" Carrie snickered. She then looked to Nicole and beamed from ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes, Carrie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Something strange was going on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Carrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I think so!\" Nicole peeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uh-oh,\" were the only words you got out before the two of them, Carrie and Nicole, grabbed you by your hands and dragged you off to your doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You gave a gulp and wondered where things went so wrong. You just closed your eyes and awaited the torturous acts these two surely had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And... We're here!\" Carrie exclaimed, clapping her hands in an excited fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You hesitantly opened your eyes and found that the three of you were at...<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your head kind of felt like it was going around in circles right now. First, your Dad was now a hot woman called Carrie. Secondly, you turned a couple of bratty kids into a married couple. Now, a lost little boy you met was now a motherly figure towards you. What the heck were you supposed to think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here we are.\" said Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to see the full game set up, and some people already playing. You could make out the married couple that you turned the kids into, and they blended in perfectly with the other adults. It was both weird and interesting to see how they went from building sand castles to beach volleyball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Melanie, good serve!\" called Carrie to the woman, apparently named Melanie. The lady smiled in return, after she just made a serve. Truth be told, it wasn't much of a match. The guys were too busy looking at the women in swimsuits to care all that much, which didn't surprise you one bit. After a while, they took a bit of a break, with Carrie talking with Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are things with Peter?\" Apparently that was the husband now. Melanie just gushed at the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. We'll be in town for today before he takes me out to dinner. He's such a gentleman.\" she smiled, which gave your stomach knots. This was supposed to be a little boy, yet she was a perfect adult right now. Nicole even went and talked with her for a bit, and the three ladies went and had a lovely chat. You weren't up to it however, so you just left to walk around a bit. It seemed like another game would start soon, but you weren't interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You heard a lady come up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen my son? His name is Nick.\" she said. That gave your stomach more knots. These were Nick's parents? How were you supposed to explain that their son was now older and certainly sexier than you were now. Simple, you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure. I'll keep an eye out if you'd like.\" you offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. My husband and I will be around this area if you hear anything.\" said the mother. You just smiled sadly as she left to go back to her husband. You just sighed. You had no idea how to handle this. You were so anxious right now that you didn't even notice yourself putting in another candy. You just wanted to feel better in some way. Any way to make the anxiety go away. Maybe if you actually had someone to talk to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had more company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you wished that, and the light went off in your head that you used a candy, you saw something off to the side, a bit behind the beach bar. You slowly walked over, wondering what it was. You gasped a bit when you saw. There were two kids there; one boy and a girl. Not ordinary ones though. No, this was Trevor and Nicole (not the other Nicole) who were your little siblings. Well, used to be anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Nicole, how did we get here?\" asked the 7-year old Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" said Nicole, who was only 5-years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you to do?</span></div></div>",

They weren't there when Carrie turned you into Natalie, so how could they? Still, you had to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, are you lost?\" You asked them, deciding not to try to convince them who you were. Besides, what reason did they have to believe you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Trevor bluntly. He was always like that; not really minding how he sounded to others. Kind of like other boys his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Natalie, and you both seem lost.\" you tried to say in a sweet voice as you put your hands on your knees and leaned down to their level. You weren't sure how to react with kids as an adult. Heck, you tried that with Nick, and look what became of him. Well, not much you could do about it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just appeared here. I don't know why.\" spoke Nicole, who seemed a bit scared. She was always that way too; naive, sweet, and easily confused. Your parents loved her dearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure, but perhaps we can help you find your parents. Do you have anyone you know here?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother Nate just vanished an hour ago. I wanted to ask him something, but he wasn't around. Then, Nicole and I just found ourselves here.\" said Trevor, not bad an explanation for a kid his age. You nodded, trying to show that you understood. You smiled and held your hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go and try to see if your brother and parents are here.\" Trevor eagerly took the hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, lady. I'm Trevor and this is Nicole by the way.\" You sadly smiled at that. Trevor was not subtle with his choice of words. It got him into trouble at times, and he got grounded for it a lot. He wasn't naturally mean, but he never understood his words fully. You sighed at those memories, as you still chewed around the candy you had from the previous wish. It was still there, waiting for another wish as you hadn't swallowed yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you walked with Trevor and Nicole away from the back of the car. You didn't think the bar was a good place for children. Who would? So, you tried luring them away from it. As you did, you ended up coming across Nick's old mother from before. She gave you a nice hello, so which you responded. Neither of you had found \"Nick\" yet, so that conversation didn't go anywhere. Trevor laughed a bit once the mother had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that lady? She was huge and all crying!\" You sighed again. There he goes with his language again. The kid needed to learn better language. Thank goodness that the mother didn't hear him. You didn't want to explain things to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor, that was not nice of you. What if she heard you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But really, she was really big!\" Apparently, Trevor didn't have much of a grasp on the word. The woman wasn't fat at all; she was normal for her age. Then again, Trevor thought that with their Mom too. He didn't mean anything, but he had yet to learn how rude it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you muttered to yourself. \"Perhaps you need to learn. I wish you could feel what it was like to be as \"big\" as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately slapped your hands on your mouth. Oh no! Not again!</span></div></div>",

You were clearly outside, but something was really off. You felt something beneath you, like......sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you exclaimed as you suddenly got up, seeing a bunch of sand beneath you.

You really didn't feel weird as in sick, but weird around your body. Something, you're not sure exactly what, felt wrong. You hugged your belly as if you were feeling ill in the stomach and moved along the beach. The feelings you feel could best be compared to the feeling a child has as they hit their growth spurt; Sore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Geez, Dad! What are you thinking?\" You moaned as you walked along. What you failed to notice was that between your arrival at the beach and now, you had shrunk down to 5'4\". Though, at this point, you felt too weird to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      After you unknowingly shrank to your new, final height of 5'4,\" that weird feeling alleviated. \"Phew!\" You sighed in relief, removing your arms from your belly. \"That's better!\" You exclaimed, feeling a little better. Something about your view was weird. Everything seemed... Taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Anyway, you brushed off the way everything seemed to be taller and walked along the beach, looking for any sign as to what your father had planned. Dad wouldn't just throw you here without some underlying motive. And, if you couldn't find why your Dad sent you here, you at least sought some form of life. At the moment it was just you in your solitude on this beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you casually moved along, you felt something in your hair, it felt like a bug, or something, was in there. You wiped down your hair as if to have rid of the bug, and just like that the feeling was gone and you continued. What you missed was that your hair had grown in length by 1 inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, in the distance, you could make out the shapes of people moving, and the sounds of chattering voices. You slightly sped up towards these voices and shapes in the horizon. Closer and closer you got until you knew for certain that you had reached civilization! You were now among the beach crowd. Families walked along the beach, children played about in the shallow depths of the shore, girls and women alike bask in the sun, while the men engage in sports and more physically demanding activities. All the while, more and more people join from the beach side hotels and resorts that line the beach access. All and all, it looks to be s pretty normal day at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Then, you realize, you are not appropriately dressed for the occasion! You look down to your self and notice your still in your shorts, socks, tee and bra! Clearly you are a male with breasts. The sight of you must have really scared someone out of their wits. You reached for your candies, but instantly realize, much to your dismay, that your Dad still has them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Then, the strangest thing happens. As a rather large group of teenage boys and girls passes you, not one of them handed you a strange look, if any look at all. They didn't even seem to notice your presence. You took note of this and cautiously moved on. You had to experiment to see if people noticed how out of place you looked. You decided that you had to blatantly gain someone's attention, otherwise you'd only find ignorance, much like the group of teens gave you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With that, you found a woman lying on a towel, basking in the sun, working on her tan, you assumed. She was front facing, and to her right and left were women whom you assumed were her friends, considering they looked to be about the same age, somewhere in their early 20s. You took a deep breath in and a deep breath out then, blatantly blocked the sun from all three women. You felt terrible, but realized that you had to do it, only to see how you were treated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to the trio of women. Clearly, they were infuriated. Peace had been disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The one on the left screeched first. \"Hey, Kid! You're blocking the sun!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The middle one spoke next. \"Yeah, you little pervert!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The right-most one came after. \"What are you just standing there for, get out of the way, you little prick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You didn't hesitate in getting out of their way. All that they say about a woman's scorn was true. But, more importantly, they treated you normally. Not one commented on your strange clothes, or the fact that you were clearly a teenage boy with breasts. You smiled at this. You fit in. Still, you needed to find out what you're Dad had up his sleeve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You decide you have to settle somewhere to ponder over all this. You see two options; Out, in the middle of the beach, among the sand, is an umbrella clung to the sand right by a maroon colored towel. There's no indication of an owner, so you consider resting there for a bit. Or, you notice a small out-door bar and restaurant that is relatively busy and bustling with people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You decide to...</span></div></div>",

As there was no one there, perhaps you could take a break there to clear your mind. Things had been hectic after all. Not just from your Dad's role in this, but from school and all of that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could rest. I hope no one shows up to claim the towel. That would be awkward.\" you spoke to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you walked over to the towel, smoothing it down a little bit more so it was straighter. With that done, you positioned yourself on the towel and leaned back, feeling the sun on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never figured the sun could be this hot.\" you said to yourself. \"Then again, it doesn't feel bad at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that you had no sunglasses was a bit of an inconvenience. What pair you had was still at home after all, and you couldn't wish for them to come to you. Still, laying back on the maroon towel felt....really nice. You allowed yourself to smile as you put your hands behind your head and just took in the sun. No one came and looked at you weirdly for your odd state of dress. Thankfully, your shirt was white, so it didn't make things hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Dad can wait for now. This is actually nice.\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even think about the fact that you were only 5'4 now. Still, that sun was doing wonders for your skin, unknowingly to you. While you weren't exactly tanning much, any blemishes and unwanted hair was started to fade away, leaving clear smooth skin in its place. Everywhere the sun touched did this to you, including your arms. Your legs, which were now a bit longer to compensate for your shorter height, looked long and smooth now. In addition, you felt another small itch on your hands behind your leg, although you didn't pay much mind to it. Your hair was still growing, another inch or so longer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, your eyes opened again, feeling pretty good about yourself despite how odd everything was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     You opened your eyes softer a few moments and something felt off. You couldn't quite put your finger on it, but something felt wrong. Surely, it wasn't the candies or your father, whom was doing only god knows what back at home. That, in fact, was the last thing on your mind. No, other things bothered you, at the moment. Then, it hit you. You looked down to yourself form where you lay. Your clothes were the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You began to rub your now incredibly smooth, but still clearly male, legs, all covered by your long mens shorts. \"I've really gotta show off what I've got...\" You sighed. \"I'm at the beach so I can show these things off! I should, right?\" You asked yourself. Then you looked to your chest. \"And, this shirt! These breasts! I myself wished for these breasts, and I got 'em! I should flaunt them. That's what people do at the beach, after all.\" Next, you looked to your feet and noticed your socks. \"And, what's with the socks?! I'm at the beach. Who the hell goes to the beach in their socks? Me, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You, in the back of your mind, knew exactly where you were going with all these complaints. You knew all too well the solution to these grievances which you seamlessly filed, one after the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Clothes!\" You exclaimed, as if you found some great truth in life. \"But, where do I even start? All these beach stores suck... They all sell the exact same thing, with different names. I don't even know where to begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Then, as if on your cue, your problems were answered as three teenage girls, around your age, passed by the place where you lay. Two were brunettes, and, in between these brunettes, was a blonde whom completed their trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Y'know,\" the brunette to the right of the blonde started. \"For a beach store, that place was pretty awesome!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The blonde nodded her head in agreement. \"Yeah!\" She chirped. \"Look at these bikinis of ours, they're pretty cute! Don'tcha think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The brunette to the left of the blonde then spoke. \"Hey, what was that place called anyway? I didn't catch the name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The blonde and the other brunette hesitated not in providing an answer. \"Waves!\" The two simultaneously responded. After the two answered the third, they walked out of your hearing range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well, that was convenient!\" You exclaimed getting up to your sock-dressed-feet. \"Waves was the name of the place! And those were some pretty cute girls, and their bikinis were pretty cool, also. If they had something for them, they must have something for me!\" You exclaimed with hope, walking towards the shopping district of the beach, off the beach, obviously. As you walked away, you hair grew yet another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After a little more than ten minutes of aimless searching and walking about, searching for this mystery shop. Then, you saw it, without warning of any kind. Right in front of you, you beheld a neon sign reading \"Waves,\" next to that, an open sign. Casually, you walked inside with a smile about your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you opened the door, you heard a bell ring, the kind of bell that rings to let a store owner know that someone has entered their facility. The place looked like a typical beach store, as you anticipated. Before you were a variety of surfboards and boogey-boards, all on display. About the store, manikins modeled the clothes the store had to offer. As you gazed about the stores offerings, from where you stood at the door, you saw a male head peek from the checkout desk. \"Hi! Welcome to Waves!\" He warmly welcomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hi...\" You sheepishly waved and replied in response. Out of instinct, you headed to where you knew you could find that which you sought; Clothes that emphasize the body. The section you made your way to? The women's swimwear section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked down to your clean shaven legs and were instantly reminded of your first grievance; Showing off your legs. You figured that the article of clothing that would best be suited for the purposes you had in mind would be... A bikini. Those perfectly showed off legs, and body alike. At the women's swimwear section, a seemingly infinite amount of options there awaited. Upon the walls, and about the floor, hangers and racks decorated the store, each holding a wide variety of bikinis, designed in all sorts of colors, for all shapes of women. You looked to your chest and then recalled the color of the bra you donned under you tee shirt; Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With that, you grabbed the first pair of black bikini panties you saw. Now that you held a solution to the 'leg dilemma,' you looked to your feet and were reminded of your other problem; The socks you wore. No other solution came to mind other than good ol sandals. Conveniently, right next to the swimwear section was the women's footwear section. There, on a rack upon the wall, was the sandal section. You reached for the first matching black pair of sandals you saw and, from there, made your way to the dressing rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After taking a moment or two in choosing a room, you wasted no time in getting to changing. All this was strange to you. You knew yourself pretty well, and you knew you weren't at all the type to shop. By not the shopping type, you meant as in the kind who'd be completely lost and totally helpless in any clothing store. It's why your mother hated taking you to the mall. And, for whatever reason, here you were shopping and trying on clothes as if you were a seasoned expert. Anyway, you shrugged all that off as your hair grew one more inch and continued changing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You began by removing your male shorts and boxers. You looked to yourself in the mirror. For whatever reason, the sight of your 'male components' bothered you. You proceeded to slip your feet into the panties and then, ever-so-gently, move them up your legs, then your thighs until they reached their spot at the edge of your hip area. As the panties gracefully glided over your legs, you failed to notice that your legs grew more shapely and curvaceous; Generally, more feminine. Muscle mass was lost and, especially at the thighs, replaced by attractive feminine mass. Not too much, but just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Next, you removed your socks from your feet, grabbed the black sandals, and slid them up your feet. As your sandals moved over your feet, they, too, lost their male qualities and became daintier, even gaining a certain curve about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked over your legs and smiled in content. \"Perfect! Just what I was looking for!\" You laughed as you began to remove your shirt. As you did so, your hips and torso also lost male qualities and developed a feminine curvy quality. Your arms, too, lost muscle and remained frail and girl-ish. You looked yourself over in contentment. \"Now this is what I'm talking about! This is what I'm at the beach for!\" You smiled, instinctively, and without thought, striking various poses and facial expressions. You now resembled a teenage girl, more than a teenage boy. Your body was nice, but, clearly it was young and had yet to experience maturity; Womanhood. The only thing that disrupted the appearance of a teen girl was the eruption of your 'male parts,' in the form of a bulge, coming from inside your panties. You grabbed your socks and shorts, slung them over your shoulder and began towards the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you approached the register, a smile about your face, you couldn't help but notice that the cashier guy was checking you out, blatantly so. He scanned you head to toe. All you could do was continue walking and blush in a certain flattering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah,\" you began. \"I'll just be taking the bottom half of the bikini and these sandals.\" You said gesturing to your body, indicating that you wore the products you've just mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Sure!\" He sheepishly responded, almost intimidated by beauty. \"I just... Ugh... Need to see the tags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Of course!\" You chirped in your still male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You then bent down as to reach for the aforementioned price tags. You gently ripped them off and handed them to the cashier, still smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Alright... Your total will be...\" He began, punching some keys on his register. \"... $6.74.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Okay!\" You complied, reaching into the back pocket of your shorts as to obtain the five dollars in your wallet. You rummaged through your other pockets to search for more money. This pocket, that pocket... Nothing. Every nook and cranny searched and all you had on you was five bucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You gave a disappointed frown. \"All I've got is a fiver. Never mind...\" You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Five bucks will do!\" He said, clearly trying to impress and pull out the charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Great, thanks!\"  You chirped in your higher voice. Yes, your voice went up the slightest bit higher and you noticed not. Now, you resembled more a pre-pubescent boy, almost a girl, rather than the teen boy you truly were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No problem, Ma'am!\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And... Here's your receipt, and a bag for the clothes you've got over your shoulder there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Thanks!\" You squeaked in your new, almost female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No problem, have a good day, Ma'am!\" He called as you walked out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, I finally got what I need to really show off this sweet body of mine!\" You said to yourself, still not noticing the voice. Then, something hit you. Something threw you off, the way that guy treated you. He accepted your five dollars without question... The way he stared at you. That's the way you've seen guys try to win over women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"And... Did he call me 'Ma'am?!?!'\" You questioned, greatly confused by the way that guy treated you. Well, no matter how much it confused you, you thought it best to put such things aside and continue with your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"So, I've got the clothes... Next... I'll...\" You thought, making a face as you thought of what you ought to do next.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps I can get myself something to drink afterwards.\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a reasonable plan, so you began walking back. Your hips started swaying back and forth as you walked across the beach, and you noticed that those particular areas were getting some looks from the guys. In addition to your hips, your butt had also filled up on its side, looking sexy in your bikini bottom. The C-cups on your chest were no slouch either, and you could swear that you got an envious look or two from some girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that's not a bad sign.\" you said to yourself. Then again, part of you said that you shouldn't worry. You've got a great body, so you should show it off. The thought made you smile, almost making you forget totally about your Dad. You seemed to be enjoying yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you got back to the towel, and saw that it was still empty. You smiled as you laid back down, deciding to use it at your leisure for a while. If someone was going to leave it around for this long, well their loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it feels so good.\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun felt nice on your smooth and curved body, as your hand gently landed on your flat belly. You were pretty lean now, and the thought of it sounded great to you. You even looked at your hands. They were daintier as well, with slightly longer nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't this be a little odd?\" you asked yourself. Should you be acting so.....girly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you thought that, a brief itch went through your head, and a light wind blew something into your eyes. You used your hands to brush it aside, grabbing it in the process. Your eyes turned to what it was. It was your brown hair, now flowing even longer, at least down to your shoulders now. For some reason, you got the feeling that it wasn't the end for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Longer hair?....Looks nice.\" you smiled, coming it back behind your ears in a very feminine way. Aside from your hair still growing, your face was still masculine, and you still had a slight male voice and \"manhood\" so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there for a bit, just watching the ocean and everyone else playing around......</span></div></div>",

Whatever comparisons were to be made, you and your new, curved-as-a-coke-bottle body, struggled to get comfy on the towel. You grimaced in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      In your discomfort, you looked to the ocean wave back and forth; The sounds the waves made as the swayed and crashed into each other was music to your ears. You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't know what it is... But... The ocean is just calling my name.\" You sighed under your breath, as your voice continued to escalate in pitch. The line between a boys voice and a girls voice was blurred. But, surely, it was leaning more towards the girls' side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to your towel and frowned.

This towel sucks anyway!\" You laughed, your voice finally settling to that of a teenage girl, despite the fact you still had 'manhood' and a man's face. As you laughed in your newly acquired voice, you walked towards the beckoning waters of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You grinned a wide grin, your perfect teeth shining from the sun's rays that beat down as you felt the wet sand and the water between your toes. As you walked deeper into the water, you giggled, your voice maturing as you did. Your laugh was that of an 18 year old girl. Adulthood lingered about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Now, the water reached your waist, your curvy waist that expanded and matured into the edge of adulthood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"This is great!\" You smiled, flipping your hair out of your face, to your back, as you did, your hair once again elongated a little more than inch, now, it went slightly below your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You stood, bathing in the salty water, in a certain satisfaction. \"This is probably far enough out...\" You justified the spot at which you currently stood. The water now reached halfway up your belly. You just stood there in your contentment. The mixture of the suns warmth and the oceans refreshing waves was a perfect combination. As the waves washed themselves all about you, your hair again extended, going below your shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Amazing!\" You laughed as your voice again matured, right at the sound of a 22 year old. You sounded a bit like your older cousins, whom were in their 20s. Along with your voice, your body also did its share of aging. You grew only two inches taller, your height settling once and for all at 5'6\". Your legs also matured, shaping and aging into a slender form with utmost grace and beauty. Your arms also grew a bit longer and slender, to match your newly reached age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You were hit by another wave, this time, the wave got you right on the face, halting your laughter right in its tracks. As you wiped the ocean water off of your face, changes there occurred, as well. Your young mans face grew notably softer, much more easy on the eyes. Your eyes became rounder, bigger, full of a feminine beauty. Even the lashes upon your eyes extended with a certain look about them, the look of true womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Your nose grew more petite, more button-like. Your lips swelled up and became fuller, more developed; Not necessarily pouty, but certainly you now had the lips any woman would envy. Your eye brows thinned and softened up in appearance. Your face now could be described only as perfect, the soft, warm face any man would kill for and any woman would seek in desperation. Perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Finally, all the ocean water was off your face. You remained completely oblivious to the changes that had made their way to your face, you just kept on giggling, with your still maturing voice. 24 years was your voice, as of now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The final wave of changes, and wave of water was now upon you. This time, one large wave that managed to consume your entire body covered you like a blanket, leaving you, for only the shortest of seconds, under its watery shade. Within this incredibly short time under the wave, all things fell into place. Your hair, for the last time, lengthened until it reached your mid-back, even the color of your hair grew to a softer shade of brown, versus the darker brown you possessed in your former physical form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your age, for the last time, shot up to the age of 26. Gone were the teenage days you had only recently come to know. Finally, your 'manhood,' and all of its components, vanished. Between your legs, a clit-like-structure formed from the nothingness there. In that newly formed structure, you had developed a fully functioning female reproductive system. The deed was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the wave passed, there you stood, laughing and smiling as if nothing had happened. Gone was the boy, present now was an adult woman, 26, totally comfortable in her own skin. You smiled, unknowing of any serious changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You giggled in your womanly voice and finally spoke. \"Wow!\" You chirped in your soft, gently, honey-like voice. \"I still don't know why Dad would send me here... But this is great! I have never, I mean, NEVER, enjoyed the beach like this!\" You laughed in your new feminine laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You stood still, in the water, beaming in delight. All seemed to be right with the world. Here you stood, in your seemingly perfect form, perfectly content. You looked about the beach and all the scenery it had to offer. Young boys and girls play in the water amongst themselves, as well as with their mothers and father. Young men play sports on the shore. Young women gathered in groups and basked in the sun or socialized among themselves. Couples, young and old, held each others hands as they graced the edge of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     All was perfect, all was right. The absolute last thing on your mind was your father, or the candies he had with him. All was right with the world and nothing, not even magical candies could change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nothing.</span></div></div>",

Any thoughts about your Dad and the fact that you were originally a teenage boy seemed far from your mind. You just felt so good right now, and you seemed to have this air of confidence now. It was a nice feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that towel seems to have served its purpose. Maybe it's time I walked around.\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared the towel, something caught your eye that wasn't there before. Something small and black was there, but you could tell what it was as you got closer. It appeared to be a black purse, pretty typical for a woman just beginning her career, whatever that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that mine too?\" you asked yourself, not too sure. Still, who would just leave it here? You decided to take the same approach as you did with the towel, and picked the purse up, putting the straps around your shoulder. It felt like something you should have. As you took a peak inside, very little was in there, other than a little cash money and a card or two. However, there was a driver's license, and it had a name: Natalie Marie Wilson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that name.\" you smiled as you closed the purse up. Odd to see a purse so empty, but you didn't care. You decided to finally get something to drink, as you felt really thirsty. You walked down a short distance towards a shack, where you asked for some nice juice, paying for it with the cash in the purse. You sighed in relief as you enjoyed it, feeling a new men's eyes on you. You could even feel it as you walked away, your hips and butt swaying behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd. My head feels a little strange, but it doesn't feel too bad. I still remember....Dad.....He did this to me, but I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt a bit conflicting, as you knew you were Nate beforehand. However, something else seemed to be coming into your brain alongside your \"Nate\" memories and personality, but you weren't sure what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as if it couldn't get any weirder.\" you said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, right as you said that, as you walked around a less-crowded area, you saw a tiny bit of light in front of you, kind of similar to what happened when you got transported here thanks to the candies. You made that connection in your head, your eyes widening in worry as a small form appeared before you, wearing a pink \"Hello Kitty\" shirt, yellow shorts, and just a pair of socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     You stood completely still, utterly shocked; in a manner very much like a statue. You could feel the surprised expression about your face, as your face reddened. You looked to your youngest sister, Nicole, clad in her not-beach-suited clothing. If you had to describe the expression about her face, it'd be <i>horrified</i>. You knew your sister, and you knew her well. She was on the verge of tears, you could clearly see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But, at this point, your mind was in a jumble, a conflict. No doubt, you recognized the girl before you as your sister. How could you forget your own sibling? But, also occurring in your mind, you saw her as... Someone else, someone of a completely different identity, you just weren't sure who. You felt like this body you were in had a mind all its own. However, rather than this newfound mind taking over, it simply co-operated with the personality of your former self. \"That would explain a lot... Like, why I suddenly enjoy being checked out by men, but, still remember things like my Dad and how he did this to me...\" You stopped right there, you knew you had to tend to Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You put your soft hands to your knees and squatted down, as to match her height. Nicole, in her apprehension, took a step back, as if ready to flee, she looked into your eyes and you beheld a terrified little girl. On one half of your mind, you were a bit hurt that she'd look to her own brother's eyes in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nicole?\" you asked your sister. \"What are you doing here? How'd you even get here? Nicole?\" You inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She wasted no time in speaking up. \"How do you know my name? Who are you? Do you know my brother, or my mommy and daddy?\" She asked, a single tear drop rolling down her cheek. Nicole had a point. There was no way she'd recognize you as her brother, considering the body you occupied. Telling her that you're her brother was certainly out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sweetie,\" you instinctively began, in a soft, motherly voice \"... I promise, I won't hurt you.\" You relaxed her, softly putting a hand to her shoulder. She seemed to calm down a bit, sniffling a bit as she stepped forward, preparing to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You seem nice...\" Nicole softy said, looking down at her feet. \"What's your name?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nat-\" You were about top say 'Nate,' but managed to catch yourself. \"I'm Natalie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That's a pretty name...\" She complimented. Unknowingly, you blushed with the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You pulled your longer, lighter hair behind your ears before proceeding. \"So, will you please tell me how you got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well... It all started at my house. I was walking around, looking for my big brother, Nate, it was his birthday today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Unknowingly, you asked, \"Really? How old is your brother turning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"15!\" She chirped. \"He's old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You simply giggled as she continued. \"Anyway, I went to my Daddy and asked him where he was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What did your daddy say?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nothing. He just, put a piece of candy in his mouth, looked at me, and said 'I wish you would join your brother!' And, all of a sudden, I was here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You took a sigh. \"Of course it was Dad...\" You echoed in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well...\" You sighed, scratching the back of your head. \"I've got an idea!\" You exclaimed, getting up to your feet. \"Why don't you and me go and walk around here and look for your brother? He has to be here, somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah! I think I like that idea!\" She exclaimed, with hope in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to her confusedly. You could have sworn that you saw Nicole bounce in height two or three inches. Her hair also seemed to elongate about another two inches, as well. You didn't feel good about this, you knew Dad was behind all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come on, let's go!\" You warmly urged, extending a hand to Nicole's. You may have been in a different body, a woman's body, but she was still your sister. And you know that your sister, in these larger, more open areas, like the beach, she liked to have a hand to hold as not to get lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Nicole looked to your hand as if insulted. \"Uhm... I like that you're helping me and all, lady, but I don't need to hold anyone's hand.\" She snapped, walking ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That was odd... Nicole always needs a hand to hold, otherwise, she'll surely be left horrified! Plus, the way she spoke to me... I know that five year olds don't speak like that... Something doesn't seem right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You followed after Nicole, not quite sure of what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, Nicole...\" You began. \"Where should we start to look? Any ideas as to where your brother would be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nicole put a finger to her chin as she grew taller still, another inch. Nicole was in thought, a deep thought. This was also an odd sight to you. Whenever the Nicole that you knew was in thought, she would always stop, sit down, and suck her thumb, lightly. Finally, her face brightened with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yeah, I think I might know where he is...\" She smiled, laughing a little. You noted this, the language she used was further changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Where?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Nate would be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...somewhere on the beach, looking for girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to see what was happening to her. She was a little under 4 feet to start, but now she was clearly at least 4'1 tall. Not to mention, the way she talked, it was far from the usual way she spoke. It was almost like how a teenager would talk, which was weird given her appearance. Based on her height, you would think she was about 10 years old or so, and her \"Hello Kitty\" t-shirt was showing her belly button to the world. Her shorts seemed a bit tighter, not really covering much of her legs at all. Her feet were bare, as she was obviously inside whenever she was wished here. In addition, her hair was originally pretty short, around ear-length or so, but now it was beginning to reach her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You asked her. You wanted to be sure you were hearing right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate would definitely be checking out girls on the beach. I mean, what kind of guy would he be if he didn't?\" Nicole just smiled, as if it was so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I guess that's true.\" You really didn't know what to say. This little sister of yours was beginning to speak like a teenager, and you weren't sure about that. Was your Dad making changes to her like you? What was Nicole becoming? You honestly felt like saying something, and yet, something in you wanted to calm down and keep going normally. You valued Nicole like a sister, although something strange seemed to be going on. Nicole was your sister....right? Oh, this was so confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go!\" Nicole started going forward towards the main area of the beach, away from the secluded spot you both were before. For now, you felt like going along with Nicole, searching for her \"brother\" along the girl-filled beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you got any ideas where your brother might be?\" You asked Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stopped and turned to you again, still smiling. You held your gasp as you slowly saw her grow more, close to 4'3 so far, almost like a 12-year old. Her hair was barely touching her shoulders now, and her face was losing baby fat quickly. Her shirt and shorts were even more tight, although she didn't seem to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably around the ones with big boobs. Seriously, any guy would go for boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't keep your mouth from dropping now. What in the world did she just say? As shocked as you were though, your lips turned into a smile, and an answer came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that.\" You put your hands on your mouth, although they didn't stay there. Part of you thought that it didn't sound that bad. Heck, you had a nice rack and butt yourself. What guy wouldn't like them? This was getting a bit weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Well enough standing around, I should start looking.\" said Nicole as she started scratching her chest. Her \"Hello Kitty\" shirt was really tight, to the point where her sleeves were barely covering her arms, and the hem was barely covering the itchy part of her chest. To your surprise, you saw parts of her shirt and shorts beginning to gain spots of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole started running along the beach, looking for \"Nate\", while you followed behind. You weren't sure what you were doing, although you started to enjoy just being around Nicole. She was a valuable friend of course....Wait, what? Nicole was a friend? Of course, you had known her for so long, even though she was older than you. You shook your head after that. Where did that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, where is he?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your attention back to Nicole, jaw dropping again. She sprouted up more in height, reaching 4'6 and looking like a 17-year old. Her hips and ass were beginning stretch her shorts, which were turning more red by the minute. Her t-shirt was barely holding on, almost as red. Her hair was now a bit past her shoulders, looking more silky and smooth. Her baby fat was mostly gone, showing real womanly beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she now?\" You asked yourself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     You watched with mixed feelings as Nicole continued her search about the beach, going from group of guys to group of guys searching for this \"Nate,\" person, whoever he was. \"Wait, what's going on? Why would I think that? That's me... But... I'm... Natalie, now... I WAS Nate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked to the ever maturing Nicole in a certain sense of surprise. It seemed like, the longer this search went on, the more motivation and morale Nicole lost to finding \"Nate.\" The sense of urgency Nicole had at the beginning of searching for this guy was gone. Instead, Nicole seemed much more lax as she searched on. But, at this point, Nicole seemed to be 'browsing' the guys at the beaching rather than 'searching.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, Nicole, with the sways of her widening, and maturing, hips, walked up to you, seemingly done with her little search. At this point, the changes you saw in her hardly bothered you. If anything, the elongating of her shining, brunette hair almost to her mid-back was familiar, though, you still couldn't exactly recall how this was familiar. \"Weird...\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nicole shot up some more in height, you estimated, more or less, she was about 4'10\". The features about her had matured, no doubt. The aforementioned baby fat was completely gone, replaced by that matured, womanly fat, especially about the legs. You were always so jealous of Nicole, for that reason, all this, and she still looked to be about 22. Anyway, regardless of your envy of your friends... No... Sisters...? Anyway, despite your subtle envy of Nicole's looks, she spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, Nat? I think I've had my fun here... I actually forgot what I was doing out there, all that running around, in the first place. Do you have any idea?\" Nicole inquired, her age shooting up to 24 right along with her height, right to 5'2\". Her hair finalized at the mid-back as it stretched there, leaving a mane any woman would take pride in, and any guy would love to have in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Actually, Nikki... I also have no idea what you've been doing... As weird as that sounds.\" You shrugged, scratching the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well... That's weird. Come to think of it... I can't remember any of the last few hours for some reason... Everything is a blur!\" Nicole stated, her voice becoming more honey-like and sultry by the second. \"Well, whatever the reason, I could use a beverage. But, I have no money...\" Nicole looked to you as her age continued progressing to 27, older than you, her height extending to 5'5\". As she spoke, her lips became fuller and her clothes continued contorting. The shorts she once donned had a certain bikini shape about them, and now looked more like bikini bottoms than shorts... Even the material from which the shorts were made had now looked more like a red, almost maroon, nylon. Same for the shirt, which lost the cotton-like texture about it, and almost looked to be a bikini top, but, still, it looked more like a really small shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Hello? Nat? Earth to Nat? You there, girl?\" Nicole waved and snapped in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What?\" You asked, confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nat? I was just saying how I don't have any money and really want a drink!\" Nicole reiterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And...? I don't have any cash either...\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"That's not what I'm talking about! Look at all those guys at the bar!\" Nicole then proceeded to grab you by the shoulders and turn you to face the bar she spoke of. It was true. Earlier, when you yourself sat there, the place was empty. Now, it was completely infested by men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nat, look at us. We're pretty dang gorgeous! And you know guys'll do anything, <i>anything</i>,\" Nicole emphasized, \"... To get with women like us. Even buy us a few drinks!\" Nicole chirped, her new, more mature, womanly voice, still made a part of you cringe. But... then again, why would you cringe, she's always had one hell of a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh! I get it! Sounds fun!\" You smiled, without even recognizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Geez, Nat, I thought you were the smart one! Let's go!\" She laughed, swaying her hips and walking, slowly, towards the little shack ahead,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Whoa...\" You thought to yourself... \"That was weird... Since when did my own sister start calling me Nat... And since when did I start calling her Nikki... Sister? We're not related... I... I guess we're as close as sisters... But... Those names... Oh, yeah! We gave each other those nicknames when we first started hanging out in High School! Good times. We met when she tried to flirt her way out of a failing grade with a guy teacher. She bombed that thing! Good times!\" You smiled, walking towards the bar. \"Wait... What was I just...? Never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     By the time you walked in, Nicole was beginning to work her 'magic' with some guy, who looked to be a little older than you, around Nicole's age... You rolled your eyes and laughed. \"Typical.\" You sighed, contently as you took a seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Nicole crossed her legs, really close to this guy, to the point where her legs were rubbing this guy about, clearly an attempt to make contact. Nicole coughed a few times. As she coughed, her bikini completed itself as the sleeves of her former shirt faded all together. The collar once there dipped down to her cleavage in a V-neck shape. She now donned a beautiful, maroon colored bikini that very well complimented her fair, if only slightly tanned, skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nicole finally managed to get the guy's attention. He turned to her and the two smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey,\" Nicole smiled as her age and height rose again, her age finalizing at 30, her height, 5'7\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey.\" The guy smiled as he scanned Nicole from her head to her toes. He was interested, clearly. Even you could tell. As he checked her out, features finalized. Her arms and legs became even more slender and shapely, defined in maturity. Fingers and toes slender. Lips were full and kissable. Her eyes were certainly bigger. Even her breasts enlarged, inflating like balloons all the way to a mild D-cup, leaving your modest C-cups in the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hi, I'm Nicole... Nicole Williams... What's your name, cutie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The guy blushed a little. You found him totally cute as you watched him fall for Nicole. Alas, he'd only be in for disappointment, seeing as Nicole was a total flirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhm... They call me, Michael, Michael Hayes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, Michael, mind buying me a drink? I'm all out of cash, and this girl would really appreciate it.\" She said, leaning in on him as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Ugh... Sure! Yeah, sure! What do you want?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Just whatever you're having, and, make it to go, why don't you and I walk a little, my friend here can take care of herself...\" Nicole then turned to you, looking at you with a smile, winking. \"Sorry, Nat! You can take care of yourself, can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You smiled, giving a small giggle as you did. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Michael paid for Nicole's beverage, got up from his seat, and took her by her hand. \"Shall we?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ooh! A gentleman!\" Nicole laughed, blushing, taking his hand and walking off, farther and farther from Natalie's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh, Nikki... You've always been one hell of a flirt.\" You walked in the opposite direction, back to the towel where you lay, the place where this all started. You sat there, laying down, looking at your legs, wiggling your toes, clearly bored. You looked back to the direction in which Nicole and Michael had gone off to. They were long gone, out of sight. As you realized Nicole was gone, you felt like something was missing, off. Like someone, more than a friend, almost a sister, had fled. Something was definitely wrong, you couldn't quite put your little finger on it. But, whatever it was, you knew your dearest friend... Best friend, Nicole Williams, would return, eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You took a sigh of contentment, smiled, and rose to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What to do now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things had done so topsy-turvy here at the beach. You were now a mature and hot woman. Your friend was older than you and running off with a man to do who knows what by now. And yet, there was still contentment, as if this was nothing new. Nicole was always like that. You laughed a bit at how you would see her act around guys since High School. She had tried giving you tips even, although it kind of contrasted with your personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, perhaps it's time to leave for now. I think we've all enjoyed ourselves here.\" You giggled a bit as you got up, grabbing the towel as you did. No one came to claim it, so you naturally began to think of it as your own. No one would likely miss it after all. You folded the towel in your arms in to a neat square, tucking it underneath your arms. Looking up at the sky, you could tell that it was probably around mid-day right now, so you had been here for a good amount of time. Of course, the next time you saw Nicole, she'd probably want to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to yourself as you thought that, you began walking past the beach, getting a few more looks here and there as you did. Your hand slightly adjusted your bikini subconsciously. You had some good C-cups, while paled compared to Nicole's \"melons\", which she would sometimes call them. To think that she was once an innocent child. Now she was definitely a woman who knew her body. Then again, you did to, as you noticed a couple of other guys looking. Still, you were done for the day here, so it was time to leave. Anyway, you walked a bit of a ways out, heading back into the building next to the beach, which housed locker rooms to change in and out. Without hesitation, you entered the Women's locker. There weren't any people in there right now, so it gave you some privacy as you just walked towards a locker, pulling out a sports bag. At the same time, the bag was both familiar and unfamiliar, but you knew it was yours anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got yourself a little stall and stripped off your newly purchased bikini, letting your breasts hang for a bit. You actually looked at them for a second. This was the first time you had seen them naked since becoming a full woman. And wow, it felt really nice. They went along well with your nice and bigger butt, especially as you took your bottoms off. Admiring aside though, you opened the bag up, revealing a set of clothes with some footwear. The clothes consisted of a nice sky blue sundress, and some nice sandals for daily use. You immediately thought they were cute as you put a clean bra on and the rest of the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you liked how nice the dress felt. It flowed around your legs nicely, and felt nice when it showed a bit of cleavage. You also found a purse, which was expected, and slung it over your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou packed the bag up with your wet clothes and walked out of the locker building, heading towards a nice Dodge Charger, your own car. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     The radio of your car softly played some pop song, that, under normal circumstances, you know you'd never listen to. The teenage boy mind you once possessed would never allow you to keep this wretched song from continuing! But, as the wind coming into your car from your rolled down windows made your cotton dress flow about your soft, smooth legs, you knew these were far from normal circumstances. You even found yourself humming along, cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sounding better and better by the minute!\" You laughed, continuing to press your foot against the gas pedal, raising the volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Still, in the midst of this newfound sense of freedom, joy, something felt off. You looked in the rearview mirror and saw the beach, getting smaller and smaller as you rode on. Finally, all together, the beach was gone from your sight. You looked ahead, still feeling as if you've just left something more than your crazy ol' friend, Nicole, behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nowhere to go but forward, I guess.\" You sighed, as you pressed the break at the red light you beheld. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But...\" You thought again, \"...Where is 'ahead?'\" This was all a mystery to you. How were you to know where to go from here? The uncertainty was unbearable. You had no idea who you were, other than your name and the high-school you attended. Other than those things, and a single friend, your origins were a mystery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where do I live? Who's my family? Who am I?\" You asked yourself aloud, the questions running through your panicked mind like a fever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You had to kill time and find answers, this much was certain. \"But, still, where to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you sat at yet another red light, you leaned against the window, woman or boy, the treacherous red light felt like an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... Still would've rather driven for the first time as a boy...\" You sighed. Speaking of which, you had never driven before! You got behind the wheel once, when you were 13 or 14, but, that lasted only a few seconds. The car wasn't on either, you were only looking to gain a feel for it, for when you'd be blessed with the sweet, sweet coming of age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked down to your dress. \"Is this the only article of clothing I have? I can't just keep wearing this. It's nice and all...\" You said, rubbing the dress on your thigh as you drove on. \"... But, I can't keep using this one dress for everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your eyes widened. \"Idea!\" You sang, in your high-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I should hit the mall! Clothes, food. Maybe I'll even find answers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You had no idea why, of all places, the mall was your first thought. But, it was the closest thing to an idea you'd had since the beach. So, why not? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ahh!\" You peeped, smiling. \"Right on cue!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There, on the horizon, awaited your destination. None other than the Grant Memorial Mall, the entertainment hub of your town. A ton of places to eat, a movie theatre, ice rink, tons of stores, and, for some reason, one thing that caught your attention were all the really nice clothing stores; The works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you pulled up to the mall, it was the usual, busy day here at the mall. All that beheld you was a sea of cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dang!\" You exclaimed. \"Where am I supposed to park now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As if your prayers had been answered, you looked out your window, to your left, ahead of you; A single, lone parking space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Life is good!\" You smiled, pulling your car in.</span></div></div>",

Must have been sheer luck, but that wouldn't stop you. You slowly came to a stop, parking the car and turning it off. You got your keys out and stepped out, putting your sandaled feet on the concrete. It was nice to see somewhere other than the beach, making you smile. Perhaps you could have some fun here, and maybe even some lunch. The wind whipped around you, playing with your skirt a bit, which made you hold it down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly wind.\" You said with almost a ditzy voice. It was more you just joking around though. You felt really free right now, kind of like how the skirt allowed your legs more freedom than those old jeans. There was a weird thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the mall was your destination, so you began walking there immediately. There weren't many people in the parking lot itself, leaving you to believe that everyone was likely in the mall. At least it gave you some quiet time to yourself, in contrast to that noisy beach. Still, your thoughts centered on the things that had happened. You were no longer some scrawny teenager who didn't know how to drive yet. No, you were a nice woman who....actually you had idea what you were doing. What kind of person were you now? You didn't know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the weird effects with Nicole, or Nikki or whoever. Was she always so forward with people? You had an image of her being sweet and innocent, but not so much now. Really, really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it could get much weirder.\" You said to yourself as you approached the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt as if there was a small flash of light to your right side, although you mistook it for a flash of light from a windshield. You didn't pay it much attention, if any at all. However, what definitely got your attention was the feeling of something running into your leg, almost knocking you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Both you and whatever ran into you yelled. You turned down after checking your leg, seeing a little boy there. He appeared around 7 years old, and didn't look like someone who would be outside right now. He was wearing socks as if he was just inside a minute ago, and his shirt was something you'd expect from a boy his age, along with tiny shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a name suddenly came to you, making you remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor! What are you doing here?\" You asked the boy. Trevor looked at you oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey lady, how do you know me? And where am I?\" Trevor's vocabulary was a little more developed than Nicole's was at that age, and he could use it well, even though he certainly wasn't versed in the words of teens and adults. Still, you wanted to ask how he got here. Was this Dad's work again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well I don't know. I just saw my Dad a minute ago, and I just appeared here. And it's kind of cold.\" He shivered a bit from the wind. This was certainly no place for a kid right now, especially so ill-prepared for outside weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, come with me.\" With that, you rushed him inside the mall, getting you both out of the wind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"It's getting really cold out here!\" Trevor whined as you hurriedly dragged him by the hand, at the same time, you held your dress down as to avoid... Exposure of what was under your dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Don't worry, Trevor!\" You assured, looking your younger brother in his eyes. \"We're almost there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, as you were barreling towards the door, a man saw you coming and held the door open. \"Thanks!\" You said, passing him, leaving him in the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Alas, both you and Trevor were inside the mall, in this case, some cheap department store. The place wreaked of a plethora of scents and fragrances, filled with the chatter of passers by and that monotonous elevator music could be heard in the background. You were short of breath, what from the rush. You had to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Whoo!\" You tiredly cried. \"Trevor...\" You breathed. \"How are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm great now! It's nice and warm in here!\" He proceeded to take the seat next to you, his feet far from the ground. His stomach immediately let out a violent growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uh oh...\" He sighed, holding his belly. You looked to him, giggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uh-oh indeed!\" You laughed. \"I take it you're hungry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You want to get something to eat with me?\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure! Thanks, Lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Please, you can call me Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright, Natalie!\" He exclaimed. You then extended your hand, which he grabbed tightly as the two of you headed for the food court. Fortunately for the two of you, the food court was the farthest thing from a long walk, right outside the store you two were at, actually. Because you knew your brother so well, you knew to head to the pizza joint across from the Burger King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The line, as per usual, was pretty lengthy, and, the feeling of men staring at you and whistling to you as they walked along didn't help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"In front of my little brother...\" You thought to yourself. \"Jerks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looks like you two had time to kill, given the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So...\" You began. \"You never really finished telling me how you got here? You said something about your Dad and a wish he made, or something?\" You inquired, bending down a bit as to match his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Before he could even answer, you shot him a peculiar look. Right before your eyes, his height had increased just the slightest bit, from his normal 4'2\" to about 4'4.\" A couple of inches. The dark brown hair on his head also grew a shade lighter as it, too, elongated a couple of inches. His legs and arms also developed a bit more. But, despite the changes, he answered as if nothing happened. Now, he looked to be around... 8 or 9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, it was weird!\" He exclaimed. \"First, I walked into his office, and, I saw him sitting on his chair, holding this jar of candies really close to him. He was mumbling something about my older brother, Nate and my little sister, Nicole. I was going to ask him where they were, 'cause, I hadn't seen them all day. He didn't even answer! The moment he saw me, POOF! I was here, with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yeah, that does sound... Weird.\" You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah...\" He agreed, his height growing to 4'6,\" his body changing around to be proportionate. His hair, too, lightened in color, now resembling a light brown, and lengthened another couple of inches. He looked to be about 10 years old. But, something about his frame... It didn't look like a boy's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You closed your eyes in disbelief, taking a deep breath in and out as you did so. \"Not Trevor, too!\"  But, you kept this to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But, I'm glad he did...\" He said, looking into your eyes, his voice not deepening, but, keeping that higher pitch it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come again?\" You asked. You were utterly shocked. Glad? He didn't even know who you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I said I'm glad he did! I've always enjoyed spending any extra time I had with you, Natalie!\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh...\" Speechless. You stood there speechless until your attention was caught. And, was it just you, or were Trevor's speaking skills becoming really, really good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Next!\" The man at the register of the pizza place called to you and Trevor. \"The line's already passed?\" You thought. \"I guess time does fly when you're having fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yay!\" Trevor laughed. \"Come on, we're finally up!\" he then rushed over to order. You followed along, not as rushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, what'll you two ladies be having today?\" The man inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"DID HE SAY 'LADIES?'\" You panicked, in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah! Natalie, you're up first!\" Trevor looked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... I'll just have a salad. Just a regular Caesar Salad with a water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Trevor chimed in. \"Yeah, I'll have the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Trevor hated salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright... Your total will be... 10$ flat.\" The man sighed, hitting various keys on his register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Okay...\" You said, reaching into your purse, pulling out a 20$ bill, handing it to the man, your mind, still a jumble. Something was... Off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The man wasted no time in handing you your change, a receipt and your order. Silently, you handed Trevor's salad to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, finally! I'm starved!\" Trevor chirped, very much in a feminine manner, as he contently walked over to an empty table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What is going on...?\" You followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Trevor possibly becoming a woman too? You couldn't really say anything about it. Who would believe you? Besides, your Dad had your candies, so you could really do nothing but wait it out. But what kind of woman could little Trevor become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie, over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Trevor call you over, and you slowly began walking to him. He looked so weird in his tight clothes and socks, which somehow stayed on. Apparently, no one else found it weird to see a boy like him. His shirt was beginning to show a little waist, including his bellybutton. His shorts looked pretty tight, especially with those tiny female curves coming in. His socks were especially tight on those growing feet. Still, you sat down opposite on him and gave him his own salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you hated salad.\" Trevor raised an eyebrow. As he did, you almost gasped as you saw him sprout up a couple more inches, going up to 4'10. He almost looked 11 or 12 years old right now. Just how far would it go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I've always liked it.\" He reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you said to yourself. Was he becoming some kind of model? Who else would say that? Still, there seemed to be a certain shyness to Trevor's words, making him blush a bit. Somehow, it was both cute and attractive. You also noticed as he ate that his hair continued to lengthen, becoming a bit lighter as it reached his shoulders. It now was getting a lovely sheen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, your hair looks very nice.\" You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Thank you.\" blushed Trevor. \"I've tried to look more like you. A lot of people don't think I'm anything like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're better than that. You know that.\" You replied. Trevor beamed a smile at you as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation seemed a bit better after that. Trevor made occasional comments about random things, while you mostly smiled and nodded. It seemed nice to have a pleasant conversation like this. The old Trevor was too hyper to stay still for anything, but now he seemed a bit more mellow with his emotions. It wasn't a bad thing, although it was still weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I get to see you more often since we moved closer to you.\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ended up asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember? My family used to live further away, but we moved closer in. Frankly, I think it was a nice change.\" smiled Trevor cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really now how to respond to that. Was that another change in reality?</span></div></div>",

He wiped his face with a napkin before he grabbed all the trash from the table, placed it on a tray and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That sure was good.\" He laughed, walking towards a trashcan. \"Just like old times, huh?\" He looked to you, walking away from the food court, you followed his lead, he seemed to have more of a clue than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What? Old times?\" You asked. You didn't know what to say other than that. You were completely stumped, clueless. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow, are you alright there, cousin Natalie?\" Trevor looked to you confused, as his height hopped up to a solid 5' tall. His hair gave one last push as it grew a few inches past his shoulders, leaving his hair a pleasant shade of brunette versus the darker brown hair once his own. His legs also looked abnormally shapely and curved, for a boy his age. Clearly, he wasn't a child anymore, he was maturing, but not into a man... Those legs were way too soft looking. The stares that teen boys gave Trevor's legs scared you, but noting could drill fear into you more than the fading bulge between his legs. Trevor looked to be a 13 year old... Well, you weren't quite sure of a 13 year old 'what,' he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhm... What?\" You inquired again, regaining your focus. \"And, did he just call me 'Cousin?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Trevor looked lost. \"I was asking if you're alright. So... Are you? You've been acting... Not yourself the whole time. You didn't even remember what I was talking about when I said 'Just like old times.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I still don't know what you're talking about!\" You argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Now Trevor looked stunned. \"Come with me...\" He sighed, gesturing for you to follow his lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Curiously, you followed right behind. As you looked ahead of you, where Trevor was walking, you noticed his hips, but and legs were definitely more defined. Boys' hips did not sway like that. That had to be a girls' butt on him, too... \"Strange...\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Much to your surprise, Trevor led you not to the toy store of his choice, but, rather, a locally owned bookshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Books?!\" You thought to yourself. \"Books are the last thing that'd be on Trevor's mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But, whether it was Trevor in that body or not, he walked right in. You were in pursuit. As you walked in, Trevor seemed to know his way around, well. Like he'd been here all the time. Even the staff seemed to know him, greeting him by a foreign name, completely new to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, Claire!\" A man at the register called, waving Trevor's way. \"Weird...\" You thought, looking at the man as if he were crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hi, Mr. Schriver!\" Trevor responded, joyously. \"Weirder... Why would Trevor respond to 'Claire?'\" Well, whatever was happening, you thought it best to move right along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhm... Claire? Why would you respond to Claire, Trevor?\" You asked, as Trevor stopped to examine some books, his height picking up to 5'2,\" as his chest expanded to small bumps, what you were sure would, in no time, be breasts. You looked to his crotch, and, nothing was there. He was a she. The shorts, at this point, were hardly pants at all, resembling a skirt, black in color and composed of cotton. The skirt was loose, and began to lengthen rather rapidly, quickly reaching an inch or two under mid thigh. Her socks had all together faded into what looked to be socks for ballet flats, leaving his smooth legs exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, Trevor closed the book, slipped it under her arm and looked to you. \"I don't know, cousin Natalie, maybe I responded to Claire because that's my name? There you go being weird again!!\" She freaked out, in her new, unfamiliar to you, feminine, soft voice. \"I'll explain in due time, let me just get a few more books before you act all weird again...\" She said, walking through the halls of bookshelves, examining texts of all sorts. Romance novels, drama novels, books that told of things of fantasy; Books of all sorts. Before you knew it, her arms were full of books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright, let's head to the usual spot.\" Trevor said, arms full of books, her height finalizing at 5'5,\" her age jumping to 15. On her chest was a moderate pair of young female breasts. It was nearly done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You had to ask. \"Where's the usual spot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You heard her sigh. \"Just follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She then proceeded to lead you to small table for two in the coffee shop that was in the center of the bookstore. There, she placed all of her books on the table before throwing herself onto one of the chairs before sighing a content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ahh! I love this place sooo much!\" She chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So... You wanna fill me in here?\" You asked, concerned. \"You haven't been making sense all day! First, you talked about moving here, then, you called me 'cousin!'\" And, in lunch, you were talking about having moved here from some other place, who knows where! Then, you sounded as if we've been doing this whole bookstore and mall thing all of our lives! I think you should update me, 'cause, I'm lost!\" You finished your speech, leaning on the table as you did. Your lean caused one of the books to fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Could you get that, cousin?\" She asked. You sighed as you bent below the table to reach for the book. As you were down there, you noticed the magic was working fast, really fast. You saw that, on her feet were a black pair of ballet flats, which, she wore really well with that skirt, actually. And, under her skirt was a pair of... Pink panties. You groaned in disturbance as you got back up, placing the book on the table.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Thank you.\" She said. And, right there, as you were obtaining her book, she now wore a V-neck, maroon, sleeveless blouse. Gone was the Marvel superhero decorated shirt. Her change was hopeless. Trevor was gone. Dad had done it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dad...\" You sighed in your mind as Claire continued... That name would take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Clearly you're lost!\" Claire began. \"So, if you must know, here's our history, in short...\" She said, placing a bookmark into one of her books then placing it down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You're my cousin, Natalie. I'm your cousin, Claire Michaels. 15 years old and a high-school student. I really like to read, you started taking me to the mall ever since I was in elementary school and you were going to the local college here, studying to be an English teacher. You were 21 at that time. We'd come here, and we'd read, in this very spot.\" She explained, slowly, as if you were a moron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Go on...\" You urged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... I said 'just like old times,' earlier, in reference to those times. I said I moved here, because, up until last year, we lived farther up North, and, I'd only come to visit you and your family.  We moved because my Dad, Richard Michaels, got a job here at the Middle School you teach at. When the school you work at started looking for math teachers, you put in a good word for my Dad, and, he was hired, so we moved here. It was great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As strange as it may have sounded, it was beginning to ring a bell. You were beginning to remember it, all of it. You remember being a college English student at the local university. You even recall taking a much younger Claire to the bookstores coffee shop, so you can study while she read and ate. She like it so much, it got to the point where it was her favorite hobby, of sorts, you recall Claire calling it a passion, saying she also wanted to be like you and become a teacher in English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You even remember putting in a good word for her Dad, your Uncle Richard, who was a total math geek, who you also knew secretly wanted Claire to be a math student in college, like him. Obviously, he knew that wasn't going to happen. When he got hired at your school, you recall Claire calling you, and, the two of you speaking about all the fun you'd have. Just like old times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You massaged your head softly, as if getting over some violent headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh... Now I remember everything, Claire!\" You exclaimed, looking her in the eyes. She smiled a soft smile, her brunette hair shining in the soft lights of the book store. \"I'm... I'm so, so sorry. I have no idea what got into me! It was almost like I was... Someone else. It was weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, it was weird!\" She laughed. \"Now, why don't you grab a few books, come back here and I'll get us some coffees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'd like that.\" You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Just remember, I've got to be home in an hour! My parents said so, and, you know how they get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you walked off, you looked to Claire reading her books and smiled, proud of the young woman she's become. She always wanted to be like you, and, you're just glad she was coming to be her own woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At the same time, you were totally aware that that girl had just been Trevor. You dreaded what would become of your Mom, your younger sister, Erin. And all at the hands of your father. But, even though you had just watch your younger brother fade from reality, you smiled in content, seeing he had transitioned into a happy young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say, things actually went smoothly after that. You got coffees for both yourself and Claire as you both enjoyed some hearty conversation along with some reading. Although, some things Claire said stuck with you a bit. She mentioned you teaching at the local Middle School, although that part seemed kind of vague. You remembered all the things Claire mentioned, although the whole \"school\" thing still seemed hazy. Was that another large part of your life? Claire just unveiled much of your family up until now, although some things were still not clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost enough to give you a headache. This new life your Dad ended up giving you was a real pain sometimes. However, making out of your stupor, Claire was beaming at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well cousin Natalie, it's time to go! Don't want Mom and Dad to be cross, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er, right.\" You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing those thoughts aside for now, you and Claire began leaving. She did end up buying a couple of the books that she found really interesting. You could tell that she had a bright future as a teacher, and that made you smile. You both walked out of the mall, with the weather still a bit nippy from earlier. Both of you were in skirts, so you both had to pull them down, which kind of made you two laugh a bit playfully. After a minute, you both reached your car, and were on the way to Claire's house, which wasn't too far away from your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, just where was your house now anyway? Was it the same one you've had for your whole life? Your Dad was probably still there, wishing left and right. You could only wonder what he was like now. And he had sent both of his youngest children to be ladies. Speaking of which, where the heck was Nicole now? You were beginning to get a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the books, cousin Natalie!\" Claire beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome. It's a nice reward for the good grades you've been getting too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Claire blushed a bit at the praise. She could be so confident one second and then shy the next. You imagined she probably had some fans somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you did remember the address of Claire's home. It was 3987 Bristle Dr., and it was about 10 minutes or so away from where you at least used to live. Boy, was that confusing to think. You pulled into the neighborhood, seeing not many cars around. Seeing the correct address, you pulled in, allowing Claire to get out. She looked around, not seeing her parents' car around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cousin! Would you like to come in? My parents don't seem to be home yet.\"</span></div></div>",

You looked to Claire, whom seemed to be giddily awaiting your response. You wanted to take up her offer, you really did. And, on top of that, you actually really liked the young woman whom Trevor has become, not necessarily the principal, but, she seemed to be happy this way. Plus, you suddenly remembered your Father, his candies, and your Mom and Erin, the only two family members left. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cUgh\u2026 Sorry, Claire, but\u2026 I\u2019ve got a few things I\u2019ve got take care of.\u201d You sighed, much to her disappointment. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cAww!\u201d She whined, slouching over, :We were having so much fun, you and I!\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cI promise, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d You smiled, she returned the favor.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cFine. Bye!

All this and it\u2019s barely 4?!\u201d You sat in the driver\u2019s seat, totally shocked at what had all taken place in only a few short hours. You grasped firmly the steering wheel with both hands in frustration. You liked the people whom Nicole and Trevor, or, Nicole and Claire had, respectively become, but you\u2019d much rather they be unaffected by your Dad\u2019s wrath. Your little brother and sister were gone, happy in their new forms, but, gone.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cMaybe I should pay Dad a visit\u2026\u201d You said plainly. \u201c\u2026 Give him a piece of my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cOr, I suppose I could learn more about this life and head to this woman\u2019s home. That\u2019s an option.\u201d<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     This gave you an idea. You put on your lap your purse, dug around about the clutter which it held and finally came across your wallet, which you opened up and found your license.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \u201cBingo!\u201d You laughed, pulling out the license. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Natalie Marie Wilson\u2026 5\u20196\u201d\u2026 Ah!

Part of you really wanted to see what had become of your Dad, and yet you were kind of afraid as well. Who knows what's happened to him and that house with all those candies. Perhaps it was best to be cautious right now. With that in mind, you began following the path to your new apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe route to the apartment seemed to come naturally in your head, as if the drive was filling in the blanks. Claire had filled up quite a bit of memories before, which seemed to make you a bit more comfortable, but you still felt weird about it. Just what kind of person were you now? Claire mentioned something about the local middle school. Were you involved in that somehow? So many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to that, time flew by as you took a right into the parking lot. As if by instinct, you pressed a button in the car, opening one of the garages inside. You parked the car in your spot, closing the door as you did. You got yourself out, patted down your skirt a bit, and walked in after getting your purse. The place inside was nice enough; what you'd expect from an apartment but not so much that it looked shoddy. Some people inside waved at you as you came in, and you waved back with a small smile. Did they know you? Perhaps so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you looked at which room you had, seeing that you were up 2 floors. You found an elevator nearby and took it, waiting patiently as you reached the 2nd floor. You followed down the hallway a bit, eventually reaching your own door. You took a breath as you got out the door keys, unlocking the door as you walked in. The place was fairly nice; not bad for an apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could see why I live here.\" You smiled a bit. It certainly didn't compare to a house, but it was nice enough. Off the corner of your eye, you could have sworn you saw a brief flash over to the right, but you saw nothing when you looked there. Perhaps it was a trick of the sunlight, not that there was much left. It was well after 4:00 after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after you put your purse down, you heard a brief noise over to another room. While part of you was worried about a burglar or something, you somehow stayed calm, as if this didn't surprise you or something. Without pause, you walked over and opened the door, opening what was a small room, and someone else was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lynda, your mom. Well, who used to be anyway. You had been through this twice now, so you knew what this was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me.\" You spoke under your breath. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda's response?</span></div></div>",

Finally, your brown hair grew out of your head and down to your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just like her, your boxers became a pair of panties while your shorts became jean shorts.

Melissa jumped onto the dance floor, while Natalia sheepishly wandered to a quieter corner. After an hour or so, Melissa has accrued a bevy of boys around her, while Natalia talks to another wallflower that didn't want to be here either. \"I can't believe my friend dragged me here. Why did I ever listen to her? I told her I don't like parties,\" said the wallflower, her name Sakiko, a petite 18-year old that was equal parts geeky and cute. \"I'd rather be playing Halo.\" Sakiko adds. Through their conversations, Natalia learned Sakiko was a child prodigy, having already graduated high school at 11 and was already wrapping up her dissertation for her PhD in physics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa meanwhile, had become the life of the party, namely through the candies, but was now worn out from dancing, and sat down with her new entourage, and decided to show off her powers. One of the guys she's with points to a tubby guy with acne doing lame dance moves in a corner of the dance floor. The guy says to Melissa, \"That's Joel Proest. He's this party's token nerd. We had to invite him to get his hot sisters Gina and Flora to attend the party. For some reason they all stick together, and they even do some of his nerd things.\" Melissa got to thinking how to impress them, then she saw Joel's shirt, which was a shirt with a picture of Hatsune Miku on it. She also noticed his sisters wearing cat ear hairbands on their heads. Melissa grabbed a candy, suckled a bit, then made her move. \"I wish Joel Proest was a catgirl Hatsune Miku, and his sisters were catgirls too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Joel suddenly froze, feeling odd as his body lost fat rapidly. His legs lost their thick pelt of hair and became smooth and svelte. All his limbs became lean and petite and his frame became feminine. His face scrunched down and became very soft, devoid of crater-laden acne that burdened him since puberty, his eyes an aqua green. Suddenly, his messy split-end filled hair lengthened to the floor and turned green, and then magically bunched into two pigtails as light bangs adorn his forehead. His waist pinched tight, hips widened a bit, as his large man-boobs dwindled to a feminine A-cup. Then his ears rose to the top of his head, growing green fur and becoming triangular in shape, while a four foot green furred tail rips out the seat of his pants. The final anatomical changes take place, making Joel a member of the fairer sex. However, more changes went on, now with her clothes, as her baggy shirt became Hatsune's famed dark grey sleeveless top and green neck tie, with the black and green striped sleeves materializing on her arms. Her pants fell apart below the knees, reconstituting into her boots, while the upper half of her pants shrank up and fused together to make Miku's black and green miniskirt, the only difference being that in the middle of the rear there was a hole for Joel's tail. Finally, Joel's briefs became a pair of panties. As Joel's changes finished, black cat ears replaced Gina's human ears and her hairband and contrasted nicely against her platinum blonde hair, and her tail slid through the seat of her dress, while orange tabby ears now rest on auburn hair in place of her hairband, and her tail was flailing away to the music through her jean shorts. When the current song ended, Joel, now Hatsune, got up on the karaoke stage, along with her sisters, and began performing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!! How did you do that?\" one of the boys in Melissa's entourage asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With these!!\" Melissa said, holding up one of the candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls in the entourage, a red-headed airhead with little to nothing on named Candi, said, \"Then, can you like, do something about those two?\" She points to Natalia and Sakiko. \"They are, so like, sucking the life out of the party, and that kind of sucking, um, sucks. They should be more like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl, a more modest girl in a black dress, Sakiko's friend Andrea, says, \"I don't know. I know Sakiko, and I was hoping to get her out her shell, but I guess she was telling the truth about not liking parties. Let's just leave them alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Melissa listen to?</span></div></div>",

There was no cushion, your butt was inflating. In fact, it kept inflating until eventually, you heard your shorts ripping. \"Uh oh\" you say in fear. Then, with one final push, your shorts ripped apart and fell to the car floor. It was the result of the huge bubble butt that formed on you. Luckily, your boxers were more flexible and stayed on, but barely. \"What in the world just happened?\" you ask yourself, not figuring out what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

They slid on perfectly and you stood up in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they don't hurt as much as I thought they would\" you said as you walked around a bit in them.

As you walked you see blonde hair on your face. \"That's weird since when did I-\" That's when you noticed you were a completely different person.

As you see that there was no red umbrella in sight you decided to have some fun. You went in to the water and relaxed inside it. Later, you noticed a woman setting up a red umbrella and began to read, Pride and Prejudice. You got up from the water and headed to the umbrella. As you ran, the woman noticed you and closed the book. \"I'm so glad your safe,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her glasses and you realized it was Lynda, your mom. \"Mom?\" you say. \"You brought me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes and I had a reason. Your father and I had been growing apart lately. He was seeing other women. I demanded a divorce, but he refused until he wanted a prenuptial in which I refused.

You go to the mirror and do some poses. Your attention focused on the mirror as you see yourself modeling. For some reason you actually liked the outfit you were wearing. It showed the 'girl' inside of you. Then again, Lynda stuffed your closet with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you try out the next outfit which was a strapless dress.

They said that they will deliver in 30 minutes. When you were waiting for the pizza, you made some preparations for your first work day. You head to the bathroom and grabbed a few candies. You looked in front of the mirror and gladly say, \"I wish my body hair was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you looked at yourself as your body hair was diminishing before your eyes. Everywhere from the arm hair to the (you know what I mean) to the leg hair. Your body was completely hairless. Your next step in celebrating was another relaxing hot bath. You took off your clothes and stepped into the tub. There were some soap fragrances nearby so you poured it into the water. You loved the nice aroma. Even, your body felt smooth. You were stuck in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the door was knocking. The pizza guy was there. \"Hello,\" he said. \"Pizza delivery for a Nate Wilson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon went out of your hot tub and put on a towel. However, when you wrapped the towel, you didn't wrap it around the \"torso\" area... . When you opened the door, holding tightly of the towel you said. \"I'm Nate Wilson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza guy was astonished at your breasts. He actually didn't see someone topless (except for a few guys). \"Hear is your pi...zza.\" He says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much would that be?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's free,\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon close the door. What was that about, you wonder. Then when you put down the pizza, you realized that your breasts were showing. Oh that explains it, you thought. At least you got a free pizza. You sat down on the couch and began to eat your pizza. The pizza here is delicious, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, once you were done with the pizza, you soon cleaned up and headed for sleep. You chose what to wear for the night. You tried something out in the closet which was a nightgown. You admired yourself in the mirror and headed for sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First new expansion to North America!! Now hiring women for positions as cat-ear maid!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ever wrote this must not have a fine grasp on English... or they did it on purpose... Still, sounds kind of cool...\" You fold up the paper and paid for your meal. As you walked down the street though, you wondered, \"What do they mean by 'cat-ear' maid though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there and see the other maids already working there, it made a lot more sense. \"Oh... '<i>cat-ear</i>' maid...\" You saw all the girl were wearing very realistic cat ear headbands and cosplay cat tails with their maid uniforms and acted with cat mannerisms in additions to portraying maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nya!! Welcome!!\" one of the cosplay catgirl maids asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I saw you had an opening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to the back, where you find the branch manager, a wiry, geeky looking lady with long flat brown hair and thick glasses, sitting at a desk with a small Sanada figurine on it, typing up some data on the computer. \"Well hello there!! I see we have another applicant!!\" she looks at the maid. \"Sarah, you can resume your duties now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nya!!\" she says heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of you may seem confused by that conservation, maybe a little weirded out, but one of the requirements of the job, to help you stay focused, will be that unless you are on your lunch break, that during store hours, even when not in front of customers, you are to remain in character. Corporate has found this method of training and presentation to help you make your performances more authentic when waiting on customers, and the theatrics of the neko maids are why the brand has done so well for so long.\" She gets up, \"Alright... The application process is in three parts. Today all you will be doing is sitting and watching our current maids in actions, so you can pick up on how to act and just what the job entails. Tomorrow, if you're still interested, arrive early, where we will get an idea of your straight-up waitressing skills by having you wait on the staff before we open to the public. If you survive the cut, we'll do it one more time, but in full dress and roleplay. After that, I will choose two of you from the full class of applicants, which I will mention now totals 12. Now, go out to the reserved party section and spend the day watching the staff. To prevent your actions from disturbing the customers, you will be waited on like any other customer, with anything you order on the house as so long you remain until I dismiss you. Now, take your positions for orientation!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and the other applicants sit down, you find flyers laying atop your menus. Opening it up, it seems to review most of what the boss said, but also points out some new details that you get into as you watch the maids in action. \"While remembering to act 'catty' and with cat-like mannerisms, there are some details to notice. Not all maids act alike, and as a result, play different roles, and get paid at different rates.\" You watch various maids go by, acting in different ways, noting how they acted seemed mostly dependent on their dress color. \"Blue dress maids are 'submissive' maids. To play them, you must be patient and oblige the customers every whim. This role is trying on a waitress' nerves, but also pays the most.\" A maid in a red dress goes up and asks rather belligerent to her customers. \"Red dress maids are 'saucy' maids. While they have the lowest pay grade, they are free to act however they wish to the customers as long they remember to inject the nekomimi roleplay into the experience as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing by you in orange is a somewhat rude maid. \"Orange maids are 'tsundere' maids. They act in a tsundere fashion at all times.\" You suddenly jump as the cook yells at a maid in a white dress. \"White maids are 'spacey' maids, maids that roleplay as goofballs and eccentrics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA maid in a yellow dress brings you a drink. \"A hope you wike it... nya!!\" She then skips off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yellow maids are 'childlike' maids, the second highest pay grade, playing the role of naive, innocent catgirls seeing the world with wonder. Corporate has found these maids tend to have a great bond with the few children that find their way into our walls and make them feel happy and at ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw one more maid type, but three more entries. \"Black dress maids are trainee maids, as you will be when you first join. Black maids have more leniency when it comes to breaking character, and help in the kitchen and re-stock the back as necessary.\" Then you read on the two missing maids. \"Gold maids work in the back in managerial positions, and rarely interact with customers, but must roleplay as a 'big sister' or 'mother' type to the other maids.\" Finally, you see the last entry. \"Pink maids are 'bimbo' maids, and only work the late night shift. If you agree to work as a pink maid, expect to wear skimpy uniforms and present yourself in an alluring manner at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou order some of the food, which turns out to be actually quite good, the menu being roughly three-star French food. After a while, a couple of girls walked out, leaving ten in the running for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... I guess you got the gist. I'm closing things up for the night. If you're still interested come in tomorrow for your waitressing exams...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you get dressed, preparing to for Round 2 of your application. \"Wait... I have zero waitressing experience...\" You look at the candies. \"Maybe... No... Then again...\" Uncertain as to whether you should amplify your skills with candy, you take some with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, you found it as hard as you imagined. Actually, it was friggin' insane. Not only was she having the wait staff blurting orders like a blitzkrieg, but cooks screaming at them, and other waitresses hurling things at them while they carried their orders, seeing if they could evade the debris AND not spill their orders. Girl after girl was failing to meet the manager's high standards and being dismissed. \"Guess I had the right idea... I wish I was the best waitress this waitress has ever seen!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FivecrepesuzetteeggsbenedictpineappleparfaitdietchainticanIhaveitallfor free?\" the waitress you had to wait on asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'sfivecrepesuzetteeggsbenedictpineappleparfaitther'snosucht hingasdietchiantistoppullingmychainandnoyoucannothavethemealforfree.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you delivered the order, you easily dealt with the cook's broken english and walked out with tray in hand. That's when the pottery and refuse started flying. You bobbed and weaved through the chaos, never spilling a drop, then just before the table, you leap off the wall and flip off another one to dodge some spoons. \"Here you go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, looks like we got only two candidates left... Girls, I'll see you in the office for measurements, and tomorrow we'll flip the script and do this again, in character!! As long as you pass tomorrow the jobs are guaranteed yours!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Measurements?\" you gulp. You realized you hadn't fully taken the plunge yet and gone all female... If you went back there in this state, you'd be exposed and you wouldn't get the job for sure!! However... you really need this job!! \"I wish I was fully female!!\" you whisper, candy residue from your previous wish still intact. With a shimmer the last of your masculine traits fades away from your body, they only reminders you were male now in your memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are getting measured for your trainee maid dresses, the manager remarks, \"I never saw moves like those before... Nate? Odd name for a girl like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my parents had been expecting a boy when I came out, and it was already on the birth certificate before the doctors told my dad I was a girl. However, 60 hour labor... Well, everyone was pooped, said they'd fix it later, but they never did, and here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool story...\" she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you were back in your apartment, now with your loaned trainee maid dress on a mannequin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***FLASHBACK***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, part of your grade will be your ability to accessorize the dress on your own. We may be providing the dress, but you have to acquire or design your own ears, tail, and other features you want for your maid character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***FLASHBACK END***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or is this the most unconventional interview ever? However, it is an unconventional job...\" You stare at the uniform... \"Man, this is an insane demand!! How the hell does she have so many employees already? I tempted to use some candies and complete it that way... But should I rely on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

After all the mints were so powerful he could erase his sons memories. That's when he felt Nates hands running up and down his hairy legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was feeling very good now. He turned his head toward Nate and pulled him in closer. Mike closed his eyes and then plunged his tongue deeply into Nates mouth. Mike laied Nate on the blanket as he broke the kiss. He began to massage Nate's breast. Nate let out a burly moan.\"Oh dad that is sooo nice\" Nate said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Mike still had the mint in his mouth from earlier he said,\" I wish Nate would call me Mike instead of dad.\" Just as the wish took effect Nate said,\" Mike don't stop playing with my tits.\" Mike could feel Nates hands reaching for his manhood. Mike moved in closer to allow Nate to reach his penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike continued to take all this in.</span></div></div>",

It was like his dad was trying to turn him into a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that we would return to our house\" said Mike out loud. The mint, which was a new one he just sucked on, instantly worked its magic. In a few seconds, Nate and Mike were back in their house.

Then, he focused on the mint in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Nate had the same hair as the intern does\" said Mike. Then, the mint went to work. Nate could feel his hair extending and growing down his back, growing down to his waist. At the same time, it darkened until it was a nice dark brown color, lush enough for Mike to run his hands through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

To say she was shocked was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here? What the hell are you going mister?\" she asked in anger, seeing her husband having sex with an unknown woman. You immediately looked up at your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom?\" you asked in the intern's voice. You sort off remembered her, but your memories seemed to be fading somewhat. You were hardly remembering \"Nate\" anymore. Mike smiled at your face. You were beginning to think of yourself more as \"Irene Wilson\", the intern at Mike's work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was unfazed as he grabbed another candy and looked at the still-mad Lynda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get over here and get that whore off of you!\" said Lynda as she stomped over. However, Mike knew what to do with the candy in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that Lynda was a cat\" he said imply. Before Lynda could even react to that, she instantly started shrinking down to a small size. She got down on all fours and her thumbs vanished as her hands became paws with claws. Orange fur grew over her body as it replaced her clothing and a long orange furred tail shor of her backside. Her ears moved to the top of her head and became pointed. Her eyes became slitted as her mouth extended outwards a bit and whiskers grew and a small flat nose replaced her old one. Just like that, Lynda had became a house cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's so cute!\" you said in yoru womanly voice as you got off Mike and petted Lynda the cat. She liked it and started purring. Apparently, she didn't really remember being Linda now. At least, if she did, she didn't show it anymore. Mike was glad to be off of the hook but he imagined that he would change her back eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

In the faintest recesses of your mind and soul, the real you pounded away, like someone imprisoned for all time in the Phantom Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, after a wild romp, Mike adds an addendum, saying, \"I wish we had unlimited stamina, and you never got a period.\" You both felt rejuvenated, then he added, \"And I wish you... What the...\" A brilliant flash of light comes from the hall, and suddenly, Lynda was back, although she seemed to look like she was almost 15 years younger than normal, and she had cat ears and a tail. \"How the hell are you human again?! I didn't wish you back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda lifts her lifts up with a twisted smirk and belts out, \"Who the hell do you think <b>CREATED</b> these wishing candies? I know all their secrets and gave them all their powers, and I was the one who gave our son, the you turned into your sex toy here, the candies for his birthday. That's right!! I can see through the changes into her soul, and know my boy is still in there deep inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike screamed, pushing you aside, \"But I saw you, angry and confused, and then I turned you into a cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda countered, \"That was all an elaborate illusion I was forced to induce with my emergency candy, and it did take me a moment to see through all the wishing you had done to recognize my own son, however, as for the cat thing, your wish did graze me before I could evade it, thus the whole catgirl thing.\" She looks into your eyes, her own eyes emitting a violet aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at this woman, and listening to her speak of you as your son starts to bring your true self back to the surface. \"D... Dad?\" You say, jumping out of the bed. \"How could you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got tired of the lot of you, so I decided I wanted a change, and when I found the candies, jackpot... Why did I say that aloud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda says, \"Don't think because I don't have a candy on me I don't have powers of my own.\" Mike notices her burning white eyes. \"I forced you to speak the truth.\" She steps forward. \"Now, it's time I make you suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike suckles like mad, yelling, \"I wish Lynda forgot about the candies!!\" Suddenly, a noxious spicy taste filled his mouth and he began gagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda cackled and told him, \"I see you tried to make a forbidden wish!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbidden wish? No thing!!\" Mike cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!!\" Lynda retorted, \"The candies are powerful, but not omnipotent, and I built safeguards into them.\" Taking another step, she adds, \"One thing that's forbidden is directly commanding someone to forget something. These were designed for fun, not malice.\" She suddenly vanishes in something one could describe as a sonido, and reappears next to you with the bag of candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had the bag of candies!!\" Mike's throat was once again assaulted by flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty boy. That's also forbidden. It makes sure no one person can monopolize the candies other than me.\" Lynda exclaims, wagging her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish there weren't any stupid rules!!\" Mike screams, only to feel heat so intense he coughs up blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do!! Rules are rules, you know.\" Lynda smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gets a coy grin, and with what is left of his candy, says, \"I wish Lynda was a dumb bimbo that did anything I said... Hah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda has a look of worry on her face, exclaiming, \"Oh no, that's like, a great wish an all...\" Mike grins a wide grin, about the laugh in victory, when suddenly, she does another sonido thing, and with a glowing fist, strikes the air, and says with a crazed look in her face, \"Psyche!!\" A strange object, resembling a phantom bimbo, is slugged in the face. Mike's grin fades rapidly. Lynda grabs the ghost slut by her face, and exclaims, \"You fool. You had a family with three wonderful children, and you do this to your own son... You deserve worse.\" She thrusts the phantom back at Mike just as his candy fully dissolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Lynda and you watch as Mike's frame shrank down, his hair lengthening and turning blonde, as two F-cup breasts adorn his chest, his butt becomes luscious, his waist descends to a size 2, as all his body hair fades away. His eyes turned a sharp green color as his lips became pouty, nose petite. You watch as what clothes your father had on became an itty-bitty pink tube top, black leather micro miniskirt, and stiletto heeled sandals, as the most important anatomical changes went on under the clothes and within now her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, and asks Lynda, \"Hi, like, what was I doing again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda tells her, \"Myra, I told you before... You're our housekeeper... maid. Now I want you to clean up this mess, but after you make supper.\" A few light tears were rolling down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyra says cheerfully, \"Okie dokie!! Like, will do!!\" She heads out to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda turns to you, and suckles on a candy. Without saying a word, you begin to change... However, you aren't turning back into a boy, but are becoming a unique female roughly the same age you were when you were Nate. You have a raven A-line bob haircut, B-cup breasts, dressed in a black button-up blouse, crimson sweater vest, black pleated miniskirt, black kneesocks, and loafers. Suddenly, cat ears and a tail pop out of you, both black as well. You ask, \"What's going on?\" surprised at your alto voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda says, \"I tried to use a candy to stabilize you and return you to normal, but my 'rules' came back to bite me in the butt. Apparently, when you were 'Irene,' your father must have you pregnant, and one of the candies rules is it cannot extinguish life. Therefore, it made you a female version of yourself, and as for the feline traits... I worry your father's lucky blow damaged my magic, and made me being a catgirl perfectly normal, and as a result of my efforts just, my children as well. Wait, what about Trevor then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though by fate, Trevor walks by, but now he is now a she, dressed in a yellow tank top, denim skirt, and sneakers, but still had the same short boy hairstyle, possessing calico ears and tail, and looked every bit the tomboy, holding a football. \"Can I go outside and play football with David and my other friends?\" It seemed the change in reality didn't alter Trevor's friends, or his... her interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After supper.\" Lynda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I hope Myra makes us mahi mahi again!!\" Trevor says, running down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother turns to you and says, handing the candies back to you, \"With all that has happened, I could understand if you were angry with me, but I believe I should have explained how these things worked instead of letting you feel your way out. Because of that, Mike...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your finger up and silence her.</span></div></div>",

After the pre-school, you had to pick up your oldest daughter (who was seventeen but hadn't passed her driver's test yet) and drop her off at dance practice.  Then you had to get your two sons (aged twelve and fourteen) and bring them home from where ever they were.  Oh yes, they were playing lasertag.

Forget about being a guy, time to be a full on jiggling breasted girl for life) Nate said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one of the candies in his mouth. He thought hard and thought about being the most beautiful woman in the world <br>\r\n\"I wish i was an extremely beautiful girl with the absolute perfect body\" he said. <br>\r\nAll of a sudden Nate felt a tingling throughout his body. His thighs puffed up and became thicker and wider like thick chicken thighs with round curves. His lower legs trimmed down and became slim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his upper body, his waist constricted and became stick thin while his butt inflated with a \"phwoomph\" like a balloon, two soft orbs sticking proudly out of his backside, greatly contrasting his thin waist with a fat butt.<br>\r\nAll of Nate\u2019s body hair began to disappear as his skin smoothed and slimed, giving his arms, legs, and face a beautiful shimmer. His arms lost their masculine muscle tone and gained a skinny beautiful womanly length and slim tone. He, now a she, began getting skinnier and daintier hands with long fingernails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts grew about 2 more cups sizes, giving him 2 very plump jiggling breasts. They stretched his shirt to the limit. His body was becoming very well endowed and female. <br>\r\nFinally, his hair grew long, very long. It grew and grew down his back, cascading past his shoulders and back until it reached his jiggling fat butt. His voice then changed and grew very high pitched and serene sounding. It seemed as though the wish had played on Nate\u2019s desires to be a very beautiful woman in his image. He was now a she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s better\u201d she said. Nate looked down at herself. Her jiggling fat breasts swaying back and forth as she grabbed both fleshy orbs with her long fingernailed hands and shook them vigorously. They jiggled and jostled in her shirt and showed the extent of how bouncy they were, jumping up and down and moving greatly like two bouncy balls before she finally calmed down and let them settle back on her chest. \u201cThis is amazing\u201d Nate says in her new extremely feminine voice.  <br>\r\nShe turned to her backside, noticing her extremely plump butt. She had a pretty big butt on a skinny and perfectly proportioned girl\u2019s body. She shook it with her hands. The jiggling butt swayed left and right as it proofed every bit as shakable as her breasts. She kept shaking it as it jiggled more and more, moving left and right even further like jello until she finally let it settle down on her posterior, amazed on her jiggly it was and still able to retain its shape after settling down. <br>\r\nNate looked over the rest of her body. She put her hands on her chunky thighs and slim legs, running down her smooth skinned legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally awesome\u201d she said. The thighs and legs were proportioned perfectly, nice fat chunk on the thighs and skinny legs with cute feet. Nate was truly a marvel specimen of woman. <br>\r\nBut with all this enjoyment going on for her, she thought she should change her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll call myself Natalie, It is the female version of Nate\u201d Natalie said, it may not have been original but it fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked in the mirror and had an idea. She sat on the floor and flaunted her legs in an attractive pose, bending one leg and straightening out the other on the floor. She shook her breasts with her body, shimmying and jiggling her fat fleshy orbs. She saw them jiggle and bounce left to right in her shirt. <br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u201d Natalie said. <br>\r\nSuddenly the strange desire to take off her socks came over her. She didn\u2019t know what it was but Natalie had the desire to walk barefoot. \u201cWell, I have seen many girls barefoot a lot\u201d Natalie said. She pulled off her socks, revealing her bare feet, her toes was small and nice as she wiggled them. She did have cute feet. \u201cTeeheehee\u201d Nate giggled with his new girly estrogen flowing through her body causing him/her to become more and more girl like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie felt her smooth skin. It was like smooth velvet. She kissed her hand. \u201cSmooch, smooch\u201d she went as she admired her perfect skin and loved its feel. He loved every minute of being a beautiful girl. Her hair swayed and touched her butt repeatedly as it was long and beautiful. She had the body any woman would want, huge jiggling breasts, a thin waist and thick thighs and a plump bubble butt.<br>\r\nBut with all this excitement going on, Natalie wondered if she should make more wishes.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Natalie said, placing her slim hands on her slimmer waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could wish to improve his body more, or he could go play with it some more\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You and Kate do so, and you are brought to a round corner booth, where the two of you are able to sit side by side. The waitress says, \"Your server will be here in a few minutes.\" She walks back to the podium, leaving you and Kate alone. She twines her fingers with yours, a gesture you weren't expecting but not protesting, and she leans her head on your shoulder and closes her eyes. You clasp her hand in both of yours, and you caress the back of it with your thumb.<br>\r\nShe's perfect, you think, the most perfect girl I've ever seen. You feel happy with her, content, blissful even. She obviously feels the same about you, judging by the way she cuddles up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, another waitress comes, and you look up at her. She has green eyes\u2014which were dull compared to the vibrancy of Kate's\u2014and strawberry-blonde hair. Her name tag reads, \"Janet.\"<br>\r\nJanet Day, the head cheerleader of the school cheerleading team. You almost laughed. Arrogant, oh-so-perfect Janet Day was an Uno's waitress? Ironic.<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name's Janet and I'll be your server tonight. Can I start you off with something to drink?\"<br>\r\n\"Pepsi for me, a diet for her,\" you say, and you feel an odd weight in your pocket. Money, a result of your wish from before.<br>\r\nJanet smiles as she finishes jotting down their drink orders, and she looks up again, but instead of walking away to get your drinks, she looks at you and Kate, specifically at the latter.<br>\r\n\"Kate Smith?\" She asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Your date replies, \"Hello, Janet.\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were of the bisexual type,\" Janet says, changing her tone the moment your eyes locked fiercely onto her. You won't be letting anyone hurt Kate as long as you're around.<br>\r\n\"I'm...experimenting.\" Kate replies with a serene smile, and Janet nods.<br>\r\n\"Ah. Cool. Good for you, by the way. I'll be back to take your food orders.\"<br>\r\nJanet walks away, and you eye her with fury. She was demeaning your date, even if it wasn't obvious. You were tempted to get up and have a word with her when Kate squeezed your hand again, and you out an arm around her shoulders, calming down. Janet comes back with drinks, and she sets them in front of you two.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to take your orders?\"<br>\r\nYou nod and look at Kate, who speaks. \"Just get us two Chicago Classics, please.\"<br>\r\nJanet nods and walks away again.<br>\r\nYou look back down at Kate, who is perfectly relaxed in your embrace. She didn't mind being insulted by Janet; she always dealt with that problem at school, anyway. You pull her close and lean your cheek on her head and shutting your eyes but remaining awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Janet returns with the two pizzas, and the two of you eat. You each devour yours in a matter of minutes, leaving nothing behind and baffling Janet when she returns. You ask for the check, and she returns again with the check. You pull out the cash and put it in the check booklet, and Kate pulls out thirty dollars and hands it to Janet herself. She seems surprised, but she graciously accepts and picks up your mess. The two of you slide out of the booth, and you leave the restaurant, walking hand in hand and Kate's free hand wrapped around your arm. <br>\r\n\"Where to next?\" You ask, stopping and looking down at her.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...let's...\"</span></div></div>",

She practically leaps over the counter and closes the gap between you and her at lightning speed, then stops and speaks.<br>\r\n\"Hello! Can I help you with anything?\" She asks, and you smile and reply, \"Uh, yes, could you help me and my friend here get some new clothing? We, uh, we had some...improvements...done, and we were wondering if you could help us measure our new sizes.\"<br>\r\nThe girl nodded gleefully, then guided you and Kate across the store, to the dressing rooms.<br>\r\n\"I need you to step inside and undress so I can get an accurate measurement, ma'am.\"<br>\r\nHaving grown up being called \"sir,\" you didn't realize she had been referring to you.

The employee returns with several pairs of jeans, tees, and jackets, all of which fit Kate perfectly. Kate paid for the clothes right then and there, and then you stepped in to be measured. You measured, from bust to hips, 51\", 35\", and 47\". The employee leaves and returns with jeans to fit your size, a white tee and a large black windbreaker. You happily slip these on, and after a few more outfits, you out that one back on and pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out with a bag of clothes in each hand and Kate on your arm.

The pillows fluff up, and a red-curtained canopy appears over the bed. A chest appears at the foot, and behind you, your mirror expands to cover the closet door, which became a sliding door and slid into the wall. A wardrobe was revealed behind it, one that housed all of your clothing. Your clothing was snaking out of your dresser and changing to fit a woman as it flew and fit into your new wardrobe.

His lashes spill out of his eyelids, and his flat cheeks plump up and his jaw and chin become more angled and narrow. His shoulders narrow as well, his arms beneath the puffy blue jacket becoming slender and feminine. His fingers lengthen and his calloused hands soften and tighten until the skin is soft and supple, and his fingers become dainty. The wrinkles on his body disappear instantly, giving his newly feminine face an unmistakable beauty. His waist tightened on itself gradually, as if invisible hands were molding his flesh out of clay and smoothing it into something more graceful than the clunky male body. He stands up, gazing down at himself in a combination of horror and interest as the invisible hands moved the fatty, useless clay down lower, to his hips and butt. In the reflection of the window behind him, you can see his backside as it seems to bubble beneath his jeans, as if still forming the fine clay to sculpt the newest masterpiece. His legs grow shapely, his jeans tightening, especially on his thighs, which were pressing tightly against his jeans and still growing, even surpassing the size of yours. You are surprised by the resilience of his pants when he gasps and moans in sensual pleasure and agonizing pain. Your eyes avert toward the bulge beneath his pants, his prominent manhood fusing back to his crotch and tucking itself between his legs. You knew that it was replaced by a vagina when he gasped and a hand flew to that spot.

She looked down and the three of you watched as her once pudgy belly receded into her torso, her waist pinching in the process. It was strangely mesmerizing to watch the fat from her belly split into two masses of flesh, one of which rolled up her body to her chest, where it began to situate itself inside her breasts, which doubled in size and then became triple their original size, leaving her with breasts the size of melons. The second mass of flesh and fat had slid down her body to become part of her hips, which filled out and grew tight against Heather's jeans. Soon they became formfitting, then skintight, then they seemed to become constricting, judging by the fact that they were forming to the creases in Heather's crotch. She was moaning in pain, her hips, thighs and butt becoming to big for her jeans, and eventually they just bursted. The button pinged off in a random direction, the zipper busted, and the rest of the jeans exploded, leaving her naked on her lower half, save for her black panties. She sighed in relief and leaned on the table, her forehead sweating. Her hips finished widening and were now quite rounded and broad, her thighs had become thick and meaty, like your own but more so, and her butt was large and plump, like two watermelons. You let out a low whistle.<br>\r\n\"Dang, Heather,\" June says with a naughty smile, her eyes locked to Heather's breasts, \"Would you mind sharing some of that body with me?\"<br>\r\nHeather growled and looked up at him. \"Screw you.\" She stood up straight and had to compensate before she fell over by leaning her back against the wall. \"Ugh, my back hurts. A lot.\"<br>\r\nYou were about to question why your back wasn't in pain from your breasts, which were only a little smaller than hers, but then you remember that you are much lighter and your spine probably has gotten stronger due to your wings.

Another drawer had fishnet stocking and kneehigh striped socks. The other drawers was nothing, and I mean nothing, but various type of micro and miniskirts. Nary a pant nor short was to be seen. Atop the armoire is a number of holders holding earrings <i>(many of them either hooped or having heart designs)</i>, necklaces, and bracelets, as well as make-up of various types and colors, but at the moment, you weren't paying too much attention to the jewelry nor the make-up. You needed clothes. You dart to your new closet and see hanging up nothing but half-tanks, tube tops, and for some reason a very slutty-looking Applejack cosplay outfit in the corner. You have no idea why that's there. You see quite a few stylish belts hanging up as well, alongside a few hats. More importantly though is the massive collection of sexy boots, heels, wedges, sandals, and platform sandals the wish had blessed you wish. Many of the boots ranged from shin to knee-high, and almost all of the boots, sandals, and heels had heels in excess of 4 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that if you were still a guy, the idea of seeing all these clothes on a girl like you would drive you wild. However, you then notice a few snowflakes fall outside and the slight chill you had begun to feel from nude for so long and realized, \"Damn, these clothes are hot, but they won't keep me warm... Wait!!\" You off another candy and proffer another wish. \"I wish I can stay warm no matter what I'm wearing or how much I'm wearing.\" You feel a slight shiver as the candy dissolved. As you heard the commotion of your family enter the kitchen, you quickly slip on a tiny pink thong that barely covers your front and slides up in between your cheeks on the other side. Once you do this, the chill in the air goes away, and the room, and your body, feels comfortable. You slide on a short pink and white tartan pleated miniskirt and thread a sleek studded belt through its belt loops. You then, in your haste, grab a petite white bikini top with a lone pink stripe across the left cup that ties up in the front and stretch it over your mammaries, making sure the knot it secure. You then nab a pair pink and white kneehigh socks and 6-inch platform sandals, moaning in fascination at how good to felt to slide them on. You then finally grab a hot pink cabbie hat and throw it on your head real quick and coat your lips in a little bit of the lipstick that was on the armoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie!! Sorry we had to bail on your birthday and all, but luckily we managed to get sooner than expected, but we all didn't expect Trevor to fall off his bike and break his arm over at your aunt Bethany's, but it looks like he's alright.\" you heard your mother explain, \"I brought home some pizza for us to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... So to get my parents out of the house, you broke my brother's arm?\" You growl at the candy. You quickly wish away the broken arm, to suddenly find yourself reliving the previous moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were all worried when Trevor took that sudden tumble at your aunt's place, but it doesn't look like he broke anything, according to the ER doctors. Oh, and I brought home some chicken!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, you still hurt him!! I wish my brother wasn't hurt!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events play out again. \"Natalie honey!! Sorry for having to run out, but Bethany said Trevor was having wild fits of explosive diarrhea and she had to take him to the ER because Immodium wasn't helping. Turns out he had a mild stomach virus. By the way, I got us all some Chinese food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really being testy, candy.\" you mutter. \"What is it with messing with my brother as being the deus ex machina for my parenting being out earlier? You know what? Let's just stick with this reason before you try to do something really ridiculous like say an alien burst out his chest, or his head randomly exploded, or he suddenly turned into a catgirl and got detained by the government in Area 51.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had finished your rant to the arcane snack treats, you finally decide to head out of your room to see if your wishes worked as intended, and also because that Chinese food did smell pretty good. Just before you went though, you nommed one more candy. \"I wish no matter what I eat, I never lose this awesome figure.\" An almost orgasmic tingle coursed over you. You realized you finally got your female body the way you wanted. You didn't want a little binge eating to screw it up... Also, you loved to scarf pizza, and you weren't about to give that up nor work out religiously to compensate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the kitchen, you saw your whole family sitting down at the table, scooping up rice, grabbing egg rolls, gathering seasme chicken, and so on. There was Erin, in her usual spot, still the same, looking all frumpy, Nicole next to her nomming some General Tsao. Tommy was on a liquid diet thanks to his \"gastrointestinal issues,\" sitting by your dad... whom seemed a bit more tanned and a little more fit than you remember seeing him at breakfast, not to mention this man has a full, thick pompadour, whereas before he was clearly balding <i>(all in all making him almost look like Space Dandy)</i>, and mom was... <b>HOLY HELL, WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM!!</b> Your formerly brunette mom now has obviously pink hair, tanned skin, a complexion that made her look like she was still 19, a waist rivaling yours in tininess, hips that flared as much as yours did, and boobs as big, no scratch that, bigger than yours!! Her clearly J-cup boobs bobbed within her forest green turtleneck sweater, being literal \"sweater puppies,\" and her jeans seems painted on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lynda leaned over to help Nicole get a little more of the super-spicy chicken, she accidentally hits Erin with one of her boobs. \"Mom!! Could you get those things out of my face!! It's bad enough it's clear I didn't inherit your giant boob gene like Natalie did, but you don't have to keep shoving them in my face!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling you that you shouldn't worry so much about your bust honey. You should be happy about how you feel on the inside. Besides, you could always be a late bloo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that 'late bloomer' line again, mom!! Natalie was already a D-cup when she 10!! I'm still just barely an A!! I know that means I didn't get your bust gene.\" Erin storms off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand why she's so jealous of you and her sister.\" Mike says. \"She's already a pretty girl, and smart too.\" He sighs. \"Teenagers, baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in shock, wondering in your head, \"Alright, somehow, as some consequence of my actions, my dad looks healthier and has that full head of hair, my mom has a body on par with me now, and Erin suffers from boob envy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then blink, before a small realization hits you. \"I guess just the candies using Trevor as the excuse for my parents to be out, there had to be a reason why I could be a girl with such physical features, so there had to be genetic changes to my family to make my wishes make sense in the greater scheme of reality because I never specified for them to only affect me... Seems legit to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother snaps you out of your deep thought. \"You seem a little silly just standing there staring. Come on and eat, Natalie!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go on and eat supper. It was excellent, but you still can't figure out how Nicole can down that ridiculous hot chicken they cook with habanero and those ultra-hot peppers from India without even batting an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, your mom reminds you, \"Oh, look at the time. You do remember...\"</span></div></div>",

Kate then suddenly shifts gears. \"Anyhow, guess what I got. The brand new <b>ADVANCED WARFARE, BITCHES!!</b>\" She whips a game box for Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. \"So how about how it? Wanna show those whiny scrubs what real YOLOswag is all about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply...</span></div></div>",

Little did you know that it would be a huge mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, your parents had gone out for the night so they were out of your hair for a while. You knew that Erin could take care of your little siblings for the night. That actually brought out an interesting thought as you didn't know if everyone thought that you always looked like this. Apparently, you now had a new friend and job so something definately changed. Maybe your family believed that you had always been Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I'll figure that out later\" you said as you walked down the staircase, your heels clacking against the wood. You smiled as you walked down. Thanks to your last wish, you felt completely natural and felt completely feminine. Walking in heels felt as natural as talking to you and felt pretty good to wear. The skirt allowed your legs a new sense of freedom. It was almost like a second life to you, although you still had your male memories and still somewhat thought like 'Nate'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, you yelled to Erin that you were going out for work and that you would be back after 11. You felt confident that everything would work out just fine. However, there was one oversight:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was not affected by the wish at all. The wish had bypassed her and she still remembered how things were before. Not only that, she overheard most of your wishing as you slowly turned yourself into a college girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic candies huh? How interesting\" murmured Erin to herself after you left the house. She watched you enter your new car: a black Dodge Charger and drive off. One she was sure that you were out of sight, she went up to your room and easily found where the jar of andies was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I heard right, these grant wishes. Must be true since I heard Nate changing himself. Never knew that he was so curious about being a girl. Maybe if he had asked, I could have helped there\" said Erin as she contemplated what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to do anything evil to Nate. In their past, they fought just like any other brother and sister, but that was in the past and they were more mature now. Now, you two got along with the occassional bickering, which was quite comical. Actually, Erin found it kind of cute that you were so interested in the female life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she happened to see a magazine sitting around that remained from when 'Nate' was around. She picked it up and looked through it. It was a typical magazine showing things like celebrities and such like that. Then, she came to some pages that you had bookmarked when you were still Nate. It was some famous actresses. There was one in particular that caught her eye:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.stud-center.com/wallpaper/ellen-page/55891.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.stud-center.com/wallpaper/ell...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Ellen Page huh? Nate did like her\" smiled Erin. She believed that she knew what to make a wish for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could give you this actreess's looks and attire and allow you to explore female life from the famous point of view rather than a college view. What could happen?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin thought long and hard about her next wish. Finally, the words started to form in her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stopped herself. Her initial wish was going to be to make herself as beautiful as Natalie, but she remembered that she was only 13, whereas Natalie was 21. Being a beautiful 13-year-old would be cool, but it wouldn't have quite the same impact as being a beautiful 21-year-old. She decided she needed to age herself with the wish as well. Before she did that, Erin pulled out her phone and stood in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To serve as a reminder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin used the camera feature to take a picture of herself. She then pulled out a candy and made a minor wish. \"I wish this picture would stay exactly as is, regardless of any future wishes I make.\" She then tried to formulate every possible angle for the wish, to ensure nothing would go wrong. She went over to her mother's room, and after a minute of scrummaging through her closet, found a shirt and skirt to wear. Erin went back to her room, took off her own clothing, and threw them on, They didn't fit at all on her, but with any luck, the wish would take care of that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she picked a candy out of the bag, and popped it into her mouth:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that I would age to 21, becoming as beautiful as my sister Natalie, but that I would have my memories stay the same, as well as everyone else's memories of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of moments later, Erin started hearing a small, crunching noise. It took a matter of her seconds for her to realize that the noise was coming from inside her body. Suddenly, an intense wave of pain went over her entire body, sending Erin to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Efgeraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery bone in Erin's body was breaking and reforming. Erin crawled to her bed, grabbed a pillow, and bit it, so she wouldn't bite her tongue off. The changes were rapid and relentless. Erin looked at her hands and noticed they were getting bigger, to the point where they looked like female adult hands. The same thing happened to her feet and the rest of her body soon followed. Her chest cracked and crumbled as it expanded horizontally and vertically. Her arms lengthened considerably. Her hip bones also widened greatly. As she stood up, Erin could feel herself getting much taller; she stopped at 5\"5. The final bone reformation process took place in her skull as her face started to change. Her jawline and cheekbones became much more defined, with her chin becoming more pronounced. Her nose slightly grew along with her eye sockets. Finally, her skull as a whole became just a tiny bit larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked over herself and was horrified. There wasn't enough tissue on her body to compensate for the bone growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a skeleton with skin\" she muttered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, that issue resolved itself in a matter of minutes. Erin felt her body filling up, as new tissue came into existence. It started at her feet, as they filled out to become dainty, beautiful feet. It surged through her legs as they became shapely and womanly. It then reached her butt. Erin felt it as what her friends once called \"a pancake butt\" started to expand in volume. It stopped at a point, and then the tissue and flesh reformed. Her ass was bubbly yet tight, something which gave Erin great pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process continued. It reached her vaginal area and did it's work there. The tissue started going into her hips, eventually providing just enough cover for the hipbone. Changes continued as her stomach and arms started to receive tissue. Initially, her arms and stomach were very toned, but acting on a subconscious desire from Erin, added a bit more tissue, making Erin curvy yet still very athletic. Erin looked down at her A-cup breasts and frowned. As she was looking, she could see lumps moving around them. Erin then started to feel them getting heavier as they started growing. They stopped at C-cup; perky and noticeable but not something ridiculous looking. The tissue finally reached her face. Collagen went into her ears as they slightly grew. Erin pressed her fingers up against her forehead as she felt the tissue maneuvering throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo cool.\" Erin thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tissue finished, Erin's hair started to grow. Her brunette hair slightly darkened as it reached her waist, Acting on another subconscious desire of hers, no hair grew on the rest of her body. Erin started to get up, believing the transformation was finished. As Erin stood up, she felt a surge of hormones throughout her body, compensating for the eight-year jump. Her brain also started to hurt. She stumbled to her bed and lay down. Erin wasn't going to have the memories of a 21-year-old, but she was going to have the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes passed, and Erin realized all the changes were done. She slowly got up and walked to the mirror.  Looking back at her was the body of a gorgeous 21-year-old woman. While Erin appreciated her shapely body, new height, ample breasts, and long, flowing hair, what she most fixated on her face. Erin still looked like herself, except more mature and much prettier. Her eyes seemed even darker blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's enthusiasm did not last long, as she was somehow disappointed. She was beautiful, but not <i>Natalie beautiful.</i> To Erin, she was now a \"hot girl-next-door\", and not a show-stopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess 'beautiful' is subjective\" Erin thought to herself.  As Erin started to come to grips with her transformation, she came to a realization. She didn't need to be as \"beautiful\" as Natalie. However, she did want to stand out from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, Erin's mind started racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, a thought came to Erin; if these candies are as powerful as advertised, could they change her biology?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of transcending humanity excited Erin, but she wasn't sure what direction she should go. Cat/dog/fish? Lame. Fairy? Too tiny. Elves/fauna/whatever? Not a Lord of the Rings fan. She was briefly tempted by the idea of being a succubus, but didn't like the idea of becoming a sex-obsessed demon and she was just a bit troubled by the idea of pledging her heart to the lord of darkness. Erin went through as many non-human options as she could, but was still unsatisfied. As she sat down, she noticed what looked like a book tucked under her bed. When she pulled it out, she saw it was one of her old X-Men comic books. Erin took a glance and saw Jean Grey on the cover. That's when it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A phoenix!\" Erin exclaimed. Not the superhero, but the actual mythical animal. Erin was fascinated by the concept of rebirth, renewal, and being able to rise after defeat. To her, the phoenix represented strength, resiliency, and autonomy. With her mind imagining all of the possibilities this wish could bring, Erin took a candy out of the bag and made the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had the beauty, grace, and power of the phoenix, physically and mentally. I wish I was a phoenix incarnate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin slapped herself on the head after making the wish, because she realized her wish was again subjective. Erin quickly thought of ways she could properly phrase her wish when she started to feel the room getting warmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, Nate must have turned the heat up or something,\" Erin thought. She went to the thermostat in the kitchen and was quite surprised when it said 62 degrees Fahrenheit. She lowered the thermostat ten degrees, but nothing changed. In fact, her body started getting warmer. At the same time, Erin felt a weird rumbling in her stomach. Little did she know, her entire DNA structure was being rewritten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin started to feel weary. Her body wasn't getting any cooler; in fact, it had already reached temperatures that would kill an average human being. To make matters worse, the rumbling in her stomach had spread throughout her entire body. Erin could see something moving under her skin. That's when lightning sparks started coming from the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Is this the wish coming to fruition?\" Erin said. She couldn't think long because her body had already become unbearably hot. Erin ran as fast as she could to her kitchen, took out the ice water pitcher and poured it all over herself. It gave her no comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening to me?!?!?!?\" Erin said, panicking. Her skin had started to roast and Erin could see smoke coming from her fingertips. The energy in her body was only growing as well. At that moment, Erin thought she was going to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin quickly ran upstairs to her room. She put a candy in her mouth and started thinking. Erin was horrified to taste ashes in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bag of candy in her hands, Erin made her wish. \"I wish I was somewhere where I could be alone, unseen and not hurt or destroy anyone/anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was quickly transplanted to a long, grassy field. She estimated she was fifty miles from home. In the trip, Erin failed to notice that her arms had started to turn black, with the rest of her body following. With no other options at the moment, all Erin could do was sit down and cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid wishes from a stupid child.\" Erin mumbled through her tears. \"OH GOD, IT HURTS SO MUCH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy surging throughout her body reached it's tipping point. With Erin barely containing herself, and with her body being literal ashes, she decided the best thing to do was face her imminent death with as much courage as she imagined she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stood up. She thought of the family she was leaving behind. Then, she decided to stop resisting and let the energy rip her body apart. Erin screamed as loudly as she could as her body exploded in a combination of flame and light, reducing her to dust. The outpouring of energy lasted for nearly 10 minutes before it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin woke up in a daze. She looked around. The field around her had been blackened to a crisp, standing out in stark contrast to the bright dusk sky above her. At that point, Erin realized that she was alive. \"I'm not dead? I'm not dead!\" Erin started to scream. \"I''m not dead!!! But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin staggered to her feet and examined herself. Unbelievably, her skin had not been damaged at all, save for two small scars, one under each arm.  Her clothing had not been as fortunate, as there wasn't even a shred of it left. As a whole, Erin felt different, but from what she could see, she looked as human as ever. Erin looked out onto the horizon and came to a terrible realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The candies! Oh god, they must have burnt up in the flames. How the hell am I going to get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin started pacing around, a funny thought came to her head. If the wish had made her a phoenix, could she...nah. No way. Not even possible. Still, with everything else that just happened, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at her arms again, and thought to herself \"If I can fly, show me how.\" Suddenly, her arms started tingling, and something started to sprout from them. At first Erin couldn't tell what it was, and then she realized...they were feathers. In a matter of moments, Erin's arms had turned to long, feathery wings.\"Holy fucking shit.\" Erin exclaimed. She started flapping her arms, but nothing happened. \"Don't tell me I'm like a penguin.\"  Erin grumbled. Suddenly, Erin eyes started to glow. Waves of radiant red and gold light started cascading from her wings. Erin could feel her feet leaving the ground. As she flapped her wings harder and harder, she started to rise higher and higher. With each flap, Erin's ascent started getting faster. Eventually, Erin found herself in the sky, maneuvering without constant flaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be real, right? I'm not actually flying....AHHH, I'M ACTUALLY FREAKING FLYING, THIS IS AMAZING.\" For 20 minutes, Erin felt nothing but euphoria. Erin had broken the glass ceiling of human evolution and was soaring way, way above it. Life felt so much more rich for her, the possibilities were endless. First however, she needed to go home and reassess things. Erin, suddenly recognizing exactly where her house was, headed that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she reached her house, Erin was relieved to see no cars in her driveway or lights on. Trying to be as discreet as possible, Erin descended in her backyard. Willing them to do so, Erin's wings stopped glowing and retreated back into her arms. Thankfully, no one noticed her. Erin retrieved the key for her backdoor and went into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin quickly went upstairs to her room. She looked on her bed and was stunned to see the bags of candies there. \"What else can go right today?\" Erin thought. She then walked over to her mirror and noticed that her \"rebirth\" had led to some changes. She had grown several inches, now standing at 6\"0.  Erin had put on some weight to compensate. Her body was still very curvy, but had quite a bit more muscle tone. Her butt was more defined. Her breasts had grown from C-cups to D-cups. Erin noticed her face had changed. It had sharpened somewhat, and lost any trace of youthful baby fat. Her eyes again stood out to her, as they were as blue as sapphires. Erin was now an adult woman; she estimated she was about 27. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look great, but competing in a beauty contest with Natalie seems pretty trivial now. Of course, misogynist idiots will go ga-ga over my body before trying to learn anything else about me. Freaking patriarchy.\" Erin exclaimed. She then realized that her brain had changed. Erin's cognitive abilities had received a massive boost, and thus, new ideas and complicated thought processes came easily to her. Of course simple thoughts still came to her, and she realized that she needed to put some damn clothing on. Erin chewed a candy and wished she was wearing clothing. Instantly, Erin was wearing a white t-shirt, a bra that fit, undergarments, jeans, socks and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, simple enough.\" Erin said. As Erin started to walk out her bedroom door, she saw her reflection.Erin liked the way she looked, but felt that it didn't reflect who she was anymore. She decided she needed to make some cosmetic changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew how to cut, dye, and style hair. I also wish I had scissors and dark red hair dye.\" They appeared before her. Erin pulled a chair up to her mirror, and sat down. She examined her long, brown hair. Erin had always loved having long hair, but it was time for a change. Erin took her scissors, grabbed a chunk of hair, and started cutting. The cutting was frenetic; Erin was moving at a rapid pace. Strands and clumps of hair fell to the floor. In about 20 minutes, Erin was done. Her hair was now a pixie cut with long bangs, a drastic change from the hair that was down to her hips. Erin looked at herself for 30 seconds, and then moved on to color. She went into the bathroom and applied the dark red dye all over her hair. Erin noticed her eyebrows and realized those could be changed too; she pulled out her tweezers, thinned them a little bit, and applied the dye to them as well. Erin was about to use her hair dryer when she felt her hands getting warm. Erin glided her hands over her hair and felt it get warm. She decided to increase the intensity, and in a matter of moments, both her hair and eyebrows were done. Erin washed them out and dried them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin went into her mother's room and got her makeup kit. She applied a dark brown eyeshadow, mascara, and eyeliner to her eyes. On her face, she put some concealer and foundation to hide blemishes. To finish it off, she applied blood red lipstick to her lips. Erin, still chewing a candy, wished she was wearing a black dress with straps and heels to complete the look. Erin took one of her mother's necklaces and put it on. Erin walked back to her mirror and took in her new look. \"It doesn't even look like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Erin was quite attractive, but she still projected innocence and cuteness; a guy could look at her as his best friend, but would never take her fully seriously. That was done with. Erin wasn't \"approachable hot\" anymore; she was \"full fledged adult vixen hot.\" Erin had the body of a bikini model, the face of a mature, beautiful, sophisticated and serious woman, the intellect of someone who could actually do more than just spew meaningless jargon, and a secret that would terrify most people. Erin had never felt this sexy or confident in her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin picked up her ID card and purse and was about to leave when she decided to make one more change. \"The name Erin (E-R-I-N) is cool, but conventional. I'm not conventional anymore. From now on, my name is Aeryn (A-E-R-Y-N). Aeryn Wilson\" Immediately, Erin's ID card changed to reflect that she was now Aeryn. For all intents and purposes, Erin Wilson was dead and gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeryn walked downstairs and headed out the door, prepared to head into the next phase of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped a stranger, and asked where the nearest nightclub was. \"Four blocks away\" he responded. Aeryn kept walking when all of a sudden she felt a large bang on the back of her head. She could barely process what was happening before the world slipped to darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aeryn woke up, she was laying in the back of an alley. Standing over her was a tall, dirty man. He looked to be in his early 40s and was wearing a faded blue t-shirt and ripped sweatpants. He looked like he hadn't shaved in weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck are you??\" Aeryn barked. \"The name's Alan, but that ain't important. What is important is that you're going to have sex with me. Right here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're out of your goddamn mind. HELP\" Aeryn screamed. Alan quickly pulled out a rusty knife and held it to her throat. \"Now, we can do this the easy way...or we can do it the painful way.\" Aeryn, in her terror, grabbed Alan's right forearm, which was holding the knife. Alan slapped her and stepped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't smart, you dumb broad. Now....now, you're gonna.\" Alan couldn't finish his sentence because he noticed his forearm was quite red.  \"Do you have some disease?\". Aeryn stammered no. Alan attempted to walk back over to her but stopped in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...now let's...holy shit, are you hot or is it just me?\" Alan had failed to notice that his forearm was growing redder and redder, with smoke starting to emanate from his skin. \"Don't you go anywhere..I'm gonna...oh my god, IT'S SO HOT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the fact that his body's internal temperature was skyrocketing, Alan started to get angry. \"You crazy bitch...did you inject me with something?\" Alan tried to walk over to her, but again stopped when he heard a squishing sound. Alan looked down and to his horror, noticed that his sneakers were beginning to melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?\" Alan screamed. His entire body was growing red and smoke was coming from every pore. His fingernails had begun to pop off and Alan noticed that he was beginning to lose his sight. Panicked, Alan ran out of the alley and began screaming for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP ME, HELP ME, SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME. I THINK I'M GOING TO DIE.\" Alan blurted. From there Alan's speech became slurred as his tongue roasted in his mouth. Strangers looked on as they saw the crazy man with burn holes in his clothing frantically running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, making animal screams at this point, sprinted into traffic and stood in the middle of it. Suddenly, his body exploded in flames. By the time an ambulance came, his body was nothing more but ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeryn watched the entire thing from the alley, mortified at what had happened. She began to feel dizzy and running to the nearest trash can, vomited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I killed another human being.\" Aeryn quietly said, shellshocked. She sat by herself in the alley, pondering what she would do next. </span></div></div>",

It was odd as she felt as if her insides were shifting inside of her. Lots of it seemed to be forming in her stomach and she almost felt like hurling. She guessed that perhaps changing in a boy was a different experience than turning into a girl as Nate did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to be sick\" said Erin as she, with the candies in hand, ran to the bathroom and closed the door behind her. Setting the jar of candies down, she looked in the mirror and gasped as she felt like her skin was crawling around her. Little by little, she could see her smoother skin becoming slightly rougher to the touch. There still weren't many blemishes but it was still consideably rougher than her usual smooth girly skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it is really is happening\" she said. She gasped as her hand, which had grown slightly bigger, went to her throat. It felt bumpier as she felt an Adam's apple form in her throat, making her voice a little deeper. Little by little, she witnessed other changes throughout her body. Her small and budding breasts slowly deflated ouf of her chest, leaving her bra empty. Her shoulders broadened slightly as well. Her waist got a little bigger as her butt and hips got smaller. Other than that, most things got a little bigger, as muscle started to form in her arms, legs, shoulders, and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went on, she also slowly felt herself rise up from the ground a bit as she grew a bit taller. She sprouted up to about 5'3 from her previous 4'11. By the time things started to slow down, her girl clothes were tight against her larger body. Then, the transformation moved up to her face and she looked in the mirror. She gasped as her face started to reform, her nose becoming a little bigger and her eyelashes becoming smaller. Her facial features rounded out to become more similar to Nate's when he was still a boy. In addition, her shoulder-length brown hair seemed to grow back into her head as it became a more male style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Erin started to think that they were done, she had forgotten one huge part. She felt small discomfort in her groin as her hands went down there. Slowly, she felt something emerge in her panties underneath her shorts. Without looking, she knew what it was. She knew that she wasn't carrying potential life anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now a boy where it mattered.</span></div></div>",

She'd always seen guys make a big deal out of how bad it hurt to get hit there, but she didn't feel anything special. Still, she was amazed at how quickly her soft member began to stiffen under her touch. \"So this is what it feels like to be a boy,\" she said, marveling at not only the changes to her body, but how different her voice sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, she was struck by how odd she looked. Not only did her pink and black short shorts look silly on her slightly fuzzy legs, but they accented the bulge in front to a nearly obscene level. On top of that, her black tank top that said 'Princess' in pink glitter seemed entirely out of place. Taking off her shirt, she could see the beginnings of muscular definition across her chest and shoulders and the thought struck her: \"No one will care if I go outside topless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she looked over herself, things didn't feel right. Nathan had taken several wishes to make himself an absolute bombshell, and she'd just gotten started. For a moment, she considered going back to her room, but the bathroom had a full length mirror on the back of the door and she wanted to be able to see herself change with each wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do I wish for next,\" she mused, sitting down on the toilet and crossing her legs like she would have before. That position lasted only long enough to pinch her new testicles painfully between her legs. \"Ow! That hurts... so that's what all the fuss is about.... ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the candy into her mouth she settled on her next wish...</span></div></div>",

However, there was something more pressing. Her clothes were extremely uncomfortable and looked so wierd on her male body. She knew what she had to change next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my clothes changed to fit the new me\" she wished. Almost intantly, the change was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felf her clothed shifting on her body and she looked down. Underneath her shirt, she saw her training bra vanish, as it wasn't needed anymore. Her black \"Princess\" tank top changed next. The \"Princess\" part vanished and the material started to loosen and become less tight against her chest. Sleeves formed at the top and the hem extended down to cover over her shorts a bit. Now, she was wearing a plain black t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, there were the shorts. Like the shirt, the shorts began to loosen and change color slightly. The black remained but the pink parts vanished and became black as well. As they loosened, the leggings extended down to just below her mid-thighs and gave plenty of space between them and her legs. A brown belt forming in the loops at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she felt shifting underneath the shorts. Peeking in them briefly, she ould see her pink panties fading to a bright white color as they became looser and the material became more like cotton. Before too long, she now had a pair of white underwear underneath the shorts. She felt such relief as her member didn't feel constricted anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Erin could no longer be mistaken for a girl as she now sported all male clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, just wow\" said Erin as she saw her new reflection in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

The few places she'd had a bra or pair of panties laying out had become places in the room where an undershirt or pair of boxers lay, but other than the changes in her clothing, the room was just as she left it. Her prized My Little Pony collection still covered one shelf, and elsewhere, stuffed animals guarded a full third of her bed from the advance of pink pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... this really needs to change...\" she said looking around the room. \"I wish my room would be what it should if I had grown up as a boy,\" she said, excitedly watching for the changes to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a blink, the My Little Pony collection vanished to be replaced with Halo action figures. Her pink pillows and stuffed animals gave way to a plain blue comforter that was tossed haphazardly over a bed that hadn't been properly made in weeks. The last thing to change that she noticed, and perhaps the most interesting, were her copies of Seventeen and Teen Fashion.The magazines themselves fluttered as they moved under her bed, the covers changing but vanishing before she could take a good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching under the bed, Erin was amazed to find that she had a small box of Playboy and Hustler... along with a copy of Busty Babes featuring a woman who was almost as stacked as her brother had become.  \"Wow,\" she said, looking over the magazines...</span></div></div>",

She began to think that perhaps she really wasn't old enough to appreciate things like this. She had to change that. It would also be a good chance for her to become her new sisters' age and hang out with her if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was old enough to really apreciate these, and that my clothes would grow with me\" she wished, adding the last part as an afterthought as she didn't want to destroy her clothes. It didn't take too long before the candies started to take effect on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, she felt herself shoot up in height, soaring over 6' to about 6'1. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Woah! The room looks so much smaller than it did before\" she noticed, as she ascended to a height she never would have gotten close to as a girl. Then, she felt other effects coming on. She felt her muscles begin to grow, as if she had been working out all these 'years' so to speak. She didn't become ripped or anything like that but she was now reasonably strong for a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the down side to all of this was the increase of hair throughout her body, particularly her chest, armpits, and legs. You get the idea. As she grew, she looked under her shirt (which was growing with her) and saw her new chest. Muscles and hair and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that will be something to get used too\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, her growth finished. Where Erin was once around 13 years old, now stood a hunky 21-year old male, reasonably in college like her new older sister.</span></div></div>",

Still, inside the body of the 21 year old male college student lay a mind that was very much a thirteen year old girl. \"But just like Nate made himself gorgeous, I can do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling off her tight fitting shirt, she looked at herself in the mirror closely. She had muscles, but they looked more like the muscles a person got from routinely doing physical labor than the model perfection she wanted. And it was so hard to see under the mat of chest hair she'd developed. \"I wish I was the kind of guy who kept his chest clear of fuzz,\" she said, not intending it as a real wish, but pleasantly surprised with the results. As chest hair receded into her body she realized that she was more solid than she'd first thought, but still not as well defined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be a heart throb out there... I wish... I wish I was three inches taller,\" she said, raising herself to a now towering height of 6'4\". \"Wow... this is really cool. And I wish I was really toned... like an underwear model.\" Across her body, muscles twitched, gaining mass and definition until she had perfect washboard abs and the kind of well defined arms that made women drool. In her pants, she could feel her new appendage getting stiffer as she looked at the dream boat of a man she was becoming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... I'm even turning myself on. I wish,\" she paused and thought for a moment if she really wanted to do what she'd thought of next. \"I wish I was attracted to girls like my sister instead of being attracted to guys,\" she said, not realizing that in addition to changing her sexual preference, she'd also ensured that she was most attracted to exceptionally busty women, and that Nate had become her definition of the 'perfect woman'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, at least one part of her was no longer rock hard at the mere sight of herself, even though the rest of her toned body still was. \"I really need to go see Nate... he's not going to believe this! Let's see... is there anything else I'm forgetting? Oh! He's working a lame job to pay for school... um.... I wish I was going to the same school as Nate on a foot ball scholarship. That should take care of just about everything. Oh, and a car... I wish I had an old corvette, but  perfectly restored, and that I knew how to drive it really well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to a wallet that had been sitting on her nightstand a pair of car keys appeared, all but begging her to get out of the house. \"Perfect,\" she said grabbing the keys and her wallet. Pulling on a tight fitting black tank top she grabbed a pair of sun glasses and headed downstairs for her car, but turned around before she left to retrieve the candies. \"Just in case,\" she said, pocketing the pack of magical sweets. </span></div></div>",

Erin actually started thinking about that and she was thinking that she should start referring to herself as a boy for now. First, there was her name. However, that was the convenient part as Erin could be spelled as Aaron and used as a boy's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple enough\" said Aaron as he walked out to his new car. He smiled as he walked out to the new Corvette in the driveway. He got in and put his seatbelt on and started the car as if it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really working\" said Aaron with a smile as he backed out of the driveway and started driving out of the neighborhood. For the first time, Aaron could properly explore his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorvallis, Oregon. Home to where the Wilson family lived. Luckily, that made it easy for Aaron to guess where his new sister Natalie was. She was working at a cafe next the college campus nested in this city: Oregon State University, home of the Beavers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't be too hard\" said Aaron as he effortlessly drove down the roads, as if he had done it many times in the past. It was easy to guess which restaurant Natalie now worked it. It was called The Lodge and it was right next to the campus, an easy place for college students to get a part-time job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron knew the route by heart and easily found the restaurant. He smiled as he was eager to talk to Natalie about the candies and their new lives. He walked right into the restaurant without much effort as it wasn't too crowded. However, he did get some looks from some girls and one wanted an autograph. Aaron had to remind himself that he wished to be on the football team and obviously he was a famous guy now. He did what she asked for anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, how may I help you?\" said the girl a t the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get a table for two?\" asked Aaron. The girl lookec confused as she didn't see anyone with Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming later\" he said simply and the girl took that answer. Long story short, she escorted him to a table that was big enough for two and left him to be while he waited for a waitress. However, Aaron had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Natalie was my waitress\" wished Aaron, popping a small candy in his mouth.</span></div></div>",

Oh sure, she wasn't dressed like a Hooters girl or anything, Natalie was a classy girl after all. But still, with the full juicy rear end she'd wished for and the monster jiggling G cups, there was little you could do to make her look less amazing. \"Wow Natalie,\" he said with a warm grin. \"You look great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you,\" she bubbled, not recognizing who she was talking to and mistaking him for just another customer. While most of the women in the cafe might have been head over heels just looking at Aaron's chiseled good looks, Natalie was still more interested in other women than men, having made no wishes to change her preference. \"What can I get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie... It's me,\" Aaron said, dropping his voice to a low whisper. \"Your sister Erin... well, until I found your candies at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\" Natalie said stunned, quickly sitting down at the table across from Aaron. \"You found my candies... wait... and you made yourself a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not that different than what you did. And it's really cool to be so... different. And you look so amazing. Here, is there any way we can talk for a few minutes? I don't want to get you in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until the end of my shift at eleven. I'm covering for a friend, and I need the hours anyway. School is really expensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you didn't take care of that when you were changing yourself,\" Aaron said, leaning back in the booth and admiring his sister. \"Here, I have an idea,\" he said as he popped a candy in his mouth. \"I wish my sister was going to school on a cheer leading scholarship and didn't have to work in this cafe to pay for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, Natalie's clothing changed from the sensible work attire she'd been wearing to a tight fitting university cheer leader uniform, complete with micro skirt and midriff bearing top. The school letters strained across her massive chest and the cafe name tag disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Natalie could respond, a waitress came to the table with a name tag that read Katie. Evidently, since Natalie no longer worked here, she'd been unable to get someone to cover her shift for her. \"Oh good,\" Katie said, paying most of her attention to Aaron. \"I see your friend found you.\" Obvious disappointment tinged her voice. Even though she had a boyfriend, Aaron was quite a sight and would have been a ton of fun to flirt with. But seeing the football hunk with the busty cheer leader... she got the feeling she didn't have a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not a friend,\" Aaron said, taking in the petite brunette's lithe figure and fixating just a bit on the exposed cleavage of her C-cup breasts. As Erin, he'd heard his mom warn him that he'd have to deal with men who never looked above his neck. As Aaron, he was starting to understand why.  \"Um, this is my sister Natalie,\" he said, hoping she hadn't noticed the bosom staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. sister,\" Katie said with a smile. \"Well what can I get for you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a pair of beers and a bottomless plate of fries,\" Natalie cut in, trying to make things simple and to get rid of the waitress. \"If we want more after that, we'll let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" the waitress said, turning away and mincing off on her four inch heals, firm buttocks almost exposed by the micro skirt she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Aaron said, watching her walk away. Not realizing he still had a candy in his mouth from changing his sister into a cheer leader, he said...</span></div></div>",

Natalie looked a little concerned at her new brother's behavior. Obviously, Aaron had wished for male preferences now and he was just getting used to them. She didn't want him to get hurt at all because of this. She gently placed a delicate hand on Aaron's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you can always tell me if you need anything. I do still remember how things worked when I was a guy\" said Natalie, giggling as she said that. Aaron smiled but ended up looking at her hige and firm breasts tucked in her cheerleading top. <i>'Maybe that is my ideal woman. Maybe that Kate girl...'</i> thought Aaron. However, his thought process was interrupted with Kate returning. However, she seemed to be much more happy then she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again big boy, here's your beer\" she said with a very seductive tone. Natalie was not pleased with that Kate seemed to be insinuating. Was she flirting with her brother? She didn't like the look she was giving Aaron. Not only that, Aaron seemed to have trouble talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks\" said Aaron nervously. He wondered how she changed so much but it seemed like she liked him more now. He took a look at Natalie and knew that he had a weakness for the traits she possessed; huge breasts, firm butt, and a beautiful face and all of that. Maybe he should incorporate that into this new girl and have a real girlfriend. It was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess I'll be leaving. I'll see you at home Aaron\" said Natalie as she waved good bye to Aaron, leaving him all alone with Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the beginning of things going downhill.

In fact, he didn't think he'd ever managed to get to the bottom of a glass before Katie slipped back into his booth, usually sitting in his lap, and poured him a refill from her pitcher. Somehow, in an increasingly drunken haze, Aaron wound up telling her about the candies.  Not what he had already done with them... but that he had them, and what kind of power they had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying you can change anything with these candies of yours?\" Katie said as she bent over Aaron's table, giving him a good look down her shirt while she wiped down the table. \"Anything you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Aaron said, smiling and somewhat mesmerized by the view. \"I mean, anything really. They're like gum drops... gob stoppers. You suck on it and as long as it hasn't all gone yet, you can make wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're drunk honey,\" she said, leaning in to kiss Aaron on the lips before standing back up. \"I don't think that kind of magic exists anywhere.

So I just wish we were at your place now,\" he said drunkenly. \"And that you were naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Katie exclaimed as they appeared in her small one bedroom apartment. Not only had they popped into existence in her living room, but her work clothes now lay strewn about the room, as though she'd been in a great hurry to get out of them. \"They really do work,\" she said excitedly, rushing over to Aaron and jumping into his lap, grinding into his stiffening member and pressing her full C-cups close to him.

The look was busty to be sure, but by no means unreal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess that's not too bad,\" Katie said, admiring her new assets before leaning in to kiss her boyfriend. The kiss stopped moments later when she felt a swelling in her chest, pushing the two apart. DDs gave way to EEs, and even such massive cups as those could not encompass the swell of her growing breasts. Soon, her chest was adorned with a large pair of F-cups that lay down over most of her chest, hanging low as such large natural breasts tend to do. Her nipples had doubled in size becoming rock hard points at the center of saucer sized areolas. \"Oh my... no no no... I liked my perky boobs! Look at these,\" she cried out grabbing hold of two handfuls of soft, yielding breast flesh. \"I want them to be up high and perky, it's no good to be big and saggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think the wish is done yet,\" Aaron said, staring only at the beautiful bounty of breasts before him. \"I think Natalie is still bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, faint scars formed around her nipples, showing where a skilled surgeon had performed both a lift and augmentation. Her breasts surged forward as they were filled with over a thousand CCs of high profile silicone implant, passing Natalie's G cups and settling into a comfortable H-cup range. \"Aaron... what did you do to me,\" she said, inspecting the massive breasts that sat atop her chest. The twin melons formed a valley of cleavage even while she sat naked and unsupported in her boyfriends lap. Had one looked from behind, the sides of her gigantic jugs could easily be seen from behind. Each breast was easily larger than her head, and combined they dominated her otherwise petite body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're beautiful,\" Aaron said, stupefied by breasts and booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" Katie said nervously as she looked at him from nearly a foot away, simply to give room between them for her massive bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just wish...\"</span></div></div>",

However, the effects were almost immediate. Thanks to being naked, she didn't have to worry about destroying any of her clothes which would probably be shredded if she were wearing clothes. She felt a soft feelings coming from her rear as her hands went to her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?!\" said Kate as she felt her butt start to inflate underneath her hands. Aaron had wished for it to match the boobs so she knew that it was going to be large just like them. She could feel the womanly fat and tissue form underneath her skin as it pushed outwards. As it did, she felt it harder to push into it, as her butt was becoming firmer in addition to becoming larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis inflation also extended to her hips. She could them expanding too, not becoming unreal but pretty much borderline in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her rear was done, it easily covered almost half of the space on the bed (it wasn't a large bed).

It was more like an evil smile, not like Aaron in his drunken state knew any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's save later improvements for later hunny\" said Kate into his ear seductively.

She didn't need to work anymore so she went straight home after leaving Aaron with Kate. However, despite knowing that she didn't need to work anymore, she was really worried for her new brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried for Aaron. He probably can't control himself right now since he just changed from my former sister\" said Natalie as she sat on the couch. She was at a loss as to what to do right now. She had a bad feeling about Kate. Something about the girl seemed odd to her now. Thanks to her new memories, she thought of Kate as a childhood friend, even though Natalie knew that it was a result of the candies. However, she was really uncomfortable now about how things were planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one thing was for certain. If Kate hurt her brother in any way, she would punish her....severely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will treat my brother like a piece of meat.

She knew that she also felt a little differently towards Aaron now then she did when they were Nate and Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey always had a good relationship. They were actually step-siblings. Nate was born from Lynda and another guy while Erin was born from Mike and another woman. Thus, they weren't blood related. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie could only wonder if such a thing would help shape their relationship from here on.</span></div></div>",

In bits and pieces, last night came back to him.. the amazing sex and the wishes that had gotten him here. One thing was for sure, the thirteen year old girl Erin was becoming more and more of a distant memory, especially as he watched Katie work her magic on his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning stud,\" she said as she pushed her dark brunette hair out of the way to kiss his lower head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm..\" Aaron moaned, enjoying the sensations that accompanied what Katie was doing to his newest appendage. \"Morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking honey, that you need to get one of those candies and get to work on me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Aaron said, somewhat bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I love my new curves,\" she said, lying only a little. She liked being busty and curvy but not this much. \"But I'm only 5'3\", so it really dominates my whole body... so maybe if we scale things back a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it,\" Aaron said, sliding out of bed and digging the packet of candies out of his pants pocket. \"Yeah, I guess you do kind of look goofy that way. Hey,\" he cried out startled as his girlfriend threw a pillow at his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never tell your girlfriend she's goofy,\" Katie said, trying to fold her arms across her chest and glare. Not being used to the proportions of her chest, what she managed looked more like an indignant pout than a really stern glare... and Aaron just found it cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, here,\" he said, popping a candy in his mouth. \"I wish that Katie was six feet tall, with long sexy legs that look great in high heels or stockings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic wrapped around Katie instantly, drawing her figure out and putting some additional space between her massive bust and her full, shapely ass, making her narrow waist look naturally tapered and slender. But the real change, and the majority of her extra height, came in the transformation of her legs. Not only did they lengthen and stretch, but they filled out from the almost scrawny lean form they'd had before to a lush, toned set of legs that would draw the eye upward to her plump, juicy ass. Finally, the magic worked on her feet, altering them slightly to feel more comfortable in heels than flats, and making Katie a natural at walking in even 4\" heels, as if she weren't tall enough already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's not quite what I had in mind, but... wow,\" she said, running a hand down her new and sexier legs. \"More Aaron, before that candy runs out... I want more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he replied, feeling his shaft become rock hard as he looked at Katie. Still, there was room to improve a few more things... \"I wish...\"</span></div></div>",

Primarilly, she felt the feelings going towards her chest, arms, and legs. Suddenly, her chest started to fill with muscle and she felt as she felt tight muscles underneath her skin. Her arms got slightly bigger as they became muscles that clearly came from constantly working out at gyms and such. Similarly, the same happened with her legs. Her already shapely and long legs became toned with more muscle as she felt them under her skin too. In the end, she didn't look like a bodybuider but clearly quite strong for a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, nice Aaron\" said Kate with a smile, with a seductive tone to the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you\" said Aaron.

They couldn't see into the closet but they knew that they were there now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you hot stuff. See you later!\" said Kate as she kissed him, getting the correct responde from Aaron.

Instead, he found himself in a small bedroom that contained two beds, neither of which was neatly made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was trying to get his bearings, the door opened, admitting a man who was every bit as well muscled as Aaron had made himself, though perhaps 3 to 4 inches shorter. He was also wearing nothing but a towel. \"Oh, hey bro,\" the man in the towel said, opening the trunk at the foot of one of the beds and beginning to rummage. \"Look, thanks for agreeing to hook up elsewhere with your girl last night. Amanda's parents are all over her if she brings dude into the house and they don't approve of the Alpha Roe rep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Aaron said, now utterly confused. \"Sure, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know it's rough when you have to crash at a chick's place. I mean, half the time you get there and their bed is still covered with extra pillows and stuffed animals and shit. I mean, wtf is up with that anyway?\" As he spoke, he dropped his towel and began to get dressed, showing absolutely no embarrassment at being nude in front of another man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Aaron said, still trying to figure things out. <i>And why would guys be bothered by a few stuffed animals on a bed anyway?</i> Aaron thought. <i>They usually get moved to the shelf above the bed before you go to sleep. Except for the one that you pick that night to cuddle with, and that one gets to stay.</i>  Somehow though, he figured that explaining that to this other fellow would only make things awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I have to book it if I'm going to make it to Seller's 'Theories of Social Justice', I'll catch you at practice tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, later,\" Aaron said, sitting on the other bed and fishing out a candy. As soon as the door closed, she sighed heavily. \"This is getting too confusing... I wished to go back to my room, and I wound up here. But yesterday when I was wishing to change myself, I never wished to change where I lived. My room at the house even changed. So why am I here now?\" Popping a candy in his mouth, he thought for a moment on how to phrase his next wish carefully. \"I wish that I understood everything about my life, and how things changed when wishes are made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, it became clear. He was in 'his' room at the Alpha Roe Kappa house. The fraternity was populated mostly by members of the football team, along with some well placed sons of politicians and business men. The Alpha Roes had made it a mission to ensure that the people in their house who came to college to play sports had solid foundations in life if they didn't make it into the NFL or elsewhere after college. Some of the Alpha Roes did make the big time in the NFL and NBA and remained sponsors of their fraternity, but those who didn't often found the help and support they needed to make it into other high paying professions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wishing to be on the football team hadn't gotten him here. It was his last wish for Katie that had changed things enough for him to get here. By wishing that she was athletic, he gave himself a girlfriend that was both stunningly hot, and that pushed him to be his best. And Katie was always pushing him to be his best... she really wanted to see him with an NFL contract. If it wasn't for her, he never would have gone so far as pledging to the Alpha Roes. So sure, he still had a room at his parent's place. They lived in town, so it made sense. But he rarely used it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is getting to be a bit much,\" he said as the candy began to melt away in his mouth. \"It's cool, but it's really heady. I wish I was with Natalie so I could talk about all this right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal candies remaining: 18</span></div></div>",

I'll do it.\" Aaron takes a candy and exclaims, \"I wish Katie and I were futanari!!\" As soon as Aaron finished saying that, Natalie let out a small laugh as swirling light engulfed Aaron, his masculine form losing mass rapidly, becoming svelte and feminine. His hair grew out and down to the small of his back, as his facial features lost all masculinity, now resembling what would be a 21-year old Erin. His testes pulled up into his body, replaced by a feminine opening the old Erin remembered quite well. As (now her [again]) hips widened and waist contracted, giant F-cup breasts burst from her chest, as all body hair save her head hair, eyeborws, and luscious eyelashes vanished forever. Her height was last thing to change, going back down to 5' 7\". While her body was done changing, her clothes were now adapting, shrinking and stretching where appropriate. Underneath her clothes, the familiar undergarments of her days as Erin returned, a bra and a pair of panties, but she felt a light strain in the panties, and realized it was her still intact penis. While most of her \"Aaron\" clothes didn't change, including the letterman jacket only the football players could wear and the Alpha Roe t-shirt, her pants shrank up and became a denim miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, Erin looked in the mirror. She saw she looked just like a woman, hell, just like what a 21-year old version of her original girl self would look like, but she peeked into her skirt and panties to see her dual equipment and realized the wish did what it was intended to do. \"Wait... If I pretty much look like and am as big as a normal woman, why am I still in this jacket and shirt, and why do I still have memories of playing football and joining the Alpha Roes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie, now looking like she was 16 again, smirked, smiles, giggles, then says, \"I kind of tricked you. I wanted to see if my theory would work, and I saw you were getting in over your head with this boy wish, so I convinced you to make that wish, having made a wish that could only activate if you make <i><b>THAT</b></i> particular wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Erin exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I made a wish that defined the properties of futanari, giving them the strength of two gorillas and the speed of an ostrich, all while having the same frame and musculature of a fit lithe woman. I also made it that the wish picked 20% of the world's population at random and made that futas as well, and the Alpha Roes are now an all-futa fraternity. In addition, you've moved back home in this new iteration of reality, so if you need me, I won't be far away, since I decided to go back to high school, but am keeping my new college-level intellect. This way I can get a sweet scholarship, save my money, save my candies, and get back some youth. Well, anyway, now I know I can set up wishes in anticipation of other wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin groaned at her sister, but then said, \"I think I'll give it a try... What about Katie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still an item, don't worry.\" Natalie says. \"Now, if you don't mind, I have to study for AP calculus, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining Candies: 16<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Erin...</span></div></div>",

And her legs, the amazingly well formed legs, bare and on display... \"Aaron!\" Natalie hissed at him, snapping him back to reality. \"What are you doing in the girls changing room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" he said, then covered his mouth at how easily he'd cursed. Had he still been a thirteen year old girl his mother would have tanned his hide for that kind of language. \"Um, I wished to be where you were so we could talk....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Natalie,\" another voice came through the fog as a stunning young Asian girl walked up to the two of them, her towel easily enveloping her petite frame and her long dark hair spilling down nearly to her knees. \"Can I borrow your shampoo, I can't find mine. Oh, hey Aaron,\" she continued. \"Katie's not in here at the moment, and you better scoot before coach catches you in here again. Not that I mind, Natalie, you have such a hot brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Yeah Kim, you can borrow my shampoo. And Aaron, you'd best wait outside, I'll be out in five minutes... um, make that ten,\" she said, considering the work she'd have to do to make her hair presentable. \"Then I'll be right out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Aaron,\" Kim said, taking a bottle of shampoo from Natalie and putting a little extra wiggle in her petite firm ass as she walked away from the handsome football player. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking out into the hall, Aaron breathed a sigh of relief that he hadn't been caught... and it seemed like at least some of the girls expected him to sneak into the girls locker room... and that they didn't mind. \"What kind of person am I becoming?\" He wondered as he waited for Natalie. </span></div></div>",

It made him wonder if he ever did things like that as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wierd\" said Aaron as he heard the door opening. Natalie came out, wearing simple clothing that amazing turned Aaron on a bit. She was wearing a pair of jean short-shorts with a pink tank top and ballet flats. <i>'Wow'</i> thought Aaron as he tried to control himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Control yourself Aaron. Sheesh\" said Natalie, smiling a bit as she did. She was teasing him, which was something she was finding quite amusing about boys. She then noticed the bag of candies Aaron had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how many are left?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"18\" said Aaron with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"18 huh? Better be careful with the rest\" muttered Natalie to herself. Then, Aaron had a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing here at this hour?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was jogging for a while and came here after I was done. I've got a figure to keep up now. Believe it or not, not only did my scholarship change with your wish, my major also became Dance\" said Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's quite a change\" said Aaron. Then, he continued. \"So, why is it not surprising to see me in the women's room?\" asked Aaron with concern. That question seemed to gnaw at him. Natalie looked him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your reputation now seems to be that you're a bit of a womanizer and sort of a pervert because you try to sneak in often. Most girls actually don't mind because they think you're hot\" said Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so too right?\" smirked Aaron. Natalie blushed and turned away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Maybe\" was her small reply. Aaron chuckled a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I assume you've been using those candies to 'improve' Katie?\" asked Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of\" said Aaron, rubbing the back of his head a bit nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did to be more careful. Those are mine after all!\" said Natalie. It was kind of odd since she was now the younger sibling but she was used to being older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ok\" said Aaron, still a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I'd like a few of those just in case\" demanded Natalie, extending her hand out. Aaron knew that it was only fair so he grabbed the bag and took out a few candies and gave them to Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" said Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandies with Aaron: 14<br>\r\nCandies with Natalie: 4<br>\r\nTotal Candies left: 18</span></div></div>",

Revving the powerful muscle car to life, he peeled out of the parking lot and headed for Katie's apartment. A block away, he found her jogging down the side walk. She'd changed into a pair of black jogging shorts that looked spray painted on her amazing ass and a pale blue sports bra that could barely contain her tremendous cleavage. For a moment, he just slowed down to watch her jog, eyes mesmerized by every swing and bounce of her breasts and every jiggle of her ass. Even more intoxicating was the power in her piston like thighs as she propelled herself down the side walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he allowed himself to pull even with her along side the curb and rolled down his window. \"Hey there hot stuff,\" he said with a smile. \"How about you hop in and I take you home... I promise not to tell your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, very funny Aaron,\" she said, leaning into the car window and giving him an amazing view down her cleavage.

No longer had she been out jogging, but reality had changed so that Aaron had just picked her up from the same workout that Natalie had been at. In the back seat of his car, a gym bag and a pair of pom-poms appeared in university orange and black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not all, I wish I wasn't just any cheerleader, I wish I was head cheer leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the car, nothing seemed to change, but across campus, people who had been cheerleaders suddenly became girls who didn't measure up to Katie's high standards, which generally meant girls that didn't fit her idea of how busty and sexy a cheerleader should be.

He grew even taller, stopping at a staggering height of six foot seven as he became one of the most gifted college athletes in the country, easily having the size, speed, and stamina to play professional ball. And several pro teams were talking to him, encouraging him to consider relocating after he graduated. But Katie wasn't done yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I wish that I didn't have to work at that stupid cafe anymore, and that I had plenty of money without having to work very hard for it,\" she said, then stopped in surprise when another bag formed next to her cheerleading bag, this one containing a collection of high heeled shoes and skimpy outfits. On her hip, a small tattoo of a playboy bunny appeared, along with another tattoo of brambles and roses along the small of her back. \"Wait, what did that do?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It changed your job. You're already a cheerleader and dancer, now you're also a stripper,\" Aaron said, smiling at how sexy she was looking. \"I think you only have to work one or two days a week because you make so much money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's okay. But I wish I got payed for being a cheerleader instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the second bag in the back went away and the first one changed from being a university bag to a bag that sported the logo of the Portland Trailblazers, the NBA basketball team up state. Physically, she changed a little as well, her age going from twenty one to twenty four as she became old enough to have graduated college and moved on to a job as a Blazer dancer. The magic rippled again, making her older a second time, advancing her age to twenty six as it reconciled her wish to be on the field with Aaron during football games. Now, not only was she a Blazer dancer during basket ball season, she had gone from head cheerleader to Assistant Coach. Her artificially enhanced bust settled a bit and her face became a little more mature, but otherwise very little changed as she aged the five years from twenty one to twenty six. The cheerleaders at school would remember that she had <i>been</i> head cheerleader years ago, but currently that spot would be held by one of her students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow... that was a lot,\" she said, reeling a bit from the last set of changes. \"I think..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandies with Aaron: 1<br>\r\nCandies with Katie: 9<br>\r\nCandies with Natalie: 4<br>\r\nTotal remaining: 14</span></div></div>",

However, for her next plan, since she was Assistant Coach now, she needed Natalie for her next plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time, the day went by normally. Aaron had to go to classes so he had to leave Katie by herself. Katie said to herself that, maybe if Aaron behaved like a good boy, she'll get him out of college soon enough. Aaron snickered at that comment before kissing her. His hormones were raging, overpowering the used-to-be little girl.

She wanted to get Natalie on her side and she had the perfect leverage. As a busty girl now, Natalie did want to be head cheerleader. Katie could make it so. However, she didn't know that Natalie was who she was because of the candies. she figured that she was just a normal cheerleader now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, she saw Natalie eating her lunch at a nearby table.

I'm going to make you the perfect head cheerleader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you..\" Natalie started  to ask but was cut off by Katie's first wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that Natalie had all the dancing skills and athleticism to be the best college cheerleader in the country,\" Katie started with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowledge poured into Natalie's mind, dance routines, choreography, costume design and all the best music to work with. More than that, her body became more limber and lighter while retaining it's curvaceous shape, allowing her to easily preform feats of complex gymnastics despite the immense size of her GG bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a good start,\" Katie said with a smile, \"but we're not done yet. You need to be head cheerleader and that means more than just being talented. It's social, political and a whole lot more. And right now, you don't fit the part completely. So, I wish you were not only head cheerleader, but also president of the Sigma Delta Delta sorority,\" she said, naming the sorority on campus that was most well known for taking only the most beautiful young women and throwing the wildest parties. It was rumored that in order to make it into the SDDs, a girl had to prove her beauty by steeling a man from another woman who wasn't in the sorority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think that's good enough,\" Natalie said standing to leave. \"Thank you coach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not done yet Natalie,\" Katie said, judging how much candy she had left to wish with. She'd have to be quick if she wanted to get more than one more wish out. \"I wish you dressed more like a girl with your figure and your position in Sigma Delta Delta is expected to,\" she said, thinking carefully about how that one needed to be phrased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wish had exactly her desired effect, transforming Natalie's outfit from simple and comfortable (if girly) jeans and fitted tops to a collection of short skirts and shorts, tight, low cut tops and party dresses that had little enough material to be able to be folded up and put in a purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's a bit much coach, really, why?\" Natalie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, you have so much potential, and I really want to see you tap into it,\" she said, hoping Natalie would believe her. \"That, and I'm really hoping you can see how much I care and talk to Aaron for me, I'm hoping you can help me convince him to get more serious and propose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wo,\" Natalie said, surprised by Katie's request. \"That's a lot to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I really wish you would help me,\" she said as the candy melted in her mouth at last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did she make the wish in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandies Aaron has: 1<br>\r\nCandies Katie has: 8<br>\r\nCandies Natalie has: 4<br>\r\nTotal candies left: 13</span></div></div>",

This made Katie smile. She knew the wish didn't count but she was glad for Natalie's offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\" said Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie began to wonder about how did things come to this. At the begnning of all this, she want to be the successful business type of girl. Now, she had pretty much become one of the more devious type of girls, given the rumors to join the sorority. With this new reality, Natalie gained memories that now confirmed such memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh man, don't tell me I really...'</i> thought Natalie. However, she did. She had used her looks and some newly learned 'techniques' that surely weren't PG-13 to steal a man from someone else once. Suppsedly, they had broken up now months ago according to the new memories in Natalie's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie now had to worry about many things. Like Aaron before her, she seemed to be succumbing to her hormones and new desires. She didn't want to be a bad girl but, in some ways, that was exactly what she was becoming. She began to wonder if the new way of thinking that was starting to invade her mind would influence any future wishes she might make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, Katie had almost wished for her to talk to Aaron about proposing. She really didn't want to do that. This was getting way out of hand but she didn't know if she could stop it. Maybe she should use of the 4 candies she has with her or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I should get going. Nice talking to you....head cheerleader\" said the older Katie as she picked up her purse and walked away from the table, eager to resume her plan to make her life grander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad that she didn't really bother to pay attention though. As she had made wished before, one candy had dropped out of her bag, something Natalie noticed that didn't tell her. Now that she was gone, Natalie picked up the candy, adding one more to her collection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Natalie should make a wish, to see where her way of thinking is going right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandies Aaron has: 1<br>\r\nCandies Katie has: 7<br>\r\nCandies Natalie has: 5</span></div></div>",

She wanted to scream but stifled it as her breasts began to hurt. The flat surfaces began to swell as two b cup breasts pushed outward. Her erect nipples pushing against the white latex.

The candies weren't sent by a friend or someone who wanted to do you a favor.  It was sent by someone who truly hated someone in your family.

You didn't remember it as it really was, you remembered that Erin had been dad's favorite.  That dad thought of her as his real child and you was just his wife's boy.  Resentment grew in you, not just for your dad, but also for Erin.  You now thought of Erin not as your little sister, but now you thought of her as \"the little princess who stole you dad's love.\"  You didn't mean princess in a good way.  This is why you wanted her to know what is happening but not be able to do anything about it.  That reminded you since you still had a candy in your mouth.  \"I wish that Erin couldn't let anyone know that something is happening here.\"  You was going to make it so that no one would believe her if she told anyone, but it's better this way.  There is a certain horror in when something is happening and you can't do anything about it.  Not even confide in a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Erin is handled, the next thing is to get this 'revenge' on the road for dad.  You wanted something slow.  Something that you could watch and that would build, just like your imagined anger which had been building since you was two years old and Erin had stolen all your father's affection from you.  But no one can steal one's affection.  It's your affection to give and in your mind dad had chosen not to give it so he should be the one.  Even if he wouldn't notice anything was wrong.  So you made a wish.  It was a small wish.  It was a subtle wish, but it would start the ball rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that dad would lose all of his enjoyment for sports and replace it with an enjoyment of woman's fashions, especially teen fashions.\"</span></div></div>",

You wanted it to take its time and you couldn't be with your dad all the time to see what was happening.  But after a couple days you noticed your first inkling of something happening.  Your dad had brought home a \"17 Magazine\" for Erin.  It was supposed to be a new magazine but you could tell it had been opened and read.  You had assumed by your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw the magazine you heard your dad say when he gave it to Erin that he had bought a subscription for her.  He also wanted to know what other magazines that Erin would want.  He had gotten a list and subscribed to only those that were specifically for teen girls.  He knew that those always had lots of information about fashion.  His fashion interest started slowly as it was supposed to.  At the beginning he was only interested in clothes.  But as his interest grew more aspects of fashion invaded his conscience.  Apparel was obviously first, but then accessories to go with them like shoes, purses and scarves.  Next he became interested in jewelry and finally makeup tips.  He always preferred fashions for teens, but he also broadened his interest in fashion for young adults and then fashions for women his own age and older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enjoyment of sports was going in reverse.  In the beginning the lesser sports was abandoned.  He list interest in bowling which he never played but was on TV on the weekends and so he watched it.  He stopped buying, 'Sports Illustrated\" weekly.  He stopped reading the back pages of the newspaper.  Soon he wouldn't even look up the standings.  He would find excuses to watch other programs on TV which actually pleased Lynda, who didn't mind that Mike was starting to read her Cosmo.  Mike would steer conversations with his friends away from sports or just walk away when he could.  His friends didn't like when Mike talked about fashions, but because of the first wish didn't think it was strange that Mike wanted to talk about that instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was time to make another wish.</span></div></div>",

These were all subtle things but you noticed them.  You also noticed what wasn't being recorded and how little time your dad would spend in the sport section of the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought up going to a game which was a really great matchup and your dad finding an excuse not to go.  The excuse was plausible, but you didn't think it was true.  So the first wish had been working fine, now it was time for the second wish.  You couldn't really see if this worked but you assumed it would.  \"I wish,\" you said after popping a candy into your mouth, \"that dad would always pee sitting down.\"  No one would notice this, but it was definitely a change in your dad's life.  Your dad actually liked this wish, it gave him more time to read the fashion magazines that he now truly loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you thought about it.  Maybe Erin shouldn't be just a bystander.  She should change a bit too.  So before the candy was gone you said, \"I wish that Erin would throw out her panties after using them instead of putting them into the hamper.\"  It'll take a few weeks before she ran out of underwear, you would make another wish for her before that happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike had to pee.  It was a normal thing that happens every day.  In fact he had to pee badly.  He rushed to the bathroom and pulled down his zipper.  He reached into his pants to get his penis and there was his briefs in the way.  Her had to pee so badly that he unbuttoned his jeans and then quickly pulled down his pants.  Then since his pants were down he turned around (out of reflex) and sat down.  He didn't touch his penis, gravity pointed it towards the floor for him.  The problem was that the seat wasn't down.  He didn't fall in.  When he was done with his business he decided on two things.  One that trying to pull his penis through his briefs wasn't worth the effort.  That it was easier to simply pull it all down and sit.  He would never stand to pee again.  He also decided that Lynda was right and he always made sure the seat was down on the toilet.  There wasn't any reason for Lynda (or anyone else) to notice that Mike never stood to pee again.  But Lynda did appreciate that the seat was always down in the bathroom.  At least it was always down after Mike used it, you not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda and Mike were also spending more time together.  Mike's viewing habits had changes and without watching so much sport's programming there was more things that Mike and Lynda could watch together.  Not just fashion programs, but other stuff that they both liked such as dramas.  Also, Mike volunteered to go shopping with Lynda when she was clothes shopping.  It was nice for Mike to see the stuff he read about in the stores.  Lynda enjoyed the time together and didn't wonder why Mike was so interested in woman's fashions.  She took it in stride like she took his fascination with baseball which had bored her.  At least fashion had some practicality to it.  Besides, Mike's new insights on clothing were getting quite helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days for the wish to sink in you made another wish.  The first one was easy, you knew you had to make it.  \"I wish that mom would buy pull-up diapers in Erin's size and start putting them into Erin's panty drawer.\"  This had to be done, soon Erin would run out of panties.  But even with all that, at this time you didn't make her wear the diapers, you just gave her something to wear when she ran out of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next wish was harder.  You could have simply 'forced' Mike into buying and wearing girl's clothing.  He would have thought it was his decision, but it would have been the wish.  You would do that eventually, but not yet.  But it was too soon for that.  You decide to do something even more shocking.  Well maybe shocking isn't the right word, disturbing is better although with the first wish no one will have a problem with it.  With the last of the candy dissolving in your mouth you said, \"I wish dad would slowly drop all of his men friends and develop lasting friendships with girls around fifteen-years-old.\"  There wasn't anything sexual about it.  Dad would have no more sexual attraction to his new friends than he did to the old ones.  But if anyone thought about it for a while (and no one would because of the first wish.  That first wish was key to everything)  people would be worried about it and the authorities would probably be called.</span></div></div>",

He had read it before and now he was looking through it for some makeup tips that he had previously seen in this magazine.  He didn't wear women's clothes or makeup but the topic interested him greatly.  To Mike you didn't have to wear makeup to enjoy reading about it any more than you needed to play baseball to read the daily sports columns.  None of whom he had read for quite a while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Mike was learning the beginnings of how to put on eye makeup.  Well this wasn't makeup 101, but was more advanced than that.  The article was on how to blend two (or sometimes three) shades of eyeshadow to get a certain look.  There were also tips on how to use eyeliner and eyebrow pencil. It was all very intricate.  For a second Mike wondered how girls pull this type of thing off and still can't do simple algebra or write a readable essay.  But that didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a ring at the door, it was Heather one of your friends.  She said that she and Nate had something planned.  But you wasn't home or so Mike thought.  You had planned to get Heather here to see what would happen with your wish.  You knew that dad didn't hang out with his friends as much anymore.  Without sports they didn't have as much in common.  But Mike hadn't made any friends with 'young' girls.  You realized that Mike just wasn't exposed to girls in his life or his work so he hadn't had a chance to become friendly so you set this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Mike said at the door, \"but Nate isn't home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sure he said to meet him here now,\" Heather reassured Mike, \"Can I wait for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  After offering Heather a drink, Mike returned to what he was doing.  Heather noticed what Mike was reading.  Without the wishes this would have shocked her, but it didn't in this case.  She was actually intrigued at what he was studying.  One thing led to another and a conversation was started.  Heather was an 'expert' on teen makeup.  Well as compared with Mike anyway.  Soon, they went to the bathroom to try some of the techniques that were demonstrated in the magazine.  It was only a matter of time before a friendship was struck with the simple remark, \"Hey, if you need anymore help, this is my phone number.\"  Mike did need a lot of help and called her within two days.  Several of Heather's friends also became Mike's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one thought anything wrong with this.  Mike not only called Heather all the time, but he also started to visit her house and the houses of some of her friends too.  A couple of his new friends had parents who used to be Mike's old friends but they didn't mind either.  In a relatively short time, Mike hadn't any male friends.  All of his friends were teen girls.  The only exception were Mike's friends at work.  They really weren't friends, they were coworkers that you had to maintain a pleasant relationship with.  But other than that, when not at home, Mike spent his free time with 'the girls.'</span></div></div>",

You had this all planned out and so you took a candy and said, \"I wish dad would develop some of the interests of his friends.\"  Then slowly but surely Mike found new appreciations for several things.  Babysitting was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started innocently at first.  Heather phones Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike,\" Heather said with worry in her voice, \"you have to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was supposed to babysit for the Johnson's four year old, but I just can't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason wasn't what Mike thought was a good enough reason to shirk one's responsibility, but Heather was his friend and he didn't mind helping her out.  So he called the Johnson's to confirm that he would be babysitting instead of Heather..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got there, Mike found that he loved babies.  Mike had always been a great dad, despite what you think, but with his new change in interests he found he loved being around babies like teen girls (and women did.)  He enjoyed playing with children who were not his own and he thought they were so cute and sweet like girls did.  Between his own experience with his kids and his new interest in babies Mike started babysitting in his off times.  The money didn't mean much he was an adult with a full time job.  But the babies were so cute and he loved to take care of them.  Soon what started as a favor for Heather became a job that he loved to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike also developed other interests such as his interest in \"Hello Kitty\" or his love of being on the social networks.  Soon he was tweeting everything he did or so it seemed.  He had joined Pinterest and was pinning all sorts of things to his boards, such as the stuff he found on the web about \"Hello Kitty.\"  His tastes in television had changed too.  He was spending more time watching the Disney channel or Nickelodeon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his new interests, he started spending less and less time with Lynda who he also found that he had less and less in common with.  He preferred to look at fashions with his new friends than with Lynda and he was more interested in dramas that took place in a high school than between adults.  Lynda didn't mind the changes.</span></div></div>",

But because Mike was a man there were places that Mike couldn't go.  Mike could go to all of his friends houses, but when it came to certain things Mike just couldn't go.  It was embarrassing for Mike that his friends could go to the bathroom together (as girls often do) and he would have to wait at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make another wish.  This wish seems to help Mike out a lot but in the end it really didn't.  \"I wish that dad could go all the places his friends could go, but had all their restrictions too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when it was time to go to the ladies room, Mike could go with all his friends.  He could even do his business their.  He was always sitting down anyway.  He could also go into the dressing rooms at stores with his friends to see them trying on the clothes instead of waiting for them to return.  This wish had the side benefit of making Mike comfortable in seeing his friends in various stages of dress.  Mike wasn't a pervert and so it didn't matter if he saw them naked or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the restrictions part made it so that Mike couldn't use the mens room even if he wanted to.  He couldn't go into a bar or buy a beer at the local 7-11.  He couldn't get into an 'R' rated movie without another adult being present.  All these things were a pain to Mike as they would be to any teenager, but that was the way it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoyed dad's new found freedoms and his new found restrictions very funny.  Mike couldn't even drive anymore.  His license had been reduced to a learners permit like yours.  In your state, a fifteen year old (boy or girl) can get a learners permit, but not a license until he/she was sixteen.  Mike found that the easiest way to get places was to walk.  If the places weren't close he would have to ask Lynda or go with the parents of his friends.  Things were progressing nicely with dad, but it was time for another wish.</span></div></div>",

But, he was still Mike Wilson a father and a husband and despite not being able to see 'R' rated movies alone he was still head of the household.  This would continue for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it was time for a new wish and so you wished one that you had been waiting for since all this began.  You took out a candy and said, \"I wish that dad would replace all his clothes with the teen girl fashions that he likes so much.  I also wish that dad would start wearing his new fashions more and more.\"  You could have used the candy to just change all of dad's clothes to girlie ones.  But you preferred this.  It would take longer and it would be all of dad's own decisions.  Every time you saw your dad bring in a new purchase or put on a new outfit you would just laugh to yourself.  You knew that he deserved this punishment.  You knew that the joke was on him since he didn't notice anything wrong, but you found the revenge delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened just as you expected.  Dad was at a sleepover at Heather's. Since the last wish dad attended these sleepovers with his friends just like all his friends.  Before the wish it simply wasn't appropriate no matter how good friends that Heather and Mike were for Mike to spend the night in the girl's room.  Were there enough girls at the sleepover to call it a slumber party was just a matter of semantics.  They were doing makeovers and Mike had been making over the faces of the other girls.  Mike knew more about makeup than all the other girls combined.  One of the girls suggested that they do his face and for the first time makeup was put on Mike's face.  Mike actually dictated as best he could how to put on the makeup to get the proper look.  Mike is still a man and so to get the look of a teenaged girl on his manly face required more skill than the girls had.  This didn't open the floodgates, Mike didn't from that point on wear makeup everywhere, but it was a start.  It would take a while before Mike bought his first tube of lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day dad was with Heather and another friend and they were clothes shopping.  Mike was again helping them pick out clothes that were in fashion.  Mike had an eye for teen fashions.  All his studying paid off and the girls respected his opinion.  This was especially true now that Mike could go into the dressing rooms with his friends.  One thing led to another on this particular trip and Heather suggested that Mike try on a pretty blouse.  Mike liked the blouse and he in fact purchased it.  When he got home later that day, Mike put the blouse into the closet with the rest of his shirts.  He didn't wear the blouse immediately, but put it on when it was appropriate.  It was a small start but it was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his wardrobe grew, he started to throw out his older (less stylish and masculine) clothes.  Neither he nor Lynda bought him any male clothes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the time that Mike was trying on makeup for the first time, you decided it was time for another wish for Erin.  She had been wearing diapers for some time now.  You made a wish that didn't cause immediate change, but would have a long term effect.  \"I wish,\" you said while sucking on another candy, \"that Erin would find that the diaper's she wore would seem more comfortable the more they were like actually diapers worn by babies.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin arrived home from school to find a queen sized bed in her room replacing the twin bed she normally had.  She liked the extra room and the softness of the new bed.  New sheets and other bed linen were bought for the bed which fit right in with her new bedroom decor.  She thanked her parents for the new stuff.  A couple days later a new chest of drawers was added to her room.  She thought that this would give her extra clothing space, but when she looked into the drawers they were already filled.  She recognized the clothes at once, they were the new outfits that her dad was now wearing.  There were training bras (Mike always wore a bra even though he didn't have any boobs to speak of so they were always training bras or small padded bras.) panties, socks, tights, hose, leggings, tops and bottoms.  In her closet were dresses and the dress suits that Mike wore to work.  All of the clothes were bought from the girls, juniors or women's departments at stores.  The last of Mike's male clothing had been thrown out.  Mike had been wearing female apparel exclusively for some time now.  Even at work he was dressed in girl's clothes although these clothes were the type of clothing a teen would wear if she had a responsible job in an office.  The clothing that Mike now wore wasn't overly feminine, but they were all in style.  The same for his makeup.  On casual days of just going to the mall, he didn't make up his face like a Christmas tree, his makeup would be appropriate and understated for the event.  Sometimes just some lip gloss and pale blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw the stuff, Erin went to ask what was happening.  (She didn't know that you had made this wish.  \"I wish that dad and Erin would share her room and sleep together.\")  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin,\" Lynda started, \"dad has had a lot of sleepovers at his friends houses.  He thought it was only fair that they come to our house for one too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't want a bunch of girls in my room with me and daddy, so we decided that it would be best to have the sleepover in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the girls would like your room better than my room.  So dad and I got to talking and it was decided that maybe he should move into your room.\"  The older wish that Mike would develop the interests of the girls didn't make him want to date boys, but it did put a damper on his own love life.  He didn't want to be intimate with Lynda anymore than the other girls wanted to be intimate with their mothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda continued, \"We think that it would be best if you and dad could stay in the same room.  You have lots of mutual interests and it would work out fine.\"  This was true, Mike's interest were very similar to Erin's in many ways.  They had gotten a queen sized bed instead of another twin because the room wasn't big enough to handle two twin beds and all of the other things that was needed if Mike was to move into Erin's room.  Plus the wish that Dad could go anywhere that a girl could go made sleeping with Erin seem perfectly natural.  It was only Erin who could see that this was wrong, but she couldn't say anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Mike slept in the same bed as his daughter and didn't think anything was wrong with it at all.  They even talked about mutual interests before going to sleep.  Mike tried to help Erin in her wardrobe choices, but Erin didn't want to take Mike's advice.  Although if she did she would look much prettier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the weekend came and Mike's friends came over for their sleep over.  The queen sized bed had as many girls on it as would fit.  The overflow slept on a comforter on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and the girls were totally comfortable changing in front of each other.  The only one who had a problem was Erin, she didn't want anyone to know she was wearing pull-ups.  She kept it hidden as best she could.  She didn't have to bother, everyone already knew and didn't care.  No one except for Erin ever cared about any of the wishes that you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made another wish during the sleepover.  \"I wish,\" you said with the usual candy in your mouth, \"that mom would stop buying pull-ups for Erin and start buying diapers with tabs.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Mike now sleeping in her bed, Erin could truly grasp all that had happened to her dad.  It wasn't just the clothes it was everything.  Mike's day started early, before Erin got up.  He would start off with a shower.  In Erin's bathroom (the bathroom that was attached to her room) Mike's stuff had taken over.  He now had more makeup than Erin had ever seen in one place.  But it wasn't just that it was the perfumes, creams and lotions too.  Mike used depilatory daily.  Not just to remove the hair on his face, but all over his body.  He also has moisturizers and several other creams that even Erin didn't know what they did.  But Mike had read about them in one of his magazines (although the magazines came to the house addressed to Erin.)  After the shower, Mike would spend time doing his makeup while his hair dried.  Once finished he would dry and style his hair and then make touch-ups to his makeup if it was messed up in some way.  This took at least an hour.  Fortunately (or is it unfortunately) Mike never bothered to close the door regardless of his attire.  He would parade around Erin in just panties or totally nude, he didn't care.  Regardless, even though Erin was uncomfortable with it she sometimes had to use the bathroom herself so she would reluctantly enter the bathroom while Mike was inside showering or putting on his makeup or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was a work day, Mike would wear a suit that he bought from the woman's department.  If it had pants then it wasn't too different than a men's suit.  He never wore a tie anymore but he always wore a blouse instead of a dress shirt.  He had four suits, but he could stretch the look by rotating the blouse or the shoes and purse that he wore with the suit.  Sometimes he would add a scarf.  His daily makeup was always professional looking and he wore a variety of jewelry.  Some times he wore a broach, sometimes a necklace, but regardless he always wore earrings.  His ears had never not had earrings in them since the day he first got them pierced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore work he would contact his friends through social media.  There were tweets to read (and post) the same with facebook and a bunch of other social networks.  If something was important he would call his friends.  During work, Mike couldn't be reached by his friends except during lunch and breaks.  He had to take the bus to and from work now since he didn't have a valid license, except for his learners permit.  After work, he spend most of his time back on the social networks or chatting with his friends.  Through them he knew everything that was going on at their school.  His television habits had been reduced to mostly shows that teens liked.  He also liked competitive reality shows like Survivor and American Idol.  He was much more like a sister to Erin than her father anymore with one exception.  Mike could still ground her, although he was more understanding about her point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was constantly horrified at what had happened to her dad.  She wanted to tell someone but she couldn't.  Maybe if she could get what she was feeling all out she could learn to accept what had happened, but she had it all bottled up.  She had to act like everything was normal.  She wondered if everyone else was just acting.  Everyone else didn't seem to notice any difference.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all this could wait she had other problems.  Erin didn't know that you made another wish to torment her.  This time the wish went.  \"I wish that Erin could only use the words a toddler uses when she talks about her diaper or anything in it.\"  She noticed this change one day when she thought to herself that she \"Had to go sheesmee.\"  This was the word that she had used when she was a baby to tell her mom she had to take a piss.  That paused her for a moment, but it really hit home when she thought she had to take off her dypee to do it.  She couldn't even think of the right words anymore.  She wondered what would become of her.  If dad was becoming a teenager, does this mean she is becoming a baby.  She still didn't go 'sheesmee in her dypee\" maybe she wouldn't become a baby.  Time would tell but it was scaring her.  Especially since she was now wearing diapers that had tabs like a little baby instead of pull-ups.  But she did think the diaper was much more comfortable than the pull-ups and there seemed infinitely more comfortable than her old panties.  She now wondered how she had worn those uncomfortable things for so long.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Months had gone by and you enjoyed every minute of it.  You saw your dad become more and more like a teenaged girl.  You loved the slow change where every day was a revelation of what he would do or where next and he drifted into a new lifestyle without noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was now wearing diapers with tabs like a baby.  You knew full well that she wasn't just wearing diapers, but she made sure that she was properly powdered and the use of baby oil and other baby lotions were used in preparing to put on her diaper.  What was really funny was the words she used now.  The first time you heard her say she had to go kaka when she meant she had to go to the bathroom was just hilarious.  But now she would say things like that all the time.  It was just too funny when she even told you to \"kiss her dabo.\"  It took a while of listening to her to realize she meant 'kiss my ass.'  She used all sorts of phrases, she said she 'needed to geesh' once.  Which you suppose was another way of saying, 'I need to tinkle' which was easier to understand but still very juvenile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut its time to step it up a bit.  You didn't want to just make Erin piss herself or as she put it 'geesh in her dypee.'  That was too easy, so you made the wish this way, \"I wish Erin would take longer and longer before heading to the bathroom.\"  Eventually she would take too long and she would finally use her diapers for their intended purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Erin it was just natural.  She didn't want to piss herself although she used other words in her mind to express that thought.  She just thought, well I am busy and if I have an accident (which she didn't intend on having) I do have protection.  One time as you predicted she had waited too long and had to rush to the bathroom with a diaper that wasn't 'perfectly dry' as she thought of it.  From then on, she took longer and longer to go and had more and more accidents.  She had to carry a clean diaper (or more) with her everywhere she went and she also carried baby powder, baby oil and baby wipes too.  She needed all these supplies because they made her diaper feel incredibly great on her skin.  Using the diaper to wet also made the next diaper that much more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to actually enjoy the feeling of having a wet diaper and would not only stop changing herself as soon as she discovered she was wet, but would luxuriate in the feeling of a wet diaper for a while.  She even sometimes developed a rash, when she did she would use Disitin which felt even more incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she made another deal to herself that even if she was wetting she would never mess her diapers.  This lasted until she messed them the first time and then the flood gates did burst.  Soon she enjoyed the feeling so much that she would flood her diapers and mess them without thinking.  She started wearing plastic panties so she could continue to wet without ruining her outer clothes.  (You had made a special wish about this after seeing a wet spot on her jeans once.) It actually felt good.  The messing she had to change immediately when she was around people.  But if she was alone, she would only change herself after a messy accident (Erin called them kaka mesin in her own toddler vernacular) when she couldn't stand the pain of the rash anymore.</span></div></div>",

He may have liked the things a typical fifteen-year-old girl would like  but he had a job that made a lot of money.  It costs a lot to start from scratch and today's fashions could be expensive.  But now dad's closets were full and his room (the one he shared with Erin) had all sorts of necessities, such as his iphone, ipad, hello kitty themed stuff and tons of makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, now that he had everything, he shouldn't be able to just buy what he wanted.  Girls that age usually couldn't just get everything they wanted.  They had to save up money or get their parents to get it for them.  So you made another wish, \"I wish that dad was put on a $15 a week allowance.\"  Now he would have to support all his expenses on $15 a week and the money he earned baby sitting.  This put him on the same level as his friends.  He would now have to choose between getting the new lipstick he wanted and brown bagging it or eating out lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn most ways Mike now had the lifestyle of a typical teenager.  The only real difference was that he went to work instead of going to school.  He didn't like going to work any more than the typical girl likes school, but there were things you just had to do.  Lynda was still officially his wife, but their relationship was more like mother and daughter now.  Mike would have to ask Lynda's permission to go out at night or to get drives to places he wanted to go.  The only real difference between Mike and another teenaged girl was that he didn't date boys.  But that would soon change.</span></div></div>",

This one was going to be a long one you popped a candy into your mouth.  \"I wish that dad would flirt with boys more than the biggest flirt in Heather's high school.  I wish that dad knew all of the flirting tricks used by the girls in Heather's school.  I wish that everyone would treat dad like a very pretty girl in the tenth grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would get dad a lot of attention you thought and it did.  At home nothing changed, but any time dad would be around high school boys or young adult men they would flirt with them.  It could be a suggestive tone in his voice, or a quick glance, a flick of the hair, a casual touch of the shoulders.  There were hundreds or even thousands of ways to flirt and dad used them all.  The wish was very specific so that he would only flirt like a high school girl and not try and attract men much older than college age.  Most of the boys would respond since they all treated him like a pretty girl in the tenth grade.  Of course each boy had a different conception of pretty and for each boy dad was considered pretty.  The older boys, those that wouldn't date a tenth grader, wouldn't show much interest but they still thought that dad was pretty in a little girl type of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the boys would start asking dad out for dates.  But dad would decline since he was already going steady as he would say, meaning mom.  But it was fun to watch dad flirt with boys.  The words he used and the mannerisms he showed to a boy looked so silly coming from a grown man.  Dad's friends such as Heather was actually jealous about how many times dad was asked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days you made another wish.  \"I wish that dad would accept a date with any boy who asked him as long as he didn't have another date for the same time.\"  Soon boys would show up at the house to take dad out.  Mom didn't like this, but another wish and she didn't mind it any more.  But I did think that limits should be set so I made another wish, \"I wish dad would act like a virgin girl during his dates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it was soon time to finish with Erin too.  You knew all along that this would happen so you took out your candy and made two complementary wishes.  \"I wish that Erin would need her diaper changed as soon as she wet or messed it.  I wish that Erin would never know how to change her own diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Erin woke up wet.  Before the wish, she didn't mind, she actually felt good in a soggy diaper but now she felt she needed to get out of it.  The problem was she didn't know how to do it anymore.  Dad was finishing up his morning shower and was just about finished blowing his hair.  His hair was now very long and in a pretty style he saw in one of his magazines.  Erin entered the bathroom, the door was never locked when dad was in there and said.  \"I made a pisapet, my bubalee is cold, can you change my diepee?\"  Both the speech and the request was perfectly normal to dad or to anyone else that Erin asked.  He quit what he was doing and expertly replaced Erin's diaper.  With the new diaper on, Erin changed into her own clothes for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a person doesn't need only one diaper change in a day.  Erin was completely embarrassed when it happened again at school.  Then she had to ask the teacher for assistance.  \"My bumbum is all wet.\" is what she told the teacher in front of the classroom.  The teacher asked one of the other girls in the class to take Erin to the ladies room and change her.  Erin needed her diaper changed and she couldn't complain anyway so she meekly followed the girl and was taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought that her humiliation couldn't get any worse until you made one final wish regarding her.  \"I wish that Erin would be treated as if she had all the modesty of an infant.\"  From that time on, when Erin would ask to be changed it would be done right in front of everyone.  In class for example, Erin wouldn't be taken to the bathroom, but would be placed on a changing mat in the room and be diapered in front of everyone.</span></div></div>",

From then on, no one took dad seriously on anything.  If you wanted to know the latest eye shadow color you could ask dad and he would tell you.  If you wanted to know which boys kissed best you could ask dad.  But everything important dad didn't care about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout an interest in working anymore, dad lost his job which put a strain on the whole family including you.  You had to get a job to help support the family.  By the time you realized this all the candies had disappeared.  You didn't know if you ate them all or they were just missing.  Dad didn't care about any of this, as far as everyone was concerned he was just a young pretty girl who spent most of his time flirting with boys and talking about American Idol and Survivor.  But at least due to one of the earlier wishes he did make some money babysitting.  He had to do something to keep him properly dressed in the latest fashions.  Also his weekly hair and nail appointments were expensive.  But other than that he couldn't care less about anything.  There was one other exception, he could talk forever about reality TV.  He could tell you who came in fifth place on American idol from five years ago.  In the end he became just a silly little girl.  If he knew what had happened to him he would be horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embarrassment was driving Erin nuts.  She couldn't control herself anymore and she couldn't change herself when she did have an accident.  When she did she needed to be changed as soon as possible and so if she was alone she would have to ask strangers for help.  She would have to ask them in such a ridiculous babyish way.  The strangers usually would be happy to help, this was a side result of one of the wishes.  But they also recognized Erin's 'lack of modesty' and would commonly change her at the nearest bench.  Erin would be exposed as the diaper was removed and baby wipes used for everyone to see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral days later, the corruption of your thoughts had been lifted and who remembered how your family really was.  How you dad used to treat you as if he was your real dad.  You remembered what a manly, thoughtful, intelligent man he used to be.  You remembered the closeness you used to have with your little sister.  How you used to protect her from all dangers and she adored her big brother.  But now you see the harm you have done.  How you made your dad behave like a silly little air-headed girl.  What you did to your sister and how you knew she hated you for it.  How your mother had lost the real love of her life and had to go to work in some unsavory ways to support her family. You knew that even though you had been corrupted that the types of punishments were your idea.  You blamed yourself.</span></div></div>",

She followed her mom to the master bedroom and inside she saw a large crib.  Immediately her thumb flew into her mouth.  This made her feel better, but she was still in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sleep her with me, like you did when you was younger.\" mom said.  It was true that for the first few months of her life, Erin did sleep in the same bedroom with mom and dad in a crib, but she was a baby then, she's a teen now.  But she wasn't allowed to complain.  Sucking her thumb was the only thing that made her feel better at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she got her first good look into the crib, it wasn't your standard crib.  It was big enough for a teen, but there were other things, the bed sheets looked like the bedsheets that used to be on Erin's twin bed only they were reshaped for the crib.  Also inside the crib instead of baby toys there was some of her stuff such as an ipad and the remote for the television.  There was a mobile over the crib, but it contained pictures of her favorite movie and television stars.  It was truly a crib for a teenager.  The only problem was that she knew that she couldn't get into the crib by herself or get herself out.  Someone, usually mom, had to put her into the crib and take her out.</span></div></div>",

She really couldn't decide if it was worse to see her dad totally naked or to see him with his penis sticking out of thong panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was her own diaper troubles.

She decided to remedy it (although she never knew that it was the wish that had compelled her) by doing what mothers did for their babies in this situation she started spreading baby powder into her pull-ups before wearing them.  This did the trick.  With the new powder in her pull-ups they felt even better than before.  (It felt even better than it normally would since there was the extra kick in feeling because pull-ups with baby powder in there was more babyish than pull-ups without them.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worked so well, that Erin decided to try putting baby oil into her pull-ups too.

She'd planned to meet up with her friend at the mall today and see a movie. Mom was out running errands so she'd asked dad to drive her. At first, she couldn't even get his attention, as it was fixed on the Disney channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally did, he'd announced that he was no longer allowed to drive on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a stupid excuse to Erin, but when she'd insisted, her dad had handed her the learner's permit. The funny thing was, Erin could vaguely remember him earning it. He'd been so proud, both him and mom. But she also remembered him driving her places before on his own, like school. It was all kind of confusing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she was able to get a lift to the mall with Heather's mom, who had arrived to pick up her dad. Erin sat in the front passenger seat in the minivan while Heather, her dad, and two other girls talked, gossiped, and giggled. The really weird thing was how in to it her dad was. He seemed to really care who was wearing what or who was dating whom; more than that, the girls seemed to take his opinions seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the mall, the girls and her dad filed out. Erin hung back, gawking at the sight of her dad walking beside, and towering over, three other girls. They were still going on and on and not one of them seemed to even notice that Erin was still there until they were almost to the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Erin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up. By the theater, her friend Patty was coming over, but it was her dad who had called her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad stood with his hand on his hip. \"Why don't we all see a movie together?\" He gestured to Heather and his other friends. \"My treat, of course. For both you and Patty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tempting offer. Erin's allowance was small, and because her dad still had his adult job, he could easily afford to pay for movie tickets for two other people besides himself. At the same time, she knew from previous conversation that the fifteen and sixteen year old girls (and her father) planned to see the latest romantic comedy, and not the Disney cartoon she'd been planning on seeing. Plus, it was awkward being around her dad and the other girls.</span></div></div>",

Her dad got into the back behind him, which looked awkward because his legs were so long. Still stunned from the conversation, Erin almost fell into the other seat.

Unlike Erin, he could do it from the privacy of his own room. Just a few days ago, he'd made a wish to be able to spy on his dad no matter what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird thing was, that was one of the <i>only</i> wishes he'd made lately. His dad had flirted with the boy Jake all on his own. The only encouragement had come from his new friends. Nate wondered if one of the \"restrictions\" he now had was an increased susceptibility to peer pressure. If that were so, he wouldn't have to do much of anything to get his dad farther down the path he was on, except put him in more and more contact with his peers -- fifteen year old girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suspected his mom was comfortable with what was going on for similar reasons. The only wish he had made tonight, in the car after picking up dad and Erin, was that there be a legal way for his dad to go back to school. Nate didn't particularly care <i>how</i> that was accomplished, but he was certainly pleased with the result. It amused him that his dad would soon be his sister as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was reluctant, but mostly because she feared losing dad's extra income (a quick wish took care of <i>that</i>). Dad's begging eventually changed her mind. Tomorrow, she'd see the lawyer about getting a divorce, and dad would quit his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, what?\" His mom smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... thank you... 'mom.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I haven't adopted you yet, but you need the practice. Speaking of which... it's your bedtime in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, mom!\" The tone of his voice was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. You can sleep in the master bedroom tonight, and tomorrow we'll move you into Erin's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate, hearing his sister gasp, chuckled. It would serve her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get you measured for a school uniform, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled, starting for the stairs. \"That all sounds great, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of his dad in one of the girls' uniforms amused Nate greatly, but it also raised a dilemma. His dad was over six feet tall. He'd look ridiculously out of place towering over the other students in the halls. And that <i>might</i> be really funny. On the other hand, what if he wished for his dad to have more appropriate physical features for his new role? Nothing drastic, of course, but maybe just a reduction in height and muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate considered.</span></div></div>",

It almost felt like cheating, and besides, Nate wanted the changes to come slowly, with the magic of the candies only starting them while his dad did the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Erin to consider.

He knew what he needed to do, but the wish had to be worded very carefully. Eventually, he wrote down what he wanted to say on his computer. Some of the terms he had to look up in his sex ed textbook to be sure he had them right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish,\" he read, \"that all of dad's male secondary sex characteristics -- his height, his voice, his muscles, his body hair, and so on -- will go back to the way they were before he started puberty.

Furthermore, I wish for his body to produce sex hormones of the same type and of the same quantity as Erin.

When Mike screamed from the bedroom, she rushed up the stairs. By that time, Erin was already at the door, while Nate stayed in his room, spying with his wish-created ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad had gone to sleep in his boxers, as always. When he'd sprang from the bed, they'd slipped over his hips and down to his ankles. When he noticed his two family members at the door, he tried to cover his privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with me!?\" He slapped a hand over his mouth. His voice was higher pitched than his wife's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda immediately rushed to his side to comfort him. He only came up to her chest now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh, we talked about this,\" she insisted, stroking his hair. \"The law wouldn't let you go back to school the way you looked. It would have been too disruptive for the other students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was sobbing. \"I just wanted to be with my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you will be. Not only that, but now you'll be able to shop in the same stores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to comfort him quite a bit. He let Lynda cover him up with one of her robes, then sat on the bed, still sniffling slightly. Nate laughed his ass off at how comically oversized the robe was. It hung like a sheet from his narrow shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin,\" his mom called out. \"Can you find your dad something to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin groaned. \"Seriously, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it, dear. He needs a shirt, some jeans, a pair of panties... oh, and a bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Erin came back with a bundle of clothing. With no regard for his privacy, Lynda helped him step into the plain cotton panties. The bra came next, and Nate noticed that his dad's now hairless chest sported a pair of fleshy cones, just like his sister's did. After getting it on, his dad tugged at the garment's unfamiliar straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished dressing, dad looked much like Erin, except that his face and hair were still his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda remarked on the similarity. \"You two could almost be twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bedroom, Nate laughed and laughed.</span></div></div>",

He chalked it up that she was still young and hadn't discovered boys yet but in a few years she'll know what it felt like to flirt with cute guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mike was texting Heather, telling her about how cute Jake is, how is crooked smile was adorable, how he was so funny and all the other things some totally imagined that Mike thought of him there was a ring on the house phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda called out, \"Mike it's for you.\"  It was Jake on the line, Mike had given Jake his house phone on instinct.  Mike's cell phone was only for business, family and of course Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike got on the phone and quickly texted to Heather, \"He's on the phone, I have to go.\"  Mike didn't wait for Heather's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake started nervously, \"Uh, Mike, I thought it was really great meeting you at the movie.\"  Jake was still a boy and not very confident when it came to talking to 'girls'.  Especially hot girls as he thought Mike was.  He talked to her easily on the line because he wasn't thinking about it.  But it took all his courage to call her.  Jake didn't know the three day rule when it came to talking/phoning girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was allot of fun, you made the line move really fast.  It was also so sweet of you to wait for me to finish and walk me back to my seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, that was nothing.  You are really great to talk to.  Will I see you in school tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have to work, they keep me really busy.  It's an intensive work/study thing.  But I am thinking of quitting.  It's starting to become too much,\" Mike lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake wanted to encourage Mike.  If Mike quit he would be at school more often and he could see him.  But Jake liked Mike enough (even though they just met) that Jake didn't want Mike to give up the opportunity that work/study meant for high school students.  \"Well if its too tough...but these things are really important to your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing how Jake was concerned for him made Mike fall for him even more.  They continued their conversation for some time.  But finally it became time for Jake to ask Mike out.  Mike accepted immediately.  Then Jake found an excuse to get off the phone.  Jake was now to excited to talk and he didn't want to seem like a dork by rambling on now that he had made a date.  Jake had just hung up the phone when Mike said \"love you.\" and hung up after him.  Mike didn't want to scare Jake off by letting him hear those words so soon after meeting but it was how he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike didn't want to get a divorce, but he had to find a way to return to school.  If he was gone all the time, Jake might think that Mike was too advanced for him and that wasn't true.  Mike didn't want to lose Jake and would do anything to be with him.  Maybe he could have Lynda threaten to sue the school to let him return.  Mike didn't know how, but he was determined to become a full time student of the high school and he wouldn't let anything get into his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynda we have to talk,\" Mike said.  Lynda was watching TV and turned it off when she saw how serious Mike was at that moment.</span></div></div>",

This was a big step and there was no going back if it didn't work.  \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything,\" Mike begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you will be coming home earlier than me so you'll have to make dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will also have to straighten up the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to keep your grades up too.\"  This was a strange request since Mike in actuality was an adult who had graduated high school (and college for that matter) some time before.  But in the context of the conversation it seemed reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise all As.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda had also decided to let him go, but she didn't want to let him off so easily.  \"I don't know.  You'll do all the cooking and straighten up around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be able to go out on school nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH OK, I'll call my friend and see what I can do.  But I can't promise you'll be in the same class as this boy or even with Heather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what grade either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter as long as I'm a student at the school,\" Mike said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda did indeed make a few calls.  There was a great many people to talk to.  But she did it.  \"I have some news,\" Linda told Mike with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike knew immediately and asked excitedly, \"WHAT!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are now a student ad Fortham High.\"  Mike threw himself into Lynda's arms and covered her face with chaste kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank You...Thank You...Thank You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one more thing though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are a student, but you are a new student, you aren't in Heather's class, you will be entering as a freshman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be two years behind Heather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the best I could do under the circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike thought it was better than not going and so he didn't complain.  He found a private area of the house to call Heather and tell her about the news.</span></div></div>",

Lynda of course went with him since he couldn't drive there himself and it was just the thing to do.  Lynda had already bought the uniform for Erin so she knew what to get.  Mike needed everything.  They started off with five blouses which contained the school emblem.  He couldn't wear the same one day after day.  Then they picked up three skirts and over a dozen pairs of tights.  They needed two pairs of shoes to complete the basics.  Everything they needed had to be in Mike's size.  This wasn't too much of a problem since they got the stuff from the recommended store and not the run of the mill Target store.  But there was more, they needed the school gym uniform for girls which was basically a t-shirt and shorts.  Lynda also suggested they get a leotard in case Mike wanted to take dance or gymnastics.  They also picked up a sweater in the school's colors and a vest for the colder weather.  No jewelry was allowed so there didn't need any accessories except for a bag to hold Mike's books in.  This was the one area that a student can show some originality in if they wanted to but it was decided to use the one recommended by the school instead of a more elaborate one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the shopping trip Mike started to get nervous.  It was finally hitting him what a big step this was.  He was going to go to school on Monday morning just like Heather and all of the other high schoolers.  Lynda picked up on this and tried to comfort Mike.  Mike seemed to calm but it was still very big for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home there was a message to phone Jake.  Mike did so and after talking to him for a while got off the phone and was a bit bummed.  Nate asked him what was wrong.  With a little prodding it came out.  Jake had this friend who he needed to get a date for.  It was some long convoluted story but the upshot was that if Jake couldn't get a date for his friend then Jake couldn't go out with Mike.  Mike knew that Heather was already seeing someone so she couldn't go out with him.  Mike didn't know who else to ask.  Nate suggested that he ask mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't ask her, she is too old for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is younger than you and she isn't seeing anyone.\"  This statement was completely true regardless of the absurdity of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I don't think she likes boys so young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask her, what do you have to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was desperate and decided to ask.  But before he could ask Nate popped a candy into his mouth and said, \"I wish mom loves dating teenaged boys and that she is an EXPERT at flirting with them.\"  Nate emphasized the word 'EXPERT' when he made his wish.  Then before the mint was fully gone Nate added, \"and that no one saw anything wrong with Mom dating teenaged boys.\"  Nate was glad he remembered to add that or his mom could get into allot of trouble.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Friday afternoon, Lynda took some time off work and drove Mike to the mall. While she had already purchased his uniform, there were a few additional items she knew a girl might need to fit in. Mike wouldn't be allowed to wear earrings, but she had his ears pierced anyway, for when he socialized with his friends outside school. She also bought him some makeup, although nothing too elaborate, along with a \"Hello Kitty\" purse and wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on that afternoon, Mike fidgeted in front of the mirror in the girls' bathroom. He licked his lips, pleased with the taste of his cherry lip gloss. If not for Nate's wishes, he would have made a very odd sight, as aside from his purse, his earrings, and a bit of makeup, his attire was still completely male. He would wear the same school uniform as all his friends, but had no other girl clothing to wear. While this troubled him, he hadn't worked up the courage yet to ask Lynda for additional clothing beyond his school stuff, which had been quite expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd decided that he'd only ask if Lynda agreed to the double date, and he was still wondering whether to even ask her about that. But if she agreed, surely she'd spring for a new outfit for him. He wanted to impress Jake sooooo badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in the bathroom now trying to figure out how to ask her, but was just getting more and more nervous. Maybe Nate would do it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo closer to a solution, he left the bathroom and went to find his wife in the food court. She had gone to order salads for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he found Lynda, he was surprised to see two teens, a boy and a girl, sitting at the table with her. Both were maybe sixteen or seventeen, or just a little older than their son Nate. The boy was sitting across from her, a strange look on his face, while the girl was scowling with her arms crossed. He sat next to Lynda, across from the frowning girl, trying to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was that at some point Lynda had undone two of the buttons on her blouse, and was showing off the tops of her bra cups. The way she was leaning forward with her shoulders hunched further emphasized her already impressive cleavage. The boy's eyes were locked on her chest, his mouth slightly opened. The girl looked on in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's <i>go</i>, Chad.\" She pulled on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... you go on,\" he murmured, waving her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look strong, Chad,\" his wife said, licking her lips. \"Do you work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad's expression brightened. \"I'm on the football team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda reached across the table, touched his arm. \"That's soooo cool. I love football players.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mike regained some of his composure. \"Lynda? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your friend?\" the girl snapped. \"Tell her to stop flirting with my boyfriend before I claw her eyes out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of them, Mike and the girl were able to pull Chad's attention away. Lynda seemed disappointed. \"You're no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was already with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Lynda picked at her salad. \"It was just some harmless flirting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his wife's behavior had surprised him, some of the shock was wearing off. Because of Nate's wish, it was already beginning to seem normal that Lynda would flirt with teenage guys, and be good at it, too. Mike reminded himself to ask her for tips later (well, not really, because he only had eyes for Jake!) The best part was that he now felt safe asking her to go on the double date with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they ate, he quickly explained Jake's situation. His wife nodded understandingly. When he was finished, all she asked was whether Jake's friend was cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smiled. \"Probably! After all, Jake is cute. Why wouldn't his friend be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her salad, Lynda considered it.</span></div></div>",

Jake got back to him almost immediately and confirmed the date for Saturday evening. He and his friend Greg would pick up Lynda and Mike at seven o'clock. Although Lynda could drive (unlike Mike), she liked the idea of the two boys coming to get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were leaving the food court, Lynda leaned over and whispered. \"You do realize what this means, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda clapped her hands. \"We're both going to need new outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, who had just been trying to find a moment to ask his wife about that very matter, could barely contain his enthusiasm. \"I want to look good for Jake,\" he admitted. \"Not like a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can fix that,\" his wife announced, pulling him by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Mike was in the fitting room at Victoria's Secret. His wife, acting more like his mom, helped him pick out his first bra. She chose for him something padded, designed to push his chest together and up, giving him the illusion of small breasts and just the hint of cleavage. Along with a pair of lacy pink panties that matched the bra, she also picked out some sports bras for him to wear in gym class and some plain cotton undies. Because of all of Nate's earlier wishes, no one thought it was strange at all for a grown man to squeal in delight like a teenage girl in Victoria's Secret. The women who heard it, including his wife, just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to tell Heather about this,\" Mike said, swinging a full shopping bag. The padded bra was clearly visible under his t shirt. Lynda had suggested he wear it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda grinned. \"You can do that later. We need to find some sexy outfits for tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Mike let himself be dragged along to another store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Because of his reading, Mike already had an idea what he wanted to wear for a first date. The problem was that he knew nothing in the usual teen girl stores would fit him. Nate, however, had already taken care of that with an earlier wish. When his mom had taken his dad shopping for school uniforms, Nate had known that some intervention would be necessary because it was unlikely the store would carry a uniform in the right size. What Nate wished was that whenever his dad shopped for women's or girl's clothing, stores would carry options in his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple enough wish, but what it meant is that wherever Mike and Lynda went, they found things that would fit both of them. Mike quickly settled on a pair of dark jeans with a pencil leg and a blue silk cami top. Since the top was sleeveless, it would show off his bra straps, but Mike liked that because it was a look many of his friends favored. Studying himself in the mirror, he also realized how much he needed to shave his armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping him select his own outfit, Lynda browsed for her own. Mike was glad to see this, as he'd secretly worried she'd try to wear some of her drab, adult clothing for the date, which would be embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife eventually settled on a pair of jeans much like the ones he had chosen. She considered a cami as well, but since her breasts were much larger than his, it wouldn't work as well. She eventually settled on a v neck tee that clung tightly to her bust. With the right bra, she told him, it would be spectacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, while they pranced and preened in front of the mirrors, neither looked much like a teen girl. But only Lynda got strange looks from other patrons. Because of Nate's wish, Mike's presence was easily accepted while his wife's was not.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lynda didn't care what the other shoppers thought about her.  Lynda knew she could have any of the girl's boyfriends if she wanted them.  She supposed that she had had quite a few already in her many years of flirting.  She probably had had many of their teenaged lovers of their mother's of these girls when they were younger too.  None of these realizations concerned Lynda in the least.  For her it was quite ordinary.  She had been dating teenaged boys for thirty-years now since she was eleven and had gotten quite good at it.  There might even be a chance that even though she didn't know Jake she had already dated Jake's friend.  She'll find out when he arrived at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat actually concerned Lynda was Mike's date with Jake.  Lynda knew that this was going to be Mike's first date with a teenaged boy and she was worried for him.  She truly loved him although in what way was complicated now.  She wanted the best for him and she didn't want to see Mike hurt.  Lynda could tell that Mike was in a full on all out intense teenaged crush on Jake and those could be dangerous.  Mike had given up so much to be with this boy.  He had given up his job and had returned to high school.  He hadn't even returned to high school at the grade level of his friends but he was now like an in coming freshman and that would be tough for Mike too.  Mike didn't realize how that was going to be his vision was obscured by his love for Jake.  That is all he thought about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the date didn't go well then Mike still would be attending high school on Monday.  If he did he would likely see Jake in the halls too and his heart would be broken.  True Mike was a full grown man and Jake was still just a boy but its not like Mike would beat him up.  If things went wrong he would handle it like any other teenaged girl, he would certainly break down crying but then what?  Would be drown his troubles in ice cream and sad songs or would he start rumors and get Jake into trouble.  Lynda didn't know.  But it was premature, they hadn't even dated yet.  Lynda would be there at least to see that the date went well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda was going to have a good time with her date if he knew anything at all.  That's what she was there for to have fun not to make any serious relationships although that was a possibility.  You never knew what would happen.  But that didn't matter what did matter was that she would be with Mike when he went on his first serious date with a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts went through Lynda's head.  She didn't stop to think of the absurdity of a man and wife going on a double date with two teenaged boys in which one of them was even a blind date.  Mike on the other hand was floating on a cloud.  He was in love.  Well maybe you could call it an intense crush but it felt like love to Mike.  He wanted everything to be perfect.  He had to have the perfect outfit, and say just the right things, not come on on too strong nor come on too weak.  He had to laugh at Jake's jokes and not seem too silly when doing it.  He was bigger and taller than Jake but that didn't matter he had to let Jake take the lead.  He didn't realize that Jake liked him so much that Jake was thinking similar things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they left the store Lynda and Mike headed home.  Mike took a shower as soon as he arrived home he needed to shave his arms and chest so he would have the right look in his new top.  He wasn't going to  shave his legs since he was going to wear jeans, but he realized he had to wear a skirt (as part of the school uniform) on Monday so he shaved his legs too.  He also wanted to practice with his makeup to get the right look.  He wanted to look cute but not slutty.  He wanted to be sexy but not whorish.  He wanted to look sophisticated but not too old for Jake.  So he spent what seemed like every moment from the time he got home until Jake picked him up the next evening getting ready.  Lynda helped him when she could but there was no use Mike was just too nervous.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monday finally arrived and Lynda had all the kids pile into the car.  Lynda drove of course with Mike in the front seat and Nate and Erin in the back.  Erin sat in a child safety seat that looked like a toddler seat but was build for her size.  In her hands she carried a doll that was her security item when she was much younger but had returned to that function again.  Erin was the first to be dropped off.  She no longer went to high school she went to daycare like three year olds often do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda unbuckled Erin from her restraints and escorted her inside the building.  While Lynda was gone, Nate asked Mike how his date went and Mike simply said fine.  Mike didn't see the need to tell what was both his little brother and his son at the same time what was up with him on a personal level.  But even though Mike had already texted Heather all the details he wanted to tell her again in person what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda returned to the car and they drove to the high school.  Nate went in to find his friends and Lynda and Mike went to the office to finish the paper work.  When they were done, Mike was given his class schedule.  This as it turned out was the same class schedule that Erin had had before she was demoted to daycare.  Neither Lynda nor Mike remembered that Erin had ever gone to high school as far as they and everyone else except for Nate had known she had always gone to daycare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you at home,\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see me around here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I work here now....That was part of the deal to get you into the school, I had to start working here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"  Nate had made an additional wish using his candies to make Lynda work at the high school.  He thought it would be so much fun.  Now Lynda could drive Nate and Mike home from school everyday and they didn't have to take the crowded bus.  Also, Lynda could start 'going out' with the cute boys she now liked.  It was true that she also liked some boys that attended the middle school too.  The former wish made her like teenaged boys regardless of their grade level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeap, it's a good deal, I we can all go in the same car every morning and they even gave me a bump in pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I don't have to cook and clean when I get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you still have to.  A deal is a deal and you promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, OK.\" Mike said dejected.  But that wasn't important now, he had to find Heather and talk to her before the first bell rang.  Mike walked off and Lynda followed him into the hall.  When she got there, she saw all the sexy boys in the hall.  She licked her lips, this was another benefit of working here.  All had turned out for the best.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things had changed at school since Nate had gotten his wishing candy although neither Mike nor Lynda (not anyone else for that matter) knew any difference.  Nate was now the most popular kid in school and president of the student council.  Nate had dated several of the prettiest girls some he had dated multiple times.  There weren't any more bullies at the school.  Some of the bullies had found themselves weaker than the average kindergartener.  Other bullies found themselves in love with the nerdy boys they used to pick on.  Some bullies were so afraid of getting into trouble they would suck their thumbs, or break out crying or in extreme cases wet their pants.  Some bullies were on their best behavior, they didn't want to lose their petition to be able to wear the girl's school uniform to be rejected.  Others were already attending preschool with Erin.  Regardless of the 'punishment' there isn't any more bullying in the high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was happy as a clam now that he was a student in the school.  He would prefer to be in Heather's class, but he could see her during recess or in the halls and that was just fine with him.  Mike also enjoyed his time spent with Jake during the school day.  Being kept separate made each encounter more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda liked the new arrangement too.  There were so many cute looking boys at the school and she flirted with any one she like that didn't already have a girlfriend.  She didn't think that was right, but all free boys were fair game to her.  She particularly liked the younger more inexperienced ones.  Also since she worked in the office she had the home address of every student in the school.  She would drop in at their homes on occasion and 'speak' with them privately in their rooms.  Because of Nate's wish that she wouldn't get into trouble, none of the parents of the boys saw anything wrong with it.  Lynda made most of their trips to the boys homes right after school.  Mike had promised to cook dinner and clean up the house which gave Lynda time for these excursions.  On those days, Lynda would pick Erin up at daycare at five o'clock instead of at three, but no one minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, going to school was a happy and fun experience for Mike, Lynda and Nate.  Erin also enjoyed daycare.  She fit right in with the toddlers and her day was full of fun.</span></div></div>",

She was getting more action than the school slut but no one seemed to mind, not the boy's mothers who thought it was perfectly normal and certainly not the boys.  Erin was as happy as any toddler.  She could play all she wanted and didn't have to worry about anything not even what clothes she wore or changing her own diapers.  Nate enjoyed running the school.  Everyone knew him and everyone liked him.  Mike made new friends in his grade but also remained friends with Heather and her crowd.  Mike and Jake were in love and were going steady.  Heather was a little jealous of Mike's relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was great but just a little boring to Nate so he decided to stir up the pot a little bit.  He took his candy and made three wishes.  One to effect each of his family members.  Nate wished, \"I wish that Erin would have diarrhea all the time.\"  Of all the wishes this one effected its victim least.  Erin was so into her toddler persona that she didn't even notice.  She didn't care, she didn't have to change herself anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his second wish, Nate wished, \"I wish that the parents of the boys that mom 'dates' would be concerned if they found out.\"  This second wish made Lynda have to be more secretive if she wanted to pursue a boy she liked.  But the boys didn't mind.  It actually made her adventures more exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his last wish, Nate wished, \"I wish that Dad would notice how things have changed but not be able to do anything to let anyone know something is wrong.\"  With this third wish, Mike would be horrified about what had happened.  He would know he isn't suppose to be going to high school or worse yet dating some boy, but he couldn't do anything about it.  He also be horrified that his wife was sleeping with children and his teenaged daughter was acting like a toddler.  Mike found himself living a nightmare which was actually the life of a typical teenaged girl.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just a little after eight, Greg and Jake arrived. Greg was driving with Jake in the passenger seat, so Lynda and Mike dutifully got into the back, each of them clutching their purses. Lynda could tell her husband was nervous, but it was hard for her to concentrate once she got a look at Greg. He was older than Jake by at least a year and very well built, making Jake appear almost slender in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, ladies.\" That was Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, boys,\" Lynda said, secretly squeezing Mike's hand. She felt bad for him. He hardly said a word until they got to Applebee's, where they were going to have dinner before seeing a movie. She wished Jake had taken more of the initiative and introduced everyone back at the house, or at least opened Mike's door for him or something. But he was young and apparently hadn't learned exactly how to treat a girl yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, at Applebee's, he recovered somewhat and did open the door for Mike, even kissing his hand in a way that Lynda would have found cheesy if not for the obvious pleasure her husband got from the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike blushed furiously as Jake introduced Lynda to Greg. He didn't call Lynda Mike's wife or anything like that, nor even indicate that he knew they were married. He introduced her to Greg as \"Mike's friend.\" That was just fine with her. Greg was taller than Mike, even in those strappy sandals, and Lynda looked forward to getting to know him better without any distractions like her marriage vows getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake, being younger than his friend, was also a little less confident, and in some ways Mike was younger than any of them. The two of them entered the restaurant first holding hands. Lynda, meanwhile, gave Greg a wicked grin and put her arm through his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fine, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake's actually my cousin. I'm staying with his family for a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Greg was from another city. He'd been suspended from school for fighting. He would only be around for another week. That was fine with Lynda, as she wasn't looking for anything long term. She pretended to be impressed with his tattoos, touching his hand in just the right way, and laughing when appropriate.  Her hope was that all this would rub off on Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Mike didn't need that much help. He giggled whenever Jake tried to say something funny, and seemed to be genuinely impressed with the boy's intelligence. Lynda even caught her husband dropping \"like\" and \"you know\" into sentences, a habit he'd apparently picked up from his friends. By the time drinks arrived (cokes all around), Jake had his hand over Mike's and the two were trading shy glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that Mike could handle himself, Lynda focused more of her attention on Greg. He wasn't very witty, and his cockiness was almost too much, but there was still something about him that turned her on. She wondered if he'd ever been with a real woman before. Probably not. While he was placing his order, she suddenly slipped her foot out of its backless heel and rubbed her toe along his leg. Greg was so surprised he almost messed up his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that?\" she whispered, when the waiter had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they were halfway through their meals, she had Greg wrapped around her finger. He was tough, no doubt, but almost as inexperienced as his cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Greg went out for a smoke, and Lynda followed. Although she had quit smoking years before, she'd soon bummed a cigarette from her date and by mutual agreement the two of them went around behind the restaurant, where the employees did their smoking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like the hottest... girl I've seen in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She batted her eyelashes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fished around in his pocket and brought out a joint. \"My cousin is really against this shit -- cuz his parents are religious or something -- but you and me could split this before the movie. Movie's always better that way, my brother always say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda considered.</span></div></div>",

Lynda knew that she couldn't have her way with Greg with Mike around.  This would be the only time to get intimate with the hot boy.  It was true she couldn't do all that she wanted with the boy but this was better than nothing and she had done similar to countless boys in all her years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda could tell that Greg was still inexperienced for his age, but she would teach him stuff in the next few minutes that would serve him for the rest of his life.  Who knows, if the boy was good she might be able to visit Greg at Jake's house before he returned home for a followup course in love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mike and Jake were getting better acquainted.  Jake was trying to make himself sound cool to Mike.  Jake told Mike everything he thought would impress a girl about himself.  Jake was careful not to lie to Mike since he really liked him and didn't want to blow it with a silly lie.  Mike was impressed with everything that Jake said because he was already in love.  Mike responded to Jake's boasts by looking at him with admiration and by finding reasons to touch him.  He wanted to kiss him but unlike Lynda he didn't want to seem too forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Lynda and Greg got back, Jake and Mike considered themselves to be officially going steady.  Lynda and Greg got back separately since they both visited the bathroom to clean up after their makeout session (it was more than that actually.)  Lynda to apply more makeup and Greg to remove Lynda's makeup from his mouth (and other places.)</span></div></div>",

Halfway through, the two found themselves around the back of the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we watchin' that shit, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike chose it,\" Lynda admitted. Jake had of course gone along with his choice. \"What're you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some additional stimulation if I'm not gonna fall asleep in there.\" He started rolling another joint. \"You sure you don' want any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda hadn't smoked weed since she was a little older than Greg, back in her first year of college. In that respect, she was much less seasoned than him. Pretty soon, she was hacking her lungs out, but then her head started to feel real light, and suddenly Greg seemed a lot funnier than he had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you need to stop looking down my shirt...It's not polite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it,\" Greg said, breathing out a cloud of smoke. \"You got great tits for being an older woman and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, she punched him lightly on the arm. \"I thought I was a hottie. Isn't that what you said?\" Secretly, his compliment pleased her greatly. The joint had made her slightly self-conscious and she'd begun to worry that parts of her were too saggy. She'd even seen him eyeing other girls in the lobby of the theater. Of course, she'd already shown she had plenty to offer, but some additional reassurance didn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stop laughing. Words just seemed to be flowing out of her, like the silence was too much to bear. \"My kids got to suck on these.\" She pulled the front of her shirt down. \"Would you like to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made out some more. She let Greg get his hand under her shirt, gasping whenever he managed to roll over her nipple with his finger. She thought about pulling down his pants then and there but then a theater employee started snooping around, so she broke out of a kiss and said they should go back to the theater. The rest of the movie passed in a blur for her. Most of it was spent with her hand in Greg's lap and his hand on her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, she was still a little dizzy, dropping into the passenger seat of Greg's car. Mike and Jake got into the back, still holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where're we going now, bitches?\" He cranked up the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go back to my house,\" Jake offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. It's boring there.\" Greg got them back onto the road. \"But I gots an idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Now that they were underway, she took his hand off the gear shift and put it back into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know an abandoned house. What say we go there and have ourselves a little party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake frowned. \"I don't know, Greg. That sounds dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go back to my house,\" Mike put in helpfully. \"There isn't anyone there... well, not really.\"</span></div></div>",

She tried to resist throwing them out too, but there was nothing she could do about it.  Erin had also noticed that her dad was 'hanging' with girls who were just a couple years older than she was.  Some of the younger ones were her age, but this didn't matter to Erin.  Her lack of underwear was more of a concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her last pair was gone and she had only pull-ups in her 'lingerie drawer.'  She resolved not to wear one and for a couple of days went around with any panties at all.  She was highly embarrassed.  But this couldn't continue.  She could get used to walking around 'commando style'  but her period was soon approaching.  She needed something to hold her feminine napkin.  She had always hated tampons.  Then she realized that the pull-ups in her drawer was in many respects just like very long feminine napkins.  If she wore one, she wouldn't even need to wear a napkin at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore putting one on she resolved never to use it 'like a diaper.'  She made a deal with herself.  She also thought that when her period was over she could return to going without.  With these two things in her mind she fished out her first pull-up.  The pull-up had a cute design on it.  It was definitely a diaper but as with all adults who need them, she convinced herself that it wasn't too different than the panties she had always worn.  With all her mental gymnastics in place, she put it one and then got dressed.  She soon got used to it and by the time her period had stopped she was wearing them full time just like she used to wear her panties.  It was better this way, since now the underwear she was throwing out after using was disposable anyway.  Besides, no one besides her knew she was wearing them and she still went to the ladies room to do her business as she had done before.  With this weight lifted from her mind, she could now pay more attention to how her dad was changing.</span></div></div>",

He would go into her room and ask her for them when he wanted them.  Erin wanted to ask him about it.  She thought it was odd, but she just couldn't bring up the courage to ask.  Erin also knew that her mom must have been seeing the same thing she was but she seemed OK with it.  Why was dad reading my magazines.  He wasn't reading the whole magazine, he only read stuff about fashion (clothing, makeup, jewelry, etc) but he was doing it a lot and he would reread the same magazine often.  (Mike would read something new and then go back to reread what he had read to get a new insight about what was said before.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis bothered her, until she had something more important (she thought) to worry about.  One day, she took off her panties and saw a small hole.  It wasn't a big hole, it was hardly noticeable, but she saw it and decided to throw the panties out.  No big deal, she had thrown out panties before although not for something as minor.  The next day, she decided she didn't like the style of the panty she was wearing and soon too it went into the trash.  For several days she found something wrong with her panties and threw them out one by one.  It became apparent when the laundry was done and instead of having a full panty draw, there was plenty of room.  Then it hit home.  She decided not to throw out the next pair.  But, this pair happened to be plain white granny panties and for a moment she decided she was too old for them (or is it too young) and threw them out.  Then she decided she shouldn't do that and was going to retrieve her panties from the garbage.  But she couldn't do it.  She had convinced herself that once in the garbage she shouldn't remove them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she was running out of panties and didn't know what to do.  She could buy more, but she didn't want to waste her money on that.  Plus if she threw those out again, she would run out of money pretty soon.  She didn't have much, she was only thirteen.  She tried day after day to not throw out her dwindling number of panties and she was getting scared when she couldn't help herself that she wouldn't know what to do.  She couldn't even discuss it with her mom.  The first wish prevented that.  But she chalked that up to embarrassment.  She still have a few pairs now, she hoped it would all work out soon.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------<br>\r\nNote: I am assuming that this chapter is included into the main story.

So to remedy this problem Nate decides that he would wish that Erin would secretly start to steal her father's boxer shorts. Than another idea popped into his head courteous of the candies. Maybe I can wish that my dad will discover Erin's panties in the trash and bring them in and start wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Nate placed a candy in his mouth and these words left his mouth,\"I wish all the grown ups and their children switched their underwear preferences, and everyone would think this is normal.\" Before  the wish took effect Nate realized very briefly the ramifications of the wish he made and Nate had a WTF moment. Why the hell did I wish....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan reality focused in sharply and he was stunned that he was not wearing a bra or his favorite things panties. He went up to his room to thankfully find all of his brassieres and thongs and panties. Nate quickly undressed and put on what was previously his mother's C-cup underwire bra and a pair of nylon thong panties. Nate pull ed the panties way up into the crack of his ass so that he would not get a panty line. He hooked his mother's bra and than adjusted the straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate than got dressed in his regular clothes and headed downstairs. He spotted his dad in the kitchen reading a Cosmo and could see Erin's training bra poking through the white dress shirt he wore. Nate thought this was normal and since he still had candy left over from the previous wish decided he should change things up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of this being odd, Nate watch his mother glide into the kitchen with her floral print blouse completely un-buttoned exposing her breasts. Never needing or wanting to wear one of Nate's bras this was very normal to see. She commonly walked around topless sometimes only in her boxer briefs before getting dressed. As she made her way to Nate she began to button up her blouse. \"Nate I'll be doing laundry tonight and I'll be starting with delicates so you and your father have your panties ready for me when I get home or else Mr.\" she said eyeing both you and your father. \"What an empty threat\" Nate thought to himself. \"What's she gonna do make us wear her briefs?\" That's when an idea hit Nate just as his mother was about to walk out the door. \"I wish mom secrectly wanted to wear my bras and panties and try's to steal them all the time.

No surprise to Nate he followed her straight to his room where he watched her quietly. She quickly opened Nate's top dresser drawer which contained all of his nylon, silky, lacey panties and bras. Nate did have an impressive collection. Janet unbuttoned her slacks and tossed her briefs to the side then found a very cute pair of Nate's tanga style panties. They were light pink with a white flowery design and lace trim. She pulled them up her smooth legs and they fit so tight across her nice round bottom. Then she undid her blouse and found a bright blue and white bra to wear. Not matching what so ever and fumbling with the hooks Nate let out a tiny laugh which caused Janet to spin around real fast. \"Busted\" was all Nate said looking at his mother wearing his panties.....</span></div></div>",

He was already undressed to his own panties and bra which were a nude set with a crazy design. \"Mad? No intrigued I'd say. Why would you need a bra mother? Don't my panties feel tight?\" he said checking her out Janet couldn't explain the feeling it just felt so right. \"Mom I'll let you wear my panties whenever you want but you should try to match better. What if dad were to catch you? You have to be careful\" he said handing her his light pink matching bra.

His calf and thigh muscles strengthed greatly with the womanly muscles coming in. In other places, his arms became smaller with small muscles but still womanly. His hands became gentle and small with long fingers. His fingernails extended to a great manicured length.</span></div></div>",

He had no idea that his changes in to a mature woman would be done by the tinme he got out of the bathtub. His mind has having new ideas of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, next is the hair\" said Brandon as he grabbed the hair shampoo. As he did, he smelled a new smell. It was a floral scent, one that a woman would enjoy. Normally, Brandon would not like this but he smiled at the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice scent\" he said as he poured himself some and began washing through his hair with it. As he washed it throughly, it slowly grew and grew, stretching out from his scalp. The dark locks of hair grew out, becoming a deep brown in the process. As Brandon ran his hands through, he then ducked under the water to wash the water out. When he emerged, his now waist-length dark bown hair cascaded down his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took a little long but that was fine\" said Brandon as he relaxed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to lay there, his legs decided to finish their changes. With his legs all slender and smooth now, womanly fat and tissue began to form in his hips, forcing them to grow outwards. The wide space needed for child-bearing began to form. His hips continued outwards, eventually getting to a size of 36', perfect for childbirth. In addition, his butt began to grow in response. More fat and tissue began to build in his butt, forming a sort of cushion on the bathtub floor. Brandon felt it not paid it no mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes continued upwards, forcing his waist to cave in. His stomach thrusted forward a bit and flattened out as his stomach became smaller. His waist constricted to a petite 24'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, his age rose once again, going up to 29 years old. With that, more memories invaded his mind. Before, he had memories up to 8 years old, and now it extended to 20 years old. He remembered growing out of his tomboy streak at 13 years old and becoming a rather popular girl. Instead of baseball, he was a cheerleader and actually the captain. He remembered going to his high school prom with his boyfriend Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all this, his body and mind was accepting of it and allowed it to overtake him. He wouldn't be Steve's son much longer.</span></div></div>",

This is so relaxing\" said Brandon with a smile. He didn't notice that the voice he spoke with was far different then normal. It was high, soft, and highly womanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of womanly, the rest of his womanly features began to form. His legs, hips, and butt had finished. As had his waist. His stomach became nice and flat and thrusted forward, riveling that of a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the biggest changes now started. Little by little, his nipples began to expand and elongate, becoming something useful for childbirth. Soon, the areas around them began to swell, pushing ever outwards. They grew and grew, as they floated on the bath water. Flowing and flowing, his new pair of motherly breasts grew out to a nice DD-cup size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, his male equipment was beginning to shrink in his groin. His manhood contiunued to shrink, becoming smaller by the second. As it was, a slit was beginning to form as a vagina was getting ready. When the penis was small enough, it went right back into Brandon's body, becoming a pair of ovaries. As his new vagina formed, a womb with eggs formed as well, thanks to the new space created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this went on, his, or rather her, age went up to 35 years old. His face softened as his facial features began to change. His lips puffed out to a kissable size, his cheeks rose higher on his face, his eyelashes grew outwards, his eyebrows thinned out, and his nose became small and cute. Small holes in his ears for earrings also formed, nearly completing his physical changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this happened, the rest of his new memories formed in his head. She married Steve after collage and a wonderful daughter, named Stephanie. She became a housewife mostly, but was an accountant for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Brandon Ryan was no more. Now, there was only Kate Ryan, Steve's \"new\" wife.</span></div></div>",

Brandon didn't exist now. There was only Kate now. Nate may still remember a bit of his old friend, but if he was, then he was only one. Anyway, Kate walked over to a towel rack and wrapped a towel around her torso as a woman would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the mirror and smiled at her reflection. She looked good for her age after all. After she admired herself a bit, she started drying her long dark hair. As she was, she heard a knock. She knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in\" said Kate, and Steve walked in to see his beautful wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello beautiful\" said Steve, making Kate smile. Nothing more needed to be said as the husband and wife kissed each other passionately. As they did, Kate's towel fell but they didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking great as usual\" commented Steve as he noticed her lack of a towel. Kate then smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'll see it again tonight\" said Kate in a husky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled yet again.</span></div></div>",

He was now a couple of inches taller than lynda. \" Mom what is for dinner?\" he said as he placed his hands on his hips sort of like his mom did.

You couldn't help but stare at her giant chest while she was talking to you, especially since she was only in her bra. She caught you staring and exclaimed,\"I got some nice tits, don't i bro?\". Completely shocked, you just nodded your head. Since she had your teenage boy personality, she wasn't embarrassed about her female body or diction. Actually, she started to wonder why she was even wearing a top. Nate doesn't have to and he's not embarrassed...why should she be? \"You know man, I don't even know why i'm wearing this sissy bra\" she said. Suddenly, she reached back and unfastened it, letting it fall to the ground (to your excitement and uncomfort). Now she was just sitting there letting it all hang out. \"Ah,\" she said, \"Much better now. These boobs are so big and heavy some times, and that bra is just too uncomfortable. Well as much as i hate cooking, i should really be getting back to it. I am your mom after all! Someone has to do this awful work...\" With that, she stood up (boobs jiggling rapidly back and forth) and went to cook. What now?

But soon enough she got a bit hungry and found your candies again.  You should have hidden them this time, but since you were only fifteen you weren't overly concerned with thinking ahead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda took one of the candies and found them to be delicious.  She then ate another one, but before eating a third she sighed to herself, \"I wish I could eat as many candies as I want without them going to my hips.\"  This wish had two effects, your mom now had an inexhaustible amount of candies.  No matter how many she ate she would always have some left.  It also meant that she would continuously be eating candies.  There wasn't a time when she didn't have a candy in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a bunch, Linda decided she didn't want to play video games anymore.  With the personality of a teenaged boy she decided she wanted to play with her boobs instead.  This was a good decision since playing with them felt so good.  If felt so good in fact that she started to get wet down below.  She started to use her other hand to message the wetness.  This is what she was doing when you returned with the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" you said when you saw her, \"stop that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't say that bro if you knew how it felt.  I wish you knew how it felt to have a body like mine,\" she retorted.  Immediately your body shortened, your hair lengthened, you figure became curvier, your skin softened, your face changed, your chest developed breasts and the rest of you changed so that you looked like a twin of your mother.  Since it was Linda's wish you didn't know that you weren't supposed to look exactly like your mother, nor would anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Erin came from her room she had heard you return with the pizza.  \"Mom, put on some clothes,\" she demanded.  Linda who was still just wearing a pair of panties did as you would have.  She went to her room to get dressed.  Teenaged boys don't want to walk around in their underwear in front of their sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to you, Erin said, \"Nate, what type of pizza did you get us?\"  Even though you looked like your mom, everyone could tell you two apart somehow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got a pizza with pepperonis and extra cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" is all she said as she went to the kitchen to get some plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Nate's always been a bit of a jerk, and their mother is always complaining at him. so Erin made a wish for him to understand Lynda better, see how she how she felt.<br>\r\nWhat Erin wished is for Nate to have the same state of mind as Lynda, so he would think like his mother. That was the intention, right?!<br>\r\n<b>So, why is Nate slowly turning into his mother?!</b><br>\r\nErin quickly grabs the jar from the floor, and runs towards the front room. Luckily, Lynda and Nate were so busy concentrating that they didn't notice the jar.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\nJumping onto the sofa/couch, Erin looks at the jar of magic candies with frustration. Why did they screw up the wish?!<br>\r\n\"Argh....\" she growls, completely angry at the candies. \"I wish I knew what went wrong....\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, a idea forms into her head, and Erin looks at the candies again.<br>\r\nErin, with some hesitation, grabs one candies and pops it into her mouth.<br>\r\n\"I wish I know why my brother is turning into my mother when I only wished for him to have the same state of mind as her.....\"<br>\r\n<b><sup>POOF!</sup></b><br>\r\nErin jumps, and turns to see a small pamphlet on the couch, with the words '<b>MAGIC CANDY SITUATIONS</b>' on the front.<br>\r\nShe grabs it, and begins to read.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<i>Hello! So, you have received Magic Candies, which when you eat and wish, the wish that you say will be granted. A basic set of instructions on how to use them is with all jars. But, if you have wished for this pamphlet to appear, that means something has gone very wrong with your wish. This pamphlet will hopefully answer your questions.</i><br>\r\n<i>Now, this pamphlet has appear to you when you wished to know why your brother is turning into your mother, when you only wished him to have the same state of mind.<br>\r\nWell, the thing is, when you wish someone to be someone else or act like someone else or think like someone else, it will end up transforming them into them. The wishes for transforming are put into the same category. <br>\r\nIf you want someone to be/act/think like someone else, the wish takes it as 'turn them into someone else'. <br>\r\nIf you wished your brother to think like an adult woman, he would turn into an adult woman that is either related or not related to your family. <br>\r\nIt's normally 50/50 there. But since you wished your brother to think like your mother, the wish took it as you wanted your brother to BE mother. Next time, be more specific. That's hopefully answer your first question.</i><br>\r\n<i>Now, the next question is, since you didn't mean that wish to happen, how can I stop it? Well, bad news is, there isn't much you can do. Your brother will keep changing into your mother. It's unavoidable.<br>\r\nHowever, there is some good news. <br>\r\nIf you wish this wish 'I wish my brother will keep his memories while still transforming', this will bring your brother back to his senses. <br>\r\nThe thing is, since you cast the wish, no one but you will notice your brother's transformation. <br>\r\nIf you wish this quickly now, you CAN save your brother. <br>\r\nIf you do not, your mother, the original one, will disappear and your brother will become your new mother, and no one but you will notice.<br>\r\nOnce that happens, reality will think your new mother has always been your mother, and you can NOT reverse the changes.<br>\r\nWhen you wish this wish, your brother and mother will come to their senses and probably freak, so it's up to you to explain what is happening. <br>\r\nOnce that's done, wish for another pamphlet to see what to do to reverse the changes.<br>\r\nNOTE: Since the first wish is still working, there is a 50/50 chance that the second wish won't work. You have to decide quickly!<br>\r\nWe hope this pamphlet has been helpful! </i><br>\r\n-<br>\r\nErin tightens her grip on the pamphlet. A 50/50 chance of it working?! That's too risky to work with?!<br>\r\nA giggle is heard from the kitchen, as her mother and her almost-mother are almost finishing off dinner, and that means the transformation is almost complete.<br>\r\n\"<i>Fuck it....!</i>\" she thinks, determinately. Erin grabs a candy from the jar and pops it into her mouth.<br>\r\n\"I wish my brother will keep his memories while still transforming!\"<br>\r\nDoes the wish work?</span></div></div>",

And this time focus!! ...or else I'm going to cease to exist...\" A tear runs down Nate's cheek, but the Lynda-dominant mind can't figure out why she would be crying. \"Must be allergies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Nate's botched wish takes effect, despite not being finished. Due to it's loose interpretation, the magic had to assume Nate's will as it approached Erin. As the arcane force hit his sister, it decided what it thought he meant. It decided to slowly turn Erin into...</span></div></div>",

He did not realize he did not wish to change himself physically, so he still <i>LOOKED</i> like Lynda, just a 16-year old version of her, but now his mind was clear of his mom's personality, and his was free to resume full control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the wish finished his work, Mike seemed to lose interest, and began treating Nate like a daughter instead of a wife. \"Now, Lydia, I want you to watch your siblings while your mother and I go out tonight. You can have your girlfriend over, what's her name, Kate, but don't get too googly-eyed over her to forget to do your job. Do it good enough, and I might pay you a little extra...\" He goes to walk out, then turns back, and says, \"...and I know your sister Erin is going through some awkward cross-dressing uber-tomboy phase, and claiming she's a boy. I think she's in the closet. Maybe, since, you know, you're... er, a lesbian, and whatnot, you could talk to her, girl to girl. I think that's what's wrong with her, but I'm no shrink. Anyways, we got to get ready.\" Mike heads upstairs to get ready to head out wit the real, original Lynda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smirked, remembering the original wish he made in his haze. \"Let's modify that wish, shall we?\" Nate pulls out a candy and eats it. \"This is for screwing with my head, Erin.\" He suckles a moment, then has an epiphany. \"Alright... I wish that although Erin will continue to mentally become a boy, her appearance and wardrobe will increasingly more feminine... and slutty, and she will become 21. By the time she becomes 21, she will act like a man, a total dude, but will look like, and want to look like, a skanky model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Erin suddenly stopped rummaging through Mike's clothing. She said to herself, \"Eh, this is good enough.\" She was dressed in a pair of jeans and a wifebeater, and slipped out just before Mike and Lynda rounded the corner from the stairs, making her way to their room. As they enter, Mike says, seeing the mess Erin left, \"That girl has been stealing my clothes again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Erin's room, Erin gagged at the Twilight posters and Justin Bieber swag. \"God, what am I, a total wuss?\" With that comment, the posters became swimsuit models, and the Bieber swag became albums from such illustrious bands such as Pantera, Iron Maiden, Finntroll, and Dethklok. She looks at an armoire and says, \"What's with the fru-fru furniture?\" That utterance made the armoire into weight and dumbbell set. Her body began to change, getting slightly taller, to 5' 3\", hair growing a few inches, her bust gaining a size or two, as the jeans became shorts, and the wife beater became a spaghetti strap tank top. She was about 15 now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I gotta piss like a mofo!!\" she boldly exclaims out loud with pride. She goes to her personal bathroom, and sees scented bath soaps. \"Who's the dumb broad who's been using my shower?\" The soaps become men's shampoos and soaps. She then turns to the toilet, drops her shorts and underwear (which had morphed back into panties), arcs back, and begins peeing, and despite the anatomical differences, easily hits the mark, all with the bathroom door wide open. As she whizzed, she grew another inch or so, as did her hair, her hair now down to the small of her back around her waist. The tank top grew tighter over now D-cup chest, the top of the top showing off more cleavage. After finishing, she pulls what was now silk panties and a denim skirt up and fastened them back up. She was now 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back into her room, it looked like a man cave now, filled with sports memorabilia, trophies, inflatable furniture, every gaming console imaginable, stacks of Playboys and Hustlers, and gym equipment of of various shapes and sizes. The only sign a girl even resides here is the closet full of super slutty skirts and tops. \"Ah hah!! Now this is more like it!!\" Erin says in a low, but still female voice. \"Too bad I got to go bad to college next week... What am I saying? College rocks!!\" Erin's hair grows again, reaching her butt, as the bottom of the now pink tank top rides up a bit, showing up some midriff. Her height maxes out at 5' 7\". Her denim skirt rides up more, becoming a low-riding leather miniskirt with a white belt that a Budweiser belt buckle. 6\" stiletto pumps adorned her feet. An eagle eye could see the tale-tell edges of the straps of pink thong straps sticking out above the top of her miniskirt. Erin was now 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whipped out her cell phone, and dialed some of her friends from college in town. \"Yo, Brock, Rando!! It is my 21st, and I want to get effin' hammered!! Trust me, I <b>AM</b> going to get my keg stand champ title back tonight!! Kappas rule!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heads downstairs, telling Nate (Lydia) as she passes her, \"Hah, I see you got stuck watching the shorties. I'd watch them, but I got guy stuff to do. Try not to 'estrogen' up the place while I'm gone.\" Erin takes her car keys, and hops into a supercharged Dodge Ram she had modified herself into practically a monster truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... even weirder than I imagined it would be, but funny nonetheless.\" Shortly thereafter, Mike and Lynda step out as well. Lydia then says to herself, \"Well now, guess I got watch Trevor and Nicole for a few hours. How hard could that be?\"</span></div></div>",

The legs fuse together as they rose up to mid-shin, except for a split that kept going up the front of Nate's leg to just over the knee. The heels gain an extra inch as the goo began to slide odd Nate's arms and shoulders, turning black. A pearl necklace wrapped around Nate's neck as diamond studded gold earrings pierced Nate's ears. Finally, the goo of the fabric, now clearly a strapless black silk dress, solidified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was amazed by the new dress... but was more amazed Mike didn't seem to notice this. Luckily, Mike had turned to look up to the second floor to see the original Lynda... <i><b>FUMING</b></i>!! \"Bitch, first you get chummy with me, then you start to look like me, and now you're trying to steal <i>my</i> man!!\" Erin ran out to see the commotion and saw both Lyndas... then thinking on the wish she had made on Nate, realized all the things she recently did must be candy related... that if it looks like a girl, smells like a girl, sounds like a girl, and was dressed like a girl, then... \"...then I must be a girl!! <i><b>NATE!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to her room, and nabbed the pouch that held a stockpile of candies she had swiped. As she swallowed a candy, penis had grown out just over her vagina. \"I wish to be able to think like the girl I was born as again!!\" A tingle ran through her, and found her mind returning to her original, feminine state... however, she then noticed she had the stiff erection between her legs, and now coarse mannish body hair was growing all over her chest and arms. \"I'm still changing physically... right.\" She was about to change back, but decided on an amusing addendum. \"I wish my transformation into a boy would stop, that all my excess body hair would disappear forever, and that I would be a girl again... except that I will retain this new penis, and despite having no testicles, it will be fully functional. <i><b>FULLY FUNCTIONAL!!</b></i> ...and that I will also become 18 and have D-cup breasts!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilking the candy for all it's worth, she felt her every demand begin to take hold, as she shed all the body hair she had accrued, as well as the feminine body hair she had before the wish, leaving the only hair on her body on her head. All the other changes she may of failed to notice reverted, restoring her feminine form, except the phallus she suddenly elected to retain. Inside her, new organs grew attached to her ovaries that acted like female testicles. Then, the aging part of the wish took hold, as Erin shot up in height 5\", to net her a height of 5' 4\", as she took on 18-year old features. As her bosom grew to her demands, she noticed she was still wearing her dad's underwear, and nothing else. She also noticed the candy was on the verge of collapse, and made a quick wish before it fully dissolved. \"I wish I had sexier clothes for my new body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad's underwear melted and morphed into lace panties that were snug, but loose enough to accommodate the wang she now had, as a matching strapless bra formed from thin air. She pulled back up the jean shorts she was wearing, not sure why, as they seem to be too small, feeling like the candy was compelling her to do this, stopping at her thighs, as the garment grew to fit her. As it slid up, the material began to change from denim to black leather, and the legs began to merge. By the time she had lifted the garment over her new ghetto booty, zipped the fly, buttoned it up, and fastened the white belt wrapped in its belt loops, it had become a low-rise leather miniskirt teetering close to being a micro mini. She bent over with the same compulsion and donned her shirt, and found it was also changing, widening to fit, but also losing material, and before she knew it, it had become a lime green tube top that completely showed off her entire midriff and accentuated her breasts and cleavage even more. The sneakers she was wearing became white 3\" heel ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the changes finished, Erin looked at the new her, and said, \"Not bad...\" She then thought of her best friend, Carly Goode, and wanted to share this her. With a new candy, she wished Carly into her room, and with careful wording, effected the same changes to Carly. She watched the surprised Carly look around confused, then grab her groin as she feel the new penis grow out, tenting her skirt. Then her body matured into a college-aged teen's body, gaining breast tissue that ratcheted up her already C-cup bust to almighty EE-cups. Carly's pleated skirt's hemline withered up a few centimeters, stopping just past her knees. Her blouse melted away, leaving only a yellow spaghetti strap bikini top on her chest. While her sneakers hardly changed, her socks became oversized and loose, coming up to just under her knees and drooping over her shoes. \"Wha... Huh... Ga...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin put a finger over her mouth and said, \"Don't worry about it. It's magic... Magic that will make our lives so much better, but first, I have to take of something...\" She takes the candies she had amassed and, with Carly in hand, goes back out to see the two Lyndas in full catfight mode. \"I wish I knew where all the candies were.\" Erin said. Suddenly, as though she gained X-ray vision, she could see the now glowing treats. They were in Nate's room, in his dresser. Erin ran in and acquired them, multiplying her stash by a factor of 50.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are doing? Why are there two of your moms and why are they fighting?\" Carly asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting back at everyone, of course.\" Erin answered, going to the stairwell, pouring a bunch of candies into two two bags, keeping over half for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin throws the two bags amongst the fighting clones, chortling, \"Duh, for the evulz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bags hit the ladies (well lady and almost lady, as while Nate's balls had pulled in and allowed the formation of a vagina, he still had his penis), Erin mad a wish. \"I wish they notice the bags of candies, each taking one, and if they do not know what they do, become aware of their power.\" Suddenly, they look over the bags, disengaging from their tussle to dart for a bag each. Nate and Lynda both get their respective bag, roll over, and land on their feet. \"Bitch...\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skank whore.\" The real Lynda said. They stand at each end of the foyer in a Mexican standoff for a minute, then they quickly pop candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does this magic firefight go down?</span></div></div>",

She quickly looks inside to find the candies were now in a whole compartment of the purse, practically running out of the handbag. Seeing the candies jogged your memories of them, and shocked Nate's dormant consciousness back to the surface. Natalie crammed a candy and yelled, \"I wish I knew what was happening to me!!\" The candy filled Natalie's head with visions of Erin's trickery, her subversive wishes that resulted in him becoming a physical clone (and potentially a mental clone) of his mother. Natalie scowls, exclaiming, \"I'll show her responsible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. Nice while it lasted.\" Lynda sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie pops a candy, stating, \"I wish my mind was restored to its original state before Erin's wish.\" In moments, Nate's mind was her own again. While still sucking on the candy, Natalie saw her reflection and said, \"Stupid wish taking my youth... I wish I was 15 again...\" Natalie watched as the years melted away, her height ducking down from Lynda's 5' 5\", down to 5' even, the height Lynda was at age 15. Her waist narrowed a bit further, reaching the figure Lynda had in the teen years. The royal blue dress she was wearing separated at the hips into a tank top and a skirt. The lower hems of the top and skirt rode up, turning the articles into a crop top and a miniskirt, showing off much of her well-toned abs and thighs. Her breasts perked up more, but remained the same DD-cup size as before. Finally, Natalie's hair receded back up into her scalp, so much so it almost gave her a boyish hairdo, the same haircut Lynda had when she was 15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was awe struck by the body staring back at her in the mirror. \"Okay, mom, I feel weird for saying this, but you were kinda hot when you were my age...\" Natalie said. She then remembered her mission. \"Now, to deal with my sis... First, to keep her from tripping me up... I wish my brain, intelligence, thought processes, and personality can never again be changed by the power of the candies, that I am Nate Wilson now and for always.\" Natalie could feel an impregnable barrier go around her mind, her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda says, \"Nate, I think there was a flaw in your wish.\" Nate whipped out a Learner's Permit from the purse and saw the name Nate Wilson... across from the female face she saw in the mirror. Nate groaned and lamented, \"Great, I changed history and made this girl body the true Nate Wilson... but at least no one can screw with my head now.\" Nate looks at her mom and says, \"However, I don't wan't to be a clone of you, and you did go along with this without questioning it, so...\" She pops another candy and begins changing Lynda, making her six years younger, extending her hair another 12\" and turning it cherry red, made her eyes green, made her nose slightly wider but shorter, knocked her breasts up to G-cups, made her complexion extremely pale, narrowed her waist to a size 2, changed her clothes into scrawny white tube top, denim miniskirt, thong, and white knee-high 4\" heel boots, and altered her brain to give her the intellect of a quantum physicist (and changed her job to such), but gave her the fashion sense of a slutty bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda says, \"Nate, honey, when we get home, do you mind letting me see some of those candies so I can study their chemical and molecular composition? I've been waiting to give my electron microscope a challenge...\" Nate nods as she returns her focus to Erin. \"Now, what to do to you?\" she thinks. The candy goes in and Nate wishes...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Note: Because of Nate's \"mind protection\" wish from the last chapter, reality changed, and now everyone acknowledges Nate as a girl.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that Erin was currently reading \"Tokyo Mew Mew,\" Nate used that as inspiration for her revenge. \"I wish Erin was my loyal catgirl minion.\" she uttered as she left the clothing store with the also recently altered Lynda, whom Nate changed for not using common sense when she was turning into an exact copy of her before, and because didn't like the idea of being a clone of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Erin was smirking, listening to music on her mp3 player while reading manga on the bed, wearing a pair of non-prescription reading glasses (her eyesight was 20/25), thinking if Nate had figured out what was going on or not yet, or if her sister's consciousness was gone altogether. \"Those wishes were the best thing I ever did. If I never see that immature girl again, then hooray for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing was, Erin had always been the one to fail to see she was the immature one in light of her higher intellect. Maybe the IQ gap between Nate and her could have been summed up in one word: arrogance. Nate could be petty on rare occasions (like this), but Erin held grudges. She still had not forgiven Nate for spilling punch on her dress back on Christmas when she was 8, or when Nate made fart jokes with her friends while standing within earshot of Erin's \"intellectual\" friends last year in school (because of her higher IQ, Nate and Erin are in the same grade).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the time Nate and Lynda got on the freeway heading home with pizza for supper, at home, Erin felt a strange discomfort in her ears and spine. She rustled about in place on the bed, and for the moment, the sensations went away. Minutes later though, the music started getting louder. Erin looked at her mp3 player, and saw the volume setting hadn't changed, but just to be safe, turned it down. \"Maybe I did have it too high... Unnngghhh....!!\" Just then, she groaned as the sound spiked again, but then the earbuds fell out of her ears, while a painful sensation fills her rear. Her glasses went flying off her face, Erin swearing like her ears \"threw\" them off. Erin arches her back to a nearly impossible curve, then flips over onto her stomach, when the seat of her pants tents up. Erin tries to fiddle with her jeans, but before she can undo her belt, there's a set of rips, which greatly relieve the pain, but add new alien sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pain gone, Erin suddenly noticed her eyesight was now much crisper, and she could hear the music from her earbuds as clearly as if she was wearing them, but they were laying on the bed now. \"Vision and hearing so sharp...\" Erin muttered as she got up, feeling an odd protrusion as she got to her feet. That's when she looked back and saw a brunette feline tail lightly swishing behind her. Erin quickly grabbed it, feeling the sensation of holding it, and ran to the mirror on the inside of the closet door. That's when she saw the damage. She saw the brown cat ears sticking out of her hair and the reflective tint to her irises. She also noticed that instead of the gaping hole in her pants she expected, they had somehow mended themselves and formed an elastic-lined tail hole with a riveted strap right above the hole to reinforce the hole and waistband. Then it hits her. \"I'm a friggin' nekomimi!! How?!\" She dig through her pants drawer and finds all her pants, shorts, and skirts have been modified with tail holes. Then it hits her again. \"Those candies... Nate!!\" She searches for more candies to try and remedy this, but realizes she used up all the ones she had squirreled away from Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang, and Erin looked out the window to see Nate and her mom coming to the door. Erin ran down to give her a piece of her mind. \"How did she escape from my wish trap?!\" Erin wondered as she stomped down to steps. Finally she opened the door. \"Nate, you bitc...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate spoke before Erin could really begin her tirade, \"Erin, go unload the car, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin found herself unwillingly answering her older sister, \"Yes, Nate-oneesan!! Right away!!\" Erin walked to the car, looking like a person possessed trying to force out the poltergeist within them, and gathered up the shopping bags, brought them in, then got the pizzas and brought them into the kitchen. Once she put down the food, Erin yelled at Nate, \"What the hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate said, \"Payback.\" Erin snarled a bit. \"By chance I managed to find my candies again once my physical changes ended, and I used them to return my thinker back to normal, and then shielded it from from further attack. Changing reality by accident so that I had always been a girl was a small price to pay to keep from losing my mind forever though. Now I made it so you're my loyal catgirl minion, i.e., you have to do whatever I say, whether you want to or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin growled and steamed, but couldn't form a cogent answer, except for, \"...Argh, you suck...!! You're so immature!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would an immature older sister got you a half pepperoni, half anchovy pizza?\" Nate countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anchovy?!\" Erin said with delight, tail thrust into the air, her response highly feline. Suddenly, she realized what she did and said with an irate tone, seizing the box and scarfing an anchovy-laden slice as she walked away, \"Dammit... You're a louse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was mostly uneventful, save for a few times Erin tried to pounce on Nate's purse full of candies, but was easily thwarted by a command from Nate. Nate handed Lynda a few candies as promised to examine in her new lab (given to her by Nate via another wish), and everyone else went to bed around midnight, save for Lynda... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the night went mostly uneventful, but to play it safe, Nate told Erin, \"By the way, I forbid you from stealing the candies.\" This basically gave her a \"Swiper, no swiping!!\" order, preventing her from stealing the candies overnight and getting her desired revenge. There was much cursing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks.\" Erin whines, almost crying with rage into her pillow before trying to get modicum of sleep. This was easier than she had hoped thanks to now being part cat. \"You suck, Nate.\" she mumbles in her sleep, realizing she was already in REM sleep. Erin was great at lucid dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Nate woke up and began to get ready. Their dad, Mike, was just getting home from his job working the graveyard shift at the hospital, and was eating some leftover pizza saved for him. He notices that Erin isn't down. \"Usually she's already eating her cereal by now... Is she sick?\" He looks to Nate, walking by about to take a shower, and asked, \"Where's Erin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get her.\" Nate runs up to her room to not see her... right away. Instead, she spots a lump under the cover. Walking over, Nate lifts the cover off the lump to find Erin curled up much like a cat, or as much like a cat the human form with a flexible feline spine can, her tail curled around her. As she slumbers, she lets out an unconscious \"Nya.\" followed by her blurting a plan in her mind, saying, \"Maybe if I obstruct my ears and can't hear Nate's commands, I'll be free from her control...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiled, then walked to the kitchen, grabs a cup, fills it with water, returns to Erin's room, and throws it all over her. This makes the neko girl freak right the hell out, almost leaping to the ceiling, hissing like a real cat, but as soon as she made contact with her bed again, she pounced on her cackling sister. However, Nate was ready. \"Sit, girl!!\" Erin slid off of Nate and sat there in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling, Erin snapped, \"Sit?! I'm a catgirl, not a doggirl, or did you forget?\" All she is met with is laughter. Erin adds, \"And the water, dick move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learn from the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin moaned as she felt the effect of the sit command fade, \"Touche.\" She realized she would have done the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You got to get ready for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, like this!!\" Erin panicked, gripping her ears, and then wringing her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that. I mean, what are you worried about?\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mike stepped in, shouting, \"Are you two fight... <b>WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO ERIN?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate casually looked to Erin as Mike fell over against the wall, almost cartoonishly pointing at his catgirl daughter, \"Oh right. I didn't tell him, or change his perception, the reality of the world any of that fun stuff when I changed you into a nekomimi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus the whole freak out, which is why I can't go to school!!\" Erin whined. She walked over to her dresser, pulled out a random pair of pants, and held the seat up to Nate. \"Also, as you can tell, your wish didn't bother to make any more 'tail-friendly' clothes than what I had on last night, and I can't live life in one outfit...\" Nate cracked a smile. \"...nor am I going around in skirts. One wrong move...\" She whips her tail in an upward gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate waved his hand in front of Erin's face like a Jedi using a mind trick, saying, \"You <i>WILL</i> go to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin uncontrollably salutes her big sis, and with a grin on her face, exclaims, \"Yes, oneesan!!\" As soon as she did that, Erin was fuming, and followed it up, teeth grit, \"You bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was standing shocked, finally able to blurt out, \"Somebody tell me something now or... or... I grounding.... someone... something...\" Trevor walked by. \"Trevor, you're grounded!!\" Mike yelled on impulse, his shock having fried his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...? What did I do?\" Trevor ran down the hall crying. Mike sheepishly stepped over to Erin, then deftly snapped up Erin's tail, pulling on it. Erin let out an audible yelp of pain, and as Mike felt her trying to wriggle her appendage free of his grasp, he finally let it go, only uttering, \"My little Erin's somehow obtained real cat ears and a tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate says, \"Alright, this is sad.\" She pops a candy and makes a wish. \"I wish dad retroactively knew Erin was a nekomimi, in fact let's just amend the wish so that Erin was born a catgirl, so everyone already will already know your feline traits, and I want your clothes altered to be 'tail-friendly.' There. Happy?\" They watched as Mike began to relax, and a tail hole formed in the pants Erin was holding. Nate then remembers something else, \"Oh, and I wish Trevor had not been senselessly grounded.\" Erin gives him a cross look. \"What? I consider quite the benevolent big sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I told you lately I hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning goes rather smoothly, given the situation. Erin hissed when she first got in the shower, much to Trevor's amusement, who heard it from his room. Nate wore a lime green halter top that showed off her belly, a plaid pleated miniskirt, and a pair of strappy sandals. Erin donned a red-sleeved grey baseball tee, jeans, and sneakers. Lynda came down ready to drive the kids to school and go to work at the local university's physics lab dressed only in a skimpy white bikini top that barely covered her massive breasts and showed a fair amount of under and side boob, black leather miniskirt that only extends an inch or two below her substantial rear, thong panties, and knee high white 4\" stiletto boots. Erin went to object, but Nate made her clam up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, Nate and Erin arrive at school, a crowd of boys coming to see their mom, as they always do (as history had been rewritten). Erin pleads with as they enter the establishment of learning, \"Please, just let me go about my day in peace...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate strokes her chin and says, \"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin says, \"You know, I realize it now; you used to be nicer. Those candies have turned you into a total bitch, Nate.\" Erin was totally feigning remorse, a skill she had mastered by age five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate...</span></div></div>",

Then, She then tells Nate to try on this bikini top she has for him because if he goes swimming He will need it.

This is due to Nate acquiring Lynda's feelings, when she was a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the wish has been made, Nate has been gaining more of Lynda's habits, like crossing her legs when talking to someone, helping her during dinner, liking like she likes, everything!<br>\r\nAll this things of Lynda are slowly changing Nate into her, one at a time. Erin's wish is changing Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis evening, Nate found it extremely difficult not to stare at his dad.<br>\r\n Because Nate's body is changing, Lynda's feelings has made Nate think his dad is attractive. <br>\r\nTonight, Nate fought the temptation of crawling into bed with Mike, because for a minute, he thought he was Lynda.<br>\r\nNot if Mike noticed. <br>\r\nThe wish has change Mike as well. At the very start of this wish, he sees Lynda and Nate as two different people. But once Nate's transformation into Lynda has finished, he'll think that Nate is Lynda, or that he has two wives, Lynda and Natalie Wilson. Nate is becoming a exact copy of Lynda from every detail.<br>\r\n But the wish is slow at the moment, taking its time. Eventually, Nate's breasts will be the same as Lynda's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr will it?<br>\r\nIn Nate's dreams, he is having a vivid dream of him two days ago.<br>\r\nInstead of him playing video games, it was him in his mother's body making dinner.<br>\r\nThen it shifts to him when he had his fourteenth birthday.<br>\r\n Instead of him talking with his crush, it was him in his mother's body making out with a boy. Not sure who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the dream shifts into a blank space. Nate is floating around in it.<br>\r\nHe turns round to see multiply bras floating around.<br>\r\nNot the small ones, like A and B, but much large ones, like DD, which his mother has, or even large ones, E, F, G, H, I and even J! Due to Lynda's feelings, he reaches out, because he wants bigger breasts.<br>\r\nWhen he grabs a large bra, he then wakes up, in a cold sweat.<br>\r\nHe sits up, boldly, and whispers to himself:<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm going to need a bigger bra....</i>\"<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Now, instead of being boy short, it has grown down to neck length, giving Nate short-girl hair that doesn't make him look like a boy, but a girlish-boy.<br>\r\nThe next, is his face. His face is now more smoother, slowly changing into his mother's face, but it looks like it's quarter way through.<br>\r\nThe next thing is his chest, waist and hips. Nate has lost the extra ribs that men have, and his chest is getting into the shape it was before his mother's breast grew. His waist is now exactly the same as his mother's, thin, and hips are larger like his mothers, giving him the beginning of an hourglass figure, like, yet again, like Lynda's.<br>\r\nHis legs are shaved, and thin filled with womanly fat, and he has sneakers on, girl ones, since he can't wear high-hills yet.<br>\r\nNate goes over to the bra section, to check out the size of bras they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>***Note***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is, let me tell you, if Nate picks a bra size bigger than his mother's, Lynda will change as well.<br>\r\nIt's simple really. When Erin made the wish that Nate will be like his mother, Lynda became the master copy. This means if any is wished to be like her, the transformation will BE EXACTLY like her, up to the last detail.<br>\r\nBut, if a clone, in this case, Nate, has been wished on that a certain part of their body will do something, like his breasts will fill the bra he is wearing, Lynda won't change, apart from one thing. If Nate chose a bra size that is bigger than Lynda's, in this case, DD, and fill out past DD, Lynda's bra size will change as well.<br>\r\nLynda HAS to be the master copy, and every clone has to be like her. So if a clone has something bigger than Lynda, say, butt size, Lynda's butt size will change to the clone's one, and that will become the template for future copies.<br>\r\nSo, if Nate gets, let's say, an E cup, Lynda's breasts will become an E cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***End Note***</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to the story.<br>\r\nNate goes to the bra section, and looks at the bras. There are many different colors and designs of these bras, so many to chose from!<br>\r\nNate sees the A cup bras, which are colorful.<br>\r\nHe frowns at this, because this is not what he is looking for.<br>\r\nHe goes through B, which has wonderful designs.<br>\r\nHe goes through C, which are a bit plain, white and black.<br>\r\nNate stops at D. There are no D sized bras, sold out.<br>\r\nHe looks for bigger ones. No DD, E or F<br>\r\nThe only bra sizes they have are G and H, which both of them are pretty big. We've got to the point that what ever bra Nate chooses, Lynda's breast WILL become bigger.<br>\r\nSo, the deciding question.<br>\r\nDoes Nate pick G Cup or H Cup?</span></div></div>",

Nate currently looks like a boy turning into a small chested girl wearing his mother's bra.<br>\r\nSuddenly, a small flash occurs, and Nate looks down.<br>\r\nHe sees his breast grow to exactly half way, filling the bra to a large C cup, but not the size of Lynda's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes the bra off, and goes compares his new breast with Lynda's.<br>\r\nNate does this silently, and soon frowns to see that they're not the same size yet.<br>\r\nA sudden snore by Lynda reminds Nate he shouldn't be here.<br>\r\nHe grabs the two bras, the small one to prevent his parents from knowing he was here, and the big one to finish the growth of his breasts. Nate also closes the draws to prevent any knowledge of him being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate, quickly and quietly, sneaks out of his parents room, and goes back to his room.<br>\r\nHe sites on his messy bed, and grabs the E cup bra.<br>\r\nHe puts it on again, and watches what happens.<br>\r\nAt first, nothing happens, but then the flash occurs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate grins with glee as his breast become a solid and perky E cup, just like his mother's. Well, exactly like his mothers.<br>\r\nHe stuffs the small bra under his bed, to get rid of it later.<br>\r\nNate promptly puts his top back on, which has changed into what an adult female would wear to sleep, with breasts that big. Nate decides to keep the bra on, to get use to his large breasts, and goes to sleep.<br>\r\nA thought floats into Nate's head, as he drifts off to dream land.<br>\r\n\"<i>I need to be like Lynda....

Your breasts though are still small though, about a large A-cup to a small B-cup. Feeling a little let down, but hopeful that won't be the case for long, you begin to put on the bra. As the fabric touches the skin the magic activates causing your breasts to swell. With each attempt you make to secure the bra in place your breasts push further and further outward, preventing you from putting it on. Finally you give up and look at your breasts again. Looking at there new size, though to you they look normal, you judge what bra you'll need next and poke your head out the door, bra in tow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey mom,\" You start. \"I think I'm gonna need to try the D-cup.\" Your mother gives you a strange look, not understanding how she could have been that off. She takes the bra away from you and quickly returns with a new, D-cup sized. Once again you try it on only for the magic to swell them further. Finally giving up on trying to put it on you reexamine your breasts and judge them at an F-cup.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feeling the strain on your back you use your right arm to lift your breasts and poke your head out the door, along with the ill fitting bra. \"Hey mom can you bring me an H-cup to see if that'll work.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your mother agrees and once again returns with the requested bra as well as a second, larger one. \"Just in case.\" she says, leaving you to try them on. Once again as you attempt to put on the H-cup bra the magic swells them to the point it won't fit. Feeling as if your breasts trying to tear themselves from your chest you sit down and take a quick breath. \"Gosh I hope this one fits.\" you silently hope. As you begin putting on the final bra the magic once ore begins to cause your breasts to swell. This time however, as they reach the point of exceeding the bra the swelling slows down and finally stops with them fitting comfortably inside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once you snap the bra in place you slowly rise up adjusting the old(new) weight hanging on your chest. As you turn from side to side and test the bra's support the magic that caused the growth seeps into the bra adding some support as well. While you will still experience some back pain, it will help to mitigate it somewhat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally satisfied with the choice you look in the tag and gasp when you see the size is an M-cup. \"I'm as big as mom.\" you think. Excited by this prospect you quickly call your mom in to see how you look. As soon as she enters, and see's just how big your are she squee's in delight and move up to hug you. The two of you struggle for a bit, the to of ya'lls breasts getting in the way, before you finally manage to embrace each other.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh sweetie, you look so wonderful.\" Your mother says, a smile splitting her face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks mom.\" You reply, grinning just as wide as her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I had a hunch that last one was going to fit.\" she says while stepping out of the room, \"So I grabbed you a new shirt too.\" She said presenting it to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking the shirt and looking it over you notice that it's a long v-neck. Looking a little skeptical at it you say, \"Isn't this a little reveling though?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it never hurts giving the boys a little some thing to look at right.\" She says with a mischievous look in her eye's.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess not.\" You say, quickly sliding it over your head and adjusting it to show off your breasts as much as possible. \"So what now?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I was thinking that we could.....</span></div></div>",

I mean Nate, come on out.\" You hurry out to your mother, but as you start to open the door you feel your chest shifting again.

Why were you going into the same changing room as your mom? Your mind started to fight over the obvious errors in the world around you. You clutched your head, why hadn't you noticed all the people looking at you oddly? What was happening how could you have been so ok with this insanity just seconds ago? Looking down at your.... your mother's breasts on your body, you began to freak out. How could you undo this change. The headache began to intensify, you felt like searing knife was carving at your mind. Then in a burst of pain you fell to your knees, then to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you came to, you began to wonder what you had been doing. That's right I need to chase after Lynda, she can't have all the fun. You grab the blouse a perfect copy of Lynda's and headed towards the changing room. You spotted Lynda waiting impatiently for you at one of the stalls. \"What took you so long, come on I already tried mine on.\" You walked to Lynda's stall and closed the door. Taking off you shirt you noticed that something had changed again, not only had you gained your mother's lovely chest, but now you had her entire torso, from the waist up and the neck down you looked exactly like Lynda. \"Stop ogling yourself, and try on the blouse.\" Lynda said while she primp herself next to you. You put on the blouse as if you had done it many times, after all blouses were your Lynda's favorite tops, you could show off a lot of cleavage if you wanted. The blouse was your favorite color, a nice slightly shiny blue, well your Lynda's favorite anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I love this top, but something it missing.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, wait here a second I'll be right back!\" Lynda said as she rushed out the door.</span></div></div>",

Although you knew that something was wrong with you, you couldn't help but feel good as you gazed at your new hands. \"What are you looking at?\" Lynda came into the room with two of the same skirts hung over her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm not exactly sure, it's just great to be becoming so similar to you I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would say so, I haven't had this much fun in years.\" Lynda tossed one of the skirts at you and she began to get out of her jeans. You looked down at your own pants, why did you have these dirty old pants on, they were so ugly and becoming very tight. You felt some pain around your hips as you quickly stood and began to pull off the pants that could only barely contain your growing assets. As you removed your pants you saw your hips widen very quickly and could feel your butt expand. You knew you had Lynda's big bubble butt and wide hips now, you remembered earlier in the day you said you wanted to have her big butt and smiled. You had gained this big lovely butt much faster than you thought you could have possibly gained it. Looking down at your legs and feet you could see that they too were changing slowly morphing into Lynda's. You decided that you wanted to put on the skirt Lynda had got. You step out into the skirt and pull it up, you grabbed the cute belt Lynda had gotten as well and finished putting on the skirt. As you latched the belt the changes in your lower half finished. Now except for you head and crotch you were completely Lynda. You tried to put your shoes back on and notice they were much too large. \"Well that appears to be a problem, let me go get you some pantyhose and shoes to go with that blouse and skirt.\" Lynda left without you even confirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at your reflection, while you waited, so much had changed. Were you really ok with becoming so much like Lynda? A large part of you wanted to stop this, and go back to being the normal Nate, but a growing part of you wanted to finish the change. Lynda was hot and soon you would be too right? Well either way you would need some shoes that fit. You heard the door open and Lynda walked in with two pairs of pantyhose and two shoe boxes. \"Hey won't it be great, soon we will be dressed just like each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" You say with much more excitement than you thought you would, as you rolled the hose up your amazing legs. Lynda opened one of the boxes, inside you saw a pair of high heels, they had to be at least 4 inches tall. Did you even know how to walk in those, you wondered? Casting aside your worries you opened your box and put the heels on and stood up slowly. It took you a moment but you gained your balance and it began to feel like you had worn heels all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's pay for these, we have one more stop before we should head home to get dinner started.\" Lynda said as she grabbed up all the boxes. As you left you threw out your old clothes.</span></div></div>",

When she finish at the register you approach her tentatively. \"Oh there you are, come on lets go into the stall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Still slightly unsure if this was the right thing to do you walked into the changing room after Lynda.

You... needed... to... stop... this. The headache flared into an inferno of pain as you fell to your knees. \"Are you ok, Nate! What's wrong!\" Lynda knelled down beside you and held you as you felt the pain increase further. Who were you? You were Nate, right, or... no... you were... The pain flared again as if pushing you to make up your mind. You couldn't be Nate anymore, afterall you were so much like Lynda now. So... you... must... be......... Lynda. When you came to that realization you felt the pain disappear immediately, bringing with it a wonderful calm. You felt the changes begin again, as you penis and balls crept inwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Lynda I'm fine now.\" You stood up and pulled your boxers out from behind your skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Lynda said slightly unsure of herself. You felt your new vagina begin to form as you slid the lacy panties up your legs, once in place you felt the changes stop. You knew you now had a vagina, and not just anyone, this was Lynda's and now your vagina. \"Well if your sure your ok, we better get back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's probably a good idea, and don't worry about me I'm fine.\"</span></div></div>",

Hearing the sound of heels walking down the hard wood stairs, she was shocked to she her 15 year old son walking down wearing her favorite louboutin's shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate being 15 was average size for his age.  He had yet to go through his growth spert, was similar size with his mother, and at this time they had the same size feet.  Even before the candies had found there way to Nate, he would often wear Lynda's running shoes when he needed to find a pair of shoes in a hurry.  This often bothered Lynda because her running shoes would go missing or even muddy from the dirt that Nate would find.  So seeing her son walking down in her high heels was shocking to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate what in the world are you doing walking in my high heels!\" Lynda said.<br>\r\n\"Come on mom, you know that I hate to leave the house in flat shoes.\" Nate replyed.

You don't wear high heels.  Now your going to take off those shoes and put your sneakers on.  One way or another, we are not leaving until someones feet are wearing those shoes!\"  Lynda said pointing to Nate's Addidas sneakers that was one the floor mat next to the door.<br>\r\nNate took a candy out of his pocket, and poped it in his mouth. \"Well I don't want to take off your shoes, and I wish that you would rather wear my shoes.\"  Nate said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, Lynda stepped back and was really unsteady on her 4\" heels.  Looking for something to grab, she found the banister of the stairs to steady herself and wondered outloud what she was doing wearing high heels.  Kicking them off, she walked over to the door in her bare feet and stepped into Nate's sneakers. She was now 6\" shorter than her son who was touring over her in the 4\" heels that were on his feet.

Nate had the manerisms of his mother, so walking in heels seemed to come natural to him.  Lynda was still herself in every way but one.  She now believed that she only wore shoes of a 15 year old teenage boy.  It was strange seeing her walk alongside her son.  She still wore the skirt and blouse combination that she had on earlier, but now she had a pair of worn sneakers on her feet.  Not the look she would ever be caught dead in.  Nate on the other hand was wearing a pair of worn jeans with a few holes in them, a t-shirt and Yankee ball cap.  The length of his jeans meant that you wouldn't see the entire view of his mothers shoes that he now would call his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's step was shortened and he would walk with in a more feminine manner.  His narrow hips swinging as much as they could.  He walked in a straight line, placing each step in front of the other.  Excatly as Lynda would have...if she was wearing heels.  Lynda for that manner was walking with a longer stide, or as long as her skirt would  allow.  She no longer walked with grace and while she only had her sons choice of footwear, she began to walk more like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda and Nate walked into what use to be her favorite shoe store.  She was going to buy a pair of shoes for Nate.  A few short hours ago her intention was to buy Nate a new pair of sneakers, but now she would buy him a pair of shoes that she was going to buy for herself that went with a beautiful red dress that she just bought.  Lynda walked over to the display wall and picked up the Silver leather pumps, and went to find a sales associate.  Meanwhile Nate was looking at other shoes in the ladies section, he was getting a few stares from people who would notice his bight pink heel that would reveal itself when he walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assoicate returned with the box of silver pumps and handed them over to Lynda expecting her to sit down and try them on.  In the eyes of the salesperson, Lynda needed the shoes so she could get rid of the sneakers.  Lynda however walked over to her son, and handed each shoe to Nate so that he could try them on.  Nate stood up in the silver pumps and walked around the store.  Lynda asked him to roll up his jeans so that she could have a better look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was wondering if I could try on some others.\"  Nate replied.  He was holding another shoe in his hands and was motioning to Kim that he wanted to try on another shoe.  The shoe in his hand was a gold, strappy platform shoe that was 5\" high.  Nate couldn't wait to try it on, and was hoping to convince Lynda that it wasn't too expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim walked out with the box and looked for Nate.

Then he spied the candies in his jeans pocket. He thought at least I could suck on one because I feel so upset. Then in true Lynda fashion he started to cry. Meanwhile, Lynda keeping an eye on the road continued her barrage on him. \"Now when you get home young man you march upstairs and change out of those clothes.\" \"I will not have my son traisping aound like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate silently said,\" I wish you and I did dress alike and you knew it.

Not suitable for a 15 year old boy!  What other boy in your grade wears clothing like his mother.\"  Lynda was getting increasingly mad.  Everytime she looked over at Nate, she couldn't believe what he was wearing.  \"I never thought in a million years that I would be wearing the same clothes as my son.\"  She said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe two continued argueing as the drove home.

Nate in his 5\" heels and Lynda in her son's former shoes.  She opened the door and set her bag down besides Nate's bag from the same store.  In the kitchen they continue to argue with Lynda eventually playing the parent trump card and forcing Nate to go to his room and change.  \"Nate\" she said.  Get your bag from the store and change out of that rediculous outfit and back into something normal.\"  Lynda was rubbing her temple while saying this.  She didn't think that the outfit was rediculous, afterall she bought the same one.  But after seeing it on her son, she felt like she needed to change as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate grabbed a bag and Lynda grabbed the other and both went to their rooms to change out of their twins clothing.  Nate took the clothes out of his bag and spread them on the bed.  He grabbed Lyndas bag by mistake.  The bag contained Lyndas Skirt, blouse, bra and panties (a new white lace set from the store). Looking at the clothes and thinking that this was normal to him, he proceeded to put them on.  He walked down the stairs and found the shoes that Lynda originally was going to wear before the wish switched her preferance in footwear.  Slipping them on his feet, Nate walked over to a chair and found an entertainment magazine and started to read.</span></div></div>",

She walked over and picked up the tin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell maybe I will have some fresh breathe at least she thought as she popped one in her mouth. The mint had a strange tingle to it. It also was a flavor she did not recognize. The freshness caused her to relax. God she thought. What am I going to do about Nate? I wish I was brave enough to wear his clothes and show him how silly I would look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that there was a blinding light and time slowed down. Then Lynda saw Nate's clothes and she had a strange desire to put them on. She quickly rid herself of her shorts and halter. She went sans bra and panties. She put on Nate's tidy whites then his jeans. Then came his shirt and the yankees ball cap. Lynda walked over to the full length mirror and adjusted her cap like Nate wore it, to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda headed down the stairs. That was just the moment when Nate walked to the bottom stair and saw Lynda. \"Mom what are you doing in those hideous clothes he said. You have such a great sense of style why are you wearing ...... that? Lynda who realized what Nate was wearing which was her outfit she wore to the mall.

When Lynda reached the bottom the two looked each other over.  Lynda looking up to her son.  With the 4\" pumps he wore, he was no a few inches taller than his mother. She looked at Nate in the face and then began to look at his clothes beginning at the top and working down to his shoes.  Recongizing the outfit as the same one she wore earlier, she even spotted bra straps through the blouse he wore.  She wasn't sure what to do, and couldn't understand why on earth he would want to dress like that.  Like a woman, she thought.  She was begninning to hatch a plan hoping to knock some sense into him and get him to behave like a normal teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Nate, since you look so good in my clothes, why don't we just switch.  From now on I'll only wear your clothes, and only the clothes that you would wear.  Meaning you get to pick for me each morning.  That means you can only wear my clothes, and I get to pick your outfit each day.  Underwear, jewlery, accessories, everything that I would normally wear.\"  She said, not really sure if this was a good idea, but she really didn't know how else toget throught to him.  When she was a little girl and was caught smoking, she was forced to smoke the entire pack in one sitting.  That stopped her from smoking ever again, so maybe if she forced Nate to wear her most girly clothes, and go all out with the feminity. Maybe, just maybe he'll realize that he was meant to wear his normal clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda walked around Nate, explaining the proposal and thinking to herself that Nate's clothes were really comfortable and she loved wearing his boxers.  They felt so loose and free she thought.  Nate stood at the base of the stairs listening to his mom and her proposal thinking that this wasn't much of a challenge since wearing her clothes felt so natural and he woudl rather wear them anyway.  Lynda took off her wedding rings and gave it to Nate.  \"Here you go son, these go with the outfit.  From now on you'll only wear what I would wear.  Deal.\"  She said extending her hand in order for Nate to shake on it.  Nate finished putting on his mothers wedding rings and shoke her hand.  \"Deal\" he said.</span></div></div>",

He was looking all around the family room and because of the clothes he wore, especially the skirt, he mobility was limited.  On the plus side, the 4\" pumps he had on meant that he saw the room in a whole new persepctive.  Standing in the middle of the room he unkowingly struck a pose.  Hip to one side with his left hand firmly placed on it.  The wedding ring sparkling from the sun beaming in through the window.  Of course the pose was more way of taking the pressure of one of his feet in order to give it a rest from the heels he was wearing.  Looking around the room, Nate heard the doorbell ring, and walked over to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis aunt Bethany had come to visit his mom, and when Nate opened the door, Beathany gave Nate a kiss on his check as if she was greeting her sister.  Not letting Nate get a word in she walked in the house and commented on his short.  Ofcourse Nate had always had short hair, but to Bethany it was different seeing her sister in short hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Bethany's voice, Lynda quickly came down the stairs and greated her sister, which imediatley caused some confussion.  \"If this is her sister, than who's this\" she thought.  \"Nate is that you\"  she said to him.  \"Hi aunt Bethany\"  he said in un upbeat voice.  \"I love the outfit your wearing, are those shoes new!\"  commenting on her footwear, which was a first for Nate.  This caused greater confussion for Bethany, because not only was Nate dressing like her sister, he was kinda acting like her as well.  \"Lynda! what's going on.  Why are you two dressed like each other.  I don't understand.\"  She asked her sister.  Bethany looked at the pair as they stood beside each other and both seemed really content on what they had on and moved like it's always been this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go and sit in the kitchen Beth, I'll tell you about my day.\"  Lynda said to her sister, as she grabed her arm at the elbow and began to lead her to the room.  \"Nate, I think you might have to go and change, remember that you have basketball practice in an hour.  I've laid out outfit on your bed to change into as well as a bag containing some gym clothes.\"  Lynda said to her son.</span></div></div>",

Then we went to the mall and I swear, he bought the same outfit for himself that I bought for me!

He brought the heels up to Lynda's closet and put them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped in front of the full length mirror in his parents bedroom. He started to primp just like Lynda would. He adjusted his skirt,and did a few ladt like poses. He decided his face needed some color and proceeded to put on just a hint of base and some of Lynda's lipstick. For some reason he thought he should look nice for Mike. As he was doing this he couldn't help getting the idea out of his head how silly his mom looked. Who in their right mind would want to dress so disgusting he thought. I swear tha woman, Nate said aloud. It muct be a phase she is going through. Nate sounded very much like his mom.

We need to talk\". Erin left her shirt and shorts on the floor but held onto her bra and little panties. \"Ill see if he wants to wear these.

It was pretty unusual to see a 15 year old boy wearing 4\" inch silver pumps.  He walked around in a very confident manner and stood in a femine pose looking at his feet in a mirror.  The salesperson was still stunned that the shoes she thought were for this beautiful women were instead for this teenaged boy.  Lynda showed no emotions over the shoes and was really disinterested in any of the shoes in the womens section and instead was checking out some of the casula shoes in the man's section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror showed that nate really did need a pedicure and Nate thought that his tow nails needed some colour.  He also thought that the shoes would look better if he was wearing someting other than torn jeans he had on.  Looking over at his mom he wondered if she would let him wear her skirt.  Knowing her response when she first saw him in her shoes.  He thought better than to just ask.  He didn't know how to ask and grabbed a candie from his pocket.  \"I wish mom would just suggest that they should swap her skirt for his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda was looking at a pair of loafers.  She had one of her sneakers off and was sizing up the loafer with her bare feet.  She took a step back to steady herself as she seemed to be seeing stars after the wish was granted.  She put her shoe back on and walked over to Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know son, those shoes look great on you but it's hard to tell in those jeans.  Why don't you put on my skirt so you can really tell.  I would rather wear your jeans anyway, I really don't know why Im wearing a skirt, because I never wear them any way.\"  Lynda said as she started to look uncomfortable at the thought of people seeing her in a skirt.  She asked the clerk if there was a change room near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Nate walked out wearing his mother's navy blue skirt and her boycut panties, as Lynda didn't think much of wearing panties under her jeans and would rather wear some cotton briefs.  Lynda follwed in Nates jeans and his underware.  she felt natural and still wore her bra and blouse and all her jewellery.  But below the waist she looked like a teenaged boy.  On the other hand Nate was the opposite.  he really needed to shave his legs, gut loved the fact that he was starting to wear the close that he felt he needed to in order to be more like his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe went back to the cashier to pay for Nates pumps, and walked out of the store.  On the way through the mall the pair received many stares and lots of people snickering.  Many thought that this must have been a dare, or maybe that Lynda was teaching her son a leason.  They past a sports store and Lynda wanted to go in to get a pair of basketball shoes.  Nate followed in his 4\" pumps clicking on the tile.</span></div></div>",

The clerk at the sports store thought that she must have been asking for her son who was standing behind a bunch of boxes and the clerk could only see him from the waist up.  He looked very tall, but  the clerk couldn't tell that he was wearing womens 4\" heels and a skirt for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk returned with the shoes and motioned to Nate to come and try the shoes on.  Before Nate sould move, Lynda had taken the shoes out of his hand and proceed to try the shoes on.  Nate would follow and sit down beside his mom and cross his legs.  This caused the clerk to do a double take.  The pair looked like they were switched at the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate watched his mom walk around, he despertly wanted to wear her top and bra.  Obviously he didn't need a bra, but in his mind in order to be more like his mom he needed to wear everything that she did and that included the bra.  Nate was going to make a wish so that Lynda would offer the rest of her clothes versus Nate having to convince her.  He just had one problem.

Once it was decided that Lynda was going to take the shoes, the pair got up and when Lynda grabbed the box of shoes, Nate grabbed her purse and swung it on his shoulder.  It was a overly large yellow purse that contained everything Lynda needed and as Nate once said, 'It also contained everything she didn't need'.  they walked up to the counter and Nate proceed to grab Lynda's wallet out of the purse to pay for the shoes.  The clerk behind the counter didn't know what to think.  The card said Lynda and this person was definatley not Lynda.  Nate signed the credit card slip with his own signature and it deffinatley didn't match the back of the credit card.  Feeling uncomfortable, the clerk just wanted the mother and son to leave.  He didn't know what to make of them and the whole situation seemed wierd to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda grabbed her shoes and was really happy to find the sneakers fit her feet.  Her jeans  were loose and she continued to hoist them up over her waist.  Nate kept commenting that she should get a new pair.  A pair that fit properly.  Lynda wouldn't have it.  She told him that this was the way everyone was wearing them, and the she didn't need any more clothes anyway.  Nate continued to nag at her over her sloppy jeans.  Mentioning that she had such lovely hair, and that it was a shame to have such nice hair and look like a slob below the waist.  She was getting annoyed and after popping a candy from her pocket.  She stated to her son. \"If you like my hair so much, I wish that we would swap hair so that you would get off my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, they continued walking.  Nate walking with long, flowing brown locks.  His mom had a brushcut that her son use to have.  From behind it, they almost loocked normal.  Except for the top and the jewellery that Lynda still wore.  Lynda still knew who she was and despite the nagging from Nate, she enjoyed the time she was spending with her son.  She didn't know that an earlier wish has caused Nate to believe that he was becoming more and more like his mother. </span></div></div>",

The mints had only changed her prefrences not full on personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate meanwhile was continuing to become more and more like his mother from the way he carried her purse to how he ran his hand through his/Lynda's hair. Just as Lynda looked down at her watch and realized the time.(Mike was coming home at 5:00) She had a roast in the oen and she needed to get home. Just as these thoughts came entered her headof  Nate said this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go Lynda we need to get home so I can finish that roast before dad gets home.\" With that he turned on his heels and clicked out of the mall and to the car. Lynda at this point was stunned. He knew exactly what I was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought I don't know how he walks in those shoes they must kill his feet. . Nate said,\"Hurry up dear my feet are beginning to pinch.\" This made Lynda glad she didn't have to wear those spiked boots as Nate used to call them. Then Lynda pulled the candies out of her pocket and put one in her mouth.\" If he wants to cook then I wish he performs all of my household duties.\" Boom with that Nate pulled the keys from Lyndas purse and unlocked the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate got into the drivers seat while Lynda got in the passengers seat.

Something that Lynda would have done.  Realizing that he still had the box containing the silver pumps on the kitchen table  he thought he should take them upstairs to his room in order to get them out of the way and besides he hated leaving stuff lying around.  He carried the shoe box with one hand and in the other he had the slingback shoes he wore earlier.  He walked past his parents room and into his own room.  Even though his persona was turning more into Lynda he still new wear he slept his name and the fact that he was still male was very clear his mind.  He opened his closet and was shocked to see all of his former clothes were inside.  Not know why his \"mom's\" clothes were in his closet and walked over to Lynda's room to see what was in her's.  Just as he thought. All of his shoes, skirts, pants and jeans were in Lynda's closet.  Thinking that it must have been Erin who pulled this prank, he called out to his mom to help him sort out this mess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with Nate's hair and choice of clothing from the waist down, Lynda also had Nate's ambition and lack of energy to do anything that required effort.  So when she heard Nate, and casually walked up to her room, she really had no intention of helping him.  nate meanwhile had all of his clothes that he no longer considered his on Lynda's bed.  He carefull y went through Lynda's closet and picked every pair of jeans, pants, short and skirts that Lynda would have worn and claimed them as his own.  He also went through her dresser and took her panties, nylons slips and bikini bottoms and carefully found places for his clothes in his dresser.  The dresses stayed put, Lynda had no intention of wearing them because they were dresses, but Nate didn't want them either because he still wore his t-shirts and tops of a 15 year old boy.  Nate was now busy with the shoes and since Lynda had alot of shoes this could take awhile.  It didn't helpt that Nate thought he should try most of them on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Nate had his room full of his mothers things.  Lynda had a closet full of Nates things and just like Nate, she tossed everything in a closed the door.  Nate was happy and so was Lynda for that matter.  She made her way back downstairs to watch TV and Nate settled a desicion of what to wear while cooking.  He couldn't descide between a jean skirt or some short khaki shorts.  In the end he choose the shorts.  That however didn't leave much for the imagination since he still was very male were it counted.  He also thought he should wear the silver pumps, in order to break them and get use to walking in them.  He carefully walked down the stairs and before entering the kitchen he say his sister Erin at the store checking on the potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around expecting to see her mother walk in as the framiliar sound of the high heeled shoes grew stronger.  What she saw was her older brother wearing very femine shorts, 4\" silver pumps and his hair in a pony tale.  Erin would take the next several minutes to compose herself from laughing so much.  She caused such a stire that Lynda came into the room to see what was so funny.  Of course this just made Erin laugh even more.  Lynda had no idea why her apperance was so funny.  Nate was beginning to get mad.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin had calmed down, but was still snickering and making comments to her borther about how nice his legs looked, etc.  She knew what and why this had happened.  She couldn't believe to what extent her mom and brother had changed and that they seemed oblivious to the changes.    She decided to sit back and observe  and see what else besides the the obvious change of clothes and hair.  She was watching Nate at the stove moving about his mom's 4\" pumps, looking like he knew what he was doing when her Dad came home and walked through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven through Nate was wearing most of his mom's clothes, He and Lynda didn't really share the same figure and they were close to being the same height, with Lynda being a little taller.  The differences in bodies was enough to stop Mike from approaching what he thought was his wife from behind while Nate stood at the stove.  Mike wrapped his arms around Nates waist and leaned around his pony tail to give a kiss on the neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Dad\" Nate responded in an almost happy to see you tone of voice.  This caused Mike to jump back imediatley when he realised that his son was standing wearing Lynda's clothes and his hair was identical to Lynda's as well.  \"Nate\"  He said in a stern voice. \"What the hell are you doing!  Why on earth are you wearing your Mother's clothes.  If I were you I would get your ass upstairs this instant and change out of those before your mother catches you.\"  Mike was angry.  Not sure if he was more angry at the thought of his son becoming a cross dresser or the fact that he kissed him on the neck and Nate seemed to like it.  Just as Mike finished his speach towards Nate, L:ynda entered the room to see what all the commotion was about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike turned around \"Hi honey\" he said, turning away from Lynda.  \"  LYNDA!  what the hell are you two doing.  Your wearing Nates clothes and what on earth did you do to your hair!\"  He said.  Mike was very confused and couldn't understand why his wife of 17 years would let their son play dress up in her clothes and whats worse is that see to be enjoying wearing his.  \"Mike, honey!  You know Ive always worn clothes like this.  I wouldn't be caught dead wearing a skirt, and besides Nate has alwyas worn skirts and heels.\"  Lynda said like this was a well known fact.  Nate stood behind lynda.  With the heels he was taller than her and supportered her statement by holding onto her shoulders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sat down and watched as Erin entered the room.  Erin knew full well why this was going on and wanted to tell her Dad, but thought that this could be alot of full to play along for awhile.  Mike was dumbfounded, he saw a small bottle of candies on the table.  This was left by Lynda who took it out of her pocket and left them on the table.  A very Nate like trait.  Mike grabbed the bottle, popping open the lid he tossed one in his mouth and  was going to respond to Lynda's earlier comment.  \"You know, you two look rediculous.  I wish Erin and I could wear each other clothes in order for you to see how rediculous  you both look.  Erin was trying to stop him from compliting that statement, but it was to late, the wish had taken hold.</span></div></div>",

Yeah thats what I was thinking I want to ask dad if we could switch clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mike was gettin madder and madder at......... Lynda.....No............. Oh that he wanted to wear his daughters clothes. He was mad because Erin had such great clothes and he wanted to wear them. Almost at the exact same time they both shouted out...\"CAN I WEAR YOUR CLOTHES!!!!!!!\" The two mad a mad dash to their rooms upstairs and Lynda and Nate were left stairing at each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had to lower his head and turn it into Lynda's eyes as the two looked like and old brady bunch episode. Except in this case Florence Henderson was Peter and Peter was the mom. Nate then broke the stare and said, Come on and help me set the table Lynda. The two went about setting the table and 5 minutes later Mike and Erin came downstiairs. Mike had on a pair of blue hello kitty panties a draining bra that squuezed his chest. On this was a Jonas Brothers T-shirt. a pair of leggings and a denim skirt over the leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin cam down in the buisness attire Mike had on. She was wearing a white undershirt on a pair of boxer briefs. A polo shirt and slacks. She was wearing slippers on her feet. Nate looked up and started to giggle. \"Oh Mike come on whats the gag he said. \"What gag?' I am getting comfortable for dinner thats all? At that moment Erin decided to eat one of the candies and save herself and maybe help Nate a little....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the table and popped a candy in her mouth......

These mints grant wishes to suspecting and unsuspecting people. The situation now is Nate the Teenage son is becoming more and more like his mom. Mental changes between him and mom have been going on allday. Lynda now finds herself dressed from the bottom up in her teenage sons clothes. Moreover she finds this perfectly normal. Because Lynda and Nate are almost but not perfectly matched bodywise their clothes are interchangable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate meanwhile is a little further alomg the mental road is he is under a wish to be more like his mother. He has her mannerisms and feelings and desires. Currently he has taken over all motherly duties in the house. Erin his younger sister was aware of the mints potential and decided to watch the fun between Nate and Lynda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir father Mike came home from work and was very mad at seeing Nate mincing around dresses as Lynda and Vice Versa. He grabbed a mint and popped one in his mouth and wished Erin and he would switche clothes which they did. Currently they are in each others clothes now the magic had to alter the clothes to fit. Nate is not happy to see his dad dressed as Erin it is silly and funny to see a grown man dress like a girl or woman. Nate thinks it is a complete turn off. (Wow! where did that thought come from)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Nate is serving dinner. He is ladleing food on everyones plate, but making snide comments to his dad about dressing like Erin. \"Come on honey, you look silly in Erin's clothes. Go back and change.\" Mike responded by saying.'I don't see anything wrong with what I have on. You know how much I love the Jonas Brothers I have all their CD's\"  \"Plus this is my favorite skirt.\" Lynda walked by and was in hysterics. \"You two look completly foolish.\" She said as she hiked up Nate's jeans and put out the silver wear like Nate had asked her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Erin decides that it is her turn to get a mint and straighten this whole mess out. She doesn't realize that the clothes she is wearing are her fathers. Because of the previous wish she thinks her father always wore legging and skirts. She pops a mint into her mouth and wishes that everyone was there true selves again. There was the usual pop and then everything was this caused some new developments. Since Nate was under the influence of the first wish to be more like Lynda his true self at the moment was Lynda. This caused him to accelarate into more of Lynda's personality. At this point he not only was menatlly Lynda but he began to change slowly physically into his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lynda could feel the beginning of hair growing on her legs. This she found normal as her bottom half became more her true self...... Nate. The result of her and her dad was they developed a llittle bit of  a mental shift. Mike was saying he like the Jonas Brothers but now he found them attractive for some reason. Erin walked over and picked up the newspaper and started reading the sports page...... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin's wish began to take effect on all of them.   Nate already believing he was his mother, began to change physically.  Already having his mother's hair, his body slowly began to change to become more like Lynda's.  His body hair disappeared and begun to reappear on Lynda's body.   He also began to experience swelling in his hips and chest area while Lynda begun to slim down.  They both also started showing signs of their ages changing, Nate becoming older and Lynda younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Erin sat and read the sports section, her and her father began to change also.   Within a few minutes, Erin began to exhibit a noticeable five o'clock shadow on her cheeks, neck and around her mouth.   At the same time, her shoulder length hair began to disappear, touches of gray started to show in her temples and across her scalp.   Mike was experiencing the opposite effect as he had went to the living room and was watching a teeny bopper show on Disney, suddenly engrossed in the characters.   After 15 minutes, Erin had noticeably aged.  Having wished for everyone to be \"their\" true selves, she now appeared to be in her late 30's,  short brown hair, with a touch of gray here and there, heavy five o'clock shadow covered her cheeks and a mustache and goatee on her lip and chin.  Also noticeable was a thick mat of chest hair in the open area of the polo shirt she had put on.  If she had not been wearing pants everyone would have been able to see that the thick hair extended down her chest across her abdomen and down her legs to her feet.   Mike was now missing all of his body hair that made it obvious he was male.  His face was very young looking as he was now looking like he was 13.   His chest had the beginning buds of breasts that Erin had had only a short time ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin now believed she was her father.  She finished reading the sports section and got up to grab a drink.  Having filled her glass with water, she stepped over to Nate and wrapped her arms around his waist.  \"Hey I'm sorry about acting so strange a moment ago, I don't know what got into me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate turned around and looked down at his sister, as her wish hadn't effected their heights yet.  \"Oh Mike, it's okay.  We all have those moments.\"  Nate leaned down and kissed Erin passionately on the mouth, as a wife would with her husband.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda, walked by and huffed as she watched her children, now rapidly becoming the parents, \"You two need to get a room.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sport, someday you'll find a woman that makes you as happy as your mother makes me,\" Erin replied rubbing the top of Lynda's head.   Erin returned back to hugging Nate.   She felt a warm and swelling sensation in her groin as they hugged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, why don't you go and take off your work clothes before dinner.  It'll be ready when you get back.\"   Nate gave her a quick peck on the lips again as he slid his hand across Erin's groin.   Erin smiled knowingly and headed up to the bedroom to change.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She pulled off the polo shirt she was wearing and undid her pants and stepped out.   She walked into the closet and dropped the clothes into the hamper.   Erin looked over her dad's clothes and grabbed a pair of jeans and a t-shirt.   She threw them on the bed as she took off the undershirt she had on and tossed it in the hamper also.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked quite different now as she walked into the bathroom before she finished dressing.  Only wearing a pair of her father's boxer briefs, the masculine hair traits of Mike were plainly obvious.    She stopped in front of her father's sink and looked at her reflection, noticing nothing out of the ordinary, as she believed she was her father.   She ran a hand over the stubble of her beard debating on whether to do a quick shave or not.   She did not notice that her hands had become larger and more calloused from years of work.   As she looked on, more changes were happening, of which she was not paying attention to.   Her body was continuing to adapt to her wish of everyone returning to their true selves.   Erin had slowly been growing taller and her muscles were growing to give her Mike's physique.   Her arms began to increase in length and size, at the same time her chest and shoulders began to increase and widen.  She felt a slight bind in her upper back and she rolled her shoulders and her bones popped and readjusted to their new width.   Erin's upper body was now looked like Mike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin decided to pass on shaving and stepped over to the toilet.   She reached into the fly of her underwear, as if she had done it for years and pulled a large penis out, pointed it at the toilet and began urinating.   As she stood there, her lower body began to change to match her upper body.   Her legs became longer and thick muscles filled out on her thighs and calves.  Her feet grew several inches.   As she finished up and tucked her dick back in her underwear, her physical changes had finished and she now had Mike's physique.   She stepped back to the sink to wash her hands, not paying attention to the fact that she was now practically her father.   She had his body, muscles, hair and thoughts.    While everything else had changed, the only thing that hadn't was her face.</span></div></div>",

Mike's still had his male clothes on but they weren't right, in a flash they shrunk and he was in danger of popping some buttons and he quickly stepped out of his shoes, because they were several sizes too small.  Looking over at Erin, she had the opposite problem as the clothing she was wearing was several sizes too big.  Erin giggled and mentioned to her father \"I guess your wish worked.\"  Mike was confused with the entire situation and sat down, this caused his pants to split in the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, honey, why don't you go change.  For some reason your clothes just don't fit you.  said Lynda,  she snickered at her husband and then looked at her daughter. \"Erin! you too, go put some clothes that fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and Erin headed up stairs and went into their respective bedroom only to find that their entire wordrobes had been altered.  Nothing of Mike's fitted hi, and Erin's closet and dressers were bulding at the seems as the clothes that they did hold were much larger than before.  Mike and his daughter met in the hallway to discuse the situation.  \"Well Dad, this is what you wished for.  Why don't we just put on each other clothes and show mom and Nate you stupid they actually look.  Why don't you put on my girliest dress and shoes and I'll find one of your suits and well go and show the others.  Erin said with a grin, smilng at the thought of having her dad wearing her fanciest dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin went into her parents room and looked into the closet.  She was surprised to see most of Nates clothes in there already.  Her mother's side of the closet was almost bear except for some dresses hanging &amp; all of her shoes were gone.  Erin used to play dress up in her mothers closet all the time, she thought it was funny that she was now going to play dress up in her father closet and what was worse is that this time all the close in the closet were meant to fit her.</span></div></div>",

He knew how wrong this was and the thought of wearing his daughters panties made him shutter.  He knew that the underwear he had on was not going to work and he wasn't about to go commando in Erin's dress.  He found a nice pair of panties and slipped them on.  We also found a bra.  Thinking that depending on what dress he choose he may or may not need a bra.  Looking through Erin's closet he was amazed at how many clothes she owned and they all fit his body like a glove.  He tried on a poka dot strapless dress, but thought it might be too revealing.  He also tried on a flowery summer dress that Erin wore for easter this past year.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of Mike's head he knew how wrong this was.  Every dress he tried on he pictured his daughter wearing it at some family function. While we was in her closet he also tried on some of Erins other clothes.  He was beginning to have some fun with this and was starting to believe that if the clothes fit, maybe they were actually his.  He was momentarily confussed as to why they were in Erins room.  Mike eventually settled on empire waste cocktail dress.  It was pink satin above the waist and black velvet below the pink bow.  He put on White stockings and found a pair of white sandles with a modest 2\" heel.  Remembering what Erin looked like when she wore the dress.  Mike looked for a black head band and put it on his head.  From head to toe Mike was no wearing the very dress that Erin wore to Lynda's sisters wedding last month.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike left Erin's room and found here waiting in the hall.  SHe was wearing a 2 piece suit complete with neck tie, dress socks and shoes.  All of which fitted her perfectly.  In fact this was the very suit that Mike wore to the wedding.  This fact was not lost on Erin when she saw Mike walk out of her room.  she giggled and the composed herself as she was having the same thoughts as Mike.  Maybe she was wearing the correct clothes afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking down the stairs,  Erin escorting her father down the stairs.  Lynda and Nate began to laugh and gave Mike and Erin a round of applause.  Lynda looked over at Nate, and suggested that since they were wearing the wedding clothes, maybe they should go change as well.  Nate responded by telling Lynda that was fine, but he wasn't going to wear a dress.  Their switch didn't include the upper body.  Lynda confinced him that since his Dad could wear a dress that maybe he could as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate was in his room and removed the shorts he was wearing and then his t-shirt.  Standing in only a pair of Lynda's boycut panties.  He was trying to remember what his mom was wearing at auntie Bethany's wedding.  Since this was her second wedding she didn't have any bridesmaid other than her daughter.  Nate was relieved that he didn't have to wear a bridesmaid dress.  Nate grabbed his robe and walked over to Lyndas room to get the dress since it was still in his mom's closet.  Nate had everything else needed, except for a bra, which he wasn't sure if he was going to need it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda had her jeans off and was standing in Nates underwear and her top when Nate knocked on the door.  Lynda never bothered trying to cover up her bottom half.  She may have reached for a robe before but with all the changes she has gone throught, she couldnt be bothered with a robe.  She walked over to the closet and grabbed a bag that was hanging up and handed it to Nate.  Nate was unzipping it when Lynda also tossed him a black strapless bra and couple of Breast forms that give Lynda a little more clevage when she needed it.  \"You may want these as well\"  she said as Nate examined the silcon breast enhancers.  She also gave him a picture of herslef from that day so Nate would be able to do his hair in the same manner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate looked at the dress and was amazed at how sexy it looked.  It was a black strapless cocktail dress that was very clean cut in appearnce.  Below the high waist line the skirt flared out and appeared to be very ridgid.  The part of Nate that was becoming his mother was very excited to wear it.  The part of Nate that still made him believe that he was male and only wore male clothes above the waist, still wasn't sure if he was ready for this.  But since everyone was going along with this game, then he might as well do it too.  Nate took the dress and bra back to his room and laid it on his bed before he went to the bathroom in order to have a shower.  His legs needed a shave  and he was cleaning earlier and didn't want to ruin his mother dress with any dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nate was in the shower, Lynda went into his room in order to get his dress shirt.  She had everything else in her closet.  5 minutes later she was down stairs in Nates suit.  She wasn't wearing any makeup and took off all of her jewellery.  She did this only to becasue of game they were playing.  She sat down beside Mike and was really impressed on how he was handling the situation.  Everytime he was going to sit down he would smooth out the skirt so it didn't wrinkle.  Mike put his arm around Lynda and they were taking about the day they just had.  Mike was forgetting the wierd situation he was in, as well as the clothes he was wearing.   Meanwhile Erin was getting impatient with Nate and went to the staircase to tell Nate to hurry up.  This caused her parents to let out a laugh.  Erin was wearing the suit well, this was the most clothes she has worn in along time.  While she was turning 14 years old in a month, she has been dressing like she is 16 for  half a year.  She was developing into a woman and was fortunate to have Lyndas genes flow through her.  If she was upset at having all of her clothes no longer fit her she was hiding it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes Nate joined the rest of his family.  He no longer looked like a teenage boy, and more like his mother.  Although he experienced no physical changes.  Everything he was wearing was his mother's.  He was even wearing her wedding ring that he found laying on the nightstand of his parents room.  He also descided to wear Lynda's perfume and his hair was spot on the picture he was given. On his feet was Lynda's 4\" black satin pumps.  He walked in the room and held his breath waiting for his family to raze him.  Instead he got some many compliments on how beautiful he looked.  Since the original wish he felt like he should be more like his mom, and now he was actually dressed like her.</span></div></div>",

She was thinking that Nate could really use some lipstick and it would help if his eyes were more dramatic.  She was thinking to herself as to how she was going to convince Nate to let her do this to him.  She herself grabbed Nates sportscoat which was a little big on her narrow shoulders but she put in on without thinking about the size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin held the door open for the others.  Mike was getting used to wearing Erins heels.  Unlike Nate who believed that he is suppose to be wearing Lyndas shoes, Mike was only wearing Erin's shoes because none of his clothes no longer fit his body.  All of Erins clothes were now meant to fit his body.  The dress he was wearing was pretty and he was happy that it wasn't strapless like Nate's.  He watched as Nate kept lifting the top of his dress up so that it covered his bra and breast enhancors.  Mike walked over to the car and joined the others who were staring at the car.  Nobody really knew what seat to take.  Lynda and Mike usually took the front and the kids in the back.  Erin was holding the keys in one hand while her other was in her pocket.  She  spun the keys in a circle with her finger that was placed inside the metal circle that held all the keys together.  Nate was standing with his feet together and both hands clutching his purse that was above his waist.  He felt like he should sit in the front but yet it still didn't seem right and wondered to imself that if he did was he going to get into trouble.  Lynda menawhile was making a motion to sit in the back seat and called Nate to join her.  This way maybe she could work on Nate's face, and make him as pretty as she was at Brianne's wedding.  That left Erin and Mike to decidef who was going to drive.  Erin had the keys, but she knew that she had no driving skills and regardless of how much she felt like she was in chagre, she knew her limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin tossed the keys to Mike, who got in the drivers seat and drove away to the resteraunt.  Driving in heels was new for Mike, but he was adjusting very well.  The sun was beginning to set and the Four Season was going to take 20 minutes to get there.  This gave Lynda plenty of time to work on Nate's face.  At first he was taken aback, not wanting anything to do with her makeup, but soon enough Lynda had convinced him that he was wearing a dress and heels and his hair looked so beautiful that a little makeup would just be the finishing touch.  Up front Mike had found Erin favorite radio station and was sining along to a Kerry Perry song.  Singin very badly!  Erin quickly tried to get him to stop.  She wasn't sure if she was embaressed by her Dad or just annoyed at him.  Erin was really please that she was able to convince her Dad to go through with this switch.  He looked really pretty in her dress.  The hair on his arms, gotee and his short graying hair on his head din't help though.  She reached in her pocket and grabbed a candy and thought that if they were going to have to wear each other clothes that maybe they should look a little more like each other.  She quietly said to heself that she wished she would swap all the hair on her body with her Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second Mike had long brown hair that was parted at the top and pulled back tight  to frame his face.  No longer did her sport a goatee or any facial jair for that matter.  All of that was transfered over to his daughter.  His arms wear clear of any hair and were his legs.  Erin scrathced at her new facial hair.  Since Mike didn't have a chance to save after work, Erin had his 5 o'clock shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rounded the corner and drove up to the hotel.  Waiting for them was a group of valet attendents.  The first was a hispanic man in twenties who quickly went to open the door,  Hoping for a big tip from the driver of a very expensive Lexus sedan.  His head bowed as the family exited the car.  A large pair of feet wearing black womens sandled heels, A couple of smaller feet wearing mens dress shoes and then a great looking pair of women black pumps.  It seemed odd, but not as odd as what he saw when he raised his head and saw the family for the first Time.  Saying a few words in spanish that the family didn't know they just smiled and began to make there way to the resteraunt.  The parking attendant turned to his callegues and laughed, not believing what he just witnessed.</span></div></div>",

Erin couldn\u2019t believe what she had heard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow dare he treat me and my family that way?  He acted as if we were freaks, she thought to herself.  She stood there fuming for a moment, then remember the mints.  She took one out and popped it in her mouth.<br>\r\nShe could have wished for a table, but instead she said, \u201cI wish everyone would stop acting like we\u2019re weird and see us as the family we are.\u201d   Unfortunately because the Wilsons were each wearing another family members clothes, her wish worked in more than ways than one.   Everyone immediately saw Erin and Nate as the husband and wife and Lynda and Mike as their son and daughter, but so did the Wilsons\u2019.   Erin and Nate now saw each other as their spouse and their parents were their children and Mike and Lynda were just opposite of their kids.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s just shitty business to treat your customers that way,\u201d she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate reached over and gently rubbed her shoulder.  \u201cNow dear, you need to let it go.

The royal deal was a full 5 course meal.   \u201cYou know what, I think we will.  I mean why not we\u2019re all dressed to the nines anyway; nothing but the best for my beautiful family and my little princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate also now aware of the budget leaned over and whispered in Erin\u2019s ear, \u201cBaby, you sure that\u2019s okay?

Tuck your shirt in Lynda, when will you get a haircut etc etc. What was strikingly ironic was the dynamic between the two. Nate being so critical of himself in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family made their way into the restaurant which was modeled like an old castle. They even walked across an old moat. The hostess was pleased to meet the family and treated them accordingly. Welcome sir may I ask how many she said to Erin.

Nate was very delicate as to not mess up Mike's hair. There sweetie you look beautiful Nate said. The family was led to a splendid wooden carved table with thick chairs that seemed to come out of an ancient movie about King Arthur. Nate sat and crossed his legs in a womanly manner and said. I hope they have some seafood. I am dying for some lobster. Lynda upon hearing that said oh mom that is horriblr, how can you stand to eat that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird part was how the two had swapped taste as well as other features.

Although she was thinking and believing that she was Mike, there was still a little part of her that had remembered she was Erin.  Possibly her having the mints and having made the last couple of wishes were causing it, but regardless of why, she was feeling some mixed emotions.  A large part of her, her Mike persona was highly aroused by his wife\u2019s breasts.  But then that little part of her was questioning her sexual feelings when she looked at her brother who was thinking he was Lynda.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to a urinal and unzipped, but when she reached in as Mike would do, she found nothing.  \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d   She quickly went in a stall and closed the door.  Undoing her pants she pulled them down and was puzzled when she saw she no longer had a penis as she thought she should.  She pulled her pants back up and leaned back against the wall.

Nate now was not only acting and dressed like Lynda, he was sporting her whole body as well.  The top of his dress was now filled out with his newly acquired breasts and feminine curves made it fit perfectly and he did not think anything about the fact that he no longer had a penis.  Likewise, Lynda now had a body that matched her clothing.  Her son's flat chest and and penis were now hers.  Both of them seemed unaware of their changes and due to their similar heights none seemed the wiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that really stood out was the fact that even with the changes Erin had wished for her family, she and her father were still not quite fully changed.  She  now looked like a man, having wished earlier for her father's body hair and only moments before for his penis.  That last wish had done more than just given her male anatomy, it had also changed her body to be fully male.  She now had her father's muscles along with his physical attributes, the only drawback was that it had taken place on her 4'11\" frame.     Mike on the other hand had lost all the physical characteristics that made him male.  His 6'2\" frame now was definitively female in appearance.  A prepubescent vagina and budding breasts now belonged to him and all of his muscular build had changed to that of a 13 year old girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the physical changes had now made the parents children and the children parents, they still their own faces, though no one around them or even each other noticed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter the waiter returned and took their orders, the newly formed family sat and talked about their day as if everything was as it should be.   Nate recounted the trip to the mall earlier today and about buying some new shoes and such, but never thought to mention anything about the changes that had occurred that morning, because honestly he had forgotten about that whole situation due to the ongoing wishes.   Erin complained about work and some of Mike's co-workers, much like the real Mike tended to do.  Mike and Lynda also talked about things that happened to the kids from earlier that day as if they had themselves had experienced it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing their meals, of which Erin had a large steak with several sides, Nate, a lite chicken dish, Lynda, a hefty cheeseburger and fries and Mike, chicken bites and fries, Erin took out her father's wallet and paid with his credit card, signing the receipt with the perfect signature of her dad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head home,\" Erin said with her own voice, which sounded really odd coming from such a masculine looking, albeit, small body.   As they walked out, Erin put her hand on the same of Nate's back, just as Mike would have with his wife.   MIke and Lynda started to bicker on who was going to sit where in the car, just as their kids would have done <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not the choice she would normally make, but in line with the tastes of her new life as Mike.  As she drove along she realized what changes had occurred, a result of her making the last several wishes herself.  She remembered she was only 13, but she felt so much older now and debated as to what she should do, change back or continue on. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The two people in the back had only a short time ago been her parents, she realized that much, but the mental changes that had came with her wishes also caused her to realize that she was now the father of four kids and the sibling sitting next to her in the front seat was now 'his' wife.   Erin though about it a little longer and decided she wasn't in a hurry to change anything back.  She realized no one seemed to recognize that they had all changed.   She may have been only 13 but she now had the mental experience and life history of her 37 year old father and on top of this she found herself thinking like her father.  She looked at Nate, but only could see him as Lynda, the same with Mike and Lynda.  She saw them as Erin and Nate. It was also interesting that even though they each had the body of the other, their faces were the same.  What was interesting to her was that no one else in the car seemed to have this same awareness.   Also she came to the realization that she may think like her father, but she wasn't fully him....yet.   She was still too short and her voice was wrong.  She took out a mint and quietly put it in her mouth and whispered, \"I wish that I had the correct built and voice for my body and all my clothes and the clothes of my family were in the correct places along with the correct voices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin blinked as the wish kicked in and as she had wished, she found herself growing, her clothes expanding to match her larger body.   Within moments she now had a 6'2\" frame and she glanced in the rearview mirror and saw that Mike was now much shorter.   She looked at herself in the mirror and decided she would leave everything as it was now and see how it worked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate looked over at her and smiled.  \"Mike, I was wondering if we might go to the beach tomorrow,\" he asked now with Lynda's beautiful voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pondered it over and decided that like good idea.  It would be interesting to see how the rest of the world would react.  \"Sure, I think we could work that out,\" she answered with surety in her father's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Erin pulled into her 'sister-in-law's' driveway.  Well this could be interesting she thought as she watched Nate get out and walk to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Beth leaned in and gave Nate a hug and began addressing him as Lynda.  She didn't realize anything was wrong Erin thought.   Nate looked back and motioned for Erin to come.   \"Wait here, I'll be right back,\" she said to Mike and Lynda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin got out and walked to the door.  It felt odd to her being so much taller and stronger now.  As she reached the stoop she said, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked at her and smiled, \"Hi, Mike, nothing's wrong, but the kids are asleep, you'll have to help Lynda carry them out to the van.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she answered stepping into her aunt house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you guys are really dressed nice,\" Beth commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike took us out to eat tonight,\" Nate replied leaning over and giving Erin a big hug and a kiss on the cheek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was sweet of you Mike,\" Beth said to Erin, not indicating she had a clue that things were not normal believing that her niece and nephew were her sister and brother-in-law. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin walked over to the couch were her younger siblings were sleeping.  Looking down at them and had a strange feeling, though she had not fathered them she felt that she had participated in conceiving life for the two kids laying on couch.  She looked over at Nate and found it strange that her former brother was now the mother of her former siblings and of their parents in the car who had taken over their old lives.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin picked up Trevor and started out to the van while Nate picked up Nicole.  Trevor stirred slightly and looked at her, \"What are we going Daddy?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin felt a mental twitch as her new personna processed his question.  \"We're going home, buddy,\" she replied feeling the mental knowledge of Mike affecting her answer.   Nate followed Erin as they headed out to the van.   Erin buckled Trevor into his seatbelt as Nate put Nicole in her booster seat and buckled her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for letting the kids come over and play today with your kids, Beth,\" Nate said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no problem, sis.  They can come over anytime,\" Beth answered giving Nate a big hug.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Nate got back in and waved goodbye as Erin backed out and continued home.   That was very surreal, she thought, my own aunt didn't realize anything was different.  She actually believed that I was Mike and Nate was Lynda.  Interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Mike and Lynda went into the house, she and Nate took their 'youngest' kids out of the van and carried them into their rooms.   After they had put them in their pjs', Erin wandered down the hall to the master bedroom.   She realized now Trevor and Nicole were the only ones in the family that weren't changed.  Since she was alone she took out a mint and wished for Trevor and Nicole to switch places like the rest of them had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt that same sensation as the wish took place and  went to see whether it had happened or not.   Nate met her at the door, \"Where you going dear,\" he asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere really, I'll be right back,\" she said.   She quickly went to their rooms and looked in.  Sure enough, in Nicole's room Trevor's face now was on his little sister's body and a quick glance confirmed that Nicole was now Trevor.   Satisfied she returned to the bedroom, noticing the lights on under the doors of her and Nate's former rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the bedroom she closed and locked the door.  Erin found Nate in the bathroom getting ready for bed taking off his makeup, as Lynda would normally do.  He had already taken off his dress and was only wearing panties and a bra.   Erin found it strange to see Nate with Lynda's body, but at the same time, she was also aroused.   Erin undressed herself, hanging up her suit jacket and pants, noticing that all the clothes in the closet were now correct again for their new roles.  She walked to the bathroom wearing only her underwear, just as Mike would.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in and went over the to toilet to pee.  She thought nothing about it as she took out her penis and urinated.  Finished she stepped over to 'his' side of the sink and washed up.   Nate looked over and stepped beside him.  \"I want to thank you again for taking us out, although I am a little put out that I worked all day making us dinner,\" he said play pouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that, but I hated to waste our being dressed up,\" Erin said as again Mike's personality came into play and she leaned down and kissed Nate on the mouth with the passion that he normally gave his wife.   \"Don't worry though.  Your leftovers are as delicious the next day as they were the first day, Lynda,\" Erin answered.  Nate reached around Erin's muscular frame and hugged him.  Erin could feel the soft breasts pressing against him.  Erin slid her hand up Nate's side and gently caressed her breast.  Nate laid her head against Erin's chest feeling safe in his arms and not rejecting her husband's caressing.   As Erin continued he felt a warmth in his groin as he became aroused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's personality continued to affect Erin's actions and she didn't fight it.  Lifting Nate's face, Erin kissed her again passionately before he led her to the bed.   </span></div></div>",

The mental knowledge of being Erin is clashing with the mental knowledge of being Mike.  She knows as Erin, what is going on, but she also knows what is going to happen as Mike and her new hormones and his mental knowledge are proving to be the stronger of the two.   She can't stop herself any longer as Mike's desires overpower her own and she decides to go with the feelings.   Seeing herself as Mike again, he pours himself fully into the lovemaking.   Nate, much earlier having lost contact with his own persona, already fully believes that he is Lynda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former brother and sister go with their physical attraction for each other as now wife and husband and consummate their relationship.   They spend a hour exploring each others bodies with all the passion that was normally present in the former parents relationship.  Erin, feeling like Mike, skillfully making love to his wife, Lynda. Successfully using his penis to bring her to orgasm.  Reaching his own satisfaction with his own ejaculation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time of cuddling, they go finish getting ready for bed.   After cleaning up and as they brush their teeth, Erin gains some control of herself again.   She recognizes that what she did was not right on several levels, but her believing she was Mike also helped her to cope with it.   She hadn't made love to her brother, HE had made love to his wife.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished they retired to bed and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling recalling yesterday's events.  She glanced over at the person lying next to her; remembering that Nate was no longer her brother, but wife.  She also remembered that her parents were now her children.  Mike was now her and Lynda was Nate.  And lastly that she had wished for Trevor and Nicole to also switch places.    She wondered how things were going to play out today as Nate began to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate stretched and yawned then brushed the hair from her face.   \"Morning sweetie,\" she said as she nestled up against Erin resting her head on his chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning to you too,\" Erin replied as she began stroking Nate's arm.   She felt that need to be Mike again, must as she had several times last night.  She had never lost track of who she really was, but at times she found herself thinking and believing she really was her father.   As she thought about that she realized it was becoming easier to fall into the role of Mike as she recognized she wasn't losing herself.   She decided then that she was just going to let herself be Mike and play the role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin excused himself and got up, kissing Nate on the cheek, and walked into the bathroom to take care of morning bladder needs.   Nate came in just as he finished, she walked over and caressed his chest.  \"God I love you Mike.  I'm so glad we worked out our marriage problems.  I don't think I could handle being alone with four kids much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin remembered that just a few weeks ago, Lynda and Mike had worked out their problems and she had welcomed him back home.  Now she was going to have to keep working on making the marriage work.  Now having Mike's memories, she knew why they had problems.   He had cheated on Lynda.   Erin found she knew all the details and the counseling that had taken place.  \"Lynda, I'm so sorry about that.  I promise to never stray again. I realize what I had and now have.  It's not worth it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It better not be or I'll will shoot you next time,\" Nate said sternly. \"Or worse I'll cut this off,\" she continued grabbing his manhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's reason enough right there,\" Erin said seriously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate raised up on her toes and kissed her husband on the lips. \"Thats why I need to remind you,\" as she continued to fondle him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin felt his dick getting hard again.  Clearing her throat she said, \"Yes, well it's a point well taken.  I, uh, definitely don't want to make you mad anymore.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate giggled, \"Good.  Would you like to join me in the shower.\"   Erin nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they showered Erin was still astonished at just how fully Nate had become Lynda.   His mannerisms, speech, thinking and body were completely hers and Erin's new male body was aroused by the beauty of her breasts, hips and ass, not to mention the sight of that lovely vagina.  This kind of freaked Erin out, but he found himself checking out his own appearance.  Erin hadn't really paid that much attention last night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nate rinsed her hair, Erin looked himself over.  His hands were now large and strong, attached to muscular and hairy arms.  He ran his fingers over the thick hair that was on his chest and legs.  Lastly he gazed down at his penis.   It looked quite large and he realized, with Mike's gained knowledge that he was above average.  He grasped the shaft and felt of it before moving his hand down to the scrotum.  It was rather odd feeling testicles that 'rolled' around as he moved his fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had finished and looked down at what her husband was doing.   Raising one eyebrow, something that Nate had never been able to do, but Lynda could, said, \"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking out things,\" Erin replied sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Can I help?\" Nate said and without waiting for an invitation reached over with her slender hand and began doing the same motions that Erin had been, but Nate's actions had more meaning.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin watched as Nate began to stroke his cock.  It was done with a loving touch and a wanton desire.   Erin was captivated as his wife went one step further and knelt down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Erin watched Nate as he dried his newly acquired body.   Her wishes had fully given him the body of their 36 year old mother, a body that was in pretty good shape considering she had given birth to four children. She realized that they were now her and Nate's children.   She had fathered four kids and Nate was now the mother of the same.    She felt an odd satisfaction with this new knowledge.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped over to the sink and got ready to shave, she wondered something.  If I'm now the father and Nate is now the mother, since our faces haven't changed, what did that do to our 'kids'.   Knowing that normally the children take after their parents in features.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to realize that it might not be a problem.   As she lathered up with shave cream she noticed her facial features looked different.   Looking closer it became apparent that with her wish of having her father's appearance had included more than just the body.   While her face was still similar, there was something different.  Her old face had always been oval shaped with a cute pointy chin, but now her chin was wide and squared.  She studied it closer and saw that not only her chin but her cheek bones and jaw looked different.   Her face was looking more like Mike's.  Wow, these wishes are more powerful than I thought, she pondered.  She glanced over at Nate.   He had always taken after Mike in his facial appearance, but she saw that he too was looking different.  Nate's face had more of a Lynda look, aside from the manicured eyebrows and hair.   His cheeks and jaw were more delicate looking, decidedly feminine.   He was becoming more like Lynda just as she was with Mike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped her tongue over her teeth as she thought and realized her braces were gone.   Quickly smiling she saw with her eyes that what she had felt was true.  Her braces, even her teeth were gone, replaced by her father's.  She opened her mouth and saw fillings in her teeth that she had never had and other clues to verify what she was seeing.  Incredible, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in disbelief and started shaving, amazed that she knew how.   Equally amazing was watching Nate going through all the normal behaviors of Lynda, blow drying his hair and putting on her makeup.  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was also kind of weird seeing her father's body in the reflection of the mirror.   She shrugged her shoulders slightly then went to the bedroom to get dressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on a pair of briefs and picked out a shirt and jeans.   Once she finished dressing, she watched as Nate came into the room.   He had put on Lynda's makeup and styled his new hair into an exact replication of hers.  Man he is really beginning to look like Lynda, she thought.  She watched as Nate dropped his towel and took out a pair of panties and a matching bra.  She was amazed at how easily Nate put them on, as if he had been doing it for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate turned and smiled at Erin.  A smile that a wife who loves her husband would give.  Erin watched as Nate went into her parents' closet to find some clothes.   Still not used to the male hormones in her new body, she felt her penis getting hard once again as she gazed at Nate's breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get the kids up while you finish getting dressed,\" Erin said to Nate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dear.

Both quickly left and passed each other as they went to the proper washroom that people saw them for the gender for which they were dressed as.  Mike walked into the Ladies room.  The first thing he noticed was the mirror and his image.  At the house he didn'ttake anytime to look in a mirror and admire how he looked, and this would be the first time saw Erins hair on his head and for the first time since he was 16 there was no facial hair.  He spent some time at the mirror looking at this face and playing with his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda was in the men's room andwalked up to the urnial and undid her zipper.  She quickly relized how much she was drifting into the mental state of nate.  She didn't have the equipment to use a urnial.  Zipping up her fly she looked for an empty stall so that she could finish her business.  This shock of reality caused her to snap out of Nate and think more clearly as Lynda.  She flushed and walked over to the sink and washed her hair and then began to primp her hair.  Since it was Nate's she didn't have much to work with, but still primped and caused a few looks from the other men who thought that this kid must be on the femine side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both left at the same time, and met outside.  Walking back to the table, Lynda and Mike talked about how weird everything is getting.  Both were feeling somewhat like themselves, well other than the clothes and hair they wore.  When they got back to the table they were shocked at how much their kids were behaving like the parents.  Both were sipping on a glass of wine and were holding each other hand on the table.  In front of Mike's and Lynda's place was a coke for Lynda and a glass of Chocolate Milk for Mike. Lynda leaned over to Mike and wispered in his ear. \"when was the last time you had chocolate milk.\"  \"I know\" replyed Mike.  \"We better keep an eye on how much our \"parents\" are drinking tonight.\"  said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was beginning to feel the effect of the wine.  Even though she dressed like her dad, smelled like her dad, and looked kinda like her dad, she couldn't drink like her dad.  She was beginning to slure her words somewhat.  Nate was better than his sister.  What helped him was the fact that Lynda never drank much, so he stopped after 1 glass of wine, and even though he was a little light headed he new that by the time they were ready to leave he would be fine.  The wine did help Nate imerse imself more into the roll of Lynda.  He was making small talk his his 'kids'.  Both Lynda and Mike repsonded as if they were roll playing, but since the incident  at the washroom both were feeling very much like themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheque arrived and Erin reached for her wallet.  Signing the credit card slip with Mike's signature, much to Mike's surprise.  The group got up and left.  Watching Erin and Nate carry on.  Mike and Lynda were not sure if they were roll playing or actually believed that they were their parents.  Lynda even saw Nate give Erin a kiss on the check and then proceeded to wipe of the lipstick that Nate left on Erin's cheek.  And since everyone around them seemed to be treating Erin and Nate as if they were the parents and treated Mike and herself as if they were te kids, Lynda knew that this could cause a problem.  \"What are we going to do Mike.  Erin thinks that she's you and Nate believes that he's me.\"  Lynda whispered to Mike.  \"There's no way Erin is going to be able to drive home, even if she was sober, I wouldn't trust her to drive us home safefuly.  Lynda thought that maybe they should take a cab, even thought she or Mike could drive.  No one was going to believe that she anything but a 15 year old boy and that Mike was a 14 year old boy.  they could get into alot of trouble if they tried to drive home.  Lynda was going to suggest taking a cab.  \"Maybe we shold take a cab.  You and 'Dad' have been drinking afterall.\"  Saying this to Nate and feeling really wierd at calling her daughter 'Dad'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth agreed and a cab was called.  Lynda and Mike talked at how they're just going to have to get through this evening and then try to see how they can work this situation out in the morning.</span></div></div>",

He didn't realize until he opened his eyes but he was in Erins room and in her bed.  This would be the reason why his back was sore.  He swept the hair away from his face.  He had more hair than he ever imagined he would.  Whiel sitting on the side of his be he streched and looked in the mirror on the dresser across the room.  He was wearing Erin PJ's that consisted of pair of flannel pants that were blue with pink bunnies all over them and a tight navy blue tank with the word princess written accross the chest.  Hi hair was a mess from slepping and Mike took the scrunchy that was holding his hair back out of hair and then with both hands he pulled his back and reapplied the scruntchy so his hair was kept in place.  He found Erin's slippers and went down stairs to grab some ceral and more importantly he needed to talk to his wife about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike found the ceral and pored himself a bowl.  It was captain cruch with was Erin's favorite.  He walked with the bowl over to the living room and sat on the couch and with his legs underneeth his body.  He was flipping through the channels when Lynda entered the room wearing a pair of Nate sweat pants on.  She was rubbing her eyes with one hand and the other hand was inside her sweats scratching her bum.  Mike casually said good morning without really looking at her.  Then through the side of his eye he noticed that Lynda was only wearing Nates sweats and nothing else.  Just as Nate would have slept with bottoms only, Lynda had done the same thing.  Walking around without a top seemed natural to her.  \"Geez Lynda, don't you think that you should put on a top on.\"  Mike said.  Lynda just nodded in response.  She wasn't really awake and when she woke this morning she wasn't entirely sure why Mike wanted to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda ran back upstairs to grab on of Nates t-shirts, and returned to the kitchend where Mike was sitting at the table and looking through the saturday paper.  He was looking for an ad for the fair that was starting today.  He showed Lynda the ad and began to tell her plan that included the hypnotist that highlited in the paper.  He told her that they would have to convince Nate and Erin to participate in the show and get the hypnotist to help them convince their kids that they are not the people that they think they are.  Maybe Nate would stop dressing as Lynda, and Erin and himself could go to the mall and get some clothes that fit them and that are made for the right gender.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She idly scratched at her various hairy body parts.  Her wish that her and father should look more like each other had also affected her personality some.  She watched as Nate went about getting dressed and saw that he was putting on clothes that matched his personality for his lower half, but not his upper.  That was kind of dumb she thought if Mike and I have to dress so completely then so should Nate and Lynda.   Since yesterday all the wishes had really messed up the entire family.  Nate was really thinking he was Lynda, wearing most of her clothes and he had her hair.  Lynda was in and out of thinking she was Nate, wearing his clothes and had his hair style.  Erin and Mike were wearing each others clothes and she had all of her dad\u2019s hair and he had hers. And the last wish that had been made was that everyone would see them as the person they were dressing as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got up she looked down at the nightstand and saw the mints.  She took one out and popped it in her mouth.  She walked into the bathroom glanced over at the mirror and looked at her reflection.  She still had her old body but she now had thick dark hair covering her chest, arms and legs.  Mike\u2019s goatee adorned her face along with heavy five o\u2019clock shadow on her upper lip and cheeks. And lastly she noticed her short buzz cut.  She felt she looked older with the speckling of gray hair that randomly appeared on her head, beard and chest.    She sat down on the toilet to take care of her full bladder and without thinking about it she randomly thought \u2018I wish this could be easier. Maybe if we not only dressed like each other but our bodies and behaviors matched our clothes.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their bodies began to change as their physical appearances quickly changed to match their clothing and with this physical change those who hadn\u2019t thought of themselves as the person they were dressed as suddenly began to act and feel like that person. The only problem was that everyone still had their old faces, just now they were on a new body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut at the garage Lynda suddenly felt a pinch in her shorts.  She reached down and readjusted her new package that she had just acquired.  She didn\u2019t realize that her breasts had disappeared and she now had a flat boy\u2019s chest. She sighed in disgust at the thought of having to waste her morning mowing the lawn.  In the living room Mike sat watching TV on one of the teen channels.  He never noticed that the bulge in the front of his shorts had disappeared or that small budding breasts appeared on his chest.  He did find that several of the boys on the show he was watching were really cute and he decided to text some of Erin's friends to discuss it.   Both of the parents also suddenly appeared noticeably younger as wrinkles and frown lines disappeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack upstairs, Nate, due to his earlier wishes was already believing he was Lynda, sat at her makeup desk having felt the need to get made up.  He felt joy as womanly breasts filled out on his bare chest and his hips widened. As his mother\u2019s vagina appeared in his crotch Nate found himself really happy as he had got his (Lynda\u2019s) womanly body back.  He frowned slightly as he noticed some new wrinkles around his eyes and mouth and those gray roots showing in his crown were going need attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, Erin, now starting to think like her father, felt relieved as she watched her (father\u2018s) large penis and testicles reappear between her legs.  No longer needing to sit she stood up and peed like a man should.   Finishing she stepped over and washed up.  Looking at her reflection again she felt better about everything.  Now she felt she had the body she was supposed to and with her last wish she now found herself thinking as the head of the family and as such she was glad she had her penis back.   When her stomach started growling again, Erin quickly jumped in the shower and cleaned up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing she was standing at the sink getting ready to shave when Nate walked in; now fully dressed in one of Lynda\u2019s sun dresses with his new cleavage prominently exposed.    \u201cWow, you look really beautiful this morning, honey.  You got some big plans?\u201d Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate took out Lynda\u2019s toothbrush and prepared to brush his teeth.  \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, I was thinking of going to the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin replied as she rinsed her razor, \u201cI think that would be fine.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both finished with their respective tasks Nate said, \u201cHoney I really would appreciate if you would put on underwear after your shower.  Its not that I don\u2019t enjoy seeing IT, but not while I\u2019m brushing my teeth.    Erin walked out to the bedroom to get dressed.   Having put on Mike\u2019s Saturday work clothes, Nate walked over and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s much better Mike, now if you\u2019re ready, lets go down to the kitchen and I\u2019ll fix you something to eat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin went over and grabbed the mints and put them in her pocket for safe keeping and headed to the kitchen.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While the food cooked Nate fixed a cup of coffee for Erin; straight black just like Mike would drink it.    Erin sipped on her coffee and looked through the paper as she waited stopping on the sports section.  She found interest in the box scores of several of the games and teams.   \u201cSo honey what are your plans when you go to the mall today?\u201d Erin asked as a concerned husband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wanted to look at a new dress and maybe some shoes for myself, but I also need to take Erin to try and find her some new clothes she seems to be growing out of them faster than we can keep up,\u201d Nate replied.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shook her head thinking like her father, that girl is starting to get into my pocketbook.   Suddenly an idea came to her.  If \u2018Erin\u2019 would slow down on her growth then they wouldn\u2019t have to buy new clothes so often.  She took out a mint and put it in her mouth and thinking like Mike she said quietly to herself, \u201cI wish Erin would stay at 4\u201911\u201d for awhile.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all the other wishes made Mike was still at his original height as was Erin and Mike\u2019s wish the day before had resulted in changes in he and his daughter\u2019s clothes not them physically.  Where Nate and Lynda had been similar in height and build, this was not the same with Mike and Erin.  Mike was 6\u20192\u201d and near 220 while Erin was only 4\u201911\u201d and thin, not yet fully into puberty. But with Erin\u2019s wish earlier about being more like the person they were dressed as and her newest wish that was about to change.  Since Erin was thinking like Mike and Mike like her the wish caused Erin to suddenly grow a foot and a couple of inches while Mike shrunk by the same.  Their clothes quickly changed with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in less than 24 hours, the entire family had changed almost completely, both physically and mentally. The only evidence that anything was wrong was the fact that everyone still had their original faces.  Nate for all intents had become Lynda. He had his mother\u2019s body, anatomy, behaviors and mental thoughts. His wishes yesterday along with the wishes made since had affected him the most.    Lynda now had her son\u2019s body and anatomy and was really beginning to think and act as him, losing touch with her old persona every hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Mike had been behind in the changing but now they had caught up.   Erin was now 6\u20192\u201d.  Her wish in the bathroom had provided her with male anatomy and her final wish had fully given her the body to match.  As the morning progressed she felt more and more like she was Mike.  Although, and it may have been due to her making the last several wishes, she somehow knew everything was changed but she did not want to fix it, not yet anyway.   Lastly Mike had become his daughter.  His body and anatomy were hers and he, like his wife, was losing touch of who he had been.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the waiter returned to take their orders, the Wilson\u2019s tastes and appetites changed to match their changing personas.    Everyone had looked over the menu and began to place their orders.   Erin, continuing to think like her father, chose to have a 12 oz KC Strip steak with all the works, a meal she would never have ate before, more over at one sitting.  She also ordered a dark ale lager.    Nate had made up his mind earlier that he was ordering his (Lynda\u2019s) favorite, lobster tail and he ordered a white wine with it.  Lynda thinking as a teenager just wanted a burger, fries and a soda and Mike went with the chicken strips and fries meal that had caught his eye a few minutes before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waiter took their order to the kitchen, the family had small talk.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry you spent all day fixing us a lovely dinner and then I decided to take us all out,\u201d Erin said to Nate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate looked over to Erin, \u201cIt really only made since we were already dressed up.  My meal will still be there tomorrow,\u201d he said disappointment in his voice as he thought of the meal \u2018he\u2019 had spent all day working on.    \u201cDo you have any breath mints?\u201d he asked Erin.<br>\r\n\u201cBaby, I\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d Erin said feeling bad about ruining the dinner \u2018his wife\u2019 had prepared as she pulled out the tin and gave one to him.   She then leaned over and kissed Nate passionately on the lips as a husband would his wife.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda, watching the interaction of Erin and Nate, rolled her eyes and guffawed at their behavior.  \u201cGet a room,\u201d she mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very nice to say,\u201d Mike commented having seen it all.  \u201cI think its sweet Mom and Dad feel comfortable with public displays of affection,\u201d he continued believing he was the daughter of Nate and Erin.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter returned with their drinks and some bread.   Lynda quickly grabbed a piece and started eating.   Nate decided he needed to freshen up before eating and excused himself from the table as he popped the mint in his mouth and headed to the bathroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the minutes passed they both began to feel more comfortable with the clothes they were wearing and as such begun to feel the desire to have more changes to match.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike watched Nate parade around and show off his look, he started to feel envious of Nate\u2019s look.  Mike wanted to look as beautiful as his son.   \u201cWow, Nate you look so beautiful, I\u2019m soooo jealous of your hair and you look so much better in that dress than I do in mine.  My hair is a mess,\u201d Mike said sounding girlish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiled, \u201cWell thank you for the lovely comments.  I do feel very pretty, but don\u2019t worry your hair will grow out soon enough and if it wasn\u2019t for my breast forms I wouldn\u2019t have near as much shape.  If I wasn\u2019t using them I would let you borrow them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was listening to their conversation and felt a similar desire as Mike mentioned Nate\u2019s hair.  She had looked at her mom and brother, each with the others hair and had thought that really helped them with their look.  Her and Mike should have the same thing.  She was thinking about using a mint to change their hair as Nate had commented about the breast forms and not having as much shape as he would like. She glanced at Nate and Lynda and saw he was right.  Lynda was wearing Nate\u2019s suit but her ample breasts and hips were obvious underneath while Nate did not come close to filling out the dress as it was designed to be. Erin then took out one and popped it in her mouth and made a wish that she could exchange hair with her dad and Nate could have Lynda\u2019s breasts and figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as Erin\u2019s next wish took place.  Almost instantly Mike\u2019 hair began to grow, slowly at first then more rapidly and as it grew the traces of gray disappeared.   At the same time, Erin\u2019s hair began to recede, quickly becoming a short masculine style with specklings of gray in it.  But because Erin hadn\u2019t specified what hair she wanted to change with her dad she continued to gain all of his body hair.  Within moments Erin and Mike\u2019s changes were complete.  Now he looked completely different; his skin was devoid of noticeable masculine hair.  His face was smooth as were his legs, torso and arms.  Erin\u2019s long brown hair now cascaded down his back.   Erin on the other hand looked much manlier.  Her face was covered with dark stubble.  She now had a full mustache and goatee.  If she hadn\u2019t been wearing the suit everyone would have noticed that that her whole body was covered with the dark body hair that had only moments ago belonged to her father.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second part of her wish had also taken place.  Lynda\u2019s chest had lost it\u2019s fullness as her breasts had disappeared only to reappear on Nate, filling out the top of his strapless dress.   Standing there Nate had plainly visible cleavage pushing up out of the top and his hips widened slightly giving him a womanly hourglass figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone definitely looked different.  Nate felt even more like Lynda as he now had her upper body and curves and with the earlier changes now looked very much like a woman.  Lynda having lost her curves and gained a boyish figure looked a lot like Nate as she wore his suit.  Mike looked somewhat more normal now that he had long girlish hair and no longer had chest and facial hair to clash with his daughter\u2019s formal dress. Erin, with her short buzz cut and facial hair and father\u2019s suit looked manly except that she and Mike were still opposites in height.   The only other thing that no one had noticed or thought as be odd was the fact that they all still had their own genitalia.  This was most noticeable on Mike since his fully developed groin was quite obvious under his dress. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come with me.\u201d    Nate grabbed his father\u2019s hand and let him to the master bedroom.   Once there, Nate removed his breast forms and then helped slide them inside the small \u201cA\u201d cup bra that Mike was wearing.  He stepped back, tilted his head to survey what he had done.  Thinking as his mother he nodded positively and said, \u201cYou look much better sweetie.  It\u2019s not too much for your age.  Now let\u2019s put a little makeup on you and straighten up your hair.   Mike smiled proudly as he stood sideways looking at his reflection, his chest having some feminine shape then joined Nate at the makeup vanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the \u2018ladies\u2019 had gone to check their looks, Erin and Lynda stood around waiting; both of them feeling irritated at standing around.   They were both starting to think as themselves as male.   Erin looked at her mother and said, \u201cYou know we ought to put all of this fanciness to use. I mean we\u2019re all dressed up.  We really should go out and you know, do something really nice. How\u2019s that sound to you, Lynda?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda feeling noncommittal replied \u201cWhatever you think we should do.  I just live here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long minutes the others came back in and joined Erin and Lynda.   \u201cWell well, look at you, are you striking,\u201d Erin said as she noticed her father.   Nate had helped him get fixed up with makeup and hair and if he wasn\u2019t 6\u20192 with a large penile bulge in the front of his dress he might have actually looked like a girl.  Mike grinned with pride at the compliment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo now are we ready to eat?  I have dinner almost ready,\u201d Nate stated motherly like.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling guilty Erin sighed and stepped over to him and began to rub her hand up and down his back, \u201cListen I know you worked hard to fix us dinner tonight, but what if we were to all go out.   I mean we\u2019re all dressed so nice.  How often do we all go out, really?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was crestfallen.  In his mind he, as Lynda, had worked all day to fix dinner for the family and now there was a suggestion to forgo all of this hard work.   Erin could see he was disappointed.  \u201cListen honey, I\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise,\u201d she said beginning to feel as Mike would toward his wife.  She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek and gave him a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll owe me big mister,\u201d Nate said softly next to her ear.  \u201cNow let me go put everything in some containers first.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stepped back, placed his hand on his hip and thought that although the room was looking better, it still smelled like a teenage boy.  Actually it smelled like...him.  He remembered seeing some air freshener in the laundry room, and since he had a load of clothes that badly needed washing he decided to walk down to the laundry room.  Nate was halfway to the room when he met his mom Lynda.  His arms were full and she couldn't see his feet, but he could hear the sound of his footwear.  Since Nate seldomly wore shoes in the house, she thought that it was very odd.  As he passed he, she purposly looked down at his feet and startled when she saw her shoes on her sons feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate, why are you wearing my shoes.\"  She asked.  Nate turned around and looked down at his feet.  \" Mom\" He said.  \"You have such great in clothes and shoes, and I saw these shoes and wandered what they felt like.  I hope you don't mind.  I'm almost finished cleaning my room, and then I'll take them off.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda, really thought that this was weird.  Afterall what 15 year old boy gets caught wearing his mom's shoes.  \"Atleast there not a pair of pumps\" She said to herself, and since he is actually cleaning his room and I'm not pestering him to do so.  \"He can wear my clothes, if that what it takes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate heard this as he dumped his laundry in the room.  Admiring the shoes that he wore, he went back upstairs to finish his room.  Again he passed this parents room and quickly poked hid head inside and saw an outfit his mom wore yesterday.  On the chair was a pair of tan coloured capris that zipped up on the back, a teal scoped neck shirt with some frilly fringe on the bottom.  Beneth them was a matching white bra and pantie set.  Nate loved the outfit, and it seemed strange to him, but he thought that the clothes matched the shoes and since he was wearing the shoes and his mom said that he could wear her clothes.  Well...He put on the outfit, found a set of pearls that Lynda had on yesterday and went back to cleaning his room.  Once he finished his room he continued on cleaning the rest of the bedroom on the floor, just as his mother would have.  Even though he was mentally becoming his mother.</span></div></div>",

He felt comfortable wearing his mothers clothes and really liked how they fit his body.  Even though the bra he was wearing did nothing for him.  He was in the bathroom cleaning the toliet when Lynda poked her head in to see for herself what her nose told her as she was walking up the stairs.  The smell of disenfectant was strong and if she didn't see it for her own eyes she would have never imagined one of her kids cleaning a bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening in here\" as she was about to enter the room.  Her voice sounded very happy, and no matter what it looked like insidef she was going to be estatic that finally after all these years she was had someone in her family that was helping with the cleaaning.  She opened the door and was starteled at the site in front of her.  Bent down on his knees was Nate, scrubbing the toilet.  From behind Lynda could tell that the pants Nate had on were her capris and she even saw her white panties.  \"Nate\" she said,  you didn't actually take me serious, when I said that you could wear my clothes, if that's what it took to get you to clean your room.  Did you\"  Nate turned around and looked up at his mother and just laughed it off.  His laugh was some what perculiar as it sounds alot like how Lynda laughs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just saw them on your chair and felt like I should try them on.  You don't mind, do you Lynda\"  Calling his mother by her first name was a first for the 15 year old.  This took Lynda by surprise, and before she said another word had taken a candy out of her pocket, and popped it in her mouth.  \"Nate\" she said in a stern voice.  Get off your knees and march into your room and take off my clothes and put something else on. We have to go to the mall and your not going like that.  I don't understand what has got into that child.  I wish I had his personality so I could find out why hes acting so strang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puff of smoke and a glazed look fell over Lynda.  She stood there for a few moments, not knowing what had happened.  She look at her son and then looked in the mirror and wandered why she was wearing a black skirt, black wedge mules and a tight white t-shirt.  \"Lynda\" Nate said, \"when did you want to leave for the mall?\". \"After I change\" Lynda said as she made her way into her room.  She looked in her closet and was confused as why she had all these dresses and skirts and shoes.  Girl clothes she thought to herself.  Noticing a pile of her sons clothes on the floor she walked over and picked up the pile thinking that this is the kind of clothing a women like her should be wearing.  She took out her earing and took off her rings, leaving them on the dreaser.  Walking out into the hall way she saw Nate, who still had on the capris and the shoes althought the shirt was removed leaving just the bra.  \"Lynda\" he said, \"I know that you told me to go and change, but I really can't go outside dresed in those clothes\"  He said as he was about to point to the clothes on his bed when he realize what his mother had on.  You wouldn't mind if I took a few minutes and went into your closet, and picked out something decsent\". \"Sure Nate, I'll be downstairs waiting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate went into his mother's room and began to look in the closet.  All the clothes look great, and since his tastes had turned into Lyndas, he felt like everything in the closet was his. He noticed a skirt and white t-shirt that was thrown and laying scattered in the room as the clothes that his mom had just taken off.  Including the bra and panties that Lynda had just taken off.  Nate decided that the skirt and shirt were right for the mall and in a few moments he walked downstairs in the very clothes that Lynda had just taken off.  With the exception of the shoes.  He was now wearing a pair of Lynda's 3\" black wedge peep toe leather pumps.  He had a sheer scarf wrapped around his neck and a few banggles on his wrist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor better or worse he was ready for the mall.  He grabbed his mothers purse.  She had found his wallet on top of the fridge and the two headed towards the door as Erin was getting home with a swithed up pair at the door.</span></div></div>",

Not sure why but he saw his mom do it before, so it seemed natural.  Lynda in the mean time was slumped in the passenger set and playing with Nate's cell phone.  She really didn't know the other people she was texting with, so she just carried on the text messages the best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was doing relatively well for his first time driving.  Even more so when you take into account that he was doing it while wearing 3\" heels.  They drove out of the neighborhood and was sitting at a red light, waiting to turn left.  Nate seemed to have the situation under control.  He pulled out into the intersection and was startled by the sound of sirens and the flashing lights of the police car that appeared in his rearview mirror.  \"Oh dear\" he said.  \"I think were getting pulled over\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police office tapped the window and Nate rolled down his window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"can I see your license and registration, Maam!\"  The male office said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate reached for Lyndas purse and began to shuffle through her wallet looking for her license.

She went to his dresser and opened a couple of drawers and hurriedly grabbed a pair of socks, and underwear.    She peeked out in the hall and seeing no one, ran to her room.  She felt giddy as she closed the door and quickly undressed.   In moments she was fully dressed in all of his clothes.  She walked over to the mirror and looked at her reflection.  Not too bad she thought, but the makeup and hair threw it off.  On another whim she quickly pulled her hair back into as tight of a bun that she could then she went and washed off her makeup.   She chuckled to herself as she pictured how ridiculous she looked and what Nate was going to say.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the tin of mints and went to find him.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hearing drawers open and close from her daughter\u2019s room she started that way.   It definitely felt strange wearing boys\u2019 underwear and no bra under the shirt she had on.  She peeked around the corner and was surprised to see Nate, wearing her clothes.   He had his back to her and she stared at him with disbelief.  When she looked closer she noticed that he was only wearing her outer clothes he had on her bra and she was pretty sure that was panty lines under his pants.   Sure she had jokingly suggested that he could wear her clothes if it meant he would clean the house, but she never expected him to actually do it.  But then again she was wearing his clothes, but hers HAD been meant as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped in the room and cleared her throat to get his attention.   He turned around and Lynda raised an eyebrow when she saw he had gone so far as to even put on some makeup and jewelry.   She was completely caught off guard when he said, \u201cYes, Nate.  What did you need?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda cocked her head in confusion, \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI called you by your name; do you have a problem with that young man?\u201d Nate questioned in his best motherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot realizing what the mints really were, Lynda had taken one out and put it in her mouth as she stood there.   \u201cSo you put on my clothes and you think that makes you me.  And here I was trying to be funny by putting on your clothes to show you how ridiculous you were earlier wearing my shoes.  Well, you kind of lack in a few places to properly pull off the look, but your close.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I appreciate that tone of voice young man,\u201d Nate answered sternly, \u201cnow I think maybe you should go to your room and think about what you just did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was going on with her son she wondered?  He puts on her clothes and suddenly he thinks he is the mother?   \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what, if you want to act like you\u2019re the mom, then I\u2019m game.  I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m you and you can be me.  I\u2019ll gladly give you the responsibility of running the house.  I just wish you had the body to go along with your new role so you might better pull it off.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to stop as Lynda\u2019s wish took effect as they both began to change.  Nate and Lynda\u2019s bodies began to shimmer.   Nate slowly began to fill out the bra that he wore under his blouse, his hips and ass widened and took on a feminine shape.  His hair grew long and styled itself to look just as hers had been.   Lynda\u2019s body, on the other hand, began to loose it curves.  Her breasts disappeared and her hips thinned.  And lastly Nate and Lynda\u2019s sexual anatomy swapped.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time started up again, Lynda felt disoriented for a moment.  She blinked her eyes a couple of times to try and clear her thoughts.  She looked over at Nate and realized something was now very wrong.  Not only was he wearing her clothes and makeup, he had breasts.  They were quite obvious in the top that he had on.  Seeing that she looked down at herself and saw her own chest was gone.   She pulled the collar of the t-shirt she had on out and looked down the front.  They were gone, her chest was completely flat.  It then hit her that if her breasts were gone and Nate had them\u2026.she ran a hand down the front of her jeans and felt something that wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.  Her anxiety was rising as she realized she had a penis, she was a boy and her son was then\u2026a woman.  She stared at her son puzzled.  He physically had her body, hair, everything.  The only problem was he still had his own face.    The thought caused a weird reaction in her and her new organ began to swell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNate, I\u2019ll ask again, did you need something?\u201d Nate asked her with her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.  I\u2019ll leave you alone,\u201d she replied, her voice now sounding like Nate\u2019s.  She turned and left the room.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She closed and locked the door and stepped in front of the mirror on the dresser.  She couldn\u2019t believe what she saw.   Her long brown hair was gone, replaced by the haircut that Nathan had bee sporting only minutes ago, but her face, it was the same as it had been.  She still looked like Lynda only the body didn\u2019t match the face.   Hesitantly she lifted her shirt exposing her abs.  They were tight and toned just as Nate\u2019s.   She continued to lift her shirt and finally pulled it over her head.  Her chest was flat. The last time she had been this flat chested she was 9 or 10 years old.  It felt very odd as she ran her hand over the skin and muscles.  Only one thing was left to verify wasn\u2019t her imagination.  Undoing the buttons on her jeans, she hooked her fingers in the waist of the underwear and jeans and shoved them down.   Her jaw dropped as she saw it was real.  She reached down and touched to just to make sure.   Convinced she was dreaming she put her clothes back on a sat down on the edge of the bed trying to make since of what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird things had been happening all morning.  Earlier she felt as if she had black out as she didn\u2019t remember anything for a few minutes.  Then Nate started acting odd, actually volunteering to help clean the house.  That was followed by her finding him wearing her shoes and kind of acting\u2026almost feminine or more so, kind of like her.  Then she found him wearing her clothes and completely acting like her.  But what happened to make this happen.   She fell back on the bed and slid her hands in the pockets of her pants.  She felt the tin and pulled it out.    Suddenly it dawned on her; Nate had the mints earlier when he began acting strange.   She had been sucking on a mint when she made the comment about trading roles with him.  Were they the secret to this?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda takes out a mint and thinks about something to wish for. Nothing dangerous but something that could prove whether she is right.  She wasn\u2019t sure about wishing to change everything back to normal, at least not yet.   So popped the mint in her mouth and wished for $100 dollars to appear on the desk.  Her eyes became as big as pie plates as she watched a stack of money materialize in front of her.  She open the tin and looked inside, there were only a few mints left.   She wondered if you could wish more than once on a mint.  So she wished the tin was full of magic mints again.   She opened it and found the same amount.  So either it was only one wish at a time or you could wish for more mints.    She took out another mint and popped in her mouth and repeated her last wish.  She waited for a few moments then opened the lid.  She grinned as she saw it was full.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk she thought so this is what caused the change and made me look like my son and have thoughts that are similar to his, but why do I still remember who I am, but Nate seems to believe he really is me.  She tried to remember what she had exactly said to him.  It was something to the effect of I\u2019m game to play along.  I\u2019ll pretend to be you and you can be me.   That must be it, she had said she would pretend, but he could actually be her.   She had just wished her son to become her.  She looked at the clock on the desk and saw that Mike would be home any minute.  This might be a problem she thought as she quickly hurried to find mom, rather Nate.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she took a mint and wished everything back, how would that explain Nate in her clothes and makeup in the kitchen and her in Nate\u2019s clothes?  She eased toward the kitchen and was shocked to hear Mike and Nate having a conversation as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda stepped into the kitchen her curiosity too peaked to avoid not doing it.   She saw Mike sitting in a chair taking off his work boots as Nate leaned against the counter talking to him about how his job went today.  She was left speechless when Mike stood up and walked over and kissed her son on the mouth with all the passion he normally gave her.   It was like he was oblivious to the change that to her was clearly present; Nate\u2019s face was on her body.

His feet starts shrinking slowly, changing from Nate's 9 and half shoe size to Lynda's 4 shoe size size. <br>\r\nThe hair on his feet also begins to shrink back into the roots, eventually disappearing from existence. <br>\r\nThen, Nate's toenails begin to shine, and changes colour from the flesh of the skin below to a painted light blue, for all his toes, to match Lynda's feet.<br>\r\nThe painted toenails are expertly applied on, if done by a professional. <br>\r\nLynda, when she has free time, paints her nails and toenails and through practice, has become quite an expert at painting her nails.<br>\r\nHaving a perfect coloured pair of feet is expected from Lynda, so it's naturally that Nate's feet are like this.<br>\r\nNate's feet also become quite soft, due to the fact that Lynda's feet are soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is Nate's socks.<br>\r\nHis socks are pure white, but since Lynda doesn't wear socks, this obviously has to change.<br>\r\n Nate's socks begin to transform, climbing up his legs until it gets to the top of his legs,covering his bottom. <br>\r\nThen, they become translucence, but at the same time, darkens to make his legs look darker. <br>\r\nThe socks then become elastically and stretchy, become a pair of pantihose, or stockings, in the process. The pantihose covers his feet, all of his bottom and his legs. These type of pantihose is exactly what Lynda was wearing eariler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of legs, Nate's legs begin to expand, widening to become a pair of feminine legs. <br>\r\nThe calves expand to fit Lynda's calves, which are not too big nor too small. <br>\r\nJust like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Nate's new calves are <i>just</i> right, being sexy at the same time. <br>\r\nThe top half of his legs also expand, becoming bigger just like Lynda's legs. <br>\r\nThey become the appropriate size to fit with the calves, with Nate's waist expanding slightly, getting ready for when it changes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly for this round of changes, Nate's pants, or jeans, and underwear. <br>\r\nSince the pantihose is already here, there is no need for Nate's pants. <br>\r\nThe blue pants, unlike the socks into stocking, begins to crawl up Nate's legs until they reach above his now feminine knees, which the pants now looks like some kind of long shorts. <br>\r\nThe long shorts then begin to transform, changing from denim to cloth, and becomes pointed. <br>\r\nThe part of the shorts that holding up Nate's private areas and is against his legs disappear, making that area exposed if you looked from the floor upwards. The shorts then turn skirt like, turning black into process. <br>\r\nThe top part of the shorts climb up to Nate's waist, hold it up and touching around the whole waist. <br>\r\nA small button and zip is placed directly in the middle, so it can get zipped and unzipped easily. <br>\r\nThe shorts have become a short, black skirt, exactly like what Lynda was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last part, Nate's boxer shorts, which he is wearing under that skirt and the pantihose, begins to change as well. <br>\r\nThey wear originally a pair of blue boxer shorts, but due to the changes, the leg areas shrink up to the point that only Nate's ass and private areas are covered more, as the waistline is thin. <br>\r\nThe blue boxers have become a pair of blue panties.<br>\r\n But, it doesn't stop there. <br>\r\nThe panties become slight frilled, as it reddens, and becomes pink instead of blue. <br>\r\nThen, small, red hearts begin to appear round the panties, at the front and back of them. <br>\r\nOn the back, a big hearts can be seen, with the words '<i>CHANGE IS GOOD!</i>' printed on it, and at the front, the words '<i>SOON</i>' also can be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all finalizes when Nate reaches the bottom of the stairs, which he then heads to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

With every step she takes, Erin can see Lynda's boobs jiggle slightly and slowly along with her ass and hips moving along as well.

Towering above her, Lynda's face can't be seen due to her mega massive mammaries blocking the view and Erin can even see her panties. Erin's view then sees the jar of candies in the corner of her eye. If she is quick enough, Erin might be able to grab it and get out of this situation. She has two candies in her pocket but shouldn't waste them at the moment as the jar is more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the moment that Erin got up, giant Lynda turned on the spot and walked towards where the sink was, which the jar is directly in the path of her. Even if she tried, Erin couldn't keep with the movements of Lynda and watched in helplessness as Lynda completely flattens the jar under her foot and walked like nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin dropped to her knees, in shock of what happened. The jar....gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pulled out the last two remaining candies to look. She read a note earlier that if the jar gets destroyed, it will re-appear somewhere else but it would be a difficult place to navigate considering her size. Erin could wish to be in the same place as the jar but that could be risky as the jar could fall somewhere depending on where it is and if it goes somewhere else after Erin spends her last candy, it could lead her stuck in this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Erin had planned to return Nate back to his original form. Yeah, having him as her mother is cool and all, but Erin isn't that cruel. He's not going to be like that forever. Besides, she wanted to wish something else on him and if that's the last remaining candy spent, she may not have another chance again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she risk trying to find the jar or return to normal size?</span></div></div>",

Erin then grabbed a candy, unwrapped it and popped it in her mouth. \"I'll show you why. I wish that Nate's hair becomes black and he is aware of it turning black.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate is taken aback by this, when he feels his hair is feeling funny. He glanced over to the mirror, which to his surprise, Nate sees his brown hair becoming black with each second passing. In a matter of moments, his hair turns completely black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate stands up, amazed that his hair has turned black. He turns to Erin, completely shocked by this. \"H-how...\"<br>\r\nErin lifts up the jar, which now has the lid back on. \"These candies you got for your birthday grant any sort of wish!\" she grinned mischievously. \"Any wish you make will be only noticeable by you and anyone you specifically mention in the wish! Anyone else with think it's normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin then pulls out a piece of paper. \"Well, that's according to this piece of paper.\" she remarked, curiously. \"Anyway, only you and I will know you had brown hair before the wish!

I was just thinking back.\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back, Nate's memories are a mixture of his and his mothers.  Both his and his mother's memories agreed that the best times they had with Eric was when she was young.  At that time she was mommy's little girl and mommy didn't have to worry about who she was with or even worse the boys she might be thinking about.  Also at that time, she looked up to Nate as her big brother.  She wasn't the annoying little sister she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his purse, which had appeared next to him on the couch, Nate took out the candies.  She offered one to Erin but she didn't take it.  Thinking back when she was young she would have always taken anything that Nate had given her.  With the candy in his mouth he said, \"I wish you acted like you did when you were much younger..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Erin's mind empties and her smile brightened.  In her head she was a two year old again.  Bored with what was on TV, Erin dropped off the couch and started to walk around.  Looking at things with innocent eyes.  Nate kept an eye on his little sister.  When she was about to pull something off a table, Nate rushed towards her and saved her from hurting herself.  He then led her by the hand back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's room had changed.  Inside her room instead of her bed was a large crib which could accommodate her teenaged body.  There was a changing table in the corner with stacks of diapers.  The walls were still painted pink, but it was a lighter pink than before and the posters of rock stars were replaced with cartoony animals.  All of Erin's things had been replaced with things you would find in a toddlers rooms including many books with small words and big pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was going to put Erin inside her playpen which contained many stuffed animals and Erin's favorite doll.  But before putting her inside, he decided to put her in a diaper first.  Quickly as if he had done it 1000s of times before, Nate stripped Erin out of her clothes.  This would be the last time, Erin would ever wear panties.  And put her in diapers which were made for toddlers but still in a size that would fit Erin's teen body.  Once she was securely fastened into her diaper, Nate lifted her into her playpen.  Once Erin took an interest in one of her toys, Nate left the room.  Instead of heading to the livingroom again, Nate once again headed toward the kitchen to see if any dishes still needed to be washed.</span></div></div>",

With the third to last bag, the pants legs merged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done?\" Robert bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a moment!! I only have a bag or two left!!\" Tommy tosses one of them in, and the groin pain goes away, now replaced with a smooth feeling, like silk. With the last bag, Tommy's pants had fully become a tiny red miniskirt barely covering his butt, bridled with a white belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!!\" Tommy closes the trunk, and on doing so, sees his reflection.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't belve that after all of the strange sensations he did not take time to inspect his now herself. As his mouth which aquired full pouty lips agaped open, he could see his hair now long curling around his neck with a hint of a dirty blonde color forming with it. But what really caught his attention was the new assets on his chest pushing against his feminine white top. \"Tammy? Are you alright honey?\" \"( Tammy? That can't be right! Why is dad calling me... wait! Mabye this has to something with my current appearance.) No. No eveything is alright dear\" There it was again. The sudden outbursts just like the ones on the way to their house, which in effect became a search for groceries to which he did not know they were running out on. Finally after what seemed a lifetime in thought the \"couple\" arrived at the house. But something just didn't seem quite right. That was revealed when they walked into the house to find everything normal. That is except for one thing. And for young Tommy it was very weird and unfortunate. \"Ummm da, I mean dear? Exactly how many rooms does this house have?\" His father laughed in amusement. \"Only 2 I belive. The main bedroom and the guestroom.\" \"Oh.\" Tommy's room vanished from existence leaving the son now apparently bombshell wife trapped in an unwanted reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Nate was still contemplating on what exactly was going on with his best friend. Could it be something to with the candies he pondered. He finally decided to be on the safeside he would check on him tomorrow. He pulled the covers over his head slowly drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Tommy's house luck blessed him for the time being. Since he knew that his dad wotks extremely hard, there would be no snuggling tonight. And even though he had to sleep in the same bed with him, it didn't weird him out cause afterall it was his dad. But his new form also came with new womanly influences. For some reason a part of him deep inside was dissapointed that he would simply fall asleep with no hooky. But he kept himself on the right side of the line long enough to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

My pants were now way too tight for my newly formed legs. Next up, my abdomen pinched in and I felt a great stinging sensation in my chest. This is when I realized I was becoming a woman. My newly formed breasts reached a c-cup length. As lips thickened and my hair lengthened, I began to feel an odd sensation in my crotch. It was the worst feeling I have ever felt in my life. I screamed bloody murder (realizing I had a new more feminine voice). After the painful final moments of my transformation, I look to a purse that has appeared to my right on the ground. On top of it was an I.D. I could only assume this was the new me. I studied the picture on the drivers license. I was now a woman of Hispanic descent. I had dark brown eyes, long curly hair, and a small mole on my right cheek. I then looked at the additional info. <br>\r\nIt read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDOB: 02-15-1990<br>\r\nName: Alexandria Martinez<br>\r\nDonor?: No <br>\r\nSex: F<br>\r\nAfter reading a little bit I got the picture. Beginning to panic, I wondered what was to become of me next. I looked to my surroundings to determine where I was. I was in an alleyway of a busy city. I look to the end of the alley and I see that there is a blue corvette. Thoughts come flooding into my head and I realize that that car belongs to Alexandria (or me).

Natalie wondered where the candies came from. Were they made by aliens looking for test samples? Perhaps, a bored god deciding to delve into the mortal realm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps, they were concocted by a powerful witch? Were there other people who had them? It was certainly possible, it\u2019s silly to assume that they were the only ones with the candies, and if they weren\u2019t, she hoped she would never run into someone else who does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus eventually arrived at the school, where they disembarked, and walked towards the main building. The wind comfortably blowing between Natalie\u2019s legs, as she savoured the sensation for a moment.

She picks up the family dog and forces him to sit at a plastic table, telling her, \"Now Asuka, you better sit there and drink your drink. You have to do what I say because I'm the princess and you're not, and I...\" She drops her doll as a strange sensation runs through her. \"Maybe I should cut back on the fairy cakes...\" she grumbled as she was unaware of her height growing. Doubled over, Nicole fails to detect her hair turning blonde and lengthening, nor her princess gown separating into a top and skirt, the latter shortening as gams were lengthening. Asuka began to bark at Nicole as smoke began to roll from Nicole's mouth. Light patches of dark blue scales began to line the inside of her thighs, on her shoulders, on the outsides of her forearms, the backs of her hands, the tops of her feet, her groin, her now budding breasts, and around a nub at the base of her spine just above her butt crack. She now looked like was 11 years old, and was still aging...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel funny...\" Nicole lamented, still not fully aware of what was happening to her as she now sported B-cup breasts in a small cheerleading top that resembled the one from the local high school Erin and Natalie attended. Her skirt was now short enough to be considered a miniskirt as a hole opened up in the rear, and through it a long, thick draconic tail coated almost totally in dark blue scales except on the bottom, where it was all smooth skin, slithered through. Her hair was now platinum blonde and so long that the lowest 10% of it was parted by her new tail. From her shoulder blades two blue scaled webbed wings grew out of her back, stretching to a six foot wingspan. Nicole's ears stretched into a long pointed, almost elven shape as her bust grew even further, reaching levels beyond normal human growth, as now Nicole sported a natural E-cup chest in a tiny cheerleading tubetop that bordered on outright slutty. The miniskirt that went with the cheerleading top was on the verge of being a micro miniskirt, but seemed to have finished shrinking, but was now supporting a firm rear, the tail between the supple cheeks now almost seven feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole groaned, holding her tightening sides as she failed to see past her enormous chest that her Mary Janes become white and green sneakers, the stockings she was wearing shrinking down to very loose socks that almost resembled short leg warmers. Finally, the very small top and skirt began to change color from pink to the high school's colors; green and yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn pain, Nicole coughs, and belches flames, melting the table where she was just moments ago trying to have imaginary tea and 'fairy cakes.' Looking through the smoke to the mirror by her bed, Nicole saw the now busty high school senior dragon girl and almost broke out into tears, asking, \"Wha... What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hall, snickering, Natalie goes, \"Now let's mess with her some more. I wish Nicole's room looked like it belonged to a 17 year old dragon girl.\" Upon saying that, all of Nicole's princess swag and childish things vanished, being replaced by posters and furniture that looked more appropriate in a teenage girl's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's everything going?!\" Nicole cried. \"I'm a princess, not a...\" she looks at herself. \"...dragon!!\" She stomped her foot in a tantrum. \"And I'm a little girl!!\" She grabbed her breasts, seemingly with the intent with tearing them off. \"Little girls don't have boobies!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so good...\" Erin smirks, watching from the cracked door. \"Now, I wish everyone besides Nicole, Natalie, and myself always believed Nicole was 17, a cheerleader at our high school, and a dragon girl!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Natalie sprinted into hiding as Lynda walked into Nicole's room, checking her forehead, saying, \"Are you feeling well, sweetie? You missed cheerleading practice today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole growled, smoke fuming from her mouth. \"I'm confused!! I'm supposed to be a little girl, a little princess!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda lays her onto her bed. \"It's alright. You'll always be my little princess, but you're all grown up now, and have to set a good example for your little sisters and brother... Now, if you're not feeling well, you get some rest. I'll tell you're coach you were running a fever... although it always so hard to tell since you're part dragon and all...\" She pulls the covers over Nicole and walks out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\" Nicole wonders, still confused out of her gourd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now, dear sister?\" Erin asks Natalie.</span></div></div>",

Erin slumps on her bed and sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow your a slow learner Natalie.\" She says blinking at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've grown into all this stuff, I've only been a girl a couple hours\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Erin sits upright with a grin on her face. \"I've got an idea.\" She says and starts rummaging in her jean pockets and producing another candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you keeping those.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh, these are mine now. You should learn to be more grateful of the presents you get.\" She sticks her tongue out at you playfully and drops the candy on it before her tongue returning to her mouth. She scrunched her eyes closed tightly and then opens them again and looks at you intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do something.\" She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, stand up and sit in that chair.\" She says pointing to her desk chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders and do as she says.

You don't remember adopting this position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wished that you would have more femanine movement and mannerisms. The way you got up and walked and sat in that chair was just like a girl. Look!\" She yells pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that you are in the middle of subconsciously hooking your long hair behind you ear to keep it out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just like a girl now,\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how to feel about this. Of course you don't want to stand out but is it worth having your mannerisms changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get time to think further as your mother walks in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girls it's time to go and you aren't even ready yet. Hurry up.\" She leaves again without so much of a hint of concern that her 15 year old son is now a 13 year old girl.

Nate and Lynda were walking beside each other on their way to the kitchen, where Lynda was going to make Nate a snack.  Lynda was wearing a pair white short shorts and a peach blouse.  On her feet was a pair of white slingback platform pumps.  Meanwhile Nate was wearing a blue t-shirt and a pair of his favorite jeans.  He had a pair of blue Van skateboard shoes on hie feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a spit second for the effects of Erin's wish to take hold.  She was going to have some fun while the candies were in her possession.  She loved the thought of seeing her older brother in her Mom's clothes and shoes.  As well as seeing her mom, (who is always dressed properly) dress down in her son's teenage clothes.  Erin was in the living room when she made the wish and was going to find her victims so she could see  how they react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was in the hall way seeing her mom and borther stop and then look at each other with a look of horror in their faces.   \"Nate\"  Lynda said  \"Why are you wearing  my clothes, and get your feet out of my favorite skate board shoes before you strech them. she said this with a harsh tone that made Nate straighten up and wonder why he was in trouble and when he looked down noticing the jeans and t-shirt he had on,  he started to stamner and try to think of a reason as why he would be wearing his mom's clothes.  He realized that the situation was even weirder when he looked at his mom and noticed what she was wearing.  \"Well mom, why are you wearing my blouse and shorts and you look really stupid in my 5\" heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Lynda to get tense and she motioned to Nate to get upstairs so they could switch the clothes back to their proper owner.  Erin was watching her mom have trouble walking up the stairs in heels that only moments before she was confident walking in.  She was having trouble to not laugh outloud at the situation and she was anxiously awaiting to see them switch things up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate walked into his room and quickly took of the jeans and shirt, he was freaking out when he realized that he was wearing a pair of cotton boxers.  This caused him to shutter at the thought of wearing his mothers underwear.  Meanwhile Lynda had off all of her former clothes off and was having trouble with the clasp on the bra.  Having never recalled wearing on she had trouble getting it loose.</span></div></div>",

She thought it funny that both of them now seemed content with the change.  She watched as they returned to the kitchen and continued on as if nothing had happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin grinned evilly as she started down the hall to her room picturing the rest of the day with Nate and Lynda.    As she walked she saw her dad who was coming down the hall.    A sudden new thought came to her mind; what if she wished for her and her dad to switch clothes also.   She quickly grabbed a mint and made her wish, \u201cI wish my dad always remember wearing my clothes and undergarments and I always wore his clothes and underwear and he doesn\u2019t remember any of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin suddenly had a strong desire to change clothes with her dad as he passed her in the hall.   She noticed her dad staring intently at her as he walked by.   She continued to move slowly down the hall pretending not to pay attention to him and out of the corner of her eye she saw him glance back at her and then quickly duck into her bedroom.  Erin did the same and stepped into her parents bedroom and waited.   She struggled to to fight the urge to go into their closet and change, but a few minutes later she heard footsteps and then saw her dad go past the door, now wearing her clothes which were rather small and tight on his larger frame.  Once he was out of sight she hurried to her room and found the pile of clothes that her dad had left in her floor.  Closing her door she quickly stripped down naked and after she threw her clothes in the hamper, started sorting through her dad\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hardly contain herself as she grabbed his underwear; her desire to put them on was becoming very strong.   Stepping into the leg holes she pulled them up to her waist, quickly realizing there was a slight problem, they were way big.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishing for her mom and brother to swap clothes had been easy as they were similar in size, although not in proportions, but that had not mattered.   Her and her dad were big opposites; she was only 4\u201911\u201d and he was 6\u2018 2\u201d.    She knew how to fix it, make a wish. <br>\r\nHolding up her briefs she went to the hamper and dug the mints out of her pockets.  Popping one in her mouth she made her wish, \u201cI wish our clothes would fit properly.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Quickly she grabbed his shirt and pulled it over her head.  \u2018Phew, it already smells like him,\u2019 she thought, the smell of cologne and stale smoke on the shirt.   She finished putting on his socks and went and glanced in the closet.  All of his old clothes now hung in there, all resized to fit her body.   \u2018Ha, thats funny,\u2019 she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back out she looked down and saw her dad\u2019s watch and wedding band laying in the floor.  \u2018This is all part of his clothes\u2019, she thought as she picked them up.  She put on the watch then slipped on his wedding band.  \u2018Wow, it fits perfectly,\u2019 she said out loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to leave the room and felt stuff in her pockets.  She checked her back pocket and pulled out a wallet; inside was an ID with her picture and name on it along with some cash and credit cards.   Checking her front pocket, she reached and pulled out keys, coins and a lighter.  Putting it back she thought to herself, \u2018OK, now I have all of dad\u2019s clothes and his personal belongings, looks like it all belongs to me now.  Oh yeah, the mints,\u2019 she thought and dug them out of her old clothes.  She popped another one in her mouth and put the rest in her pants pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin walked over to the mirror on the dresser.  She chuckled as she looked at her reflection.  She was now wearing the clothes that her dad had been wearing moments ago, right down to the underwear.  \u2018Ha, this is hilarious, I\u2019m wearing my Dad\u2019s clothes and he is stuck in mine.

She had to stifle a chuckle at the sight of his hairy body in her clothes.   \u2018He looks rather silly with a mustache and wearing a teenagers clothes,\u2019 she thought, \u2018I wish his male body hair was gone so he\u2019d look more girly.\u2018   A sudden shimmer happened and Erin looked back at him and all his hair was gone, even his facial hair.  \u2018That\u2019s better, maybe I should wish I could grow it on my body to match my clothes too, she thought, not realizing that even though she hadn\u2019t actually wished it, it was still a wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin went to the living room to watch some T.V. while her parents and brother went about their business.

Going to the closet, she noticed that all of her parents clothes, which was now her and Nate\u2019s were there.   \u2018So Nate and I share the room, interesting,\u2019 she thought.    She went to the master bath and started getting undressed, putting her soiled items in the hamper.  As she turned to get int the shower she noticed her reflection and stopped in mid-track.   She gasped slightly as she noticed dark hair on parts of her body.   She quickly surveyed herself and realized that thick hair was now on her lower legs and her groin, which had been covered with fine light brown earlier, was now a thick mat of dark black hair.  She looked at her chest and abdomen and saw she had patches of dark hair growing, the thickest mostly in a line from her groin up to the middle of her chest, where it was starting to spread across her small breasts.  Most amazing was on her face.  She had noticeable stubble on her cheeks and a good start of a mustache on her upper lip.  It looked like it had been growing for a week at least.  She reached up to feel it, confirming what she was seeing.  It was definitely real as touched the thick hairs on her upper lip.  Her hand slid down to her breasts.  The hair there was also thick and coarse feeling.  \u2018Damn that thought about having Dad\u2019s hair, came true.  I did think a wish in that thought earlier,\u2019 she realized and reminded herself to be more careful.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin jumped in the shower to clean up.   When she washed her hair, large patches of her long hair started coming out in her hands.   She watched as it quickly dissolved in the bottom of the shower.  Somewhat concerned she hurriedly finished and got out of the shower.    While she had small amounts of hair on her body when she started it now appeared to have grown more.   Her upper legs and all of her upper torso was now covered with dark hair.   As she stood in front of the mirror she was surprised at her reflection. She stared at her image in the mirror and her mouth fell open as she saw herself, a short masculine looking hair style adorned her head now.  It was her Dad\u2019s haircut.  Even her mustache was thicker, almost as full as her father\u2019s had been.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d she said out loud, as she ran a hand over her mouth feeling the fullness of her  mustache and beard growth.  \u201cI look like a miniature man, with small breasts and minus a penis, but still,\u201d Erin commented to herself. </span></div></div>",

She glanced at herself in the mirror on the dresser.   She was still surprised at her reflection.  Her earlier unexpected wish had resulted in her now having Mike\u2019s body hair.  She stroked her newly acquired mustache and smiled.  \u2018This is kinda cool having a mustache,\u2019 she thought.   She glanced at the dresser and saw a bottle of Mike\u2019s cologne.  Why not, she thought, picking it up and spraying some on her self.   She finished getting ready by putting on his watch and slipped his wedding ring on.  \u2018I\u2019m wearing Dad\u2019s ring and I\u2019m not even married, but it part of my clothes now,\u2019 she thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin headed back to the kitchen.  Nate was busy at the stove, working on dinner, when he noticed her.   \u2028\u2028\u201cOh good, you clean now.  Listen I need something from the store to finish dinner.  Would you be a dear and run and get it for me,\u201d he asked as he continued working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Why do I need to go to the store,\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t send Mom or Dad, they aren\u2019t licensed to drive.  I swear sometimes you would forget your head if it wasn\u2019t attached,\u201d Nate said with exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin tried to understand where this was coming from, then it hit her.  She had wished for everyones responsibilities to be swapped earlier.  Mike would normally do this for Liz, but now Nate was asking her to do it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what do we need?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate quickly jotted down some items that he needed to finish their dinner and handed it to her.   Erin grabbed the list and started toward the garage, wondering how this was going to work.  She had made these wishes based on no one leaving the house.  Now she was being requested to drive into town, looking like this. </span></div></div>",

He was still wearing the clothes she had seen him in earlier.  She also noticed his hair was now longer; styled and cut to look like hers had been earlier today.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, give just a moment,\u201d he said as he disappeared down the hall, returning in a moments carrying her former purse.

She dug her keys out of her pocket and climbed in the drivers seat.   Everything was already adjusted to fit her smaller stature.  Erin started the car and backed out then headed toward town.  She found herself quite at ease as she expertly drove along.  \u2028\u2028Mike sat quietly in the passenger seat for a short time before he pulled out Erin\u2019s cell phone and started texting.  Erin glanced over and shook her head at the speed that Mike was typing and sending.  She realized that since he had her old responsibilities he was just chatting with all of her old girlfriends.   She was rather surprised that he knew what he was talking about.  She also became concerned about what anyone who saw them might think.   The fresh mint in her mouth she wished that no one they met would think anything was wrong.  Everything shimmered again and she felt better. </span></div></div>",

Erin was a little disappointed that her dad was smoking while in her clothes.  She didn\u2019t want him putting burn holes or worse in them and he looked silly doing it while dressed as her anyway.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be smoking Dad.  Its not good for you,\u201d she stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts a bad habit, I know, but I just can\u2019t quit, I\u2019ve tried before.  I shouldn\u2019t have started all those years ago.  You just don\u2019t understand how hard it is,\u201d he retorted as he put it in the ashtray and went back to texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI realize that, but you still shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Erin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you did understand then you would realize that it\u2019s not so easy. If I could do it over I wouldn\u2019t have started.  I could be healthy like you,\u201d he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right I can\u2019t understand the addiction you have. If I felt like you do about it then I might, but I wish you hadn\u2019t started,\u201d Erin answered wondering about what it would be like to have his addiction and its affects on his body and if he was young and never started, then suddenly realizing what she had done as she was still sucking on her partial mint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Erin felt different.  Her breathing was not as easy, as new sensations came to her mouth and assaulted her nostrils.  She tasted cigarette on her tongue and lips, smelled it in her nose.  She glanced down at the smoldering cigarette in the ashtray and picked it up taking a now familiar deep drag.  She exhaled a stream of smoke and shook her head in irritation.  \u2018SHIT!  Another stupid wish made without thinking. I have to be more careful,\u2019 she thought realizing she now had Mike\u2019s addiction and memories of smoking.  Her errant wish had changed her physically.  She now had his internal organs, all affected by his 10 years of smoking. She felt and looked as if she was thirty-seven years old.  His mental habit overrode her brain and became hers.  She remembered he started because everyone else at work did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced in her old purse sitting next to her dad and noticed the pack of cigarettes were now gone.  A familiar feeling came to her as she felt them in the pocket of her shirt.  She looked at her Dad, he looked so much younger, which he was now due to her wish. He had never started smoking and Mark appeared and felt as if he was thirteen again.  She glanced in the rearview mirror.  Her own appearance was drastically different now.  Her face was aged, some wrinkles around her eyes.  She still didn\u2019t look bad, Mike had a younger appearance than he really was, kinda look, but she realized her looks had affected by his old habit and she wasn\u2019t exactly him.   Her skin felt less smooth.  She looked at her hands and noticed her fingers stained by the nicotine.   She coughed and realized that it was what Mike did quite often.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the store and went in.  Mike was energetic and walked with a renewed vigor related to his recent change, while Erin was not in as big of a hurry.   They went around and gathered the items on the list as Mike frequently answered and sent text messages.  Erin found she kinda missed not knowing what her friends were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed several people around the store and none seemed to be disturbed or curious about the very young looking adult man wearing a teenage girls clothes or the older looking small girl wearing men\u2019s clothes. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHaving got everything they went to the register and the clerk rang up their items.  Erin pulled out her wallet and grabbed a bank card, which had her name on it and swiped it to pay.   Erin asked Mike to help grab their bags and the headed to the exit.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started out Erin pulled out a fresh cigarette and lit up. It hung from the corner of her mouth, just as Mike would do.  She was slightly nervous about being seen smoking, having just acquired this new habit, but at the same time it was normal to her now and she realized no one would even give a second look due to her prior wishes.</span></div></div>",

Dinner will be ready in a short time,\u201d he stated grabbed what he needed to finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike retreated to Erin\u2019s former room, texting the entire time.  While Erin stood there watching Nate move around the kitchen, she thought he looked odd with his wispy attempt at facial hair.   \u2018Doesn\u2019t seem fair that I have all of Dad\u2019s hair and he has mine, while Nate and Mom are still the same.  Time to remedy that,\u2019 she thought grabbing a fresh mint.   \u201cI wish Nate and Liz swapped all their hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shimmer passed and Erin watched as Nate\u2019s hair began growing at an accelerated rate.  Within moments Nate had shoulder length hair, styled and colored just as Liz.  She knew that Liz would now have all of Nate\u2019s hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix o\u2019clock came and Nate called for everyone to come to dinner.  He had set the table and had everything ready just like Liz would.   Erin, Mike and Liz came in and started taking their seats.  Mike and Liz were starting to really look like teenagers now.  Mike was noticeably younger looking thanks to Erin\u2019s earlier wish and Liz now had a short buzz cut and traces of a young man\u2019s facial hair.  Erin had a mint in her mouth, as her parents started to take their usual seats.  Erin was disappointed and wanted to sit at the head of the table, it seemed right to her that if she had the responsibilities of Mike she should get to set there and Nate had done the cooking so he should set at the other end, just like their parents would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another thoughtless moment she made a statement, \u201cI wish Nate and I were in our parents places and they were in ours.\u201d   Erin didn\u2019t realize immediately how she had just worded her wish, as the shimmer passed around the room.   Mike stopped in his tracks and moved to where Erin usually sat, while Liz and Nate switched seats.  \u201cSorry Dad, I almost sat in your seat,\u201d Mike said blushing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was dumbfounded momentarily.   She and Nate were now parents, even though they were still brother and sister since she had wished that she and him were in their place and they were in theirs.  Her and Nate were now physically in their 30\u2019s while their parents were now teens.  \u2018How can we be the parents, would that even be possible.  I\u2019m not a man and Nate isn\u2019t a female, who got pregnant,\u2019 she wondered, \u2018I\u2019m just glad Nicole and Trevor are at Liz\u2019s parents for the weekend.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all sat there eating dinner, Erin wondered if she should fix things back the way it was supposed to be.  Her wishing before thinking was making quite a mess of things.  She now thought of Nate as Liz and her parents as Erin and Nate.   Though they were still physically still the same sex as they had been this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished dinner and Nate started cleaning the table with Mike helping him as was normal for the family.   Liz went back to Nate\u2019s room to play more video games, while she went to the living room.   She started channel surfing while she absently lit a cigarette as Mike would do.   \u2028\u2028Shortly Nate came and joined her and Mike went to his new room.   The two of them watched television shows that were normally enjoyed by their parents, while not really saying much to each other.   Erin found it weird when Nate did speak to her as he was addressing her as Mike and treating her as his spouse, while she was compelled to do the same.  As it came close to call it a night, Nate as if Erin would rub his feet, something Liz asked Mike to do often.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was reluctant to do so, but couldn\u2019t stop herself as Nate was her wife.   Erin noticed that his toenails were painted as she massaged his feet.  Close to 10 o\u2019clock Nate suggested they call it a night and got up to head to the bedroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin turned everything off and checked the doors before heading up to the bedroom also.   As she came in, Nate was getting undressed.  He had stripped down to the bra and panties that he had been wearing all day.   Erin looked around the room and noticed that their was only one bed in the room now.  \u201cBecause I made the wishes, no one else seemed to notice their changes,\u201d she muttered to herself, \u201cgreat, now I have to sleep with my brother in the same bed now, even if I think of him as my spouse. \u201cI need to change this.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wish I wasn't sleeping with my brother,\u201d she said, hoping it wouldn't make a mess of things more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shimmer past and Erin started noticing changes occurring immediately.  While Liz and her both still had breasts when the wishes started, neither had been wearing any normal female support clothing since they were dressed as males.  Nate and Mike had been wearing bras as part of their female attire, but had nothing in them.   That was changing rapidly as Erin looked at her reflection in the dresser mirror.  She realized her breasts, being smaller A cups, were already gone.  Erin felt her now flat muscular chest.  She knew that meant Mike would now have them.  As she glanced in the bathroom at Nate and saw that he was quickly filling out.  Within a few moments Nate had Liz\u2019s D size breasts filling out the cups of his bra.  Erin felt a tingle run through her whole body and stop in her groin. Looking down she saw a small bulge starting to push against the front of her briefs.  Pulling her waistband out, she watched as a male genital started to lengthen, becoming wider and thicker as she watched.  She pushed her underwear down to get a better look.  Rapidly it lengthened, three, four, five inches, before it stopped at nearly seven inches.  I She never knew just how large her dad was.  She felt another sensation as she felt a scrotal sack develop and two testicles swell inside.   \u201cHoly shit, I have a dick, Dad\u2019s dick,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthis wasn't what I meant to happen.   A large penis hung limply between her legs, the scrotal sack visible underneath.  The real shock came when she looked up at the rest of her image; it was not what she expected.  She now had a male body like her father, only 4\u201911\u201d.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had felt the tingle run through her body but had been focused on the growing appendage between her legs and had noticed anything else until now.  She touched her body, not believing what she saw.  She looked fully male now, just like Mike, she felt like a man, only she was too short to be him.  She was scared to make anymore wishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nate had finished getting ready and came out.  \u201cYou about ready to join me in bed, dear,\u201d Nate said smiling lovingly at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa, in a few minutes,\u201d she answered heading to the bathroom spitting out the little bit of mint still in her mouth.   She shuddered as the thought of Nate\u2019s voice coming from Liz\u2019s body and her own feminine voice coming from her very male body echoed in her ears.  She walked over the toilet feeling the need to pee.  She reached through the fly of her briefs and pulled her penis out, the knowledge of how to do so in her mind.  Done, Erin tucked her penis back in place and went to the sink to finish getting ready.  In the better light of the bathroom she saw that her facial features had changed.  Her own face was still there, but it looked different.   Her cheek bones, forehead, eyes and jaw were different as was the shape of her nose. She had his bone structure under her skin and recognized it was shaped like her dad\u2019s.   She grabbed his toothbrush and went to start brushing when she realized she no longer had braces.  She was so accustom to them she hadn't noticed they were gone.  She bared her teeth and saw they were no longer straight and white like hers had been.  They looked like her dad\u2019s teeth she realized.  \u2018What the hell have I done, or worse, why do I keep going,\u2019 she wondered as she brushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done she came to the bedroom, Nate was already in bed under the sheets.   He patted the bed next to him.  \u201cHurry and come to bed, baby, I need you to get me warm,\u201d he cooed in his masculine voice.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin felt mixed emotions.  She was grossed out at the thought of this being her brother, especially with his voice, although he was very much female and yet excited at going to bed with him, all at the same time.  She was a man now and was feeling all the emotions of Mike in her head along with her own. It was apparent that Nate was having no problems believing he was Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin climbed in next to him and he immediately snuggled up next to her.   She felt his naked breasts pressing against her arm and could smell the lingering odor of Liz\u2019s perfume.  All of it affecting her body.   She tensed as Nate began to caress her chest.  She felt his fingernails, gently and lightly, brush along her skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for going to the store for me earlier.  I really did appreciated it.  It saved me from having to do so,\u201d he said as leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin swallowed hard, her body starting to react without her control.  \u201cI...I was happy to do it, honey,\u201d she heard herself say, her voice crackling nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate leaned in and kissed her again, this time on the lips, with noticeable passion.  Erin grunted in surprise as she felt a hand come to rest on her crotch then start to rub in small circles.  \u201cNo, I really did appreciate it,\u201d Nate said before he went back to kissing her, moving down to her neck.</span></div></div>",

Linda had previously worn her 3 inch pumps in order wear them in. Linda had purchased the pumps for her sisters wedding which was coming up this weekend. Since all of her responsibilities had been transferred to Nate it was now his sister getting married this weekend. His sister as far as he was concerned.  Before the candy changed things it was Linda's younger sister Debbie who was getting married.Nate headed upstairs to his former parents bedroom and found Linda's house flats. They were pink and in a ballet shoe design with cute satin bows on top. They were Linda's favorite shoes for doing chores around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate sat on the bed and slipped off the pumps and then put the pink ballet flats on his feet. Then Nate stood up and admired the shoes and thought to himself how adorable they looked. Just like Linda would have done. He then carried his pumps into the closet and placed them among all of Linda's shoes which now belonged to him. He also decide that he would check to see if there was anything he could scrounge together for his sisters wedding, before he tackled the laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did a brief inventory of all of his dresses. He found a formal teal dress that he remembered wearing for a formal dinner he and his father attended or was it with Erin. The memory was a bit cloudy,but he wasn't concerned about that he had to decide if he would need to go shopping before Saturday or wear the teal dress. He thought that since Mom and Dad would be in school and Erin at work that maybe a little shopping wouldn't be such a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he found the laundry hamper and carried it out of the closet. He went around his parents room picking up clothes and tossing them in the hamper as he went. He then went to his old room and knocked on the door. \"Linda\", he shouted. The television was on and the volume was really high. He then opened the door and saw Linda sitting on the floor with head phones on playing video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate put the hamper down and walked over and pulled the headphones off of Linda's head. \"Nate, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\nNate stood there with his hands on his hips. \"Honestly, Linda you are going to go deaf.\" He then found the TV remote and turned the volume down. \"And look at this room. Linda I want you to stop playing video games and get busy cleaning this pigsty up.\" Linda was now standing and responded just like Nate would have.\"But Nate it is my room and I like it like this its....cozy.\" She said with a crooked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate responded with,\" I will not have you living in filth when you can afford your own place you can do what you want, but you live under my roof and I want it clean.\" \"Awww Nate.\" Linda shrieked. As Nate headed toward the door he turned and added one more thing. \"By the way your Aunt's wedding is this weekend and I want you to bring me your good suit so that I can iron it.\"  This nearly put Linda over the edge. \"Nate, really can't I just wear some jeans and a t-shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was getting very angry.\"Mom do as you are told or you are going to be grounded. Get busy young lady.\" Then Nate slammed the door and took the laundry down to be washed.</span></div></div>",

The urge to finish putting on her dad\u2019s clothes came back and she returned to the bed and sat on the edge.   She grabbed his jeans and flipped them out and slid one leg on then the other standing up she pulled them up to her waist, suddenly realizing they were no longer loose and her perspective on the room was different.   She turned to look at her reflection in the dresser mirror and saw she had physically changed.   She was now as tall as her dad had been, her upper body was huge as was her lower body.   Erin was stunned, this wasn\u2019t exactly the way she had expected her wish to turn out, but oh well, she thought.    She stepped over closer to the mirror.   She ran her hands over her chest, her small breasts were still there, but she could feel muscles underneath.  She turned and looked at her right arm and then left.   Incredible, she thought, seeing the large muscles of her upper arms.  Erin refocused and went back to getting dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin picked up her dad\u2019s shirt and pulled it on, smelling his cologne on it.  She then bent down and grabbed his socks, sat back on the bed and put them on.   Looking down she noticed his watch and wedding ring laying in the floor; apparently they had been covered by the socks.   Hey they are part of his clothing, she thought as she picked them up and slipped on the ring and then fastened the watch to her wrist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around making sure she had everything.  Seeing nothing she started to the   door, as she walked she felt of her pockets.   Erin shoved her hand down into the front right pocket and pulled out car keys, some coins and a lighter.  After she put them back she checked the other front pocket, which was empty.   Feeling her back pocket, she felt a wallet and pulled it out.  She opened it and found her ID, a couple of different cards and some money inside.  Almost everything that she had in her purse, except of course her female items.  She grabbed up the mints, shoved them in her left front pocket and headed to see how the rest of the family was behaving. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the world goes quiet for a moment, before sound roars back with a vengeance, sharper and louder than before, with greater clarity and sounds you weren't hearing before. Just as you were getting used to the new sounds, a strong pressure forms in the seat of your pants. You clasp at it, trying to do anything to free the growing lump, but then a loud rip solves the problem for you, relieving the pain, but now drawing your attention to the sensation of a new alien appendage. Swishing behind you was a new 3' feline tail, coated in grey tabby fur. Feeling back to your rear to where it connected to your body just above your bum, you noticed your pants apparently regenerated around your tail, and that touching your tail was almost... orgasmic. You almost fell to your knees just lightly rubbing it. The shudder it made you do finally made you notice another change the wish did to you, that your new breasts have another three cup sizes, sending you up to F-cups. Finally, you notice the last change, that your hair color is now a vibrant pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned out perfectly!!\" Kate cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate, I...

Before slipping into the personality of Raymond, once more, you recall feeling a great sense of satisfaction, seeing Kate scared as stiff as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the light subsided, you were really, I mean, really surprised as to the person who stood before you. Suddenly and without warning, you, again, slipped into the role of Raymond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hello, Mrs. Wilson!\" You said, although what you really wanted to do was laugh at the form Kate had taken on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And there stood Kate Smith, now in the shape of Lynda Wilson. Kate, on the inside, was absolutely horrified to hear the man before, her father, refer to her as 'Mrs. Wilson.' Kate and her dad knew only one Mrs. Wilson; Nate's Mom. Raymond, although he never met her son, was only familiar with Lynda for a reason or two; Raymond and Lynda did attend high-school with each other, but were never romantically involved. Raymond and Lynda mutually agreed to keep it at the status of really good friends; once or twice, with benefits. For some reason, Kate, being in Lynda's body, recalled all of these events, from Lynda's perspective; High-School, the 'friends with benefits' parts also, which particularly disturbed the hell out of Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The other means by which Lynda and Raymond knew each other was because both were regularly involved in their children's lives. Whenever each had free time on their hands, volunteering as chaperones for certain events was where much of that free time went, for both Lynda and Raymond. It was here at these school functions where the two kept their friendship going. Much to Kate's relief, going by Lynda's memories, at this point, both were only friends with no sexual interaction of any kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Nate, when not trapped in the persona of Raymond, laughed to himself at the irony of Kate's situation. The two were totally opposite. Don't get me wrong, Kate and Lynda were fond of each other, but, their respective personalities were just... Different. Lynda was bright and cheery, she was, after all, a cheerleader in high school. 'Sweet' was the adjective that came to most everyone's mind upon interaction with Lynda. Kate, however, was a good person, very kind and sweet; of course, these adjectives were only when she wanted to be. Otherwise, Kate kept to herself much of the time, she almost came across as the emo-type. And, if Kate didn't like you, she would never hesitate in telling you. This brutal honesty Kate possessed resulted often in her being described as 'Bitter.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just as Nate, Kate, too, fought the strong personality of Lynda for control of the body. On the Kate side, she wanted to grab a candy and wish herself, and the man before her who was Nate, back to their original, teenage bodies. On the Lynda side, she just wanted to catch up with her good friend, Mr. Smith, or, Raymond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Mrs. Wilson?\" Nate asked, still in a struggle for control. \"Mrs. Wilson are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, Kate decided, despite this tug-of-war for control, that she had to make an attempt to speak out.</span></div></div>",

Kate sought only to reach for a candy, wish, and end this abnormality for both herself and Nate. That simple, all she had to do was pop a candy in her mouth and wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Without warning, she lost the mental battle. She and Nate both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Please, Ray.

Nate looked down to his mother, noticing how small his mother looked from the perspective of a middle aged man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, how have you been these days? Just out of curiosity...\" 'Raymond' asked 'Lynda.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      'Lynda' put her hand to her mouth, gave a small giggle and answered. \"Fine, y'know, taking care of the house, the kids, the husband. Just the usual!\" Kate had no idea what she was talking about. Then, as Kate was about to protest, 'Lynda' continued. \"How about you, Ray?\" It felt so incredibly weird for Kate to refer to her father by name. But, at this point, at least physically, they were only friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      'Ray' laughed heartily and replied. \"Good, Lynda. Thanks for asking. Right now, I was just looking for Kate... Have you seen her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Both Nate and Kate had nearly lost the mental struggle completely until both heard the name Kate. At this point, both instantly regained their respective personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Kate spoke up. \"Nate, what do we do?!\" Kate panicked, darn near on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Calm down! Isn't it obvious?!\" Nate shouted in Raymond's booming voice, completely forgetting of the party going on in the rest of the house.  \"You have the candies, Kate! Just wish us back to normal! Before their personalities-\" Nate was the cut off abruptly by 'Raymond.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    'Raymond' massaged his head as if attempting to get rid of a headache. \"Sorry, Lynda, I don't know what came over me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kate, however, still had her own personality. \"Geez!!!\" she shouted in frustration, finally infuriated by this identity crisis. \"Nate! Snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Again, Nate rubbed his head, closed his eyes and opened them again. \"We have to fox this!\" Nate shouted. Just then, the door opened up and there stood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    With no anticipation whatsoever, much to the fear of Nate and Kate, the door to Nate's bedroom opened up, behind a masculine voice called, inquiring about the shouting erupting from Nate and Kate, or, 'Lynda &amp; Raymond.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What is all the noise up hear?\" Mike asked, confusedly. Nate and Kate both turned their heads towards Mike, silence followed leaving behind a rather awkward scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Raymond?\" Mike asked, looking to Nate. \"Hon?\" Mike inquired, looking to Kate. \"Is everything alright in here? From downstairs, we've been hearing a lot of screaming and shouting from up hear. We got worried, so I came up here to check. Is everything okay?\" Mike again questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate and Kate looked to each, both saw the intense dread in each other's eyes? \"What are we to do?\" Their eyes said, if eyes could speak. No longer could they just wish, Mike was right there. Surely getting out of this predicament would now be far more difficult than just popping in a candy and wishing it all to be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uhm... Nothing, Mike. Your wife and I were just... Reminiscing on the good old High-School days... Right, 'Lynda?'\" Nate cued his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh... Yeah... Babe?\" It felt so weird for Kate to call her best friends dad 'Babe.' She felt she'd surely have to wash her tongue after saying such a thing. \"Me and ol' Raymond here were just... Talking...\" Kate struggled to contemplate a fake story that'd get both herself and Nate out of all this. Then, the idea, the goldmine of ideas hit her. \"Raymond was just... Accompanying me, for a little while. I just wanted to be alone, and he made sure I was alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate smiled inside, seeing the look on his father's face, she'd get her alone time, then she could wish and that'd be the end of it. As for Mike, he looked rather concerned. Lynda was the kind of person who hated solitude. For her to look for loneliness, alone time was a rare and strange event. Mike looked to his 'wife' concerned, fearful of what may be going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Lynda... Are you okay? You wanna talk about it alone?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"NO!\" Kate shouted, hesitating not in responding. Mike and Nate both stepped back, surprised by the shout she gave. \"Sorry for shouting. I just want to be alone. I'll be out in a few minutes... Honey.\" Kate forced out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright, Babe.\" Mike comforted, putting a hand to his 'wifes' shoulder. \"We'll leave you alone. See ya later.\" Mike then gave a peck on her cheek, leaving a disgusting feeling to spread from her cheek to the rest of her body, down her spine. It just felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike then left the room, without a word more. He waited outside the door for 'Raymond' to leave her be. Nate, carefully then went up to Kate and whispered something to her. \"Stay here, no matter what. We can't have two copies of my Mom walking around. And, just in case I get the chance, give me a few candies so I can fix this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Okay.\" Kate whispered back, reaching into the jar of candies, pulling out about three and handing them to Nate. Nate then left the room and followed Mike outside, leaving Kate, or 'Lynda' in her solitude.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     And, so, Nate and Mike walked along, in silence. Clearly, Mike had a suspicion about him as to what only 'Raymond' and 'his wife' were doing alone. Also, Mike could've sworn that 'Lynda' was acting a little weird; As if she wasn't herself. Or, even had something to hide. Even 'Raymond,' who also wasn't acting like himself. Anyway you put it, both 'Raymond' and 'Lynda' acted as if they had something to hide. Mike was going to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Raymond, can you follow me, please, I'd like to talk with you, alone.\" Mike urged his friend, escorting him to their room, which was down the hall from Nate's room, where 'Lynda' was. As if on cue, Raymond's personality took over, right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, sure, Mike!\" 'Raymond' exclaimed, happy to follow his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After but a few seconds, the two men arrived to the master bedroom of the home; Mike and Lynda's room. Mike, discretely, closed the door behind them, as not to make a ruckus. Mike was not going to leave until he found out what was really going on with the people he believed to be Raymond and Lynda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Why don't you have a seat, Ray.\" Mike calmly offered, gesturing to the small couch kept in the room. As one might've guessed at this point, Mike was clearly the jealous type. He and Raymond were good friends, almost best friends. It was he who introduced Mike to Lynda. Lynda met Raymond first, then Mike. That's what made him so suspicious, the length of time they'd known each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure! Thanks, Mike.\" 'Raymond' complied, plopping down on the couch, kicking his feet up on the ottoman before the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"So, how've you been, Ray?\" Mike asked, rather monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Pretty good, Man, pretty good. Just the norm, the daily grind, my daughter. Y'know, the usual! What about you?\" 'Raymond' questioned, going along with the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, Ray, just the usual. The wife, the kids, work. Y'know, seeing Nate turn 15... That's a shocker, he's growing up so damn fast. You know what I mean?\" Mike continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Aww, of course! I remember when Kate turned 15 a few months ago. It was a big deal, she's no longer a girl, but, a young woman. When they say they grow up so fast.\" 'Raymond' paused. \"They ain't kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ain't that the truth.\" Mike agreed. \"And, ugh, just out of curiosity, can I ask you a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Shoot!\" 'Raymond' conformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike took a deep breath in and a deep breath out and proceeded. \"What, exactly, were you and Lynda, <i>my wife</i>, doing in the other room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     'Raymond' could smell the suspicion in Mike's voice, there was a certain aura about him. \"Just talkin'...\" 'Raymond' solemnly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"About what?\" Mike again questioned immediately. This whole scenario was making 'Raymond' just plain uncomfortable. There had to be a way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, Mike!\" 'Raymond' nervously called. \"Want a candy? They're pretty dang good!\" 'Raymond' now desperate to escape the discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure, why not?\" Mike coldly answered, taking a candy from 'Raymond's' hand, leaving 'Raymond' with only two more candies; Two more chances to escape the madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now, back to the topic at hand, what were you and my wife talking about?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     'Raymond' really wanted out of this discomfort. The door was closed, this was Mike's house, Mike's bedroom, Mike's wife. Awkward. \"Just about kids! What all parents our age talk about!\" 'Raymond' then popped a candy into his mouth and sucked on it, slowly, attempting to kill a moment or two that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike followed his lead, and popped the candy in his mouth, savoring it at his own, moderate pace. \"Speaking of kids, have you seen my daughter, Kate?\" 'Raymond' asked, the candy still about his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Let's get back to the subject, Ray.\" Mike demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Who spoke next? </span></div></div>",

She said she'd be here, at your son's party.\" 'Raymond' nervously continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Stay focused, Ray.\" Mike shouted, demanding. All the while, 'Raymond' nervously rambled about Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I just wish that she were here, y'know?\" 'Raymond wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just as Mike was about to protest, infuriatedly, a bright, blinding light spread about the room, covering everything in the room. The wish took place and was filled promptly. Mike would be the victim of this wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike, from his masculine, middle aged man frame shrunk down and got smaller, in height and body mass. By the time the shrinking was done, he resembled a small teen boy, around his son's age. Next, his 'male plumbing' had been done away with completely, being replaced with the reproductive organs of a healthy young, teenage girl. He was now a she.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Her features then became more and more feminine; She lost all the hair about her body, except for her head, where her short brown hair became much longer, around the shoulder blades and notably darker, almost black, but still brown, nonetheless. Her legs and hips became more shapely and slightly more curvaceous. On her legs, the muscle once there diminished almost completely, being replaced by womanly fat, giving her rather attractive thighs. Her feet and hands became more slender. Her eyes closed, and, upon opening them, her blue eyes were now green. Her Adam's Apple faded completely, leaving only the sweet voice of a teen girl. Even her clothes changed, all she wore now was a pair of denim shorts, mid thigh, and a tee-shirt of the high-school Kate and Nate attended. On her feet, only a pair of sneakers and ankle length white socks. Mike was now a copy of Kate Smith. One could hardly tell that the person who now appeared to be Kate Smith, 15 year old girl, was really Mike Wilson, a father, husband and man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     'Raymond,' looked where Mike once was and found his daughter before him. \"Kate! Honey! I'm so glad I found you! I've been looking for you everywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike looked incredibly confused, uncomfortable even. \"Uhm... Raymond? It's me Mike, I don't know what happened, but it's me, I'm in the body of your daughter...\" Mike pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What are you talking about? You're not a man, you're clearly my daughter! Now stop calling me 'Raymond!'\" I'm your Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just as Mike was about to plead some more for his identity, there was that mental struggle again, this time the personalities of Mike and Kate conflicting over control. For whatever reason, Kate had successfully taken over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sorry about that, Dad! I don't know what came over me! I felt like... I was someone else for a minute!\" 'Kate' sweetly asserted, completely unaware of 'her' former status of an adult man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know that feeling, Hon.\" 'Raymond' agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come on,\" 'Kate' started. \"We really should get back down to that party Nate's having.\"</span></div></div>",

First, I wished you were a girl, more specific a 13-yr-old girl with D size cups and downright<br>\r\nbeauty all over. Second, I added the fact that you were a girl with 'bathroom problems', so you had to take stuff to help<br>\r\nempty your system. Third, I added the fact that the way you empty it is by eating a lot of food, and taking 2 whole<br>\r\nboxes of laxatives with about 3 super-powered ones in each box. Lastly, I added the fact that nobody knew you were a boy,<br>\r\nor that you even have this problem except for me. One more thing I didn't add, uh, you won't know when you're going pee or poo..<br>\r\nAlso, I didn't add this either but I heard some guy say it, but uh you use..um... diapers now... for that second addition... heh heh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that last part finished up, you felt yourself changing all over, and froze in place out of shock.<br>\r\nYou felt your boy down there shrink into a girl near the bottom, your pants change to a skirt, and your underwear<br>\r\nchange to..uh..diapers..? You can't tell, it could very well just be very fluffy panties. Besides that,<br>\r\nyour hair grew down to your mid-back and turn dark dark brown, like close-to-black-but-not-quite-black-brown brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd jeez, she really wanted to mess with reality!

You see, I'm your son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad, are you okay?  You seem faint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up gasping in your covers.  <i>That was a weird dream,</i> you think.  You sit up, rubbing the sleep from your eyes, and see that the box of candies is still on your bed with the note still attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite a fall you had there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize the voice but are afraid to turn around.  Instead, you reach into your pocket and feel - just as you feared - thirty dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head slowly and once again see your son Donovan.  \"Big day, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, someone enters your room.  It's your sister, Erin, carrying an omelette.  \"Hey, big brother.  I heard you fainted, which is why you missed breakfast.  Here's to make up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to Donovan.  \"Who are you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan replies, \"I'm a friend from school,\" and winked slyly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she says and went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you ate breakfast, you felt well enough to get out of bed.  However, Donovan blocks your way.  \"Before we go,\" he said, \"we have a few things to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do,\" you reply.  \"First of all, if you're from the future, why come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your friend, Josh Howards.  In the future, a megalomaniac who will go unnamed takes over Missouri.  Josh Howards is a spy who knows that the code that can stop him is in a locked chest in his basement because of the identity of the megalomaniac, but said megalomaniac destroyed the only key.  My mission is to get the young Josh Howards to give the key so I can take it to Josh Howards in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're not in Missouri,\" you complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  I realized I needed help - someone whom I knew would believe who I was - and the obvious answer was either you or my mother, Kate Smith.  You would know I was telling the truth because you would recognize my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's true,</i> you realize, seeing that his face is almost a perfect cross between yours and Kate's.  You also silently cheer that you are eventually going to marry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to be easy, because no doubt the Megalomaniac will know what we're doing and cause obstacles; besides, convincing Howards to give the key won't be easy.  That's why I sent you the candies; I can't use them because I'm displaced in time, but you're still fully intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I need to do what exactly?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since Howards is too rational to believe our story, the only way we can get him to hand over the key is if we give him the only thing in the world he values more than anything: his grandfather's old photo album.  Last I heard, it was somewhere in the Himalayas.  It won't be easy; the candies only get you so far.  We can only take three other people with us, but I'd recommend only taking one, since we may need to pick up more along the way.  Naturally, it'll be Mom - Kate Smith, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you accept your quest?</span></div></div>",

The shock of this shockingly shocking turn of events these past few minutes shocks me so much it's shocking, but I think I've recovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  I recommend heading out immediately.  I don't know how much the Megalomaniac has done to protect his future, but if I'm right, he knows I traveled back here and he's laid traps.

It's a type of plot device.  That's not what matters right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we head out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  First, of course, we'll need to convince Mom to join up with us.

You only have 48 hours because the clock is ticking and the candies will only take to new users during that time period.  You can't mention me - or at least say who I am - because that will jinx the mission.  Literally.

There are three very obvious things wrong with that - that is, if you understand how the candies work.  The first and simplest is that it's the wrong color candy.  Different colors grant different types of wishes.  If you want a romantically-oriented wish, you need to use a pink candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secondly, the candies are often unpredictable.  If you don't word your wish right, it might be granted in a way you didn't expect but which comes natural to the candies.  If you've studied them for as long as I have, you know that the wish you were trying to make, even done on the right candy, would be granted by analyzing your girlfriend and causing Kate Smith to take on characteristics of her.  Since you don't have a girlfriend, there are no characteristics for Mom to take on, so she will simply cease to exist - to become 'nobody', who is presently your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirdly, even if you worded it properly, making wishes which involve the emotions of others is extremely risky.  It wouldn't result in anything resembling emotional stability for any involved parties, and the last thing we need on a desperate quest to save Missouri is emotional instability.  In short, you have to become her girlfriend 'the normal way' - by asking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to divulge in-depth into the inner workings of the candies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you are a master of the candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now need to become your crush's girlfriend 'the normal way'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start your quest the way any hero would - by eating breakfast with your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody questions the quest you casually mention, nor do they doubt the identity of your friend.

You are so flustered you can hardly speak.  So is he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to ask him out, but you're nervous.  You're not quite sure if he's in to you.  Boys aren't usually a mystery to you, but for some reason Nate is.  Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to say, \"Happy birthday!\" but instead say, \"What's that bag of candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate replies, \"It's magic candy that grants wishes if you eat it and make a wish.\"  He says it with a perfectly straight face.  He looks like he's telling the truth, and he is normally a pretty bad liar, but this is rather far-fetched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I try?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he replies, giving you a candy.  \"This one's general purpose, but don't wish for anything too big or it won't work right, and don't do anything too esoteric or it won't work at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say.  You pop it in your mouth and murmur, \"I wish my phone's battery were charged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow it, and immediately you feel a faint vibration near your thigh.  You reach into your pocket and pull out your phone - fully charged, although it had just died a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it works!\" you say in an expression of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does,\" replies Nate.  \"Want another?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now.  Hang, on, do you want to come inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you and Nate are seated comfortably in your living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted - \" he pauses for a moment \" - to show you these candies,\" he finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense something else he was going to say but brush the thought aside as unrelenting optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're pretty cool,\" you say.  \"I'm not sure if I want any more, though.

Suddenly you lose all mobility.  You feel your arms and legs changing shape and a hole opening up in front of your neck.  Your head rescinds down until it is part of your back, and then your vision spreads to your entire self - outside and inside.  You see that you are now hollow and a slick leathery black before Kate Smith completely fills your now seemingly lifeless form.

You need to say dare so as to increase the odds of your plan being successful by a slight amount, but Tommy has given some outlandish dares in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you to drink this entire bottle of Sprite in a minute,\" he says, holding out a bottle of Sprite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you bring that just so you could do that dare?\" asks Nate as you begin to chug furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I did,\" he says proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know she was going to suggest ToD?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually going to suggest it if she didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally finish the bottle of soda, put it down, and release a giant belch.  Erin wrinkles her nose and Tommy giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Nate,\" you say.  \"Truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth,\" says Nate.  \"We've done two dares in a row already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say, pausing slightly before executing your brilliant plan.  \"Who do you have a crush on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses for a full thirty seconds before answering.  \"You,\" he says feebly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately respond.  Before you even know it, you say, \"Will you be my boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems thoroughly taken aback.  Perhaps this was a bad - \"YES!\" he shouts and proceeds to kiss you.  Tommy and Erin simply walk away.  You don't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half minute later, you and Nate finally separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's persepctive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get this party started!\"  you say.</span></div></div>",

You're feeling a high because Kate is now your girlfriend.  Wow.  As in, WOW.  No, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this does have one thing in common with addicting-drug highs; namely, it causes you to do some things you quite frankly shouldn't be doing.  That thing, specifically, is running upstairs, grabbing candies, and running back downstairs to eagerly tell your friends about them.  This probably isn't your best idea ever.  But whatever.  It's now or never, and you're pretty sure the candy jar has like 10,000 candies.  Everyone in your family turned down the offer when you asked if they wanted candy, so you need someone to help share them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, guys,\" you say, \"do you believe in magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've finally explained the general concept of the candies to Tommy and Erin.  You can see their minds churning to process this information.  You can't blame them; it's a lot to take in, even without Donovan and candy colors entering the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin is the first to speak up.  \"Who wants to play Brawl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asks Kate.  \"After all that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After each game,\" she says, \"the winner gets candy.  Is that acceptable, Nate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say.  \"Yes, it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make it more interesting,\" interjects Tommy.  \"How about we do a tournament and the winner gets a whole bunch of candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" you say, \"but we shouldn't do a normal bracket, because the pairings can bias the match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just do a bunch of high-stock free-for-alls,\" suggests Kate, \"and when someone loses, they're out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you get an idea.  \"What if we combined those ideas?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain,\" says Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after every match, the winner gets a candy - orange - and the loser gets to be on the receiving end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" reply the other three, eagerly and yet tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first match goes well for you.  Erin is eliminated first, through a combination of repeated stage-caused self-destructs and pok\u00e9balls.   It was close, but you managed to throw Tommy out of the stage.  It's just you and Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on equal footing.  She picks up an assist trophy and finds to her dismay the Nintendog.  You use the distraction to unleash a smash on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026an explosive crate.  You are blasted off the stage - but no!  You manage to recover.  She tries to stop you and accidentally self-destructs in the process.  You have won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Erin.  <i>What now?</i> you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to worry about wording; the candies can determine the intended \"victim\" from context, and wishing for an object isn't easy to get wrong.  The only question is what that object will be.</span></div></div>",

In order to do so, he brought his father - whom he knew to be the megalomaniac, in the future, but also must have known to be morally reliable in the past - magical candies that grant wishes.

And as soon as he sees you, he takes his hat off, tips it once, and bows formally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is unusual.  But what is even more unusual is: <i>WHAT IS HE DOING IN YOUR ROOM?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freak out, springing off the bed like a scalded chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?\" You demand, eyes bulging out from your sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely sidesteps the question.  \"<i>Candies of Chance</i>, at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think '<i>Candies of Change</i>' is his name, but it occurs to you that there is no way anyone's parents would be in the right mind to name their kid that.  But... Well, looking at that guys fancy costume, you begin to wonder if there's such a word as 'impossible'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo- though your cold sweat is cascading off you like a waterfall-, you still boldly ask, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Candies of Change</i> is a Candy company,\" He finally explains.  \"I take you received your... order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the jar of candies downstairs and you nod wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" The man replies.  \"I've done my job, I better be off, finishing my deliveries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're definitely not letting him get away with so soddy an explanation.  \"I didn't order those candy,\" you tell him sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it must be a gift,\" he says as a matter-of-factly.  \"We don't give away free candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink.  \"Who ordered for my gift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it labelled who it was from?\" The man abruptly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you recall.  \"Nothing at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shrugs.  \"Then the sender didn't intend for you to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth indignantly, but nothing comes out.  This is ridiculous!  An anonymous magical gift? What next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, something stranger is happening.  The man takes a single candy out of his crazily coloured pocket.  The candy is bright yellow - and it reminds you of those in the jar below.  It does not look anywhere near normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees you staring at him stupidly, and smiles.  \"Teleportation candies,\" he explains.  \"I deliver candy orders.  To humans, witches, demons, anyone.  We don't discriminate.  Very useful for sifting through worlds, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops even more and hits the ground.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try out your own candies,\" he advises.  \"They are just as interesting.  But remember to read the words on the sweet wrapper.  Different coloured candies are for different uses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just gape as he pops the 'so-called' magical candy in his mouth and sucks it merrily.  \"I wish to teleport to <i>Faerieland</i>!\" He yells happily, before winking mischievously at you. You think it is some sort of prank, but before you can shift an eyelash, he is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust... Gone.  There is no trace of him <i>at all</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the piece of space where he used to be for a long time, before something strikes you.  Shouldn't you be testing out the sweets?

The ball of light came out of the new girls mouth again and enlightened all the room, which now changed to become a typical room for a 15 year old girl!<br>\r\nLast thing was clothing Nate was currently wearing: His T-shirt became a female cut top and his pants were now also very tight girl cut trousers, showing her new great female curves!<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Erin, what have you done!\u201d the girl shouted in a female voice to her sister\u2026<br>\r\nErin wanted to explain and also tell her new sister, that her brother is now her sister, is making Erin very happy\u2026<br>\r\nNate wanted to start a fighting conversation as they were interrupted by mom calling:<br>\r\n\u201cErin, Natalie, can you please come down for dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe called me Natalie!\u201d stated former Nate and Erin responded smiling: \u201dYes I think this is your name now that you are a girl!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then she stared down at the rest of herself.<br>\r\n2 painfully obvious lumps making out her generously ample bosom stared back at her, along with a slender waist and beautiful hairless legs beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill being the practical and calm individual Nate were, Natalie jumped off her bed to see herself in the full-length mirror of the now feminized room for a full confirmation of her gender-switch. <br>\r\nA pretty, taller and older version of Erin stared back. The face however was a combination of Nate and Erin. Strangers would without question assume her as Erin's older Sister! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was extremely uncomfortable in her female clothing and the way it emphasized her curves to the world. She wasn't ecstatic about the change in colour-scheme to her room as well. She then, suddenly stood rock-stiff as if remembering something awfully important.<br>\r\nHer hand trembled as it hesitently reached from her lower front to her crotch. Natalie's face turned green as her hand gently felt the now inverted emptyness of where her manhood once stood, confirming without a doubt she was female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie turned angrily back to Erin. \"You had something-\" still perturbed about her new higher, melodious voice, Natalie's hand went to cover her mouth, brushing her new puffed lips. \"You had something to do with this!\" she accused at Erin who was now smiling ear from ear.<br>\r\nErin tried to get in a word that she was just happy that Nate could now be her sister \"Dammit Erin! What did you do? Why did you do this?!\" Erin feebly again tried to explain how badly she just wanted a sister but Natalie cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was those candies!\" she said remembering and pulling out the 30 dollars which for some reason, were still there in the pocket of her now slender-cut jeans. \" They were supernatural after all! Where are they?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin realising she had brought the sweet-container with her when she ran after the light wisp, tried to hide them behind her back, as she still held them in her hands. Natalie being sharp saw this immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give them back! Change me back now!\" said Natalie rushing over to her.\"Why would you do this to me? Was I not a good enough brother, heh?!!\" Natalie tried to force them from Erin, who vainly tried to keep the container out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was now in tears and blurted \"I just wanted an older sister who would listen and talk to me!\"  Seeing the tears of Erin stopped Natalie in  her tracks. \"Please. Just for one night?\" she said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin! Natalie! Please come down! The food's getting cold!\" yelled their mother from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want this, don't you?\" asked Natalie quietly at her sniffing sister, never wishing her sadness.<br>\r\n\"Please! I promise all we have to do is talk. And you know... maybe a one night sister-slumberpary?\" she asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie hanged her head and sighed. \"One night. One\" she stated, holding one finger in front of her forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin - now overjoyed - grabbed Natalie by the hand and rushed with her downstairs to dinner. There, Natalie became extremely self-concious of wearing girl's clothes and hesitated before entering the kitchen, but Erin pulled her along forcefully with far more  enthuasiasm than Natalie would have liked.<br>\r\nBut, as luck would have it none paid her the slightest of attention. Besides Lynda( their mother) who scolded them both for being late of course.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natalie was starting to have serious regrets about agreeing to be Erin's Older sister, as dinner turned to be a slow mental torture.<br>\r\nShe quickly learned of some key differences between girls and boys, all of them to her displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst and foremost: breasts! They were endlessly more fun to look at than to have. Natalie's amply endowed bosom only emphasized this. The fatty sacks were lively and bounched and jiggled at the gentlest of movements. Worse still: they were quite sensitive. And not in a good way.<br>\r\nThe pert orbs of flesh on her chest, persistently reminded her of their existence, the slightest movement not only setting them wobbling, but could clearly be felt. Whenever she so much as brushed her arm against her breast to bring a spoon to her mouth, it registered the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir sensitivity wasn't painful or irritating, but brought an uncomfortable sense of awareness to Natalie, the likes of which Nate had never experienced before with any body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still yet, her long hair: It took Natalie all of her patience not to accidentally dip them in her food.<br>\r\nNate always shaved his head cleanly. Military style. He firmly believed that if you had to comb it, your hair was too long. Now as Natalie, even the pink alice-band on her head could do little to keep her beautiful sleek black hair out of her face. It wasn't helped that it reached all the way to the small of her back.<br>\r\nNatalie was starting to understand the significance of the gesture where girls brushed their hair back to hook them behind their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made Nate truly uncomfortable as a girl, was the realisation that his female form was significantly shorter and weaker. She thought grim thoughts as she felt weak and vulnerable.<br>\r\nFor example: she couldn't reach the top shelf anymore. When asked to pass on the salad-bowl, she had to stand up to reach it, and use both arms to lift it. Nate could have done so sitting and with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Natalie recovered and adapted quickly. What truly became an exercise in annoyance was Lynda, her mother, who frequently berated her throughout dinner for \"having boyish manners unbefitting of a lady\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would say things like: \"Cross your legs or keep your knees together when you sit Natalie! I know you like wearing jeans, but still!\"<br>\r\nor<br>\r\n\"Small bites Natalie! Small bites! The food's not going anywhere. Girl's take only small pecks at a time, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor eventually<br>\r\n\"Honestly! You can be such a tomboy! I know you like things like camping and hiking instead of going to the mall, but ..\"<br>\r\nWell at least her hobbies were the same thought Natalie optimistically.<br>\r\n\"But you should act like a lady indoors! You don't want to scare away any potential boys, no do we?\" she said with a wink to Natalie who replied shivering and with disgusted sarcasm: \"No, we certainly don't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry ma.\" said Nicole (your 11-year-old younger sister, sitting next to Erin) giggling from the side. \"Natalie's already sitting in a tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is news to me.\" said Lynda smiling. Yeah, me too! thought Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Nicole extracted a purple piece of crumpled paper. It appeared to be a love letter. Nicole stared evilly at Natalie, filled with glee at exposing a love scandal. But Natalie just stared back, sincerely ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Natalie...\" began Nicole ensuring she had the tables undivided attention before continuing. \"From Tommy Iverson!\" and then Nicole let out a long romantic sigh, before reading the remaining contents of the love letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandemonium broke out around the table as all the girls coo'd with delight. Natalie ignored them all. The handwriting was definitely Tommy's; Nate's best fiend since kindergarden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWAIT WHAT?! Tommy Iverson?? Now that's just bloody grand, thought Natalie bitterly. Her best friend was now her boyfriend in this reality, apparently. Now that just sucks. Natalie didn't want to face him as anything but her male self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Natalie had enough. To hell with being Erin's sister.<br>\r\nShe excused herself and was about to stalk back to her room, where the magic candies were, when Nicole and Erin followed suit and intercepted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisinterpreting Natalie's frustrations for anger Nicole said:\"Here! I was only joking!\" handing the purple paper back, anxious to make amends. \"You didn't need to stalk off like that. I was only having some fun.\"<br>\r\nNatalie smiled. \"I'm not angry with you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well...good night then\" relieved, Nicole walked off to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate. Can I say something.\"<br>\r\nNatalie turned to Erin, almost surprised to here someone speak her male name. She saw Erin holding the candy container in her right hand! She must have brought it downstairs earlier. Had she anticipated Nate's intent to go back upstairs? <br>\r\nErin was looking at Natalie with an  intensity that was almost eery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natalie decided that guile wasn't the best course of action and directly asked Erin to change her back: \"Look, Erin, I've had enough. Please wish me-\"<br>\r\n\"I said: Nate, can I SAY something.\" came back the retorted, interrupting reply from his sister who looked angry. Once again she stared at him with an eery intensity, and Natalie hoped they didn't hold any trickery in them.<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked wary and on his guard, fearing she might do something with the candy that would leave Natalie regretting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's next action took Natalie completely by surprise. She walked up to him and hugged him, his now slender waistline making it possible for Erin to encircled him with her short, petite arms. \"Thank you.\" she said, which threw Natalie even farther of balance.<br>\r\n\"For what?\" came Natalie's confused reply.<br>\r\n\"For being my older sis, even if briefly.\"<br>\r\nYou chuckled sadly: \"You realise I just came back to change myself back, right? I don't deserve your thanks.\"<br>\r\nShe looked up into your face:\"I know. I saw you squirm during dinner. Could see you didn't like it.\" she then untangled from you and held held the container before her.\"Here. I won't stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked at the doe-eyed Erin even more warily: \"But?\"<br>\r\n\"But please, PLEASE. I'm begging you. Just this one night! You said you would! I promise, promise, promise tomorrow we'll turn you back.\"<br>\r\nNatalie held her face in her arms and groaned. She looked through her fingers to see Erin smile sweetly and then pout in a most adorable begging fashion.\"Fine, FINE. Alright already! But I'm holding this to you. ONE NIGHT! Only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin almost went ballistic. Now with the assurance of Natalie being her sister, she simply radiated glee. In the same abrupt fashion they had came downstairs, Erin pulled Natalie upstairs. The words of \"sister-slumper-party\" echoed all the way to her room.<br>\r\nNatalie just smiled thinly. She hadn't succumbed to Erin's request because of her cute begging. Instead she knew she would never have heard the end of it, and also she sensed a genuine longing in Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have homework for tomorrow?\" asked Natalie. Today was Thursday, and the next day was still a schoolday before the weekend. Natalie had finished her work early, which was why Erin had found her asleep earlier before the transformation.<br>\r\n\"Already done!\" shouted Erin as they sprinted to her room. Natalie expected Erin was lying, but knew better that nothing aside from the apocalypse would stop Erin from having her way with Natalie tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Erin's room, they pulled down a spare mattress from the closet and set it next to Erin's bed and then settled Erin's mattress next to Natalie's on the ground. Their mother (Lynda) gladly giving them a helping hand. Erin told Natalie to go grab her pajama's and clothes she might need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time Natalie surveyed her feminized room. Everything from Nate's old life was still there: his extensively customized and overclocked computer and all the endless videogame's he had played lying in a tower next to it. His hiking boots and camping equipment. Even his pet tarantula in a glass box on the table next to the window. It brought a moment of comfort to Natalie, knowing she hadn't lost her identity, a fate she considered worse than death. But what really ticked her off was the obsession with the pink colour-scheme. Her walls, the duvet, even her hiking boots now with its pink lacings. Whoever had made the candies had a moronic sense of humour. She doubted any single girl besides herself inside this town had such an absolutely steriotypically girly coloured room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natalie went over to her clothes closet and opened it she cringed. An impressive array of clothes covering the entire spectrum of womanhood lay neatly folded and hanging from hangers before her. Jeans, shirts, jackets and the usual. But along with that came skirts, blouses, dresses and most intimidatingly: panties and bra's. Natalie was grateful her tidy nature with clothes had trancended to her girl life as well. She picked up her teddy and the least girly jean and shirt she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was careful(or perhaps irrational) not to touch any of the bras or panties, as if they might contaminate her, despite fact that she was already wearing a matching pair. Taking her sheets with her, she went Erin's room to make up her bed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if Erin wanted to make up for 13 years worth of girl-gossip. She just couldn't shut up. She talked incessantly, without break. Natalie couldn't have gotten a word in if she tried. But Natalie didn't care. As Nate, she was always a quiet person and an excellent listener, never saying anything unless it was truly worth mentioning. Besides, it would appear that Erin was finally having her wish come true. She had an older sister to talk to. <br>\r\nShe seemed truly happy, so Natalie just laid there next to her on their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Erin would caress Natalie's hair, folding ponytails and flexing braids. She even after, great effort, managed to convince Natalie to have a make-up session with her. After resisting initially, Natalie found it quite enjoyable and even relaxing having her sensitive female face caressed by the soft brushes and liners. Lipstick, powder, eyeshadow, eyelines, and various other junk mentioned that Natalie couldn't even remember, later; Natalie was allowed to see her own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful, cute teenage girl stared back. Natalie was astonished at the extreme effects the make-up had on accenting her female features and most especially her eyes. The pink pouty lips matching perfectly with the alice-band that bounded several snaking braids running down her back. The eyes were gorgeous without dispute. This girl staring back couldn't possibly be Natalie, it was almost harder to accept than when Nate had been transformed to Natalie and saw herself for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie felt aroused by her own reflection, but quickly squashed the thought. The irony wasn't lost on her. That she was now the spitting image of HIS own dreamgirl. That she wouldn't be with her dreamgirl, but would be her entirely.<br>\r\n\"It's OK for a girl to sometimes fall in love with herself.\" whispered Erin from the side, reading Natalie like a book and smiling proudly<br>\r\nthat her make-up skills had such a profound effect on her sister/brother, much to Natalie's displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night ended when Lynda called them both to sleep, saying that it was getting late, and that tomorrow was school. Erin reluctantly relented. Now came the part that Natalie dreaded the most: undressing herself. She had decided she would be quick, ripping off only her shirt, socks and jeans and pulling her teddy over herself. She wasn't comfortable with the sight of herself naked at all.<br>\r\nErin looked at her expectantly, knowing exactly what she was thinking.<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Erin?\"<br>\r\n\"We're both girls.\"<br>\r\n\"Erin!!\"<br>\r\n\"Touchy, touchy.\" giggled Erin at Natalie's obvious embarresment, but still turned around to give Natalie her privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping and redressing at reccord speed, Natalie had decided to eject her bra entirely, its plastic straps having rubbed her shoulders when she had laid next to Erin earlier, and kept only her panties beneath her teddy.<br>\r\nThe touch of silk from the teddy carressing her open nipples brought blood to her face, making her blush red-lead fire. <br>\r\nNatalie jumped into bed, hoping Erin didn't see her face; which, along with being covered with pretty freckles around the nose region, was also paler than Nate's face, and showed blushed very prominently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Erin.\" Natalie ventured.<br>\r\n\"Good-night, tomato-head.\" came back the mirthful reply to which Natalie snorted.<br>\r\nBut Natalie quickly forgot as later, she could feel her hand grasped by Erin who held it tightly and lovingly as she snored snoozely next to Natalie who only smiled thinly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin woke up first. But it wasn't a graceful awakening. Being a bad morning person and habitually sleeping for 9-hour sessions, she was understandably tired, since she and Natalie had only gone gone to bed at 11:30 and now had to wake up at 6 to prepare for school. Her eyelids felt as if glued with tar; she rubbed the edges of them to get rid of the sleeping-sand which had crytalized around her tear glands. Half-walking, half-crawling, she managed to get herself to face the mirror on her cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a mess. Hair diverged into all directions as if hit by a hurricane. The make-up from last nights folly spread around, out of place. The typical image of a heavily overslept girl. She took comfort in that Natalie appeared every bit as bad as she did, if not worse.<br>\r\nNatalie looked ridiculous and as unladylike as could be imagined. Sleek silky black hair in her face, mouth, nose and generally mixed all around her shoulders and arms; like a boa-constrictor coiled around its prey. Since Natalie's hair reached all the way to the small of her back and was about 3 times the length of Erin's, it was only to be expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the scene of ridicule didn't end there, oh no. For Natalie lay in a most peculiar fashion: her rump pointed skywards, as she lay prostrated on her stomach, her knees and the side of her face serving as the legs of her tripod-position. And bandaged around her lower half was her sheets, rapped around 3 times, as if the bed had tried to eat her. Erin stifled a laugh, it was a funny sight indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was aware that Nate was a very dynamic sleeper and would often role over and change position whilst in sub-conscious mind, ruining the sheets of his bed. But the sight as Natalie was infinitely more precious and called the right of several snapshots from Erin's cellphone camera. Her smile quickly faded into sadness as she realised this would be the last she would see of her older sis.<br>\r\nLast night was undisputably the happiest Erin had experienced, but now all things had to come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe intended to make full on her promise to turn Natalie back into Nate after one night, and so reached for the Magical candy container to unmake her wish. Only it wasn't there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't where she had left it earlier, directly on her cabinet next to her closet. Erin remembered that her mother always, cleared away cutlery and food from the kids's rooms early in the morning. Maybe she had taken the container?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin wasn't given the chance to ponder this as she heard a long gasp behind her, as if someone had broken the waterline after a deep dive and desperately sucked up air. It was Natalie waking up. It wasn't surprising she had gasped; her own hair strangling her face, smothering the airflow. She tried to stand up drunkenly, struggling to untangle herself from her hair and the linen interwined with her legs. Erin dreaded to face Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was one of those uncanny individuals who, when they woke up, woke up instantly. Not like Erin who had to rouse herself over the course of 10 minutes before she could function as a sentient being. No. He woke up fully aware of his surroundings, and could start writing a difficult exam - requiring intense concentration - straight out of bed. The same appeared to apply to Natalie.<br>\r\n\"Phew! That wasn't my best night.\" she said cheerfully.\"Luckily it will definitely be my last with this damned hair.\"<br>\r\n\"Err...it would have been your last.\" said Erin scared.<br>\r\n'Would have?? Whadoya mean WOULD have?\" came back the retort.<br>\r\n\"I can't find the container.\"<br>\r\nNatalie just stared at Erin speechless.<br>\r\n\"I think ma might have taken it this morning. I was about to go ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Natalie grabbed Erin by the wrist and charged downstairs to the kitchen to where their mother was undoubtedly busy with her morning ritual of preparing breakfast. Like greased lightning, she sprinted downstairs at almost literal break-neck speed as Erin felt her head snap backwards whilst she was towed like a ragdoll behind the desperate Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MA!!\"<br>\r\nLynda( their mother) looked at the two sisters whom had burst into the kitchen still wearing their teddies, looking as if they had just emerged from a drugged sleep: \"Oh, good morning you two. How-.\"<br>\r\n\"Ma! Did you take a cylindrical container from Erin's room this morning?\" interrupted Natalie.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, dear?\" asked Lynda, taken aback by her daughters manner.<br>\r\n\"There was cylindrical box of sweets on the cabinet.\" added Erin helpfully.<br>\r\n\"Oh that. It was full of ants. I thought it best to throw it away into the garbage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood drained from Natalie's face, leaving her resembling virgin snow: \"You did wha-?\" she chocked.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Ma?\" asked Erin, concerned for Natalie's sake.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I remember because the garbage truck arrived to take the trash cans away right after I emptied the bins.\"<br>\r\nShit! Now the candy container was completely out of their hands!<br>\r\nNatalie felt like fainting, her knees weakened, forcing her to grab hold of the fridge to steady herself.<br>\r\n\"You O.K. Natalie dear? You look pale.\" asked Lynda, completely unaware of Natalie's sudden distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to salvage the situation Erin asked:\"Ma, are you absolutely sure you threw out all of the sweets? Didn't you maybe save at least one?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm sure! Trust me, you wouldn't want to those things in your mouth, they were swarmed with bugs! Don't worry, I'll buy you a replacement this afternoon.\"<br>\r\nNatalie wanted to say that nothing, not even radiation-contamination or sewage rats would have deterred her from eating just one of those damned sweets, but she was simply too dumbfounded to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so interested by those sweets, Natalie?\" asked Lynda puzzled. Then as if she had a lightbulb switched on over her head: \"Oh I know, was it mayhaps the party present of a friend who happened to be a boy?\" she asked batting her eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, yep that, was definitely the wrong thing to say. Now it was Natalie's turn to go ballistic. Already faced with the unsavoury possibility of remaining a girl permanently - a fate Natalie found horrifying - she was now pushed over the edge of panic by her mothers retarded boyfriend remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned tails and run back upstairs; Erin followed suite, leaving Lynda confused who just shrugged: \"Ah, young love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran back upstairs, for who knows what reason, Erin heard her older sis swear in a language most unbefitting for a young girl. <br>\r\nErin was now very unhappy. She wasn't fooled last night by Natalie's participation in the slumber-party; she knew Natalie had disliked it very bit as much as Erin had enjoyed it. That Natalie was unhappy as a girl. Now having Natalie in a state of distress due to Erin, made her even more so unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin found Natalie staring at herself in her room's full-length mirror, rock-still. Turning they both stared at one another in silence.<br>\r\nErin cringed, expecting Natalie's wrath for her predicament. She almost wished Natalie would just accuse her for being responsible for Natalie being stuck as a girl instead of giving her this eery silent treatment.<br>\r\nInstead, Natalie just crumpled onto the floor and started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stared in fascination at her sobbing sister, for she had never in her memory saw Nate cry.</span></div></div>",

Erin was torn between the joy of having an older sister permanently and seeing Natalie suffer. Erin just stood respectfully, silently, not saying anything. Anything she said would be fruitless anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Natalie's weeping subsided and she looked up: \"I don't want to be a girl.\" she stated simply.<br>\r\nAt that precise moment Nicole walked past, she was clad in a school uniform, she had a piece of toast in her mouth freeing her hands  to pull on her jacket and rugsack: \"Yes Natalie, we know!\" she said disdainfully surprising Natalie and Erin with her out of the blue remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" asked Erin and Natalie, misunderstanding, thinking she was referring to Natalie's transformation when she in fact was referring to Natalie's masculine demeanor she had in this altered reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You've made that point whenever we've tried to drag you to the mall and-\" she stopped midsentence, seeing Natalie's tears: \"What's all this then? Now I've seen everything! Natalie crying? That must definitely be a first!\" she turned to Erin \"So, what on earth did you do to make her leak? Beat her with a crowbar? That must have been it. I didn't think our tomboy-sister had tearglands the way she beat the bush with the boys. You definitely couldn't have insulted her. Natalie doesn't have emotions; she's colder than the fridge. Out with it, Erin. What'd ya do?\" Erin looked very uncomfortable under Nicole's interrogation. The fact that she was being accused of being the cause of Natalie's sorrow hit very close to home the fact that she was the reason Natalie was stuck being female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like the good old older sis, Natalie came to her rescue: \"Get lost, Nicole! Erin's not at fault here.\" Erin smiled gratefully at Natalie.<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that so? What ya gonna do to make me, crybaby? Set your little old spider on me?\" Now the crybaby remark pissed Natalie off, drying her tears instantly. Nicole was a good sort and could be called for in trouble, but she could also be a monumental pain in both neck and arse simultaniously. She had a very sharp mind and tongue, and was mature far beyond her 11-years. She always knew when to push the right buttons to annoy to the utmost, much like she was doing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might just consider letting Old Stan loose, while you sleep, Nicole.\" threatened Natalie. They were referring to the pet tarantula Natalie kept in a glass box in her room. Nate had called it Old Stan. It was enormous and had a leg span of 17 centimeters, truly not a sight for the faint of heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had held a fascination with insects and arachnids and old Stan had caused a great deal consternation and arguments with his mother Lynda, whom refused to have such a disgusting creature under the roof of her house; Nate would usually counter that lots of insects lived IN her roof anyway. Eventually a truce had been agreed upon: Nate could keep his gargantuan spider,as long as it never left its glass cage. He ignored the rule as often as he could of course, allowing Old Stan to walk across his room and on himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate loved small creatures. He was a naturalist at heart. Where others would scream in irrational terror at bugs a 1000 times smaller than them and then proceed to grab the nearest fabled shoe to crush the hapless insect, Nate differed. He admired insects and there biological adaptions. He would willingly touch, hold and allow scaly, slimy and hairy creatures and allow them to walk all over him. His favorite prank in life was to settle Old Stan on his back and see how long it took friends to find their petrified voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" said Nicole in mock terror. \"You wouldn't do that t your own sister, would you? Ma said she'd throw that...thing out of the house if it got out of its box. Your welcome by the way.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, for what?\" asked Nate bemused with Nicole's never wavering impudence.<br>\r\n\"For cheering ya up. Oh, and I'd advise you 2 to get yar tail-ends in high gear. We leave in 30 minutes for school.\" And with that Nicole left, wolfing down the toast in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Erin and Natalie realized that Natalie had stopped crying from Nicole's mockery. Again they just stared at one another.<br>\r\nErin suddenly blurted: \"Being a girl c-can be lots of fun! J-just try it for today. I'll help you. Please, for me? I know I can't ask you, but I really still want you as my sister.\"<br>\r\nNatalie sat down on her bed and sighed, wiping the tear-tracks from her face.<br>\r\nHer ever cynical thin smile appearing on her face: \"I am still Nate, and I always will be. I refuse to be anything else.\"<br>\r\n\"But, you'll be my sister too, won't you?\" asked Erin <br>\r\n&lt;Sigh&gt;\"Yes, Erin. I'll be your sister too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then\" said Erin gently. \"We kinda need to move. We need to get ready for school.\"<br>\r\n\"Why, we still have half an hour, plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n\"No Nate.\"Erin shook her head sadly, she used Natalie's male name deliberately. \"Girls take longer, we need to hurry a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin went to Natalie's closet, took out her school uniform and laid it out gently on her bed: \"Grab a towel get a quick shower, I'll join you in a bit.\"<br>\r\n\"W-what?!\" gasped Natalie, unprepared to see herself completely naked for the first time since her transformation: \"Can't we just get dressed?\"<br>\r\n\"You...we, stink Natalie.\" said Erin gently. \"You need to wash.\"<br>\r\nNatalie knew Erin was right and that she would have to face her own nudity, eventually. But she still begrudgingly took a towel and went to the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom alone she looked at her own reflection again, then with great deliberation and hesitation, she undressed. First the teddy, then panties. As if experiencing the shock of her transformation all over again, Natalie stared at herself with bewilderment.<br>\r\nHer nude form was spectacular. Natalie stared at her own DD-sized rack for the first time in awe. They were insanely huge on her small, lithe, slender frame. Like twin tomahawk-cruise missiles being ejected from their pods, they stood pert and proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was quite fascinated by her nipples; for they differed greatly from her male ones. The areolas were larger, spread across like medallions; the nipples jutted outwards from their centers like screws. She lifted her breasts gently for the first time in order to feel their weight, the balloons of fat filling out her hands, and found they weighted a fair amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext her gaze traveled downwards: her agile waistline, now visible without clothing, pinched her midriff into an exquisite hourglass figure. The worst sight: her crotch. Her nether lips lying below a triangular patch of black pubic hair.<br>\r\nNatalie felt ashamed to looking at the naked form of this girl, as if she was violating her privacy; she knew she was irrational, that the girl in the mirror was herself, yet still.<br>\r\nSo Natalie sighed deeply. She had sighed a lot from her ordeal, but this was a sigh of resignation. Natalie was a girl now. Get used to it Nate, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie remembered to place a shower-cap over her head as Erin had instructed, not an easy task thanks to the long snaking strands of hair. Taking a breath she entered the shower. <br>\r\nNatalie discovered 2 things about showering as a girl very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst: her breasts were sensitive as hell under the falling droplets. It was a necessity to keep at least one hand covering them at all time, her nipples proving to be especially responsive to the falling water, almost to the point of being painful. Natalie realized that the hollywood image of a girl standing in the shower with her arms held against her chest wasn't merely a sexy pose but a defensive  gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond and to her supreme horror: her nether lips were NOT waterproof. Where normal teenage girls had the advantage of having had a good many years of experience to become accustomed to their growing body and the alien sensations that were brought with the entrance to puberty, Natalie had no such privilege. The consequence being that as she felt the warm water running down her, caressing her newly sensitive female skin, she was aroused far quicker than she could react, never having experienced showering as a girl before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lovely water fell on her, it ran down her tiny neck, over and between her breasts, down her back and between her thighs. Like being stroked by a feather all over.<br>\r\nHer sizable breasts grew ramrod firm beneath her hands and the inside of her womanhood felt like a burning coal had been placed in there.<br>\r\nFinally, when the water seeped through, into her labia, brushing the sensitive folds, Natalie gasped in pleasure. Less than 2 minutes into the shower Natalie was paralyzed as she felt waves of joy explode through her, and experienced her first orgasm as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie bowed her head, her face burning like molten magma. She was in complete, total, utter, absolute shame.This was horrible! How could she do something like this? She felt like a mockery to all womankind. Washing as quickly as her shivering body would allow in her sensual afterglow, she got out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking and struggling to get her towel around herself when she heard Erin enter: \"Oh my!\" she said, clear that she recognized Natalie's shaking not to have been caused by cold. \"Look's like you didn't need my help to have fun as a girl.\"<br>\r\nFlustered and distraught she meekly answered: \" I-It's not l-like t-that!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I won't tell anyone.\" she said, as if like a knowing mother to a daughter caught out.<br>\r\nNatalie buried her face in her hands; this was a bloody fine start for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...Natalie, you need to cover your chest as well, now.\" Erin pointed at Natalie who'd instinctively only surrounded her lower half with her towel.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin watched with a mixture of bemusement and jealosy as her sister Natalie struggled, red-faced in embarrassment, with her towel.<br>\r\nShe was partially bemused because seeing a girl at Natalie's grown age, fumbling up something so fundamentally basic as trying to put a towel properly around herself, was quite a funny sight indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was also a bit jealous, because, although given that the towel Natalie was trying to use to cover herself was smallish, she was mainly failing to do so because of her plentiful...assets. Each time Natalie had pulled the towel over her large jutting chests, her lower midriff was exposed. And each time she tried to cover her lower half, she once again exposed her breasts. It was a scene straight from a 1980 sitcom comedy. Erin could not help but wish that she also had to struggle to keep her bosom covered in the morning, but quickly shook her head to dismiss such shallow thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a laugh she said kindly: \"Stop, stop, stop! Here, let me.\" She took a larger tower from the rack and told Natalie to hold her arms up; then she gave Natalie a quick crash-course on how to fold the towel across both her upper chest and lower abdomen simultaneously, demonstrating where to hold and where to fold. Natalie smiled gratefully back. But her smile was weak, hiding misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin regretted her stupid comment earlier about Natalie's....well shakes. Nate was upstanding, not prone to perversions. Erin doubted Natalie to be any different. The last thing she needed was to antagonize Natalie any farther about her sexuality, if she had any hope to keep her as her willing older sister: \"Sorry about what I said. That was insensitive of me.\"<br>\r\n\"Just leave it...\" Natalie mumbled, hurrying back to her room.<br>\r\nErin grabbed her arm: \"Hey! It's alright. This shows you really are human! I didn't think Nate was alive, now I know Natalie is.\" Natalie glared at her, but just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her room Natalie tried to dry herself off, using the minimal amount of movement and rubbing so as not to accidentily stimulate herself again as in the shower, still dreading the sudden orgasm she had uncontrollably experienced. It proved to be a forlornly, vain effort, for her skin was soft from the warm water and her towel was even softer. She was already shivering, when she had dried off her lithe back, and when she had to run it through to dry her drippingly wet inner thighs and all the female equipment that was situated there she was breathing heavily, raggedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew there was no escaping it, that her dripingly wet chest and canyon could not be ignored before she started dressing. So mustering the fortitude, she rubbed them also. Unfortunately for the poor Natalie, just as she was unaccustomed to the unknown pleasurable sensations that normal girls were used to by now of her earlier shower, so too did she drown in ecstacy, a sqeaky moan escaping her mouth, in very short order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie fumed at her inabilty to put a stopper to this horrid sensitivity of hers, and bellied a flurry of colourful curses, which had they been able to put into crayons could have covered the entire spectrum of the rainbow. Natalie breathed and calmed down. What got to her most was that she had enjoyed it emmensely and wanted to do it again gladly...No! Shut up! Shut up!. She cringed at the thought she just had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally! To just get dressed. Natalie looked at her clothes lying on her bed. She was not just a bit intimidated by the girl's school uniform lying in front of her, she was completely clueless as how to proceed from here. Yes, she had undressed last night, and yes she had pulled over a teddy, but here? There were so many more pieces of clothing lying carefully packed on her bed, more than there would have been when she was male and all of it completely alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to just start with the underwear to get some modesty and cross the many bridges when she came there later. First a pair of plain neutral white cotton panties. As Natalie slipped on the garment, she was surprised at how comfortable and snug it clung to her. But she was annoyed at how the silky inside stroked the open skin of her womanhood folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the fabled bra. Oh great. Natalie had hoped to avoid this one, but even the short walk from the shower had showed her it it was necessary if she didn't want her bosoms to flop all over school. But she was less than pleased to see that Erin had picked a particular girly choice. It was pink with frills and laces and had a mini bow-string in front. Natalie never understood the meaning of those stupid bows. She went back to her closet, rummaged and found a bra better to her taste, black and unobnixious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erin entered her room, and she was fully dressed and prepared. How the hell did she get done that quickly? She showered after Natalie! Erin wore the school uniform of their town highschool. Navy-blue plaid skirt and overjacket, with a white buttoned short sleeved shirt beneath. A green-blue mini-tie hung around her collar and her grey-green knee length fine socks crawled up her legs from her slightly hooved crop black school shoes. Her brunett hair fixed into the regulation pony-tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at Natalie in surprise: \"Aren't you done yet?\" Natalie shook her head. But Erin grinned in glee; this was perfect, she got to dress and prep her own older sister for her first day at school. Is this how mothers felt when they got their toddlers ready? She knew she shouldn't treat her sister as a doll, but hey, she needed to get dressed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Natalie, you may not want to wear that just the first day.\" she said pointing to the thinly strapped black plastic bra Natalie held awkwardly in her hands. Natalie pointed to the pink one on her bed with disdain: \"I'm not wearing THAT!\"<br>\r\nErin smiled understandingly: \"Look.\" she said gently. \"Wearing bra's sucks. Let no other girl tell you otherwise. If this is truly going to be your first day, then your going to get uncomfortable quick. You'll want things as soft and compfy as possible. Your bigger than me, and I'll tell you I get rubbed. You don't want the friction.\" she held up the pink one. Natalie looked at it tiredly, but knew her sister was right, last night at dinner had shown her just how uncomfortable wearing a bra could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly there was a snag; she couldn't get it on. Natalie struggled and fumbled for a full minute, but got no progress, she didn't know how to use the wires or hooks. She looked over at Erin whom was pretending not to notice, whist she was staring off into space, whistling and swaying to and fro. It was clear she was waiting for Natalie to beg for asitance.<br>\r\nNatalie sighed and smiled thinly in resignation: \"Erin. I need help.\" Like getting an electric shock Erin was over at Natalie's side in a split-second, a wide grin covering ear to ear. Clearly she got her kicks from showing Natalie to her womanhood. Or...sisterhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had already seen Natalie's bare chest, so Natalie didn't relent when Erin pushed her to bend her over slightly, pulled over the cups and showed/told her how to hook the straps properly. The instructions went trough one ear and out the other. Natalie cringed when Erin dug her hands into the cups in order to re-allign her breasts properly with the awkwardly situated bra. Finally done Erin smacked both of Natalie's bumps with a smirk and said Natalie could look at herself in the mirror. Natalie's face burned with the intensity of the sun; there were few who could claim the embarrassing experience of having your own sister touch your bare breasts to re-arrange them within your first worn bra, most especially if you had been her brother less than 24 hours before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin went to fetch Natalie's shirt, eager to get her going. The shirt came on easily enough but felt tight and constricting, not as loose as her male shirts had been. It was here that Natalie learned something strange: the buttons on female clothes are situated on the left hand-side instead of the right! Nate had never known that. Over the shirt the overjacket; Erin made Natalie's tie because they were pushed for time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erin handed Natalie her skirt she froze in her tracks: \"What the heck is that?!\" Erin sighed, Natalie was going to prove difficult: \"We call this a skirt, sis.\"<br>\r\n\"Forget it! Don't I have sweater pants? I not going to be seen wearing a skirt!\" Natalie looked hurriedly through her closet for the wintertime female sweater pants.<br>\r\n\"It's summer, Natalie. All the girls are going to be wearing dresses. You'll only stand out more if you wear pants.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\" Natalie swiftly put on her school trousers followed by socks and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Lynda appeared at the door, opening it: \"Dears, why are you dragging. We have less than 10 minutes left. You should-\"<br>\r\nShe broke off staring at Natalie and frowned, both she and Erin surprised at her mothers appearance.\"Just what do you think your doing, missy!?\" she said to Natalie.<br>\r\nPuzzled: \"Getting dressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that under my roof you are!\" like a blitzkrieg she was on Natalie before she could do anything. Lynda pushed her on the bed and in one swift movement yanked off her pants, making Natalie eek much like the girl she was. Following that she pulled up Natalie's navy-blue skirt and had it zipped up before she could protest.<br>\r\n\"No ma, please!\" Natalie pleaded as her mother started to pull up her long thigh length light-green socks up and put up her shoes, Lynda didn't take any nonsense: \"We had a deal, Natalie. You get to wear jeans after school only! You should act like a lady more.\"<br>\r\nLynda then pushed Natalie to stand before the mirror while she folded her enormously long black hair into a snaking ponytail.<br>\r\nNatalie tried desperately to pull the skirt downwards. It barely came to her knees: \"It too short!\" she wailed.<br>\r\n\"Oh be quiet! It's perfect. Now go brush your teeth.\"<br>\r\n\"But..\"<br>\r\n\"I warm once!!\" said Lynda threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Now what?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natalie opened her mouth to come up with a clever retort, but the venomous stare from Lynda was like a clamp on her lips and instead she remain silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to be smart with Lynda was never a good idea. She was the leading partner of her law-firm and considered the most outstanding female lawyer of her time by her peers. She could argue a rocket-scientist into believing the moon was made of cheese. One simply does not win an argument or dispute with Lynda. Nate had tried; he had failed miserably. Natalie harbored no hope that she would fare any better at convincing her mother not to wear a dress; so she just glared indignantly, chewing her lip and holding down her skirt as if a gale-force wind was threatening to blow it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought!\" said Lynda sternly. \"See? You look very pretty!\" Yeah, but that's the problem, thought Natalie unhappily \"Now off with you 2. You're late. Hurry and brush your teeth, quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin whisked passed Lynda, pulling Natalie by her hand; she wasn't in the mood for a dressing down by their mother either.<br>\r\nErin had to muster all of her discipline not to laugh outright at Natalie, for she was acting like such a child! It was an almost repeat of the situation with the towel in the shower. Natalie kept tugging her skirt downwards to cover as mush flesh of her legs as possible, resulting in the exposure of her panties as the hem went past. And each time, Natalie being mortified at the exposure of the white cotton fabric, pulled her skirt back up again. Then repeat the process the entire way to the bathroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh will you cut it out, Natalie?! You're acting like an 11-year old! Not that Nicole ever acts like one (that snotty brat), but you get the idea.\" Erin pretend scolded.<br>\r\n\"But it's too short!\" repeated Natalie miserably and meekly.<br>\r\n\"Ma wasn't lying. It's fine.\" said Erin gently. It was painfully obvious that Natalie was NOT comfortable at wearing a skirt.<br>\r\n\"But yours goes past your knees, mine doesn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stopped Natalie: \"Nate, use your common sense and look. You're older than me and you just have some sexy long legs, it's not the skirt that's too short.\" Natalie snorted, but it wasn't a mean snort. \"I swear your skirt really is the school regulation size for seniors. You wore shorter PT-pants than this, so I don't see what your problem is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People couldn't peek up shorts.\"<br>\r\nErin then, with a smirk, stood next to Natalie and flipped up her skirt, revealing her tight little panty clad bottom for all to see: \"You mean like this?\"<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" protested Natalie.<br>\r\n\"Oops.Was that so bad?\" queried Erin, her face all teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie incredulously looked at Erin with a frown then just shook her head and sigh-laughed: \"Yeah.\" she said, not meaning it.<br>\r\n\"Can't you just see the light at the end of the tunnel for once?\"<br>\r\n\"To see what? The next tunnel?\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" said Erin, and rocked her pelvis back and forth, hands crossed behind her back, her own skirt fluttering gently with her swaying: \"Ya can feel the breeze between yer knees!!\" she declared as if proudly revealing a profound secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked at her sister flabbergasted: Erin had never been one for clowning about. Then Natalie did something she had never done before as Nate: she giggled. Mirth welled up inside from her, uncontrollable, uncontainable, untamable. Erin just watched smiling as her older sister/brother clutched at her sides, tears leaking from her eyes as she tried to put a stopper to her own giggling.  She giggled away long and hard, each previous spurt of giggling being an infectious invitation for a next as she giggled her heart and lungs out; much like a little girl in a slumber-party. Natalie couldn't understand what was wrong with her; it wasn't nearly that funny! At long last Natalie calmed down and tried to catch her breath: laughing your soul out, dear reader, you will agree, is tiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's smile melted away into seriousness: \"Look Nate.\" she held Natalie's hands. \"I know this sucks. I know you don't like being a girl. I know you don't like wearing skirts. I know you're angry at me, but please just try to look on the bright side. I'm here; let's just try to get through school, okay.\"<br>\r\nNatalie realized Erin's self-ridicule had been an act to cheer her up: \"I'm not angry at you Erin. I'm just ticked off at having long hair; can't I get a buzz cut anytime soon? This ponytail's damn heavy; like having a lifting-weight tied to my neck.\"<br>\r\nIt was Erin's turn for girly giggles: \"Again. You'll just stand out more. Come on, Ma will have our backsides if we keep her waiting. Just try it; skirts are fun to wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie held her ever cynical smile as Erin continued to pull her by hand to the bathroom. Now that she didn't walk so stiffly and didn't hold the plaid skirt down tightly, she was in knowing the irony, enjoying the feel of wearing a skirt. The key word was freedom. The skirt comfortably conformed to every movement of her legs. In contrast to the panties beneath, which hugged her tightly but snugly, the skirt hung loose and swayed, stroking her sensitive upper legs in a pleasurable manner. Erin might have joked about the breeze between the wearers knees, but Natalie found the cool air-current that was absent in a lifetime of wearing constricting enclosed pants to be welcoming, especially so in the enveloping warmth of the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 sisters wasted no time in the maintenance of their oral hygiene. Teeth were brushed, flossed, and gurgled with anti-septics. Lynda had been a fanatic with the upkeep of her children's teeth.<br>\r\nThe only thing that annoyed Natalie were her lips. She hadn't noticed it last night, but they appeared to be permanently puckered up as if on preparation for a kiss no matter how much she stretched and thinned them. They looked like folded blimps! Natalie tried to be objective about it and rationalized her lips only to be slightly more puffy as a girl, but still. Sneaking a glance at Erin revealed hers to be far less prominent, once again much to Natalie's displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, whilst her younger sister finished up, Natalie gazed at her reflection once more. Her thoughts were in confusion, her emotions in turmoil. Natalie was again aroused by her own mirror image. The girl before her was beautiful and cute. She was far from model and movie material, but she had a simplistic, earthly prettiness about her. Her jet-black hair stood in sharp contrast to her unnaturally fair pale skin; something Nate found odd as he was scorched blisteringly in the amount of time he had spent getting sunburned during his hiking and camping. The selling point to her heart-shaped oval face was the tiny black freckles peppering her nose and cheeks, matching her inky-hair well: they made her nothing if not adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the same source of this arousal brought anxiety. Natalie wasn't stupid nor naive. She knew she would attract the stairs of other boys who would eye her the same as she was eyeing herself right now. The selling point that would ensure second looks over shoulders, were her breasts. Erin might be right about Natalie's skirt being adequate, but her shirt sure as hell wasn't. The chest area had been designed for a girl of more \"modest\" proportions than Natalie. Or in layman's terms: her shirt could hardly contain her DD-cup sized bust; the buttons strained from the contents of her bosom. How Erin had so easily put on this shirt was beyond Natalie. Natalie cringed at the thought of having her chest be the eye-candy of every single male testosterone-fueled teenager in her school; she had been a boy, she knew where their stairs lingered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Natalie! I value my hide!\" said Erin, pulling at her jacket.<br>\r\nAs if to confirm that time was up, Lynda called: \"Erin! Natalie! Downstairs! Time to go to school!\"<br>\r\nGrabbing their backpacks (Natalie tsked at her chappy-pink one), they sprinted to the kitchen, which was also the house entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere Nicole waited and Lynda handed out lunchpacks to Natalie and Erin.<br>\r\n\"Now girls.\" Natalie frowned; she should have been prepared for it, but being referred as a female still felt wrong .\"Be good. Pay attention in class. And stay out of trouble. That means you Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" said Nicole with obvious bad overacting. \"I'm always good and listen to the teacher and help my fellow classmates-\" She pouted; the very image of a sweet innocent angel of her young age. Natalie grinned, if there was one way to describe Nicole it was thus: small bottle, big poison. Brat, smartass and prankster in one. She could shorten the fuse of patience of all she encountered...<br>\r\n\"I warn once, Nicole! I'll pick you all up at 2 o-clock so we can go for Natalie's piercings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's logic hit a cul-de-sac. WHAT? A mother actually taking her child for a piercing; wasn't it usually the other way around. Rebelling teenagers sneaking past their parents for tattoo's and nose-rings and such?<br>\r\n\"Uhm...what piercings again?\" asked Natalie tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda looked surprised: \"For your earrings, dear. To pierce your ear-lobes at the jewelers. Remember our deal? You get to keep Old Stan if we I got you some hoops.\" That...didn't sound pleasant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more painful the older you are.\" murmured Nicole sadistically.<br>\r\nErin looked at Natalie in amazement; how stupid she had been! So that's what had been missing in last Night's make-up session, Natalie didn't have holes in her ears yet.<br>\r\nNatalie just sighed: \"The next tunnel.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of all the days to be windy!!! Natalie's mood was as dark as the overcast in the sky. The sweltering heat of summer was still present, but the august clouds promised autumn winds and breezes. The arch nemesis of skirts! And she just had to wear one today, didn't she?! thought Natalie bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wilson kids went to school by means of the bus which made its shuttling routine at precisely 7 o-clock every morning on weekdays, 2 blocks away across the street. And of course the 3 Wilson sisters had to walk this short distance to reach the bus-stop each morning. And of course they had to walk past several people - fellow pedestrians, joggers, old couples picking up their delivery-newspapers and neighbourhood pals, most of whom would join them to go to the same town-school - to get there. A relatively public route...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened passed the 1st block. Now you must understand that Natalie had never been a girl before and as such had never worn a skirt either. When the freak gale-breeze hit the girls, both Erin and Nicole had instinctively held their respective skirts secure; but Natalie did not. She had never before experienced the need to hold down a dress in strong wind and had just kept on walking, oblivious to the fact her skirt was fluttering upwards and giving a front-row-seat view of her smooth thighs and white-cotton undergarments to around a dozen spectators, including her sisters.She was too busy musing the unpleasentries of having her ears pierced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie!!!\" Shouted her shocked sisters, whom were terribly embarrassed on her behalf at this ignorant display of public-indecency. Erin ran forward and held Natalie's plaid skirt downwards, whispering in her ear: \"Nate! Watch out for the wind, you idiot!\"<br>\r\nNatalie's shame transcended into her blood-red blushing face as she hurried along and away from the pointing and stares of strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full moon in the afternoon!\" mocked Nicole, barely capable of containing her laughter. \"Well technically it's still morning and you have to be naked, but seeing your panties in their glory, big sis, trumps all that!\"<br>\r\n\"Really Nate-Natalie...\" Erin corrected herself in front of Erin whom didn't know her older sister was in fact her previous older brother. \"I thought you were the one who didn't want to be peeked at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-cheeked, Natalie just tugged frustratedly at her backpack's sling over her shoulder and pursed her lips: \"I didn't intend for that!\"<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. Just be careful from now on.\" Erin said gently. \"Hey, happens to the best of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, shame on you, Natalie!\" Nicole seemed not to have finished having her fun at Natalie's expense: \"Our dear mother didn't raise her upstanding daughters just so they can become flasher chicks; what do ya charge per view, 5 cents-?\"<br>\r\n\"Nicole: SHUT UP!\" Hissed Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What's eating you, sis?\" asked Nicole, not at all fazed by her sisters retort, in her usual pretended ignorance. She should have been born a mosquito thought Natalie; she certainly had the persistent tone of one. If normal younger siblings grinded on one's nerves by being a nuisance, then Nicole raided a person's nerves and mind with a chainsaw! A loud one!<br>\r\n\"You've been grumpy and gloomy ever since last night; you know, more than usual. Somethings up. Usually you just ignore me.\" said Nicole with her ever irritating interrogation. \"I thought you and Erin had lots of fun with your little slumber-party, but you still seemed sour the whole morning. Can't be because of a lack of sleep, you're too much of a morning girl. No, it's something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie groaned-sighed: \"Egypt had it's plagues, I have you.\"<br>\r\n\"How rude! To say that to your own kin- Wait! I know what's up with your foul mood! It's because of last night's love-letter! Come on, you can't be that dim. Even Ma laid it on pretty thick: EVERYONE at the table already knew about you and Tommy! You're just peeved because I told about the letter-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie stopped in her tracks, her eyes widening, pupils shrinking. She had forgotten about Tommy! No. Not really forgotten, but had suppressed thinking about him entirely. Till now. Not that the sudden trials and tribulations of being a girl of recently hadn't occupied her mind completely.<br>\r\nTommy had been Nate's best of friends. They were as thick as thieves since kindergarden. On hindsight it almost seemed logical that Erin's wish having feminized Nate's reality would make them a couple when Nate became the girl Natalie, since they had spent almost all of their times together as boys. But...it left a bitter taste in Natalie's mouth. She doubted she would be able to muster the courage to face Tommy as a female. Having breasts, having to wear bra's and skirts, all of that paled to the punishing awkwardness of being forced to be the girlfriend of your previous best friend. Natalie really hoped Nicole was joking, lying about the love letter, but she knew better: Nicole never needed to rely on making up stories in order to annoy people. Natalie simply dreaded having to meet Tommy...<br>\r\nWho could blame her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, misinterpreting Natalie's sudden solemn silence, pounced on the opportunity to annoy her even further.<br>\r\n\"I don't see what the big deal is. Or is it perhaps that our tomboy sister is too ashamed to admit she likes to date? Or maybe you're too scared to ask him to kiss you? Yeah that's probably it! Both he and you must be such chickens!\"<br>\r\n\"Will you be quiet, Nicole!\" spat Natalie. Nicole's words hit home far too painfully close to Natalie's fears and disgust at the prospect of being Tommy's girlfriend when she had previously been a boy herself.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you should repeat today's stunt and trow him a panty-flasher, you'll both be snogging in no time. But take my advice: ditch the plain undies and get some cute lacy ones with flowers and pretty little hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no longer amusing, Nicole.\" said Natalie quietly. Nicole, sensing the hurt and distress in Natalie's voice, relented. \"Hey, I was just teasing you!\" <br>\r\nNatalie's cynical smile re-appeared; if only Nicole knew how outclassed her taunting were in light of the effects of Erin's wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Erin, Natalie worriedly looked over her shoulder at her younger sister whom had remained silent the last minute: \"What are you looking at?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin peeked up from her backpack: \"Uhm...nothing!\" she said quickly and zipped it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had been walking behind Natalie and Nicole whilst they had been arguing. She had wanted to speak up for Natalie against Nicole's jeering, but something stopped her. A weight, as if someone had thrown in a handful of led, pulled her backpack earthwards, sending her off balance. At first Erin had assumed that Nicole had placed a brick in her bag, as she often did as a classical prank. But Nicole was in front of Erin. And there was no one near the girls on the open sidewalk. Puzzled, Erin had taken off her bag and looked inside; something had to have been placed in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart missed a beat and time stopped cold. It was the candy container...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin just gawked at the cylindrical box. It must be magic. It had to be magic! How else did it just appear in her bag!! It explained why her backpack had suddenly become heavier, but all else was a mystery. Erin walked aimlessly, staring transfixed at the container. It looked an exact replica of the original, only there was a note attached to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read: \"96/100 Units remaining. Box cannot be lost or destroyed. Use wisely.\" And nothing else. No explanation, no anything.<br>\r\nUndoing the lid revealed the gumball-like sweets inside, the same as the first container, and there were no ants in them either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin felt rotten and cruel. She knew it only fair to tell Natalie about this great discovery, but something stopped her. She knew Nate would immediately want wish himself into her brother again as he clearly despised being a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of last night and this morning had been of the happiest in Erin's life. She did not want to lose Natalie as her older sister. When the candy container was found missing, Erin had been every bit as ecstatic as Natalie had been horrified at having to be a girl for life. Nate wouldn't just be her older sis whom she could talk to about her feelings for the night, but would be there for her forever! <br>\r\nShe had felt like a jerk for being overjoyed at Nate being stuck as Natalie; even when Natalie had cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Erin could spend just one more day with her older sister! She made the decision then and there not to inform Natalie about the candies; to keep them secret for now. She promised herself she would tell Natalie about them later tonight. Just another day with her older sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's voice penetrated Erin's thoughts: \"What are you looking at...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing? How can you look at nothing?\" queried the ever sharp Nicole. \"Or do mean to tell us you forgot your books?\"<br>\r\n\"Never you mind.\" retorted Erin, fearsomely worried that they would find and see the candy container.<br>\r\n\"Hey Natalie, how about we find out what scandal Erin is hiding.\" Erin blanched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you touch Erin, I will throw you into the traffic.\" said Natalie evenly. Erin smiled gratefully once more; feeling even worse at lying to her loyal older sister.<br>\r\n\"Wow. You really must be mad at me. Suite yourself.\" Nicole was immune to threats of physical harm. Only Lynda could tame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie just shook her head at Nicole. She was a good sister, but could be handful of sores at the worst of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hoot of the yellow-orange horizontally black-striped school bus alerted the trio of sisters. Time for school...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tommy was very pleased to see Natalie and her sisters board the bus. He called to her, but she didn't seem to hear him over the din of the engine and talking kids. So he waited patiently till she was walking right next him and gently prodded her squishy upper arm: \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie turned, her eyes widened to saucers as she saw him: \"T-tommy!\"<br>\r\n\"Hi Natalie. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi Tommy.\" said Natalie scared, now taken aback at the sight of seeing her best friend this soon. \"Err...what are you doing on the bus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our car broke down. I'm just riding the bus till its repaired.\" he again extended his arm and rubbing her shoulder in an affectionate manner. \"You didn't call last night. Something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething certainly was the matter. Natalie cringed and visibly flinched beneath his touch, stepping out of reach in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing touched by Tommy wasn't a new thing for Natalie. As mates they had had physical contact frequently. A pat on the back, wrestling in the dirt. Standing on each others shoulders to reach greater heights. But this was a different ball-game entirely. They had both been boys. To be touched and rubbed in fondness as the girlfriend of your previous mate; it was nothing short of mortifying. Worse still was that Tommy's strong firm fingers had elicited a warm pleasant glow from Natalie's soft sensitive skin where he had touched the bare flesh of her arm. To her terror, Natalie had enjoyed it.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Tommy, sensing her mental discomfort, reattempting to feel her arm.<br>\r\nNatalie knocked his hand away: \"Don't touch me!\" she hissed. Oh dear, how did he screw up this time? wondered Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why? Did I do something?\" he asked hurt. Changing tactics he held her gently by the hips. Natalie's face first blanched, then reddened and heated up like the inside of a furnace as the blood of embarrassment rushed to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scowl she slugged him in the chest, back into his seat: \"I said don't touch me!! I swear I will break you! Just please!\"<br>\r\nTommy frowned worriedly: \"Okay, I'm sorry. But if you can just tell me what I did wrong.\" Natalie was looking at him the way one looked at something that had crawled out from the swamps and had died on your doorstep. Tommy wondered how he pissed off his girlfriend this badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had a pained expression; she didn't want to hurt her mate, but she also didn't want to be his sweatheart either. She pursed her puffy lips and said: \"Look, it's not you, it's me.\" Oh now that sounded so salty, Natalie wanted to gag at herself. Fleeing, she stalked off to sit as far away from Tommy as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy smiled  at Natalie's retreating form; she was going to be difficult again today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erin had made her wish she had made it vague and without any specifications. All she had wished for was that Nate could be her older sister. And since Nate had already been her older sibling, the only thing the magical candies had altered was his gender, nothing more, nothing less. This might seem like an insignificant detail, but it had a large impact on how the effects and results of Erin's wish was carried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had flipped gender and his reality had been feminized, like his room. But the rest of his life had remained unaltered. His past: every action he had taken, every event that had influenced him, was unchanged. His personality, hobbies, talents, desires, memories, the way other people had remembered him, his relationships and activities, his friends, all unchanged. So everything he had done( or not done) as a boy was replicated exactly, precisely; only as if he had done/not done them as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as a boy, Nate had never worn skirts, bras, panties, teddies, dresses, stockings or bikinis. He had never used make-up, never gone to the mall to shop for recreation. He had never participated in any girly activities whatsoever. And as a boy these traits were obviously unremarkable. But as a female...boy oh boy, they made Natalie one hell of a tomboy girl as seen through the eyes of her friends and family in this altered reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example: Nate had never worn earrings. Neither had Natalie. Thus the reason why her feminist mother wanted to take her for piercings in this reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was an outdoors-person and a naturalist who adored creepy crawlies. So was Natalie; this truly made her the arch anti-steriotype of feminism.<br>\r\nTommy Iverson loved Natalie for this. In his memory as altered by the magical-sweets, they still had shared their childhood since kindergarden, but with Natalie as a girl. In Tommy's mindset Natalie was a rough and husky girl who didn't mind getting dirty or breaking a few nails; she had a real sense of adventure for things like sleeping in tents or even out in the open(again: normal for boys, relatively extraordinary for girls). She was a lot of fun to hang with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourse when they grew older and out of their baby fat, so too did they grow out of the childish-stage where touching one of the opposite sex was 'icky'. Tommy's adoration for his childhood friend (Natalie) turned into attraction as she blossomed into a lithe cute teenager. When Tom had first asked Natalie out, it had earned him a fist in the face. But he was persistent: eventually after a swollen nose, a blue and black eye and a sore jaw, Natalie had relented and realized he wasn't mocking her, and had agreed to be his girlfriend. Least this was this was the version of events as experienced by Tom as the magical-sweets had made him believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie could be a difficult girlfriend to work with. Tommy had at last summoned the guts to send her a love-letter yesterday; nothing mushy, merely in plain and simple terms how he felt about her. Natalie would have broken both his legs with a blunt instrument if he dared to be romantic with her, as she disliked being treated like a girl ( just as Nate obviously would have revolted against being treated like a girl in his original reality). Tommy hoped it wasn't because of his letter that she was regarding with such disgust right now on the bus....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing,Tommy sat back down next to the red-haired, 17-year old Zepp Howards, now his closest male buddy in the absence of Nate. Zepp was an anomaly. He had good grades, but constantly got in trouble, running the risk of being expelled from school. His life hobbies included mixing gunpowder, building crackers and launching fireworks. At the roofs of people's homes. And then fleeing before the authorities...<br>\r\nHe had a lot of guts at least. The bus monitor, a mean obese woman, sat a mere 2 seats away, and he was in the midst of folding a makeshift cigar-shaped flash-stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble in paradise?\" asked Zepp, without looking up. He had seen the exchange between Natalie and Tommy.<br>\r\n\"I think Natalie hates me.\" replied Tommy in gloom.<br>\r\n\"Did you figure that out before or after she told you in her usual polite ladylike way to eff off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it. Did I say something to upset her?\" said Tommy ruffling his hair goofily.<br>\r\n\"Dunno. Were you stupid enough to tell her how pretty she looked this morning? You know how our dear Natalie loathes compliments about her good looks.\" said Zepp now licking the paper the edge of a paper cylinder the way one licked at a letter and rotated it closed to resemble a fat cigarette; withing this he inserted something resembling like a miniature piece of dynamite.<br>\r\n\"No.\" said Tom. \"I only said hi. And yet...she looked at me like I was toxic garbage. Like I was something lower than...lower than-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower than shark shit shade at the bottom of the sea abyss?!\" queried Zepp enthusiastically.<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks. That does wonders for my self-esteem.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Anytime buddy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seriously: did I do something insensitive? I only wrote her a letter. Guess I'm the world's worst poet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about it. My bet is Natalie's just having her girl time of the month. Quite understandable she'd be a bit irritated.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"What the heck do you mean 'what do I mean'?? What else could I be referring to when I say the key words of 'girl' and 'once per month'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, oh. Still, don't sweat it. She'll get over it in the course of the morning. Then she'll be back to her old cheerful swearing self, telling us what maggots we are. Then we'll all live happily ever after. While I place this zoll in the principles exhaust pipe.\" said Zepp, holding up the menacing looking little cigar-thing with a fuse running out its one end.<br>\r\n\"I somehow doubt that. I think she's angry at me in particular.\" said Tom, looking at Natalie sitting several rows behind him next to her sister, Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped Natalie would forgive him soon, he had wanted to ask her out on a date this weekend...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>WHATS WITH ALL THIS TOUCHING!!! raged Natalie in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning had been understandably traumatic and unnerving for Natalie with the discovery that she would remain a girl for life. But what finally derailed her, was when Tommy Iverson had touched her.<br>\r\nNatalie had already been dreading to confront her best friend as a female, but she had never anticipated it to be so soon, and on the  bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been 10 seconds till the little basterd had started to get intimate and had rubbed her shoulder! But what finally had made her flip was when he had held her by the hips! Natalie didn't know what had been worse: the fact that she had wanted to rip him to shreds for grasping her, or the fact that she (in her infinite humiliation) had for a split-moment wanted him to keep holding her as his girlfriend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feel of his gentle hands on her sides had short-fused her fluttering heart. It had been a marvelous sensation to be held by such firm handsome hands. But...like a Thermometer exploding at the top-end from being overheated (almost like Natalie's blood-pumped red face at that very instant), Natalie had erupted with indignation as she had lost all self-control and had vehemently punched him in the chest. Natalie was almost glad that she was now weaker as a girl, for she might had cracked a few of Tommy's ribs as Nate. Almost...her fist felt sore beneath the impact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the F###?! Natalie couldn't believe she had actually been attracted to Tommy! This can't be real! What was wrong with her?! Her male pride quaked with shame at the thought that she had, and in fact still now as she sat next to Erin, felt a warm glow at the thought of being held by Tommy. Another guy! Her mind was in turmoil of confusion: how can it feel so natural? She had been a boy herself! She can't like another boy! <br>\r\nIt wasn't helped by either the fact that Tommy had treated it as if having touched her as his girlfriend had been normal, nor by her stupid sister Erin grinning goofily and doe-eyed at her as if to state: \"Ooh! I saw all that! Natalie's in love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Natalie calmed and composed herself; she just needed to get through the day for the weekend. And then she could try and figure out things out from there.<br>\r\nThe bus halted in front of school-grounds and unloaded its cargo of teenaged humanity. There the passengers joined a further throng of children clad in the school's uniform to mingle and socialize before the bell alerted everyone to the commencement of the schoolday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her dismay, Natalie discovered that her experience in physical contact as a girl wasn't over yet. It was the hugging! Every single girl wanted to hug Natalie in greeting! They were obsessed with it! Hugs, hugs and just more blistering hugs! Every single girl, without exception just had to insist; they just wouldn't take no for an answer!!!<br>\r\n\"Err...no thanks, I'm good.\" Natalie would say meekly, holding up her hands, and try to slip away.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be such a sour-prune.\" they would answer cheerfully and almost cheekily, and just go ahead and embrace her tightly without giving her a chance to evade. No less than 2 dozen girls 'ensnared' Natalie like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Natalie thought the schoolgirls were mocking HER in particular; that they knew she was in fact the previous Nate. But as she looked carefully, she realized that hugging simply seemed to be an ingrained behaviour when it came to girls greeting other girls. It seemed that a hug was a simple sincere physical expression of acceptance between female companions. It was quite a queer sight to Natalie whom had been a male previously. Girls would hug her with far more fondness than she would her own mother! Even if they weren't particularly close either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoys in comparison would rarely resort to any such form of intimacy. Maybe a handshake, maybe a pat on the back, maybe high-five or a fist to shoulder. But NEVER a hug! To hug your male buddy without any exceptionally special reason, like having your favorite sports-team win a League or season, would be regarded particularly awkward. Even brothers and cousins would never hug and only connect via a hearty handshake. Male hugging was sometimes allowed if tragedy struck, but even then it had to be quick.  And even THEN the hug had to be a firm, powerful bear's embrace of manliness! Not the gentle, extended, almost cuddling way girls were hugging Natalie now! Quite strange really...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate Smith, Heather Yamato, Janet Day, all of Nate's previous good girl friends (note the separation you idiots) were in on this morning ritual of hugging. And all of them, much to Natalie's annoyance, asked her about what she did last night.<br>\r\nWhen boys greeted one another, they did it in short syllable dialogue. All they would say was: \"What's up?\" and the answer would be: \"Not much. You?\" and that would be the sole extent of conversation for the entire morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no! Girls just HAD to be different, didn't they? They weren't satisfied by one-liner answers; for each and every one you had to explain in vivid detail precisely what had happened in your life the previous day, now matter how boring or repetitive it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily...or unluckily, Erin was there to answer on Natalie's behalf. Natalie frowned on Erin's bubbling happiness; once again she seemed oblivious to Natalie's discomfort. It was as if Erin were ecstatically showing off her new baby puppy. Much to Natalie's blushing embarrassment Erin told of her and Natalie's sister's slumber-party. The girls ooh'd and aah'd at how sweet that was and expressed what a good sister Natalie was in comparison to their own bratty siblings. Natalie's blush intensified and she tugged nervously at the straps of her chappy-pink backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erin arrived at the part where she had practiced make-up on her sister, all of the girls in the group squealed in delight and congratulated her for having had her tomboy sister made ladylike. Thoroughly ticked off at this, Natalie stalked away cherry-faced. But the girls would have none of it and yanked her back.<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, Natalie!\" wined Heather, pulling her arm.<br>\r\n\"You should come to one of OUR slumber-parties too!\" said Janet, tugging the other arm.<br>\r\n\"Join us to the mall! You'll love it! I swear!\" Kate pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie snorted. \"Ugh.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell you what.\" said Janet, holding Natalie secure with her athletic arms, playing with Natalie's ponytail. \"We can go visit the petstore and any other place you want, as long as you spend the afternoon shopping with us.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" said Heather, holding Natalie's left hand. \"You NEVER go out with us! We really like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm busy!\" said Natalie desperately, feeling as if she were being divided as feed amongst a pack of harpies. Friendly, kind ones, but still!<br>\r\n\"With what? With Tommy?\" jeered Kate, among the giggles of all present.<br>\r\n\"No!\" hissed Natalie, her cheeks resembling the rising morning sun.<br>\r\n\"Good!\" declared Kate. \"Then we'll see you after school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching at straws: \"But I have an appointment after school at 2!\" Natalie said brightly, thinking of an escape.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but...the piercing is AT the mall, Natalie! We can meet after Ma takes you there.\" chirped Erin innocently from the side.<br>\r\nNatalie gave Erin a dark look.<br>\r\n\"What piercings exactly?\" Heather asked Erin.<br>\r\n\"Natalie's first earrings! Lynda is taking us to the jewelers. Can I come with too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Janet brightly. \"Just keep Natalie from escaping till we get there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked at Erin, sighing: \"I hate you.\"<br>\r\n\"And I LOVE you, Sis!\" Erin replied with smile that threatened to split her small head in half, holding her sister's lower arm lovingly. She was going to squeeze out every drop of fun she could have with Natalie during today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitonous ring of the plaza bell informed that it was now 7:15 AM, and that the first class were about to start. Natalie dug in her bag and was relieved to see from her roster that all her classes had remained the same. Biology first, them maths, excetera.<br>\r\nThe group diverged and the children went their separate ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecrets were like cocaine to Nicole. Trying to keep something hidden from her, be it innocent or scandalous, were like teasing a blood-hound with a raw steak. The moment Erin had tried to hide the candy-container from her backpack, Nicole's curiosity went haywire and her senses went hyper. Nicole simply loved getting beneath the skin of people, Erin more than most (one of the reasons they didn't get along very well, and why Erin and Natalie were far closer as sisters). And the best way to pester people, was to threaten to expose their closet skeletons, even if Nicole never intended to. It was also a fine way to milk favors: like getting Erin to buy her ice-cream every recess in trade for not telling mom about her poor grades or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the entire bus-trip, Nicole's eyes had been glued to Erin's bag. Erin was hiding something, something BIG; that much was certain; for Erin was a usually open, honest person. And Nicole simply squirmed in glee at the thought of finding out exactly what it was...<br>\r\nNicole was patient. She just needed to follow Erin around, and see where she went with her backpack. She already knew the combination for Erin's locker...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was so easy, it was almost a crime. Well actually it was a crime: robbing another child's locker at school was punishable by detention, but that was beside the point!<br>\r\nNicole had tailed Erin the whole morning, keeping in the crowd, keeping inconspicious, something made easy by her looking such an innocent adorable little sweet girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her enduring patience and persistence had paid off in the form of Erin leaving her school-bag unguarded in her locker for recess. Nicole was on the locker like a dog on a T-bone steak, clicking out the numbers to unlock the combination. The lock clacked, indicating it was opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, like a treasure hunter having found the fabled X on his map, Nicole opened locker with extended heart-thumping drama, as if she was opening a bank vault. Looking sideways if any could see what she was doing (and looking as guilty as a crow this time), Nicole opened Erin's bag. Excitement quickly turned to disappointment as Nicole rummaged through the backpack. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Books, spacecase, a few girly baubles, but nothing even remotely of interest. Nicole was peeved. She had such great expectations of what Erin's secret was. She puffed up her cheeks out of frustration at not having had her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened: she found the candy-container. But Nicole didn't react. She just pushed it aside, not realizing its significance. Then she opened it and looked inside to see if it hid Erin's notorious little secret. Only candy danggit, Nicole thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the next thing happened: SHE ATE A PIECE OF CANDY in an attempt to spite Erin whose secret seemed safe.<br>\r\nThere is nothing here! thought Nicole. What could it be? Was I mistaking when I thought I saw Erin hiding something? No! She was suspicious! She acted happy! Then stressed when Natalie asked her what she was looking at!<br>\r\nI WISH I KNEW WHAT SHE WAS HIDING! Nicole thought. And that, dear reader, triggered the magic of the candies of change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Nicole's mind it was raging like a flashbang. She felt her brain go numb as her memories of Nate as having been altered by Erin's wish to making her think her older brother had always been her older sister revert back. She had wished to know what Erin had been hiding; and the only way to grant her wish was for the magical sweets to inform her of their supernatural properties and tell her all about the events Nate had endured as Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gasped out loud. Then she laughed and giggled hysterically at the thought that her dear brother was now a girl and that she KNEW! Other school children looked at her funny, but she ignored their stares. She was going to have the time of her life chiding him about being a her! And now that she had these sweets she was going to be the ultimate pest! But she wouldn't be cruel to him, only toy around with him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed back the container in the bag and closed and locked the locker. But only after having taken a single candy piece.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie wished she had listened to her mother Lynda when she had told Natalie to cross and close her legs whenever sitting as a girl.<br>\r\nThe reason: that little dipshit of a pervert, Joey whom sat 2 tables in front of her, had been eyeballing her undies for the last 1/2-hour of Maths! As a boy, Nate had been well acquainted with the arts and crafts of perversion, even if he hadn't been guilty of them, and therefore Natalie had caught the creeper out in very short order...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey had used a shaving hand-mirror which he had glued to the top of his one shoe to violate Natalie's undergarments with his eyeball pressure. Having seen the whiteness of her cotton panties in the mirror's reflection, Natalie had snapped her legs shut with the force and speed of a brick-press and swore under her breath. That creeper! Natalie had the mindset of a boy, but the modesty of a girl, and she wasn't going to let this stand, oh no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlotting revenge, Natalie constructed a makeshift blow-dart gun, by taking out the ink-capsule of one of her pens, leaving only the outer plastic shell for a pea-shooter. Using the ample marksmanship Nate had with slingshots, Natalie decked the mirror with a bullseye of a chewed paper ball. Then she shot his right ear. When Joey turned around in indignity at who the heck would do such a 'childish' thing, he saw Natalie looking him straight in the eye. Natalie couldn't tell whether his ears glowed bright red from pain or embarresment at having been caught out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning had passed relatively normally for Natalie. Well...as normal for as could be for one who'd been gender-bended by his little sister into a her. But Natalie couldn't focus on improving her academic prowess at all. She suffered from the duel stress of feeling out of place as a female and whether she would remain a girl forever, a fate she most certainly didn't want, even if Erin did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most annoyingly, she couldn't stop thinking about Tommy bloody Iverson! It was just so, SO wrong!! To be the girlfriend of his previous best buddy! It burned Nate's very soul with disgust and shame!<br>\r\nAnd yet...and yet Natalie couldn't stop thinking about him! Worse still was that she felt a warm pleasant glow whenever she did! An increase in the pumping of her heart.; sweaty palms; a mouth running as dry as a cork. What the hell?! She was falling in love with him!<br>\r\nAnd yet she liked that thought. She liked the prospect of being Tommy's girlfriend even if she didn't want to! The less she tried to think about Tommy, the more she longed for him! Her mind was in utter turmoil!!!<br>\r\nNatalie sighed deeply and just banged her head into her bunk in resignation. This sucks, she thought demoralized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get her mind off of Tommy, Natalie thought of something else instead. Like her friggen missing pockets! Earlier this morning Natalie had concluded that girl clothing must have been designed by mentally deranged people. For they had no pockets! Skirts had no pockets! Girl jeans, shorts and trousers seldom had pockets! What on earth? She realized the importance of handbags as she needed one if she wanted to carry any loos articles with her outside of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had always licked the feeling of a weight in his pockets. He would carry a pocket-knife, his cellphone or even a compass with him. But the fact remained: he always carried something in his pockets! This was not possible in a skirt. Natalie only had her shirt pocket and to put something in that as her shirt strained against her over-endowed breasts was an impossibility. Natalie just blushed at the thought.<br>\r\nLuckily her girl self seemed to also have disregarded handbags just as Nate did as she couldn't find one in her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped the girls whom had wormed her into a shopping session this afternoon wouldn't make her buy a handbag! Natalie felt depressed all over again as she remembered that she would have to go for piercings and then suffer through a all out girls's shopping spree with Erin, Kate, Heather and Janet. She didn't feel like she had the energy for that as well! What a day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie just sighed. This was proving the adventure...</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t see this coming, did you?

Over the next 12 hours, you will turn into a boy. Yeah. That\u2019ll be good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mall was surprisingly close to the school, so Erin walked with the transformed Natalie who was still grouchy about being transformed into a girl. <i>Relax, just embrace it. Sigh. I really don\u2019t want to change her back, but\u2026 The consequences of not doing so are horrifying. I wouldn\u2019t want her to do anything hasty, if she hates it that much. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her going to some shady doctor.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie flicked through various shady websites on her phone, \u2018They claim to do gender reversals, huh. It\u2019s worth a shot. Even though they might be a scam, it\u2019s still better than being like this and having my mind eroded bit by bit by this stupid Tommy brainwashing candy,\u2019 Natalie thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped on one site which had the most ridiculous and had the stupidest promises, but as she knew, the impossible was very much possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What the hell is this site? Madame Mara\u2019s Magical Emporium? Even for a scam, this isn\u2019t very convincing. Nonono, I shouldn\u2019t pass up any possibility. Screw that, these prices are highway robbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$5 million for a gender reversal? Pfft\u2026 $10 million to gain the ability to fly? That\u2019s just stupid \u2026And what\u2019s this, candies which can change reality for $50 million dollars, who would belie- Candies?! It couldn\u2019t be, could it?

I would have to sleep with every man in this godforsaken city.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natalie was worrying about changing back, Erin\u2019s body slowly got bulkier and more muscular, although the full extent of these changes wouldn\u2019t be visible for an hour or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole tore through the school hallways with sprinting speeds that exceeded spoetnik's launching. Like a soft drink having been shaken before being opened, Nicole could barely contain the fizz of excitement that threatened to bubble up from her. She clutched the magical sweet she had swiped from Erin's locker earlier close to her chest as she ran; as if all the world would dare to take her truimph away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill charging blindly, it was not until when she rounded the corner and a hand snatched her shirt collar, that she decelerated. Like a bike going on a wheelie, Nicole's feet run out from under her - her sudden stop motion by the scruff of her neck causing her legs to go up in the leverage. When the underside of her body finally reached terminal height from the momentum, they then came crashing down like a meteor; right on her bottom. Nicole grunted on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on there, sport. Where are you going in such a furious hurry? The sun is shining. The birds are singing. Such a beautiful day and you don't even pay attention to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZepp!! Tommy's pal. Standing up and rubbing her still-sore butt, Nicole glared at the slyly smiling lanky red-headed teenager. The bugger had had the nerve to pull her by the shirt and make her slip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jerk! That hurt!\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry! Really I am! I tried to call to you, but you seemed on such a mission. So terribly focused, you couldn't hear me.\" he said cheerfully, rubbing her hair into a mess as she glowered at him.<br>\r\n\"Where were you going in such a blasted hurry anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere. I'm going nowhere!\" she quickly said, red in the face, still reeling from her inglorious decent back to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I suppose you don't happen to have anything sinister in your hands either?\" Zepp said with glinting eyes, reaching for Nicole's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetrified of discovery, Nicole jumped backwards and crossed her arms behind her and out of reach of Zepp's clutches.<br>\r\nAlmost in panic: \"Nothing! Nothing. I'm not doing anything! Keep away! I'm just off to maths now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZepp laughed: \"Oh come on! You can do better than that. That was a terrifically terrible attempt at lying! I expect a much better effort from you of all people, Nicole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole scowled. The irony was that she was now lying as badly as Erin had lied to her earlier this morning. Zepp the troublemaker was Nicole's match in life. The only other person beside her mother whom could best her.<br>\r\nA self-proclaimed mad-scientist and a serial pyromaniac, Zepp was Nicole's significant other in terms of scams and mischief; only he was a far greater deviant and delinquent. He could snuff out lies far better than she, and being older he had the advantage of experience when it came to spinning tales. Nicole would never be able to lie successfully to Zepp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Have it your way. I'll leave you to whatever scheme you're hatching.\" said Zepp, backing up with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sighed, visibly relieved that Zepp was retreating: \"Can I go?\" she asked apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should you!\" Nicole retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZepp grinned: \"Touche. But before you go-\" Ah great. What now? thought Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where the bug-girl is?\" Zepp asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's logic hit a cul-de-sac: \"Huh? What? Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister: Natalie. You know the one whom threatens me daily with putting that horrible arachnid of hers down my neck. The one whom spends all her free time climbing trees and staring at insects and wood-lice when most of us normal human beings would instead play video games and eat ice-cream?\" Nicole's face just continued to register confusion. \"No? You know: black hair, freckles, Tommy's bloody girlfriend for crying out loud! Come on there's only three of you! It can't be that hard.\" he rambled in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound 'girlfriend' Nicole burst out laughing, followed by a hiccup of giggles.<br>\r\nAfter having wished for the knowledge of how the candies-of-change worked and therefore subsequently the identity of her sister Natalie being in reality her older brother Nate, Nicole had her memories restored about him. She had only since that hilarious discovery thought in terms of her brother now being a girl and squirming about it, and had associated him with his old name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zepp had mentioned Tommy's girlfriend, Nicole could not keep back the flood of mirth. Just too funny! Her brother having a boyfriend. She was going to rub that in his face like acid after school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more significantly she now understood whom Zepp meant when he had asked about Natalie, whom she'd momentarily forgotten was Nate in girl form, and had for a moment not had a clue about whom he was speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you. Yes, I know I am a glorious comedian. But seriously: do you know where bug-girl is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you meant Nate!\" Nicole said before she could stop herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate?\" Zepp queried; a puzzled frown creasing his forehead. Nicole scolded herself for her slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant Natalie, yes Natalie.\" she said, hoping Zepp didn't start connecting dots in her paranoia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH I get it.\" Zepp jubilated; a grin tearing his face: \"Nate is Natalie in male pronoun. Yes our bug-girl can be quite the tomboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole snorted in her mind. Dude, if you only knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had wanted to ask Natalie to join us this afternoon. We're going to on a hike to the forest hill. She avaliable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" said Nicole hurriedly, hoping to put as much distance between herself and the ever clever Zepp before he dug into her: \"He...She's going for a piercing with Ma to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity.\" said Zepp. Then without warning he confiscated the sweet from her hand in such lightning swiftness and silent dexterity that Nicole didn't realize he had stolen it from her until he held the spherical candy in front of her. Nicole gasped and tried to pry it away from him in naked terror, but the difference in height meant that Zepp only had to hold it high to keep it out of reach of her desperate fingers.<br>\r\n\"No! No! That's mine! Please give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disappointed look crossed Zepp's face: \"That's all? I thought you had something...well don't know...more interesting hidden away.\"<br>\r\nNicole was howling with rage and tears by now, but Zepp just kept her smaller weaker frame at arm's length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...looks tasty. What would you do if I ate it?\"<br>\r\nNicole stopped moving, horror spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be crap, was the first thought crossing her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on out here?\" demanded a young but commanding and stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. We're in trouble.\" said Zepp amused. Nicole whined in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Zack - Zepp's older brother. And in this world 2 greater opposites did not exist. They were as dissimilar as night and day. While Zepp was a force of chaos - a troublemaker and the embodiment naughtiness, Zack was the paragon of order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was a hall-prefect. And while he wore the nerdiest glasses and the geekiest clothes, he did so in style. He was prim, proper, posh. His attire impeccably flawless. His tie was perfect. His shoelaces was perfect. Even his white collar and cuffs without mark. His spectacles gave him a distinguished air instead of making him look a nerd. He looked the part of a genuis groomed for success. And having the looks of a sitcom star and the body of gymnast didn't hurt much either to make him an imposing school leader and candidate for Head-boy next year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZepp in stark laughable contrast looked like a street urchin that had crawled out from the sewers. Scruffy unkempt clothing, chaotic  flaming hair and a sly grin that made him look guilty by default.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi there, brother. Didn't see you?\" Zepp called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out of class, you skunk? I hope you aren't dumping your disgusting habits on this poor girl here?\" Zack declared, striding forward with force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would think that of your own kin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember being related to baffoons. Get yer arse back in class before I drag you back to it by the ear.\" came Zack's retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There goes my fragile feelings.\" Zepp mock pouted: \"Discarded by my own brother is such a dreadful way! Oh the humanity-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up. Get yourself scarce before I make your tail-end fragile with a spanking by my boots.\" Zack spat annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZepp threw up his arms in false worship: \"As you command, my lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack kicked him to get him moving: \"Stop polluting my air en be off with you, ye blasted oxygen-thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole squeaked to Zepp: \"Wait! Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack didn't even ask Nicole what she meant; he was too salted by Zepp's antics: \"Whatever you got, return it now, Zepp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZepp flung the candy over his shoulder: \"Just a joke. A joke! Just messing with her!\"<br>\r\nNicole caught it with the same heart-pounding relief as someone would be catching a priceless antique china vase. She didn't waste time picking up speed and distancing herself from the 2 brothers with her treasure intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Nicole, Zack said: \"What's a minor doing in the senior block of the school...hey..where'd you go??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway was deserted. Zack tsked and moved on.</span></div></div>",

As the ball spins Nate turns over in his sleep to face Erin. Doing this she is able to get a good look as the transformation begins. Nate's short brown hair grows out more and more becoming long and silky as well as turning a dirty blond. His nose shrinks, his eyes widen, and his lips become fuller and kissable. With his face down the changes progress to his frame. the muscle on his arms and legs melt away giving him a smaller, more delicate frame. His height shrinks slightly causing him to lose 2in. His stomach caves in giving him a slight hour glass appearance. His hands and feet shrink down becoming smaller and petite. A noticeable bulge in his pants slowly shrinks down until it vanishes, presumable replaced by a woman's Vagina. To complete his appearance breast begin to appear on his chest, swelling into perky DD's, as his hips and butt begin to swell out, into a large jiggly bubble butt. His shirt is changed into a hot pink tank top, exposing the tops of his breasts, with the words \"squeeze me\" written across them while, his pants are changed into booty shorts, hugging the curves of his legs with the words \"juicy\" written behind them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With Nate's changes finished the light zooms into the middle of the room before flooding it in a bright pink light consuming it entirely.

Your vision then suddenly became blurry and you felt a 'shifting' sensation, the next thing you knew you were standing where Heather had been, sucking on the candy she had been eating. You blinked a couple of times and then looked down at yourself. \"Oh frick!\" you blurted out, immediately recognizing how high-pitched your voice seemed to be. You held your hands out in front of you and noticed how much smaller and feminine they looked, then you grabbed at the small but perky breasts that were hidden beneath the red t-shirt you were wearing. Further inspection of the jeans and sneakers you were wearing confirmed your suspicion that you were in Heather's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, like...THIS IS AMAZING!\" you suddenly heard your own voice exclaim loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?\" you asked your former body, now occupied by a delighted Heather. \"I don't want to be a girl!\" you said, grimacing slightly before looking down at your new body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said to wish for something fun, this...IS...fun!\" Heather responded, grabbing at the bulge in 'her' jeans. \"Ooooh...wow, my first erection!\" she then chuckled excitedly, making you feel more than a little 'uncomfortable'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I can always eat another candy and swap us back\" you sighed, as you tried to get used to being female. You realized that there were a lot worse places to be than inside Heather's cute body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why didn't you get the raise you were promised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it appears the budget has, as they said over the phone, \"fluctuated\" again,\" the father answered dejectedly and giving air quotes for his higher-ups' words. \"Sorry, champ. Maybe we can go during Christmas...\" He paused a bit before shaking his head. \"Who am I kidding? Maybe we can go next summer. Just thought I'd let you all know personally. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...\" his son grumbled while staring at the candy in his hand. \"It's okay, Dad. After all...there's always next year...\" Mike gave Nate one last worried look before slowly closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang...\" Nate sighed to himself before popping the candy in his mouth. \"And here I was actually looking forward to that trip.

The room was different, more like a hotel than anything else. Certainly not his bedroom back home. He even saw a familiar suitcase off to the side. It was his of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the....where am I?\" Nate asked himself, wandering what was up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly however, the door burst open, with Erin coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready yet?\" she asked with a wide smile. \"Mom and Dad want to leave soon.\"</span></div></div>",

No way was he letting anybody get a hold on his candies now that he knew of their true abilities.

In fact, he made sure to grab a few more and store them in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please stop stashing candy and just get your shoes on?\" his sister asked, rolling her eyes in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...\" Nate said with a nervous smile before slumping over and seeing his shoes on the floor.

Her tongue now causes serious sexual stimulation to her when it is in contact with me. Whenever I say \"yes\" within the next 5 hours she will orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this you walk into the living room.

I.... Have to go. We can't be on a date. I'm 25. You are way too young.\" She explained.<br>\r\nA little shocked you hesitate \"but.\"<br>\r\n\"You're a good looking kid, but we are just too world's apart in age.\" Said Kate. \"Are you okay if we just pretend this never happened?\"<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment... A little sad. Then you smirk a little as you look up at her and say \"yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's eyes go wide as she squirms in the sofa an let's out a muffled Yelp. Her face goes red and her hands spring to her crotch as she orgasms right in front of Nate.<br>\r\n\"What the h.... Did you do that Nate?\" She gasps as she looks at you. A look of bewilderment and shock behind her now red face.<br>\r\nYou smile again, \"yes.\"<br>\r\nShe gasps as she arches back with another orgasm. \"Stop Nate.\" She quiet pleads as she tries to get her composure. <br>\r\nYou just lean in closer to her. She puts a hand against you chest to keep you at a distance. You smile and say \"yes, yes, yes.\" <br>\r\nHer eyes go wide and then shut as she experiences another orgasm, she moans and clutches your shirt in a fist. She barely manages to look up at you when her body shivers from a second orgasm. Her body arches back and she pulls on your shirt accidentally pulling you face to hers. Her other handholding her head. She barely gets another look at you before another orgasm pounds her body. This time a little smile is apparent on her face. She grabs your shoulder with her other hand and pulls your face to hers. Her body is sweaty and hot. She is panting heavily. \"What the @#$*&amp; was that Nate?\" <br>\r\nYou smile, your cock is super hard, you lean in to her and gently whisper \"Yes, Yes, Yes,\" again.<br>\r\n\"No, uuugghhh, Nate, how is, ooooohhhhh ahhh, this possib....gaaaahh...\" She lay slouched in the couch, sweating profusely, her body shaking, while weakly clutching you. She lay grinning. \"That, was, amazing.\" She whispered. She gently pushed you backward untill you were laying on your back. She pulled herself on top of you the best she could, and began grinding your shaft through your pants against her drenched crotch. She seemed to be sapped of all energy as she slowed, and quietly lay on you. Her eyes barely open and her mouth drooling. She tried kissing you but literally fell limp, asleep atop of you.<br>\r\nShe was now sound asleep breathing heavily. <br>\r\nYou realized you went overboard. And the poor woman was asleep on you.... \"Figures,\" you say aloud. You try wiggling out from under her but in her sleep she winds her arms around you and intertwines her legs with yours. You are stuck. There is one saving grace. The TV remote is within arms reach. You grab it and turn it on. The Flash is on. You leave it on hoping you can distract yourself from your aroused state that won't be released any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is really starting to feel heavy. You wiggle around to try an get her laying side by side with you. But the couch isn't big enough. You maneuver a hand into your pocket to retrieve the two candies. You pop one into your mouth and say aloud \"I wish this couch was large enough for sleeping on.\" The couch makes the groaning sound of wood and the treating sound of fabric as the seat area lengthens out about 2 feet. You are easily able to lay her beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She roles to her back. Man she looks hot.  You sit up facing her and get an idea. The candy in your mouth is almost gone and you start saying, \"when I say so all these changed will happen in the order I said them. Your bra and panties will change into soft, white lingerie. It will be quite dainty and sheer. The fabric will be a high quality silk. Your white top and blue jeans will change as well. The top will become a small, red, spandex top that shows off your belly. Your jeans will turn into white yoga pants that are very tight around your ass and legs. Now for your body. Your hips they are going to get wider. Your ass, it is small and cute now but will grow large for your size. To accompany it your legs will become more curvy and womanly. Your vagina lips will become larger and fill out more. Your lips will become a little bigger. Your breasts will grow big and perky with beautifully developed nipples. They will be easily visible through your thin top. It is very easy for you to achieve arousal and stimulation with me. Any simulation I give you will be unnaturally strong and satisfying. When you orgasm it will be more powerful and last longer than what is natural.\" With that the candy finished dissolving and you watched with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see a slight shifting under her shirt as her bra thins and becomes lingerie. Her long sleeve top began shrinking and tightening as it goes from white, to pink, to a deep red. The top shrank more until it left her shoulders and everything above her  breasts bare. Her belly was visible and hot, turning you on.  Her jeans began Turing white and became tight exposing any detail of he body. You notice her vagina bump was naturally a nice size. There is a soft popping sound as her hips widen in one pulse of motion. She moans slightly. You straddle her belly facing her hips. You hold them firmly for a second before moving your hands southward to her ass. You watch and feel as her but begins to swell and tighten. You are so turned on by it. It continues to swell and grow. When it stops you wonder if you over did it as her ass seems too large for her dainty legs. That's when you see her legs filling out. Her thighs thicken and her calves grow, her legs fill out and look way hot with her new caboose. You turn your body around and straddle her hips looking at her face. You expect to see her lips swell but she moans instead. You quickly turn in time to see her nice vagina bump swell larger.  Your attention goes to her face as her lips grow a little. They look awesome. Your hands greedily dart under her clothes as you hold her tits. Her cute A cups begin to swell in your hands. They grow in a rhythmic pulsing, pushing outward like a heartbeat. You pull your hand out as it starts getting tight. You love the way her boobs are turning out. As they pulse and stretch past a c cup you grin. They pulse more as they pull the red spandex outward exposing sexy cleavage, they seem to settle around double D while her nipples poke behind the fabric nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go upstairs and Chang into your PJ's. They are simply sweat pants and a t-shirt. You head back downstairs but not after adding a few more candies to you pocket. You are starting to feel a little tired so you snuggle up next to her, her eyes open a little, she smiles when her eyes meet yours. She turns you to your side facing away from her and she spoons you. She holds you very tight not even noticing her large breasts against your back. One of her amazing legs intertwines with yours. She yawns a bit and kisses your neck as she drifts off. You begin to drift off. And you too fall asleep</span></div></div>",

You arch back as you are about to ejaculate. She quickly pulls off and covers your penis head with a paper towel, catching your load. You want heavily. She walks to the kitchen and you watch her lovely ass as it strains the fabric of her yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When she bends over to the garbage can you see her bulging vagina pushing against the fabric. Your soft member starts hardening again. She starts walking back and chuckles at your penis as it hardens again. \"Already?\" She says slyly. \"So, Nate, what did you do to my body? Not that I entirely mind.\" She stands on the couch and starts pulling her yoga pants off. She rocks her hips back and forth and side to side as she sexily strips them off. She kneels close and pulls off her top exposing a straining lingerie against her amazing tits. She unbuttons the lingerie and dropped it to the side. \"Nate, I don't know what you did you me. But I hope I can at least make you feel half as good as you made me feel yesterday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she pulled off her panties. She began grinding your shaft.

She starts riding you more aggressively and let's out you name as she arches back tightening around your cock. The orgasm explodes through her making her Yelp in surprise. \"Oh wow!\" She exclaims as the orgasm holds out longer.

Her tongue extendong out of her wet mouth sucking your tongue and lips intermittently. You love it. The candy dissolves between you both as she pulls away.

A few moments later you cum and she orgasms. But your cock seems to get bigger inside her. Kate rotates while you are in her to face away from you. She grabs her breasts in extacy as you both finish again. You felt an odd sensation this time. You can't quite feel her tightly around your cock. And when she fondles her big tits it feels like she is fondling your cock. You and her orgasm again. You see her turn and smile at you. \"My body feels amazing Nate. She is caressing her ass, waist, tits, and limbs. You love the feeling.you can feel her doing it as if your cock was receiving the simulation.

Cock. You realize your groin is fused with her. You let off a load but this time Kate moans and arches her back. Her moan is cut short by a surge of cum erupting from her throat. And out her mouth. It files across your legs and the couch. And then another surge of cum with another orgasm. And another and another. Kate getting smaller each time. You have to close your eyes and arch back from the pleasure. Your hands around her waist rubbing her up and down aggressively. After about 5 min you realize that you are just holding your erect cock. You open your eyes. Your cock has a new size. About double what it used to be. You don't quite know what to think. Then you feel it. An uncomfortable pressure in your body. You feel your waist thin and your bones shift. Your body becomes shorter. You see locks of blonde hair begin cascading into your vision. You lips feel bigger. Your hips painfully erupt outward with an audible Pop! Your ass thickens and swells. You are overwhelmed with please and start blacking out. The last thing you remember is the feeling of your chest getting heavy just before you let a load off, accompanied by the best and most pleasing full body sensation ever.

Kate's voice. \"Touch me Nate. I want to feel it again.\" Your member arouses a little. You lightly thought your member and hear Kate in your head muffle happily.

Your cock feels great, but in addition your body gets aroused and heated. Your cock swells bigger. You can't believe how big it is. It stands at 7 inches and is about as thick as a caulking gun.

It's like a headache.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you both rest a while Kate speaks up again. \"We should go have sex with someone. I seriously am craving.\"<br>\r\nYou don't know what to say. You were feeling great just with her. \"A sexy nurse would be nice.\" You say.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, really? Let's go to a hospital saying that you have a sharp pain in your penis and groin.,\" She continues, \"you should wish that when women see me they get aroused. They should get dirty thoughts that stimulate them. When touching me they will be stimulated perfectly and orgasm easy. Wish for it Nate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get aroused at the idea. Kate moans slightly. \"Be aroused Nate. It's amazing\"<br>\r\nAs your member begins to hardening you go to your room. You pop a candy in your mouth and wish for the changes to happen to kate. <br>\r\nYou start getting aroused so much that you fall back on your bed. Within a spit second your cock went from soft and small to it's full 7 inches and thick. You grabbed it and speedily cause an orgasm between you both. You reach and grab the tissue box in the nick of time to cover your cock and catch it all.<br>\r\nKate was moaning loudly in your mind and you rolled your eyes. It felt amazing though.<br>\r\n\"Roll your eyes all you want, I like it best when you arouse us but don't think I can't as well.\" As Kate said this you felt aroused. She was stimulating herself somehow. You cock grew again nto its impressive stature and she kept stimulating. You wanted it to finish. You wanted to cum. But she was holding it back. She was gasping and moaning as she held it in. Finally you both came together in a similar moan of pleasure. You lay there feeling amazing. Kate did too. \"Let's rest and go to the hospital in the morning,\" you say. She sexily wished you good night. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is probably best to just wish everything away if things get worse.<br>\r\n You open the door to see a young female cop and an older guy cop. \"Are you the one who called in the party?\" The older cop asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You say nervously.<br>\r\n\"Thanks kid,\" the woman says. Your eyes gaze at her long blonde hair and full lips. Her petit frame and small breasts lead to an erupting set of sexy hips and lean legs and ass. Kate starts getting aroused.<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" The woman scoldsvas you look back to her face. The older cop chuckles and says goodnight as he starts to walk off. the female cop asked a few more questions about the party and if I saw or recognized any who got away. As she seemed to be wrapping up the visit you pop a candy in your mouth. You mutter quietly, \"this hot cop will need to use the restroom badly and ask to borrow ours, the older cop will drive off absent-mindedly thinking that he dropped off this hot cop on his way home. Her clothing will start to turn braless, tight and revealing over the next few minutes.\"<br>\r\nKate giggled in anticipation as the officer suddenly looked flustered and asked for a restroom. You abliged and showed her in. You watched as the squad car drove off. You quickly dashed upstairs to grab another candy. You wished that your family lived in another part of town. You had your own home due to investing in successfully companies when you were ten. Your home isn't too nice, but it does seem a little luxurious for this part of town. You watch as everything changes. Your room expands the desk grows and your bed looks to be the size of 2 King beds. You don't watch the rest of the changes. You hear the bathroom flush and dart downstairs. You stand in front of the bathroom door and pull your pants down. Kate was full and erect. As the door opened the officer gasped and turned her head looking away. She opened her mouth to scold you but stopped as she felt sexual stimulation. She looked at your dick again and breathed in feeling the stimulation. You watched as her clothes were slowly shrinking and changing.her uniform was already turned into a light blue tanktop that showed her belly a little and snug jeans. She kept looking away then back. Over and over. Each time getting more aroused and flushed. Her top was now tiny single strap top that hugged tightly around her torso completely exposing her belly. Her jeans had now become tight grey yoga pants that came just past the knee. You step closer to her and say \"I'll make you feel amazing.\" You walk up the stairs to your room and lay on your bed you take off your clothes and sit cross-legged. Your member huge and throbbing as is arches skyward. A few moments later the officer enters the room. Her top now a sheer mocri bikini and her pants now a thin sheer skirt. She crept in a little confused. She crept onto the bed and looked at your member in amazment as she felt another wave of stimulation. Her hand went to her crotch as she began rubbing herself. <br>\r\nYou lay on your back and motion for her to join you. She looks around and hesitantly moves over to you. Her skirt is now gone and her bikini as well. She straddles you completely naked. She moves forward to position her vagina above your tip. She hesitates and looks at you embarrassed. She timidly presses down on your tip as it slides in. She gasps ad her eyes get wider as her body is rocked with pleasure. You swiftly strike upward penetrating her right pussy completely and burying your shaft into her. Kate let's out a moan of pleasure and the officer yelps in surprise. The officer begins expertly rocking up and down as she orgasms 3 times. On the fournth orgasm you an Kate unload into her as all three of you let out a cry of extasy.</span></div></div>",

The officer pressed into you engulfing your dick fully, she started twerking you off. She muffled a moan, \u201chow is this still feeling so good??\u201d She exclaimed.<br>\r\nSuddenly Kate started moaning in your mind. She kept trying to say something but was cut off when she exploded cum into the officer. The excess cum spilling out was glowing like your dick. Within a few seconds it began magically retracting back inside the officer. The officer gasped in surprise as energy exploded into her. <br>\r\nHer eyes began glowing white like your dick. As her mouth opened you could see light coming from the back of her throat. Then she orgasmed. Very hard. Her whole body shook and arched back. Then she pulled her face forward breathing heavily. Then she giggled, and smiled. Kissing you as your member still vibrates within her. \u201cNate,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s me, Kate.\u201d You looked at her dumbfounded. \u201cKate?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\nShe sat up and began inspecting the officers body. \u201cI think I can alter her from the inside.

Her police skills will come in handy. First off, I want her physical skills and body enhanced. Then, make her pussy out of this world. I want it to be overwhelmingly satisfying, for her and I. Now, I\u2019ve always fanticized about slightly oversized hips. Yeah, let\u2019s giver her some. Her tits, should be slightly bigger. Make them perky. Too perky. I want her breasts to be tilted upwards. Her nipples should be sensitive to the point of orgasm. I want her to be able to give incredible blowjobs beyond my wildest dreams. And lastly. Only I can giver her sexual pleasure, and she loves it.\u201d<br>\r\nKate grinned through the officer\u2019s body. She began flexing the officer\u2019s body and grinding your shaft vibrating within her. She gasped as her body began growing and tightening. You could feel her getting a little heavier as her body firmed and grew. She was about 6 and a half feet tall now. Kate smiled as she sat up. She let out a suprized giggle as energy focused in her pussy. A yelp escaped her as you felt her pussy lips thicken. You looked down and watched as her cletoris began swelling till the size of a large gum ball. You grinned at the sight, then looked a little puzzled as her pussy began budding another cletoris behind the first. Then you felt another bud bloom behind the second out of sight. Over and over the budding swelled further and deeper into her vagina. All the while making her pussy softer and tighter. Kate let out a suprized orgasm. She grabbed your hands and pulled them to her hips and ass. She focused as energy pooled into her pelvis she breathed heavily. With a jolt her hips exploded outward. Kate looked down. \u201cWoa, my hips are huge.\u201d You squeez her hips and then feel her ass and legs swell to compensate. Her hips, ass, and curvy legs dwarfed her tight toned waist. Kate kissed you as she moaned from heat and pleasure. Her tongue danced with yours as you felt her tits swell a few times and her nipples harden as they sprung to life, perking upwards. As you and Kate rocked back and forth she kept kissing you intently. You felt her lips swell a little and her tongue grow longer. She kept tonguing you until her tongue couldn\u2019t be contained. She farted her flexible 7 inch tongue out of the corner of her mouth as she continued kissing you heavily. Her tongue inching further and further. Before you realized it her tongue had looped around the back of your neck and back up to your mouth... and back in. Woa, she was using it to press your faces harder together. She began moaning. And moaning. Then looked past you as her mouth opened into a painful looking smile. She let out a long moan as her body arched back and the energy erupted from her as you both let out an orgasm. The officer, no longer possessed by Kate snapped out of it and slumped on top of you. She cooed as she lay asleep on top of you. </span></div></div>",

He popped a new candy and said, \"I wish for a better car.\" Once again, thanks to your vagueness, much randomness occurs, as these candies seem to have a sense of humor. A vortex opens from the hole where the first car fell through your ceiling, and a second, more expensive looking car falls through your ceiling, crushing the first car. It was a green Ferrari-like sports car, but pink slits on the headlights. Above the headlights were two small chain guns. On the front, in front of the grill was a titanium cowcatcher. \"What is this, Mad Max's Ferrari?\" Nate wonders as he looks over the car. Inside he saw fuzzy dice around the rearview mirror. On the dash were three bobbleheads. Nate recognized two of the bobbleheads, one was Hatsune Miku, and the other was Mila Kunis, but something was off. He saw that the Miku bobblehead had cat ears and a tail, and the Mila bobblehead had fox ears and a tail. The third bobblehead was a woman in a small top that looked like it was one part jersey and one part sports bra, and was wearing sneakers and a short pleated skirt, holding a basketball. The top and skirt go together like they were a uniform, and this woman, who was black, had very long dark hair, as well as very large breasts, but the most noticeable features were her spotted cow ears and tail, as well as her tiny horns and bulging udder between her legs. Looking through the windshield, Nate sees on the placard the name, \"Vanessa Okkonala, #89, Raleigh Samurai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he scratches his head in confusion, Nate hears something bumbling about in the trunk. Seeing the keys in the ignition, he figures, \"I should see what's in there...\" but then as he grabs the keys, he stops. \"...but what if what's in there is in there for good reason, like it's dangerous... No, I have to see.\" He grabs an aluminum bat from his closet, \"but just in case...\" He makes his way to the back. As he does, he notices the license plate. It said it was a North Carolina license plate, and even said, \"First in Flight, \" but instead of the usual design, it an anime-ish design of two catgirls in period for 1903 flying the Wright Brothers plane at Kitty Hawk. \"What the...?\" The bumbling grew louder, and Nate heard a voice. It sounded female!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Nate fumbled with the keys, saying, \"I'll get you out, miss!!\" He finally found the trunk key and opened the trunk. Suddenly, a girl burst out, throwing off rope and shackles. \"Nya!! That's better!!\" As rope landed on his head, Nate could only stare in disbelief. This girl wasn't just similar to your next door neighbor, long-time friend, and secret crush Kate Smith, she was was her exact double!! ...Well, except for a couple of details. Swishing behind her was an orange tabby cat tail just under five feet in length, and instead of human ears, higher up on her head, in her hair, were two orange cat ears. To your shock, you hear groaning behind her, and see a woman almost identical to Kate's mother Hilary behind her, except with the same orange cat ears and tail, but she looked almost twenty years younger than the Hilary Smith you know. This woman looked like she could blend in as a college co-ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neko Kate said, rubbing head and the base of her tail, \"I can't believe Reggie (Janet Day's mom) would resort to cheating like this before a race...\" She suddenly looked around and said, \"Wait?! How did we get in Yukiko's room?\" Then she looked down at Nate, who had been staring petrified in confusion the whole time at her. Locking eyes, they stared at one another, as though having a moment of recognition, before both screaming in abject terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It kind of surprised you as to how feminine you were acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, better watch myself\" you said to yourself, still smiling as if you were somewhat kidding. Maybe you were enjoying this a bit too much, but you weren't concerned at all. With that done, you started walking out of your parents room and started to head downstairs. You nodded how your hips and butt seemed to sway side to side as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pretty nice\" you said with a smile. It was kind of odd to be hearing this older feminine voice but you weren't complaining. Placing some of the candies in a bag, you walked down the staircase to where your 3 siblings were doing stuff. Trevor and Nicole were having breakfast currently while Erin was watching tv. That's where you decided to go first. Avoiding Thomas and Nicole, you walked right into the family room where Erin was. She turned around and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reaction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only after being at work for 3 hours did I realize I was not wearing my clothes, but wearing yours, how did this happen?<br>\r\n- Beats me...<br>\r\n- Wait... (she looks at you carefully and gets surprised) Why are you wearing my clothes?!<br>\r\n- Your what...? Uoohh yeahh wierd... (You try to look surprised)<br>\r\nYour mother, worried about still needing to return to her job, looks at you and tells you to take off 'her' clothes while she removes her black pumps, saying that your outfit was the only clean stuff she had for work.<br>\r\nYou say OK and start to take of 'her' yellow shirt with homer simpson on it as she starts taking off 'your' black pencil skirt. You look at her and ask if she would prefer to change in another place, she looks at you and tells you not to be ashamed of seeing his own mother naked, to wich you reply ok...<br>\r\nShe takes off the shirt from work and her black pantyhose and starts giving it to you as you give all your clothes to her, even your briefs. After she takes off her black lacy bra and panties, she starts putting on your clothes as quickly as possible, telling you that maybe you should also put on the clothes she was just wearing. You do what she said, starting by her panties. You slide them up your legs and feel a bit wierd, you never expected the switch to come out like this. As you stop fitting your stuff in the under sized panties, they start fitting properly on your body and next you put on the bra, wich seems a bit pointless since you don't need one but your mother insists that you shouldn't go around leaving your 'breasts' swinging around inside the blouse, to wich you raise your eyebrow looking at her. You try putting on the pantyhose but to much work you can't seem to get the hang of the thing, with your mother finishing putting on your shirt and mocking you for not being able to do something you have been doing since your 8 years old. After she puts on your shoes, she give a hand with the nylons and hands you the blouse. Without any proble you put on the blouse, and the skirt. You look at you and start realizing that your mom's clothes are resizing to your body and you notice the same happening with your mom too. After that, she runs off to work just saying bye and we'll talk later about this... After she leaves...</span></div></div>",

The bartender was offering complimentary drinks to guests of Nate's party, special blueberry and raspberry sodas. Heather loved raspberries, and Carly had already got a blueberry soda, highly fond of blueberries, and was already taking her first sip. \"Hey, girlfriend!!\" Carly said, seeing Heather. Heather sat down and began to talk with Carly. \"Isn't this neat, being in this park? So much to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly added, \"It's so awesome Nate's folks agreed to have his party at Pleasure Island!! I've always heard of this place, but never got to go.\" Heather wondered what Carly was saying; she could have swore this place was fictional just moments ago, but shrugged it off as she drank some of the soda. Carly drank more, think time forgoing the straw the soda jerk had provided. \"Wow!! This soda is so good!!\" Suddenly, rhythmic techno music started to play. Carly said, \"Hey, let's dance!!\" She pulls Heather up onto the dance floor, but not before chugging down another good portion of her soda first. Heather didn't mind taking to the dance floor, but never took Carly for a techno fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the music pulsed, the lighting started to as well. At the same time, under Carly's sundress, a ropey appendage starts growing out of her spine. As Heather sways her hips, Carly starts to feels feelings she never felt before towards Heather. \"Wow, you're so hHAAAWt!!\" Carly fails to notice the braying sound in her own voice over the techno music, but Heather swears something didn't seem right. Both Carly and Heather's moves start to get move provocative, and Heather tosses off her jacket, revealing her black spaghetti strap tank top. As Heather starts to gyrate her ear at Carly, she watches it, but somehow is so flustered she fails to see (and Heather fails to feel) a donkey tail rip out of the seat of her jeans. The sight of the dance mood makes Carly blush, and as she does, her ears elongate into long grey donkey ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Carly can't take it any longer, and leans in, grabs Heather by the head, and plants a loving kiss on her lips, The lesbian act shocks Heather out of her reverie and whatever haze the music had put her in, allowing her to see the changes to Carly's body, including the most shocking one currently in progress!! As Carly pulls away, Heather watches as a strange bulge fills the front of her sundress, followed by a rip, as her panties hit the dance floor. With glazed eyes, Carly asks, \"You wanna HAAWW-ve some fun?\" Heather sees light grey hairs beginning to bud between her breasts, and that's when she looked at herself to see the tail on her rear, and some light brown hairs in her own cleavage. Heather then remembered where she heard the name 'Pleasure Island' before. \"Oh god, we're turning to donkeys!!\" Carly steps toward Heather, semi-hooved feet slipping out of mules (love the coincidence) she wore, but Heather was starting to feel an odd new attraction for Carly, like a pleasant aroma coming from her, but she tried to shake it off. \"We...\" Carly lifted her sundress to reveal what Heather had began to suspect, a massive erect donkey penis and hairy grey testicles dangle between her legs. \"We..\"</span></div></div>",

Through the transparent door, Heather saw her friend paw at door with new hooves, trying in vain to force it open, animal hormones and instincts more and more guiding her. Heather finally can no longer look at the disturbing sight of her best friend becoming not only a donkey, but a male donkey to boot, and begins to step away, crying, when a scream a little bit in the distance caught her attention. Looking up, she saw Kate's cousin Penny, a 17 year old tomboyish girl like Kate with short red hair and green eyes, trying to run in a panic, from what Heather wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she saw another woman well into a transformation into a jack. It was Bethany Farmer, Nate's aunt. Even though her face was already partially changed into a muzzle and most of her body was that of a male donkey, she still had the tattered remained of the blouse and khakis she had been wearing when she showed up for Nate's birthday party, and she had the same earrings in her long donkey ears. Suddenly, Penny tripped, and as she rose, Penny suddenly regretted she had wore miniskirt today, as the almost completely bestial Bethany used the garment to her advantage to mount her. \"Nooo!! Not me too!!\" Penny screamed, as suddenly, the girl, whom up until now was devoid of donkey features, rapidly grew donkey ears and a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grit her teeth, unable to do anything as she couldn't bring herself to not look away from the unnatural pairing turn the girl more and more into a donkey as Bethany's changes wrapped up, her face fully becoming a muzzle as her hair, save a mane, fell out, and outside of her earrings and human eyes (though there was no higher intellect glistening in them), there was no trace of the woman known as Bethany Farmer, just a male donkey. Moments later, as the male donkey formerly known as Bethany finished, all that was left of Penny was a jenny, a female donkey, however, Penny still had her human hair on her head. \"This place is a nightmare.\" Heather utters with her hands over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a squirrel with the pouch of candies ran by, and an anthro donkey Nate and a mostly human Kate (she had just ears and a tail, like Heather), were close behind, and they...</span></div></div>",

Unless you destroy me, your form will bend to my whim, unless you happen to be a Zen master or some kind of master sorcerer.\" He bites Nate's still furry hand and forced him to drop him. \"With these candies, I can now take my show on the road. Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightning bolt strikes near the squirrel's feet, making him jump back. \"Not so fast...\" It was Lynda, wholly untouched by the island's magic, along with Erin, Trevor, Nicole, but Erin was sporting her own tail, and it seemed there was something wrong with Trevor and Nicole's eyes. Believing Nate was giving her an odd stare, she said nervously, trying to hide her tail, \"I couldn't resist punching a clown. He was really freaking me out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynda... We meet again... Well, I'm off.\" He conjures a gold orb and throws it down, realizing golden glitter and smoke. Booming over the island, his voice then says, \"You made a wish to make my playthings human again. As you can see, your wish is in affect, but at an infinitesimal crawl thanks to my island's magic.\" As he said, there were signs of reversions, but they were tiny. Bethany had regrown her human hair, and Penny's muzzle had returned to a normal human face, but they were still acting like feral donkeys, in fact had just started going at it again. A little ways away, there was a smashing sound and Heather saw Carly making her way out of a window, her head the only sign left she was ever a female human. \"If you want something more 'human,' then who am I to deny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink wave went over the sky. Exponentially, their de-donkification sped up, However, their ears and tails weren't going away, so Kate and Heather worried when they noticed they weren't changing back at all. The mating donkeys brays changed to moans, but everyone noticed they weren't stopping, that in fact seem just as vested in mating as they were as mindless beasts. As breasts grew back in on the two, they noticed their breasts her growing much larger than what they were when they were normal. Their rears swelled as well, as Bethany's testicles pulled back into her, reopening her vagina. However, her equine member was still there, and still at work. Penny moaned as everyone gasped, growing her own equine unit. Their hair was now blonde, as tight tube tops and micro miniskirts wrapped around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing upright again, the two hermaphrodite donkey girls finished as they made out. As soon as they did, Penny turned Bethany around and said, \"Like, now it's my turn.\" before reciprocating. Heather looked over to Carly, and saw she was just as blonde, slutty, and hermaphroditic as those two, looking twice as old as she used to be, dressed in a halter top that gave a free view of much of the underside of her now I-cup boobs, donkey penis lifting up a pleated schoolgirl miniskirt as her donkey tail swished behind her. The sounds of Bethany and Penny caught Carly's donkey ears and she licked her lips, drawing her attention to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can now see, I'm not over my donkey fetish yet, but just for you, I brought back an oldie, but goodie; futa bimbos!! Now we have futa donkey girl bimbos!!\" the evil squirrel's voice boomed as Carly pounced Penny from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That monster...\" Kate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they looked over to Nate, and saw he was now a large-chested girl with donkey ears and tail, which must be the parallel to the donkey form he had. \"Are you... all there, Nate?\" Heather asked, worried if Nate's brain had diminished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is!!\" Nate yelled. \"More importantly, though, how is it mom was not affected, or was able to shoot lightning, or seemed to know that squirrel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate tacked on, \"And what's with Trevor and Nicole's eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda led them into the juice bar Heather just escaped from, destroyed the bartender, who turned out to be an illusion, and re-barricaded the door. \"It's a long story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda cast a spell that erected a barrier around the interior of the bar. \"Alright. As long as this barrier is up, you don't have to worry about getting transformed any further, but we can't stay here forever, because he will take notice, and will react. Now gather 'round.\" With everyone gathered around, she says, \"First and foremost, Trevor and Nicole are under a glamour that essentially renders them blind and deaf to this world. As far as they know, we're at Disney World. I do not want them to see or hear this horrible place. Would you want your child to witness such carnality?\" Everyone agreed. \"Besides, since they are children, they are pure, and cannot be touched by this island's magic. Still, I want to get them, and everyone else, off as soon as possible. Eros is a truly perverse being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eros... Wait, isn't he the embodiment of eroticism?\" Kate said. Everyone gives her an odd look. \"What? I take Latin. Eros is the root word from which we got the word erotic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Lynda said, \"and it was on this island I sealed him, 30,000 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30,000 years ago!!\" everyone but Trevor and Nicole screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, 30,000 years ago. I was abducted by aliens from my roaming nomad hunting tribe about 31,000 years ago and gifted with the knowledge of advanced technology and the powers mankind call 'magic.' They saw potential in the human race and wanted to see if I could lead my fellow humans. However, instead of inspiring, I scared my still under-evolved brethren, and that led me into isolation. During that time, I noticed I had stopped aging, and never got sick. I tried a few more times to bridge the gap with my fellow humans, but was repelled every time. Then, one day, an alien came. His, or rather, her name was Eros, for originally she was female, and claimed to the aliens that modified me that she could do what I couldn't, asking for a steep fee in return. At first, it looked like she was going to succeed, and had basically usurped the planet right out from under the humans' noses and the noses of its observers/protectors, but then I discovered she was simply mind controlling their primitive brains, using lust as a drug, and those that refused and preferred the old ways... well that's where her love of turning people into animals came from. I tried to warn my benefactors, but it fell on deaf ears, so much so that at one point they threatened to take away my gifts if I continued this course of discussion. Very soon though she began to become interested in satisfying her own perverse desires than keeping up the con. When that happened, I got a quick apology and was told to deal with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously, he... she... it, is still alive, so what happened?\" Heather interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting there. Well, as it turned out, Eros had been siphoning power in secret from the aliens without their knowledge, increasing her powers, and making new diabolical traps to transform her subjects, like the juices in this bar. I found her and challenged her a battle on this very island, but after three days straight of fighting, we knew neither of us were going to win in a straight-up brawl, plus we both had to really pee, so we called a time-out. During that time, as I was relieving myself, an idea hit me. It was a game of elixir Russian Roulette. Whomever drank the transformation potion lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then why is it Eros can't change you now?\" Kate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eros' transmutation magic can attack their victim three ways. Outside I bet you saw the first, and her favorite, carnal acts. She loves to artificially amp up the lust in an area to goad her victims into procreating. Once they do, the magic can take hold. The second is negative emotions and actions, like anger, rudeness, impoliteness, and foul language. This method is the famous one shown in the Disney version of 'Pinocchio.' Basically, act like an ass, become an ass... or whatever form of the month Eros is in the mood for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, if I hadn't of cursed at Eros while we were chasing him, I would never have learned what having a tail feels like.\" Kate said holding her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be continued (due to length...)</span></div></div>",

While someone with magical power can resist or even nullify the first two methods her attack, like I can, the third can strike anyone, but unlike mere mortals, potion consumption will not destroy the mind, just change you physically, and also seal some of your powers, because even though you still have a magic-enhanced mind and soul, you still have to deal with the biological fact that your brain is just simply smaller, and therefore incapable of drawing all the mana you once could. Well, you get the point, at any rate, I got her to agree, and I even let her pick the type of potion, which happened to be male squirrel, her favorite at the time. We went at it, twelve potions on a Lazy Susan, at first all but one merely delicious placebos. However, in Round 11... I kind of cheated. With only two potions left, I picked one. It wasn't the transmutation elixir, obviously, but I subtly used my magic to make her think it was, changing myself into a male squirrel. Cocky as can be, she took up the last elixir in celebration and readily drank it down while laughing at me. Joke was on her as she was a quarter-way into her change as I changed back. As she was changing, her powers her in flux, giving me time to weave spells to seal her to the island and attach a parasite that saps her power, keeping her from trying to simply regenerating her power over time... however, now with some of those candies I gave Nate for his birthday, she may just have the means to regain her former form, and possibly extend her power beyond this isle, and if she gets the rest of the candies, she could break the seal on her body and be free to move about the universe again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... sucks. All I was doing was trying to remember the name of that island on  that TV show where your dreams come true with Ricardo Maltoban in it, which I now know is 'Fantasy Island,' and we ended up here because I was so certain 'Pleasure Island' was the right name and daydreamed about it while eating one of these dumb things.\" Heather lamented, holding up a candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda looked to Nate. \"How many candies did Eros manage to steal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate rummages through his pouch, counting the dozens of candies, and says, there were 144 in here when I got it, and now there's 140, so if you discount the one that got us here, that means she got three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not that bad. However, while we cannot allow them all to fall into Eros' hands, we can use them ourselves to defeat her once and for all.\" Lynda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate blurted, \"How? Eros said herself the candies won't work at full power while on the island!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can keep her busy, all of you can set up a sealing circle with the candies, and I can lead her into it and activate it, and forever take away her powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you do this before?\" Kate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't strong enough back then, and the candies were something I only developed recently. Also, I honestly had forgotten all about her after all these years.\" Lynda quipped. \"Now, I suggest we make for her fortress, the manor in the center of the island. More than likely, she'll be waiting for us, and will throw temptations at us, as well as command the transformed to attack us, so we must hurry, and we must focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then.\" Nate boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's end this witch!!\" Erin shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they make it safely to Eros' manor or get waylaid along the way?</span></div></div>",

When he's done, he pulls his panties back up and washes his hands which is something he would normally forget to do. Done with that, he continues on his journey through the castle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I feel really dumb about this.\" \"Thats okay. I mean how many times do you have rupees drop on you from out of nowhere?\" \"Yeah true that.

Pushing them open he witnessed probably one of the most gigantic rooms he has ever been in. It was basically the same room he degeated the final boss ( Ganondorf ) in. But instead of the evil atmosphere from the game, it was almost a wave of honor being placed upon him as if he was graduating school with his family watching. There were crowds of people in a line against the wall with many gaurds in front of them as if they were security to an event like WrestleMania. But in the midst of all that, he saw what was looking in  front of him with a smile on his jolly face. Sitting on the throne in front was a man in red robebes with a built but aged phisique. The king of Hyrule, The King Of Lions. As he rised from his throne, he held his arms out for embrace. And for some unexplaneable reason he responded to it with happieness swelling from his soul. He picked up the pace in his walk as he rushed into the king's embrace. But through his feelings he didn't realize that his transformation was finally complete. \"Welcome home my dear.\" Tears began to fall from his eyes as he laid eyes on him. He somehow felt safe and comftorable near him that he didn't realize the words he uttered to the king. \"I missed you too father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Kate could only stare with an agaped mouth. \"He said WHAT?!\" Then Nate realized something had to happen. But at the rate it was going it almost seemed hopeless. \"Well look on the brightside. He does still have the candies so he can still wish himself back.\" Nate took in rhe words of comfort as much as he could. He needed it. His eyes started to quiver as they filled with tears. He was trying to hold them back as long as he could, but the dam was starting to shake loose from the rapids in his eyes. \"I know your trying to be positive but.. I don't want to lose him! Hes my best friend and I got him into this!\" Nate couldn't take it anymore as the dam finally caved in. He bent his head over in shame as streams of tears swept across his tensed face. He kept visioning how shameful he looked in front of his girlfriend. Would she see him as a pitiful sight to her eyes? No. She knew that this was something very hard for him to go through. Not every person has thier best friend stuck in a fictional world while turning into anther entirely different person. She took grasp of Nates chin as she looked deep into his depressioned soul. And in one quick sigh, pushed her lips agaibst his in a passionate kiss. Nates eyes went from straigned to open and wide in shock. Kate's face flushed into a cherry red as she gave a comforting smile of reassurance. \"I know that this is very hard on you.. but no matter what happens I want you to kniw that there will always be a shoulder for you let your eyes flood to. Crying dosn't make you weak, it just proves you have the humility to have such feelings for someone.\" Nate couldn't express words on how much of a girl he had that teully cared about him through thick and thin. He dried up his eyes that still bared tears that weren't from his saddened state, but from his touched heart. \"Than... thanks Kate.\"</span></div></div>",

Nate quickly comes up with a new plan. He says with the same candy in his mouth, \"How about I wish for the abridged version?\" Suddenly, all the paper condenses in on itself, and becomes a CD, labeled, \"Candies of Change Rulebook: The Abridged Series.\" Below that, it says, \"As narrated by LittleKuriboh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we should play it...\" Tommy mentions, staring at the disk. They put the disk in the stereo and begin listening. Right away, the iconic voice of famed abridger LittleKuriboh came on, saying, \"What am I doing here? Who are you people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background Marik says, \"Just read the &amp;^*$(# script go we can go home, lest you want to watch the super secret commentary tracks on the 4Kids dub of One Piece again that you can only access by hitting up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, menu, then select where they discuss their original plan to have every character voiced by Dan Green and Rachel Lillis, for they said it works so well for FunImation. Seriously!! Half their characters are voiced by Christopher Sabat. What the hell are they going to do when he retires or gets mauled by a bear, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mauled by a bear?\" LK asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or something... Uh... Er... Shut the &amp;%^# up... NO!! Don't shut the &amp;$^% up, read your lines, and compliment my motorcycle so we can all go home!!\" Marik barks at the funnyman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...\" LK says, ruffling papers over the mic. He reads from the script the rules, boiled down to their basic language. \"Congratulations on acquiring the Candies of Change, a powerful non-San Francisco-based treat that can grant many of your wishes, or end the world, depending on how much of a dick you are. While powerful, they are not all-powerful. For that, you'll need to snort crystal math, and only quantum physicists know how to cook up pure math. Wait, 'crystal math' what the hell... Bah, I'm not worrying about it. I just want to get out of here and get lush off my ass so I can forget all about the idiot who abducted me in the first place and kept trying to do god awful 'attention duelists' jokes every five seconds. Anyway, here are the rules...\" Nate takes out a notebook and pencil, jotting down what is said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, no one may lose their life as a direct result of the candies' power, so this means you can't wish people or places dead, but we aren't held liable if say you wish for a giant robot, hit a building, and a piece of rubble falls and swishes a puppy. That's an indirect consequence. As an addendum, if you make a wish that turns a male into a female then they become pregnant, or are wished pregnant, the baby can neither be unwished, nor can the former male be turned back into a male at that time. The child must be carried to term and delivered before any female to male wishes would be allowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, LK goes on, \"Second, wishes need not be vocalized. Even thinking in the way of 'I wish' while one is in your mouth is enough activate the candies' power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate scribbles this down, saying, \"Nice to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third, be specific. If you leave too much to chance, the candies will generate a random response, and they have a penchant to lean toward doing things for the lolz, but sometimes for the evulz. For instance, if you simply say, 'I wish for a car,' you could get Lamborghini, or you could get a rusted over '82 Toyota Tercel with a broken muffler, and it's on fire... and there's a dead hooker in the trunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Tommy gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly, whatever you wish, remember, you can't unwish it for another 37 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik chimed in from the background, \"Wait? 37 hours? Who made these things? The same people who made the 'Range Game' for the 'Price is Right?' Next thing you'll be telling to spay and neuter my pets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLK adds, \"Well, actually, that's the last bit here on the script...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik yells, \"You have to be shitting me...\" The disk devolves into muttering amongst themselves over the script and Bob Barker, then it ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate finished writing his notes and says, \"Well, that was weird but informative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy smiles and quips, \"You did ask for the abridged version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate holds up a candy to the light and asks, \"Well, what should we do then?\"</span></div></div>",

Nate knows the intent in Tommy's eyes, and knows he's planning some kind of prank on him with that glare, and Nate quickly gulps one into his cheek. \"Draw.\" Tommy declares. There's a flash, and both Nate and Tommy double over, bodies shifting, frames lightening.

Hah!! Beat that!!\" Nate thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><i>***Flashback End***</i></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHips were widening, waists were narrowing, faces were becoming more delicate. Tommy groped his soon to be massive melons. Nate smirked, seeing his reflection, his face and hair having fully changed into that of the virtual idol. \"Knew you'd do something with Vocaloid, but I got a surprise for you...\" Nate stood tall as his clothes began to take the form of Miku's iconic grey sleeveless top, necktie, detached sleeves, pleated skirt, and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had sat down to combat the initial pains of the change, but now was physically the spitting image of Rei Miyamoto, and his pants had already changed into Rei's ever-so-short Fujimi High uniform skirt. Suddenly, he can no longer stand sitting anymore, his... her spine on fire. \"What did you do?\" Tommy yelled as nubs shot out of her hips just above her groin, shredding her boxers. Before she can fall to the ground, these nubs had already grown into fully formed limbs, resembling human legs, but as the distance between the four legs grew, course brown hairs grew over her legs and \"second torso,\" her feet being forced onto the balls as they extend, toes fusing into hooves, legs becoming fully equine as the new legs and old legs finally finished stretching apart. A fine sandy blonde horse tail began flicking behind Tommy as his t-shirt changed to match the uniform skirt, completing the Fujimi High uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Centaur, eh... Not bad...\" Tommy smirks, not surprised when her voice comes out matching the character she now resembles. \"Now for your twist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate moaned, \"Wha...\" his voice in the process of becoming Miku's, looking around as the last of... her body hair fell away and A-cup breast grew on her chest. That was when everything went silent, but only for a moment. Nate saw why, and found her ears gone, but just as quickly as they vanished, two new black furred cat ears shot out the top of her head. A loud ringing ripped through Nate's head, the sensation of sound being returned to her world, and with enhanced clarity to boot, was actually giving Nate a mild headache. Her new ears twitched as she heard Erin talking upstairs on the phone, her mom calling the Smith's over to join them for dinner in the kitchen while Mike is cooking lasagna, and Nicole &amp; Trevor playing football with their friends... next door. Finally, a black tail pierced her panties, then pierced through her skirt just below the skirt's waistband. It grew out a full 4' in length, and on the end a green ribbon manifested itself into a bow. Nate flicked her tail, mildly fascinated by the taffeta on the end, before turning back to Tommy. He realized the hidden context behind the catgirl part of the wish. \"Before you ask, I'm not doing that 'nyan cat' song.\" Nate told her, speaking in the ultra-soprano register of Miku. Tommy gave Nate her best puppy dog eyes. Tommy knew Nate couldn't stand the 'nyan cat' song, or the meme in general, but was was trying to use her moe eyes to guilt her into a song. Nate's aggravation subsided, somewhat. \"Maybe 'Melody Line...' later.\" Tommy squealed in delight, jumping up and down and skipping on her four hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Tommy uttered, \"let's go prank some more people!!\"</span></div></div>",

I'm tired of vapid airheads flaunting themselves while promoting unhealthy habits, but I think it'd be funny if shy good smart girls became the eye candy de jour!!\" Nate and Tommy cock their heads in confusion and blink. \"Just watch...\" She swishes the candy around and says, \"I wish this wish affected everyone outside of this room, that all the popular and arrogant girls, the vapid ones that build their lives on their looks, became plain and homely, and the shy, nerdy, geeky, good, innocent girls became the icons of beauty. In short, slutty bimbos will now be flat-chested average-looking girls that dress conservatively and are expected to dress that way, and pure, virgin, sweet girls that work hard and value their intellect have cartoonish F-cup and larger breasts, tiny waists that never expand no matter what they eat (unless they get pregnant of course), wide hips, dressing like total sluts in nothing but tiny tops and miniskirts, and not only is it alright for them to do so, they are encouraged to do so, even by their parents. However, the girls themselves will still remember the old world as it was, so a shy girl that would never dress like a total bimbo would be totally embarassed by her clothes, while a whorish girl will long for something more revealing. However, if they try to put something on that goes against their personality (a good girl tries to work conservative clothes, or a slut tries to wear slutty clothes), the clothes will turn into the proper clothes. Also, the smarter, nicer, and more pure &amp; innocent a girl is, the more like a cartoonish bimbo she will look, with tanner skin, bigger butt and boobs, and tinier tops and skirts, and the naughtier, meaner, dumber, and sluttier a girl is, the uglier, more flat-chested, and conservatively clothed she gets (and cannot wear skirts), and vice versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically,\" Kate said, swallowing the remnants of the candy, \"...now if the girl has a horse-face and walks around in a frumpy sweater that looks like your aunt made you and mom jeans, she's a slutty bimbo. If a girl walks by and she makes men's junk melt off, she's so polite, well-mannered, nice, and smart that she might just be the reincarnation of Buddha or the second coming of Jesus. However, the former hot girls will be in a living hell of ugliness and bad clothes, and the good clothes will die of embarrassment from wearing such skimpy clothes, despite their parents buying them for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it.\" Nate said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still don't get it.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were never the brightest bulb...\" Kate growled, and using another candy, wished for an orb to view other people. \"Now watch...\" She motions Tommy in closer. \"Show me Janet Day.\" In the orb was Janet, dressed slovenly in a long sleeve polka-dot shirt, her notorious bust now B-cups, and wearing a pair of plain slacks. Her visage, while not gross, wasn't turning heads. She looked, roughly average. \"Because Janet is such an arrogant pretty girl type, she now looks like a plain Jane.\" Kate waves her hand. \"Now show me Chrissy Gardner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy says, \"She's the biggest slut in school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate, \"Yeah... Look now.\" She shows him the girl, wrangling jocks into the bathroom for her variety of fun. However, instead of the hot sexpot Tommy recognized from his homeroom, there was an acne-laden, flat-chested, almost horse-faced girl with long, unkempt blonde hair, bad teeth and when she took off her hideous turtleneck and underlying frilled blouse, she had a hairy chest and bacne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unzip honey, and I'll like, screw your brain out, and stuff...\" she tells the jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're ugly, but god, I'm horny...\" he says, as he goes to unzip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, gross, gross!!\" Tommy yells, nearly shoving the orb out of Kate's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then says, \"Alright, now for the final example, here's Alice Walker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she the president of the A/V club, the science club, chess club, and VP of the anime club? She's got to be the biggest dork in school.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's also one of the nicest girls in schools.\" Nate reprimanded Tommy. \"Remember she raised all that money for those people that lost their homes in that tornado last year, and she never complains about being bullied by the popular girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!!\" Kate quieted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the orb, there was a girl in a bookstore with a stack of physics books and manga, reading away. She had short raven hair done in a bob that lined up even with her chin and wearing big thick coke glasses. However, her face was the epitome of beauty (by older standards), but more shocking was her body and wardrobe. She was well tanned, sporting mountainous H-cups in only a tiny red bikini top, a white leather micro miniskirt that barely covered her rear, pink belt, and red knee-high boots with five inch heels. Over her butt crack (which a tiny portion of which was exposed) was a tramp stamp, however unlike the old world order before Kate's wish, \"tramp stamps\" were now intelligent or had a positive message to them. Hers was of the Boltzmann constant, k = R / N<sub>A</sub>. \"I wish my mom would stop buying me such short skirts... It's so embarrassing!!\" Alice mutters to herself as she scratches her butt, blushing with embarrassment. Suddenly a group of popular girls, now ugly as can be, come up and start shoving her around and calling Alice names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dork!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerd!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virgin!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" One of them looks at the physics book she was reading. \"Science is like, stupid!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never be popular like us!!\" As the one who said that spoke, her teeth got more crooked, her clothes more dingy, and and she lost a few millimeters from her bust. A different girl shoves Alice down, and when she does, that popular girl's face breaks in even more acne, and she gets a hunchback. \"The new 'People' isn't in... Let's go to the mall, girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they leave, Alice is laying there, about to sob a bit, when  a girl in short shorts and a halter top with D-cup breasts working at the coffee shop in the bookstore came over and said, \"Don't worry about those girls. Means girls are a dime a dozen. Now how about I help you up?\" Alice takes the barrista's hand and gets up. After helping Alice up, her breasts expand to DD-cups, and her short shorts turn into a pleated miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you get it?\" Kate says to Tommy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls go bad, girls get gross, while nice girls get hotter the nicer they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be fun to watch,\" Nate said, adding, \"plus it'd make adultery impossible, because you'd get uglier with every misdeed!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good prank!!\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next?\" Kate says.</span></div></div>",

Without saying a word, Nate and Kate saw everything other than themselves freeze, as they are whisked to a secluded spot in what appears to be an abandoned building, with a clock tower visible. The trio then saw the hands of time accelerate around them, the clock hands spiraling ahead faster and faster, until 37 hours had passed, at which time they fall into a wormhole. While in it, a white haired asian man comes walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you kids a little young to be accredited quantum physicists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them chime out, \"Famous quantum physicist Michio Kaku!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" he nodded. \"Say, how are you kids manipulating the time stream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic candies.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what is going on?\" Kate demands to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We fell through a wormhole I had set up to pull us back to the point we initially started from, and therefore, are going backwards in time. Michi Kaku...\" Tommy seems genuinely lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know? All quantum physicists can freely travel across eleven dimensional hyperspace and manipulate string fields. I myself am on my way to a birthday party for Edwin Schrodinger and Elvis Presley on a planet mankind won't discover for centuries...\" Dr. Kaku then leans in and whispers, \"but don't tell Alan Roth. No one invited him.\" Speaking up again, he says in a booming voice, \"Well, just don't go blowing up the Earth. Lisa Randall hates it every time we got to put it back together. <b>PEACE!!</b>\" He vanishes in a maelstrom of lightning into the time stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um... there you go then...\" Tommy goes, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wormhole spits them out milliseconds after they vanished from their room, time moving normally. Suddenly, Lynda and Mike come in the room and say, \"I see the day finally came...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate said, \"Um, what's going on?\" She was put off a bit my his mom's hot body and slutty clothes, but knew thanks to Kate's wish that meant her mom was a fine upstanding, smart person. \"Wow, Kate's wish is weirder in person, especially when it's my mom.\" Nate thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents sat on her bed and said, \"We have something to tell you sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda said, \"Back when you were two, we were in a horrible car accident, and you got in the paper because you miraculously escaped without a scratch when we had several broken bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike said, \"Truth was, you nearly died, your body far beyond the capacities of human medicine to repair... and we didn't get hit by a boulder in a landslide... it was an alien spaceship that crashed into us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aliens!! Mom... Dad...?\" Nate said, tail raised on high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The aliens had a little girl. Her body mostly survived, but she was brain dead from a head injury...\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they made us a deal. They would combine your two bodies to keep you from dying, but on your fifteenth birthday, you would lose your human shape forever, taking the form of the girl in her teenage years.\" Lynda went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...\" Mike blurted out, taking Nate's hand. \"Genetically, you still have half your genes, so you're still our child, but now you're... just a girl... a girl with a really high voice, green hair, and has cat ears and a tail...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better get to the point, because now I'm really confused!!\" Nate exclaimed, secretly staring daggers into Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The parents of that girl, the one that make up the other half of your genome now, are of a highly musical race of aliens that call themselves 'Vocaloids.' They detected our satellites back in the '80's and came here, and almost left, uninterested, if not for anime. They said they loved our take on the genre, and was studying it more when space junk hit their cloaked ship in a 3mm wide defect in the ship's plating. The science scout ship then crashed, in all places, right next to our car, the shrapnel smacking us into a tree.\" Mike stated bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After they completed the fusion process, they said they were in fact the great leaders of their race, their names Leon and Lola, and said this incident has changed their plans on first contact with mankind. Since their daughter's brain died and yours lived, they felt it wrong to take you from us, but said there would be the day you would have become the ambassador of the Vocaloid race.\" Lynda tried to explain. \"They tried to help ease the process, and make you famous before your time by creating the Crypton Future Media company, as well as the Zero-G company, and sold the Vocaloid vocal synthesizer programs, as well as the other various software, figurines, and manga to make you an international star in preparation for this day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But just two problems...\" Nate quips, tugging on her ears and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Vocaloids were more worried about getting their name out first, and not small details like that.\" Lynda stated. \"A human avatar would be more universally accepted, as trying to market you in all your catgirl-ly glory could have put you off as a gimmick to attract otaku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they declined to hide important physical features of mine as a marketing move...\" Nate lips out with sarcastic wit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... the gist...\" Mike sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate sighs as well. \"Well, if I'm supposed to be this 'ambassador,' how and when am I supposed to bring about first contact with alien life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all things, it'll be a concert... a free concert, in the park, tomorrow.\" Lynda exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know any of those Vocaloid songs!!\" Nate exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are the real life Hatsune Miku, and your fans will expect them from you...\" Erin cackles from the stairs, having been listening in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda goes, \"Erin, upstairs!! Now, um... daughter... I guess I should find a more feminine name than 'Nate' to call you now, but I'm not ready to call you Miku yet, like Leon &amp; Lola want me to... anyways, from what you've told me, Tammy here is a huge Vocaloid fan, and has pretty much every one of the songs written with the software on her computer. Go with her tonight and rehearse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... It's a school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts!!\" Lynda said. \"This the future of mankind, missy!! I order you to have a sleepover with your friend Tammy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Nate said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after discovering her whole wardrobe had been replaced with clothes Hatsune Miku has worn in MMD videos, as well as extra copies of her famous sleeveless shirt/tie/detached sleeves/miniskirt/boots ensemble, Nate went to Tommy's, now apparently Tammy's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!! You made me half alien and the messenger of an alien race based on your favorite music?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An alien race based on my favorite music that also happens to be kemonomimi too!!\" Tammy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, your prank is elaborate... But what was that whole time jump then wormhole then about?\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the rules said you can't unwish a wish for 37 hours... Well, I sped time up for 37 hours, placing us in a remote location just in there was some temporal weirdness we don't know of yet, then sent us into a wormhole that through us out just after we were moved, so we wouldn't be missed. This way, we will have waited 37 hours, without actually waiting 37 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... clever.\" Nate quips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also used the second rule, and just thought my wish, since it was too verbose to say without possibly screwing it up. I needed the 37 hours so I could affect others without having to worry about Kate's wish completely getting in my way. Now, unless I say otherwise, any girl I change, or anyone I change into a girl, will be exempted from Kate weird reverse bimbo wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All nice and good, but what are you planning?\" Nate asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a Vocaloid concert isn't just Hatsune Miku performing alone. There's other Vocaloids too!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right!!\" Nate smiled, glad someone would have to share her burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to need a Kagemine Rin, Kagemine Len, a Meiko, a Kaito, a Megurine Luka, a Gumi, a SeeU, and a Hagane Miku. I think I have an idea where to start. I think I will...\"</span></div></div>",

Her parents was out on the town, as they usually are. \"Well, here goes...\" Tammy says, downing a candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Janet and Adam are tonguing away, when Adam pushes her away. \"You perv... Making out with your sister... Wait, wha...\" He looks confused as Janet's hair began to shorten, her red pleated skirt separating into a pair of black shorts. Adam's jeans also change, shrinking down into black short shorts as his legs become lithe and girly. Both their shirts suddenly change into white sleeveless shirts with yellow striped black sailor fuku collars. Adam found a gold kerchief tied tied below the collar, while Janet saw a necktie of matching color hanging from the collar. Janet watched as Adam's eyes got huge, even for anime standards, the irises turning from brown to an azure blue. His hair began to bleach out, lengthening a little as two berets secured his bangs in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he shrank a little, Janet grew. Adam yelled out, in a higher, feminine voice, \"J... J... Ja... Your name, it's on my tongue... What is it?!\" Small breasts adorned Adam's new girly torso, as Janet's deflated, but her overall build stayed wiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister, did you hurt yourself? My name is Len!!\" Janet answers Adam, her mind fully lost to the changes, now believing she was Kagamine Len, and was almost completely him physically as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that, brother!! I was just testing you!!\" Adam joked, his mind now that of Vocaloid singer Kagamine Rin. Finally, the last changes happened, as Janet's vagina became a penis complete with balls, and Adam's male equipment sucked into him, making female equipment. They now were the spitting images of <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.wikia.com/vocaloid/images/b/bb/Ofclboxart_cfm_Kagamine_RinLen-illu.png\">Kagamine Rin &amp; Len</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://images.wikia.com/vocaloid/images/b/bb/Ofclboxart_cfm_Kagamine_RinLen-illu.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>, however, they weren't done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their headbands come into place, Rin's ears suddenly shift, becoming long white rabbit ears. From the seat of her shorts a fuzzy, pointy rabbit's tail pops out, as the shorts mend around it. Len grows matching ears, but instead of a tail, gains thick fur on his chest, forearms, and lower legs that resembles rabbit fur, and grows rabbit whiskers on his face. Janet, now Len, says, \"Hey sis, just where the heck are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" she answers back. Suddenly, they hear a stone hit the window. Looking out, they see a familiar face. \"Hey, it's Miku!!\" Rin calls out from the window. The twins come running out the house. Rin jumps on Nate's neck with great ferocity, greeting her like she's known her for a while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have the twins, Tammy?\" Nate said, prying, Rin off of her. \"Who do you plan to recruit next?\"</span></div></div>",

His friends and family often joked that he was born underwater. Even his oriantation nickname was Tadpole. He represented both the school diving and swimming club, and his favorite passtimes included his continual daring attempts at breaking international records such as holding ones breath underwater the longest and diving the most laps without resurfacing for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was still giddy with the prospect of being able to make wishes at will, but was still suspicious and reluctant to get his hopes up high. If life had taught him anything, it was if something was too good to be true, then it probably wasn't. <br>\r\nHowever, he did feel a peculiar excitement at the thought of at least testing whether the candies he held were real or not. He had nothing to lose, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran outside with his treasure to the backyard swimming pool, a magnificently large body of water; it covered a 3rd of the entire backyard. The first things he would wish for was an improved breath, with that he would break any and all international records involving diving. <br>\r\nBut before he went any further he had a long look at the candy container. It was a simple tin cylinder, with no markings or paper or any inscriptions, or what Nate looked for: instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was a bit  puzzled as how the candies worked. Did he merely have to eat them and make his wish? Or what? Opening the lid he counted the sweets; there appeared to be roughly a hundred.<br>\r\nWith excitement overruling caution, Nate took one sweet and sucked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally being at the wishing stage, Nate didn't know precisely what to say or how to word his wish, and nervously he simply said:<br>\r\n\"I wish I could breath underwater.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate knew instantly that something was wrong. The skin on the sides of his neck and ribs felt as if they being torn open from the inside.<br>\r\nThe pain continued until he could feel air flowing through them. What the...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate tore off his shirt and saw rifled red strokes of open skin covering the sides of his torso between each of his ribs. Touching them, he realised they were gills! The same on the sides of his neck, where there were 3 pairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was mesmerized.His wish had actually been granted! With gills, he could breath underwater indefinitely. He was ecstatic and terrified at the same time.<br>\r\nBut he was also confused. How was he breathing right now? Touching his chest he could feel his diaphragm still expanding as his lungs were inflated and deflated with oxygen where he breathed through his mouth, but with a slight aircurrent between his fingers as he held his rib-gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate didn't have time to ponder this as he suddenly felt his entire body shudder when an explosion of pain from head to toes hit him. And with the pain came further transformations. Nate started writhing on the grass like dog trying to scratch an unbearable itch. It looked like someone was experiencing an epilepsy.<br>\r\nThe pain wasn't excruciating or like a torture. Instead it was like rubbing off a particularly irritating scab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate could see the skin between his fingers grow and stretch until he had webbed appendages similar to those of frogs. The same for his feet, only his toes started splitting halfway from the ankle before they grew webs between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Nate felt as if his nose were being rammed back into his face with a baboon-spanner until he had flat snout with 2 splits for nasal openings in them. With it however Nate could suddenly experience scents and smells as he had never before. His sense of smell was now so acute that he could actually see (or so he swore) the aromas being eminated from the flowers in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing up, Nate could feel his very spine being pulled out of his back. As if some surgeon on crack and with a twitch were trying to extract his marrow. Feeling his back for the cause ,Nate felt a dorsal fin starting to jut out. It was growing from his spinal column between his shoulder blades.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter that, Nate next felt like crying as rump was overcome with agony. Just above his butt, from his sternum started growing a long slender, cylindrical tail half as long as he was tall. From the tip of the tail sprouted beautiful vertical fins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext in line, all Nate's body hair on his skin was sucked back in as if by a vacuum cleaner. His skin turned a grey-blue tint, then became scaly and pointed. A marine camouflage.<br>\r\nThe hair on Nate's head lengthened and became sleek and silky, and held a green-blue colour like seaweed. They then fused into pencil sized braids hanging from his head like a Jamaican-hairstyle. Or perhaps like medusa's head-snakes, only with the back of the snake's tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his face. His ears retracted. <br>\r\nAnd his eyelids fell off. Repeat: fell off. This made Nate go ballistic, as he was unaware that his eyes had turned into the ever unblinking cat-eyes that was associated with fish.<br>\r\nLastly his jaws pushed outward as his lips shrank and became flat. His teeth grew into twin sets of razors, fitting perfectly like 2 bear traps within one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last the agony started to subside in a throbbing afterglow, Nate felt like he just ran a marathon. Whist on fire. He crawled to the pool to see his reflection. What greeted Nate was both amazing and horrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-skinned thing with unblinking yellow eyes staring back was humanoid in shape and right there the similarities with humans ended. It was amphibian in nature and sharklike in appearance.<br>\r\nWebbed hands and feet, gills on the sides of its ribs and neck, a powerfull slender tail and a shark-shaped dorsal fin made it obvious the thing was adept at swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only had openings where ears should have been and a flat snout with 2 diagonal slits for nasal openings. Green-blue tendrils, thick as pencils, hanged from its head and acted as hair. Like a sea-anemones tentacles they wormed around with a life of their own.<br>\r\nMost striking of all was the twin sets of razor teeth protruding from the thin inward lips, indicating for all the world to see that the creature was without a doubt carnivorous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had turned into an ancient human-hybrid adapted for life at and within the ocean. He was now an Atlantean. A citizen of the doomed and sunk city of Atlantis. They were well-known for their ability to breath above and below water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Nate didn't know this; all he saw was this fascinating and fearsome creature staring back at him.<br>\r\nIn total, utter shock his first words were...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate just stared at his own reflection in the swimming pool water, unable to believe the creature was him. Eventually he was convinced as the it mimicked all his actions perfectly. <br>\r\nThe sets of teeth curled into a smile as Nate jubilated: \"Holy Smokes! This is Epic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain himself any longer, Nate sprang into the water. Time to go for a test run, he thought. As the water enveloped him, he felt like being covered in silk. He felt lighter and stronger; the Atlantean body obviously functioning optimally submerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate realised he was breathing underwater, using his gills. But could only do so whilst moving. If he slowed to a standstill, it felt as if he was being smothered. It was clear to him that like all fish he had to keep on the move to ensure that water flowed through his gills from where he could filter oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo moved he did. And fast. He swam at unnatural speeds as his powerful tail and webbed limbs worked in unison to propel him through the water like a torpedo. He swam so fast that he created funnels directly on the surface from where he swan as his powerful strokes displaced the water, forcing the above to fall. Whirlpools encircled the pool.<br>\r\nNate was having the time of his life. Never before had he experienced such a fun way to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate also discovered some interesting things about his Atlantean body. His head didn't have ears because there was no need to catch soundwaves throught the air by an ear shell, sound travelled more efficiently through contact in water. His eyes also never blinked, because there was little need to replenish the moisture that would have evaporated in the atmosphere. Even his seemingly useless dorsal fin aided in acting as an aquatic aerodynamic stabilizer, aiding his steering. Since Nate desired to become a marine-biologist, he found all this fascinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Nate decided he had his fun and exited the pool. He was now more interested in finding out how and why the supernatural sweets worked. Looking again at the candy container, Nate saw that beneath the lid a warning label stood. He had missed it earlier since it was on the underside the lid when it was closed on the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn clear typed lettering he read the following:<br>\r\n##########################################################33<br>\r\nCandies of change (A proud product of Magnificents-Magics)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning: Read rules before use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1)Make wish whilst consuming candy.

He shook the container and concluded that there still had to be 98 left, as he had used 2.<br>\r\nHe just had, had, had to show his siblings this. He could imagine all the fun trouble they could get up to.<br>\r\nHowever as Nate was busy pondering the container and its contents he was oblivious to everything around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't notice his brother and sister coming outside into the backyard until he was jolted out of his thoughts by a heartretching scream. He looked to see his older 18-year old brother Tesla and younger 14-year old sister Shekkis staring at him in horror.<br>\r\nIt was Shekkis who screamed, her hands covering her mouth, a box she carried dropped. Tesla's hand moved to large bayonet he always carried on his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate meekly tried to smile to reasure them, but his best approximation of a smile in the Atlantean body only served to make him bare his teeth in a threatening way, causing Shekkis to faint right there and then. Tesla took a combat stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Shaait, thought Nate, realising for the first time that he literally didn't even have a tongue to tell them who he was.<br>\r\nNate became very scared. Tesla was one of the youngest men to have been nominated for the Spetsnaz training regime, and would run Nate through easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do to identify himself? Eat another sweet to turn back hopefully in time before Tesla scewered him on the spot, or try someway to make Tesla realise he was Nate, even though he couldn't speak.</span></div></div>",

Tesla thought Nate had eaten himself or something. Tesla flung himself at the creature, Nate tried to avoid but was caught.<br>\r\nTesla pinned Nate to the ground, hand on throat. \"Say your prayers, freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hapless Nate could only watch, as Tesla raised his bayonet arm for a deathblow, Tesla's other arm keeping him pinned. The poor chap couldn't even close his ever unblinking fisheyes at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tesla saw something which which made him hesitate. He was confused. The creature had Nate's watch on his right arm. And his torn trousers. And his torn socks and shoes. Tesla stood up puzzled, releasing the creature: \"That you Nate?\" he asked.<br>\r\nThe creature eagerly nodded its head.<br>\r\n\"How?\" Tesla asked simply. How? What an odd question, thought Nate. If he had been in Tesla's place he would have gone on like a disturbed crackhead asking a multiple of questions along the line of: Holy crap man, what happened? or: This is way too weird, what's going on dude? But not merely: How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature pointed to the fallen candy container, Tesla walked over to and picked it up. He inspected it and read the instructions intently, then he burst out laughing: \"Nate, your an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see; have to make this right the first time.\" he took one candy put it in his mouth and made a wish. \"I wish Nate was turned back to normal, exactly as he was before he made his wish, that he retained all his memories up until now, that his change be instant and painless, his clothes be fixed, and err... that nothing, no unexpected things happen. Yeah, that's about it.\" The candy in Tesla's mouth dissolved, became a bright ball of light. The ball of light enveloped Nate transforming him into his good old self instantly. Nate noted no pain this time, he was greatfull for Tesla's foresight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust settled Nate faced Tesla still sitting on the ground and perplexed by these recent events. \"You alright?\" asked Tesla helping him to his feet, to which Nate replied shakily: \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Tesla knocking Nate back the ground with the punch to the nose. <br>\r\n\"What was that for?!\" said the outraged Nate.<br>\r\n\"For being an imbecile. You scared the hell out of me.\"<br>\r\nTesla then helped Nate back up and then promply punched Nate in the face again, landing him on the ground for a 3rd time.<br>\r\n\"Again?!\"<br>\r\n\"That was for scaring the living daylights out of sis.\" he said waving to the fainted form of Shekkis.<br>\r\nTesla helped Nate up for a 3rd time, Nate cringed, but it appeared that Tesla was done handing out punches.<br>\r\n\"What the heck is wrong you? Since when did you get kicks from giving people hart attacks, Nate?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, why'd you just attack me?\" Nate counter accused.<br>\r\n\"Did you see yourself? You looked like something straight out of a Clive Barker Horror flick!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly: 'Oh'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean for any of that to happen.\" Nate defended.<br>\r\n\"What precisely did wish for?\" Tesla asked, more curious than angry now.<br>\r\n\"Just to breath underwater.\"<br>\r\nTesla snickered: \"You should have specified your wish in minute detail. Vague wishes tend to lead to screw-ups. Didn't you read the instructions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already made my wish then, the instructions were under the lid and-\" He stopped.<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait ,wait, wait! How do you...how do you know all this? How were you so calm back there? How'd you know what to do to change me back? You acted like you've seen magic and wishes and...stuff before.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTesla smiled thinly at Nate and said....</span></div></div>",

The Department of Covert Occult Warfare.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm...confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You usually are.\" mocked Tesla before continuing: \"I'm basically a witch-hunter, Nate. I belong to a specialist unit who counters supernatural threats. And I also track and locate dangerous magical artefacts before they can cause their havoc. Stuff like this, Nate\" he he help up the candy container. \"Before idiots like you can screw-things up.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, give me a break. How was I supposed to know that was dangerous before today.\"<br>\r\n\"One does not test fate by putting random crap in one's mouth that has the words 'magic' on them.\"<br>\r\n\"Says he with experience and the one who nearly stabbed me to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesla and Nate smiled at one another.\"Fair enough.\" conceded Tesla.<br>\r\nTesla continued: \"However, this little box of parlour tricks doesn't appear to be dangerous. You read the no misery and no death rule right? It's clear its creator had no malevolent intent with these. I'd go as far to as to say its an almost trivial bag of tricks, we can have our fun with it later...\"<br>\r\n\"See? No reason to have hit me.\"<br>\r\n\"But your face makes such a nice punching-bag!\" joked Tesla, before showing a serious face: \"The only thing that bothers me is the brand. Magnificent-Magics. Never heard of it.\"<br>\r\n\"Right. Now explain to me how on earth it makes sense that you're supposed to know the brand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesla frowned: \"All formal organisations that practice spellcraft professionally have to be registered to Docow. You're not registered, you don't get a magic-licence. You practice spellcraft without magic-licence, you break the law. Simple enough, my simple minded brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your making less and less sense, Tesla. Why would witches care about braking the law?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you wouldn't know, would you? O.K. it works like this. Using magic isn't illegal. But using magic on other people without their consent is. Even if witches were helping others, they still have to get whomever they're using their spellcraft on to sign contracts issued by Docow. Now these contracts are special paper resistant to magic; that way witches can't pull a fast one on us, by making innocents sign their own name under the influence of a control-curse. Only people completely willing to whatever change was agreed upon in the contract can sign, short of being blackmailed physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitches can still practice their magic in peace, but they're not allowed to, for example change anyone into a dog or cat without them having agreed to it by contract. Especially not permanently. Only witches operating by our contracts are allowed to be registered by Docow. Those practicing magic on others without the proof of contracts, we have to apprehend into custody.<br>\r\nI'm worried by this brand, because I don't recodnise it. Meaning its not registered by Docow. Meaning its creators are not using our contracts. Meaning they might be operating illegally. Chance of course its a group of young witches in hiding not even aware of our existence. Meaning I have to go find them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a whole lot better. Tell me, you mean there's good witches too?\" said Nate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Why of course!\" exclaimed Tesla in surprise: \"Lots of them...in fact most of them. In fact I'd go as far as to say almost all of them. Usually gypsies, fortune tellers, and village witchdoctors. We at Docow only exist to keep the rotten apples at bay, and stopping some young inexperienced witch going too far with getting revenge on the poor sod that's her ex or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you said you were a witch-hunter. Doesn't sound like much hunting involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! We at Docow like to brag. Make ourselves sound more impressive than we really are. Fact is, nowadays we're mainly a peace-keeping middleman between the Magical and Physical realm. Our unnecessarily ominous name of Department of Covert Occult Warfare, is something we've vainly tried for years to change in the face of the Bureaucracy that is our government, and have failed.<br>\r\nNow we don't hunt witches, we only track them.\"<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To ensure their safety; we're not as modern as you'd like to think. Lots of fanatics out there who'd like go all midievil and have some stake burnings. Sometimes the poor girl isn't even aware she's a witch; their magical-abilities only becoming evident during puberty. We at Docow hear reports of weirdness; sometimes we go investigate. If its a witch we send her to apprentice under one of her own. Make sure she doesn't lose control. An keep her from harm as well. Everyone's happy, usually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So only girls are witches?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" said Tesla.<br>\r\n\"I have a headache. This a bit much at once.\" said Nate holding his head.<br>\r\n\"Say where's Shekkis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at the backdoor entrance, where she had collapsed, she was nowhere to be seen. \"Shekkis!!\" shouted Tesla, no answer.<br>\r\n\"Oh great, she's probably hiding somewhere thinking Nate the miniature Godzilla is after her.\" he accused Nate.<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on lets go look for her, she doesn't know about these sweets. She's probably scared stiff.\"</span></div></div>",

She had regained consciousness after Tesla had turned Nate back to normal and when she had heard him tell Nate that he was a witch-hunter, she became truly fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, she was witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had ran upstairs as quickly as her legs could carry her, slammed her door and locked it. Then she had cowered and shivered under the duveys of her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started about a year ago. She discovered that she could do things others could not. First simple things: like lighting a candle without using a match, making small thing float. She discovered many of these tricks and even went as far to use her abilities, which she herself could not explain, to enter her school's talent-competition as a magician. With an unfair advantage, she could make coins literally disappear and change playing-cards into whatever her audience had guessed.<br>\r\nShe made a magnificent performer and loved the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would practice her magic and spells in secret, hoping to outdo even Houdini one day.<br>\r\nOne of her experiments led to the creation of magically imbued sweets. After months of labour she had created the pinacle of her work. She called it: The Candies of Change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShekkis had wanted to test their potency and whether they actually worked and had decided that as her brother, Nate's birthday was around the corner she would give them to him and see what he wished for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't think things would turn out this way. She never wanted to cause any trouble, she just wanted to have some fun. When Tesla had revealed himself to be a witch-hunter she fled. She of course hadn't heard everything that Tesla had explained to Nate, firmly believing her would harm her, instead of offering her security as he had explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had heard Tesla shouting after her from the backyard, she started shaking and trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe of course didn't realise they were concerned for her safety, whist they didn't suspect she was a witch and had not fled from Nate but from Tesla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Nate had knocked on her door calling: \"Shekkis!

She hazily looks up at you and begins to grin as she suddenly hugged you. This kinda freaked you out that a complete stranger just came up and hugged you. But that wasn't what bothered you the most. \"Hey big bro! Im o-... wait. Whats wrong with my voice?\" Now you were creeped out. \"Ummm ok. Im not your big brother lady. I don't even know you. She didn't even hear you cause she was still eying her new developments. \"Uh.. are you ok?\" \"Well... I couldn't say for sure. Mabye mom would know.\" \"Well it wouldn't hurt to ask I guess. Have a good day.\" Shocked that you would say something like that, she began chase you in the store. Ok now she was getting on your nerves. \"Wha.. why are you still following me? I don't even know you! Weren't you supposed to go see your mother or something?\" \"I am going to see mom. But since I don't know where she is I thought you would know since you have been around her.\" \"Ok. For one I don't even know your mom much less you.\" \"Yes you do. I mean shes my mom to ya know.\" Ok you had no idea what she was getting at, but this game had to stop right now! You had to find your sister before someone kidnaps her or wonders off from the store, which is something you doubt would happen. \"Alright thats it. Im ending this. If you actually are my sister, then what was your first Barbie?\" Giggling she replies, \"Really bro? Its the malibu stacy that you got me for christmas.\" No way. There was no way she could be your sister. But... there was no one else that knows that but you and her. True it was a christmas gift, but it was a surprise gift that no one saw coming. So if this girl knows this. Then how in the world did she even get like this? \"How did you transform into some... woman?\" \"I... I really don't know. I remember looking at the most expensive Barbie on the shelf. And... OH! Oh I am SO stupid!\" \"What? What happened then?\" Blushing from the embarrassment she says, \"well.. I kinda said I wish I looked as pretty as her.\" But that still didn't explain how it happened. You knew that just because you wish for something to happen doesn't mean it will come true. But at this point the only thing you could think of to do was to go back to mom with her. Hopefully she wouldn't pass out or something. </span></div></div>",

She looked down to see her legs had become all smooth, tone and tan. Also her toes were panted a rich pink. The feeling moved up the her tummy and hips, her hips felt like they were on fire and the tummy was all queasy, leaveing the perfict hour-glass figure as it moved to her arms. Her arms and fingers became smooth and feminine and her nails mached her toes. The fealing then sifted to her chest. Her chest ballooned out stoping just shy of a D-cup. It finally got down to her privets she didn't know what hapend but something didn't feel right with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight above her new boobs a lass bra appeared a matching pair of panties showed up right after. Then her clothing the only constant left began to change. The shirt lost its sleeves and most of its back becoming a halter top and then the pink over took the shirt makeing it all pink. The pants begain to fuse together turnd the same pink as the shirt. Then slowly came up to your thighs and fused with the shirt to make a dress. Lastly the shoes she had on began to grow heel and they became high heals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her brain began to hurt and her mind made the jump from a clueless 5 year old girl, to the 16 year old preppy chearleeder she saw in the mirror. She looked like an average 16 year old girl with all the knowledge of make-up, dresses, skirts, and shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she said \"Can I come with you little bro\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate was exhausted and not in the right state of mind to even care whether the 30 dollars he held in his hand was supernaturally procured or not. He just threw them down next to his cubbard, and face-planted himself on his bed. Sleep captured him in seconds; his light snoring sounding throughout his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, sitting alone, Nate's mother, Lynda was also exhausted. She had had a rough day. She was glad that Nate had organised his own birthday party, for she had been stumped today. She would promise to make it up to him later this weekend, for not being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Lynda was a widow. Her husband Mike, having passed away 3 months previously. What was truly traumatizing about his death was that Mike's Life-Insurance policy had been rejected by the scumbag Insurance company for which he had faithfully paid out every month without a missed payment for the last 6 years. And now his family for whom he'd loved and cared stood on the brink of poverty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda was forced to toil away daily at her sweatshop job in order to keep the Wilson family afloat. She just managed to make enough in order to keep her 3 children from starvation. Nate(16), Erin(13) and Nicole(11) had been very supportive and responsible. They had helped cleaning around the house, made food for her every night when she came back drained and had been a great pillar of support to her the last few harrowing months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a cloud of doom loomed over the household: Lynda was pregnant. Heavily so. And her douchebag employer had refused her maternity leave. If she didn't arrive for work, she would not get paid. Lynda was already 3 weeks past the legal date by which pregnancy was allowed at work, yet if she stopped the rest of her children would starve. She had cried many nights in desperation. Knowing at some point she would cease to be capable to work in her state. She didn't know what to do when the time arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she just sat and caressed her swollen belly, talking softly to her unborn infant. Hoping for a miracle. Next to her on the kitchen table still stood the candy container where Nate had left it. Feeling understandably depressed she groped for it and undid the lid. <br>\r\nShe began to munch on them, oblivious to their implications or applications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe regretted that Nate had taken a part time job as a pizza delivery boy just so he could get some extra income for the family. She felt guilty. He had worked hard the last quarter. He was steadfast and had told Lynda many times he wished he could have taken the burden from her back. Erin and Nicole had both been there as well, but she was always especially comforted by Nate, since as he was a miniature version of his father, Lynda found great comfort in his childishly determined words, for Lynda missed her spouse greatly.<br>\r\nSuddenly Lynda broke into tears like so many times before: \"Oh Nate! How I wished you really could have taken the burden from my back...\" she sniffed, wiping her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda had been chewing one of the magical sweets at the time she said this. And as she vocalized her desire, its powerful magic took effect. A crash of lightning and a flash of light, made Lynda sit upright with fright. She almost had a heart attack, believing a gun had been fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next made Lynda more fearful than she had been in her entire life. Her breasts shrank, from her milk-filled state to her normal less proportioned size. Then her pot-belly diminished, restricted and started to disappear. Lynda screamed, clutching her stomach, which grew smaller and smaller. She was convinced her unborn child was being taken to oblivion and wailed: \"No! No! Please! God no! No please! I shan't ever complain again!\" The poor woman was petrified she was being punished for talking out of turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all proof of her pregnancy disappeared into obscurity, Lynda collapsed to the floor and wept. She was now in body exactly as she had been before her pregnancy, her maternity dress falling loosely in front of her.<br>\r\nSuddenly a stream of light escaped her open mouth, and formed a spinning streak like a flying firework. It orbited Lynda a few times, then shot upstairs. Without understanding why, Lynda dashed after it, tears trailing her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light streak entered Nate's room, and Lynda followed suite. There she saw her son lying chest up and bare-chested on his bed, fast asleep, the light-streak hovering over him, before entering his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a snake going in headfirst into its underground bunker, the light-streak took 3 seconds before its entire trailing tail followed suit.<br>\r\nLynda looked at her son, unsure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Lynda almost fainted, experiencing something equally as frightening as before.<br>\r\n=============================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate woke up in fright, seeing the light-streak enter him. He closed his mouth, but it kept entering him through the nose and ears. He couldn't actually feel it, for it was like gas. He saw his mother looking at him from his doorframe, she was scared; this in turn caused him to be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next, happened fast: Nate's chest was bare so he could see things on it change. His areolas grew broader and darkened ; the nipples on top of them started jutting out like screws. The flesh behind his nipples felt swollen, and as he looked they inflated outwards, like 2 balloons slowly being filled with water. Similar to 2 missiles being raised from their silos, Nate gradually grew breasts. Large ones too. Nate could but gape in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't end there, oh no. His stomach started expanding as well. Like a rubber tube being slowly inflated, his belly increased in size, breath by breath. His hips flared a bit outward to accomodate this enlarged gut. And below his enlarging gut, Nate could feel something shrink inside of his boxers. He lifted the hem to see his one-eyed member decrease into the empty invertedness of womanhood. The scrotum formed the labia and external nether lips. <br>\r\nNate's face turned as white as a sheet, his blood draining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally as Nate lay there on his bed, his transformation stopped. He looked down at himself with utter horror. His chest sported 2 nude pert G-Cup sized bosoms, and his lower waist a heavily pregnant pot-belly. Below that, at least mercifully hidden within the exceedingly tightly restrained boxers, he could feel his nether lips constrained. Nate tried to sat up, his huge watermelons bouncing across his chest. He couldn't sit up any farther, his pot-belly preventing further angling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked a queer sight. He still had his face and arms and legs and almost everything. But it was as if someone superglued a sizable pair of orbs on his chest, larger hips around his sides, and a movie pregnancy set-piece onto his lower midriff: only this pot-belly was real, organic, alive. It looked strange on his slight 16-year old frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate then hiccuped and a flash brought the light-streak back out. The streak settled in the middle of the room, morphing into something solid. It was a grandly carved wooden signbord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it stated: Greetings from the creators of product #1256: Candies of Change!<br>\r\nNumber of units utilised: 1/100<br>\r\nMost recent wish made: \"Oh Nate! How I wished you really could have taken the burden from my back...\" Lynda Wilson at 6:37 pm, Wilson residence, kitchen<br>\r\nMost recent wish effectiveness: Limited.

It became a little flowery too. The top of her shirt began to conform down to her chest, exposing her shoulders and the top half of her torso.

Nicole's brown hair turned a natural light blond and her blue eyes changed brown. Her Wilson DNA had quickly turned into that of the Archambault family and the memories of her parents and three sisters back home in Alencon, France were embedded in vivid detail. These memories were not false, as there was in fact a loving family back there that miss their dear Nicholette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have ze stuffz to do, anyway?\"</span></div></div>",

In an instant, she grew from 3'8'' to a sleek 5'9'', with the womanly legs to match. Her face melted to reveal a beautiful French woman's with seductive brown eyes and makeup expertly applied, free of any of her former baby fat or blemishes. The hair on her new skull turned a bright natural blond that curled without any artificial needs and continued to elongate down to her flat chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strands of hair were pushed up slightly as her chest became fully developed, to say the least. More womanly fat was applied to her hips that also allowed her curves to show in full flaunt. Nicholette was far from the five years old she was but moments ago. She now resembled a downright gorgeous 28 years old French maid and reality knew that statement to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepubezent?!

After sighing, Nate continued walking downstairs, trying to clear his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked downstairs, he kept scratching his chest absentmindedly.

Further inspection caused her to realize said hand was much larger and her nails were much shorter and plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate!\" she called out in sheer terror with her new voice. \"Where is thy fair hand of mine maiden?\" She slapped herself in the face, hoping to snap herself out of this strange curse. \"Why must mine tongue be restricted to such luxuriant patterns?

As soon as she made it inside the bathroom, her newly extended legs and arms were already invaded by new bodyhair. Strangely enough, this new hair was blond, as opposed to her natural brown. One look in the mirror revealed to her that the hair on her head had also turned blond and was barely over her ears. While she was staring at herself, awe struck by her changes, she also witnessed her young, feminine teenager face morph into a masculine, older teen's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin couldn't handle all this sensory overload. She dashed over to the toilet and started throwing up, her hips depleting in the proccess. The muscle from her breasts redeposited themeselves all throughout her body until she was completely flat-chested, but pretty well built. For a young man, that is.</span></div></div>",

It didn't seem worth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I guess it's no problem.\" said Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as it went on, Nate didn't really look at his shoes, which were beginning to lose any color or decals on them. The size seemed to be shrinking, as if trying to form around his feet. Before long, the color had all gone away, leaving just white shoes, but they were still shifting and forming into something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll watch something.\" said Nate as he grabbed the remote and turned the TV on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea what was going on with Trevor as a consequence of that wish.</span></div></div>",

However, he actually ended up marching into his parents' room and just didn't notice. There was a lot of unnoticed this day actually. Well, anyway, he figured a couple puches to the wall would vent out his prepubescent fury, but the wish gave him a churning feeling in his gut. In response to these uncomfortable feelings, he decided to pay a visit to his parents' bathroom within their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore reaching the toilet, he couldn't help but notice something was different about him in the mirror. Wasn't his eyes supposed to be blue? Because now, they looked like a deep hazel. And why was his hair blond all of a sudden?! A moment ago it was dark brown!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?!\" he asked in horror no one while his voice seemed to crack. He started pacing all around the small bathroom in deep thought and terror, paying no heed to the fact that he aged from 7 years old to 12 with his height increasing exponentially to 4'10''. This change actually left a shiver down his spine that caused him to look back at himself in the mirror. Before he could though, Trevor felt like something was choking. Out of sheer reflex, he grabbed at his neck and tore off whatever he felt was restricting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his hand to examine what was previously choking him and all he found was a small necklace. Two small black straps holding an expensive looking saphire stone. Before long, the necklace reattached itself to Trevor's neck. Except this time, his neck felt much longer and seemed to have lost its small adam's apple, so it now fit snugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How peculiar,\" he observed in a melodic woman's voice, now only in dull surprise.</span></div></div>",

Though she was still heavily worried about her changing condition, she still was unable to acknowledge the shiny gold sash and shoulder guards that now belonged on her person. Erin did notice, however, her constantly changing frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror once more, but she did not see herself. All she saw was a young man around her brother's age. And a rather dashing one at that, she had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have I been cursed to appear as such?\" she sobbed in her now masculine voice, the feeling of her new adam's apple only causing more distress. \"Why must I become such a rugid man?\" Just after she asked her question, Erin felt a strange object appear in her new jacket pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it out to inspect and found a locket. A solid gold locket shaped like a heart. Out of curiosity, she opened it and found a picture of a beautiful young woman dressed in blue. However, as soon as Erin saw this woman, his heart was aflutter. That wasn't a mistake calling Erin a he. A quick glance at his sweet Natallia was enough to change her forming girlhood into a more mature manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron could not simply spend all day looking at his beloved's picture all day.

A small part of him understood that he was changing, but the rest of him was constantly explaining that it was normal. And the rest of him was believing it! So, almost any former sign of panic was replaced with almost complete serenity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the feeling of mortal terror out of the way, Trevor decided it was high time to relax for a bit. After a couple moments of thought, he decided a good soak in the bathtub would do his nerves good. Even when he reached to start the bath, he failed to notice that the entire bathroom was growing and transforming. What was once only a half-bathroom was now the size of three bathrooms and was filled with much more expensive accomodations. We're talking about <i>royal</i> quality accomodations. Even the bathtub he was about to fill was now the size of a king-sized bed with a gold rim and jets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his now long and feminine hands turned the knobs to get the temperature just right, Tevor looked around the bathroom once more. My word,' he thought. 'Nicolette really has been doing a recognizable job with the cleaning.' Any memories he may have had of his younger or older sister had instantly vanished, replaced with those of the family maid and Nate's boyfriend. 'I must remember to commend her for this job.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long afterwards, he was finally able to slip into the regal tub. The perfectly heated water sent a shiver down his spine that caused it to extend along with his age. He may not have been thinking about it at the time, but he knew he was now 18 despite still only being 5'4''. I suppose that was rather normal for a girl that age.</span></div></div>",

He was kind of aimless in his walks, not really having much of  a destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did everyone go?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like everyone disappeared around him. Nicolette was still upstairs, and he couldn't find Erin or Trevor anywhere. He wondered where Trevor had gone after his little temper tamtrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully he gets over that.\" muttered Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, he sooned walked into the kitchen again, getting himself a little snack. However, as he walked in, he noticed that some things looked different. It looked a bit bigger than before, and there seemed to be more things than before. Actually, looking further in, he noticed someone else in there; a young woman who he didn't recognize. However, she smiled at Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day sir.\" she said with a bow. \"Do you need anything?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was a bit bewildered by the sudden appearance of the woman, but he responded anyway. \"Well, I was just going to get a sandwich.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll get on it.\" she said as she ended up preparing a basic PB&amp;J sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay.\" said Nate, wondering if he should have been concerned by her sudden appearance. \"Who are you by the way?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Melissa of course. Did you forget?\" she said, her smile not wavering at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...it's nothing.\" said Nate as he took his leave of the kitchen, with Melissa staying in there. \"Well, that was weird, but at least she cooks.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out, a brief breeze flowed across his skin, making him shiver slightly. Unknowingly to him, his skin was softening up, as if soothed daily with the best shanpoos around. It was going nicely with his shrinking frame.</span></div></div>",

However, as he did, he positioned himself straight up, as if trying to show perfect posture while sitting. He crossed his legs femininely underneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only thing though. Nate noticed a fork and knife right next to him.

For some reason, he didn't feel bad about the skirt. It felt like it gave him some sort of freedom.

He could worry about the others later if he wanted. With that in mind, he began walking towards the back door, soon seeing it in view. He walked over and slid the door open, walking out and closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that feels good.\" said Nate with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside, the house still looked normal, which was a bit perplexing.

His skirt lengthened further, flowing down to his ankles, becoming the bottom half of a royal dress. The material had softened considerable, allowing it to feel pretty good against his legs. Underneath the skirt, his legs slimmed down, becoming a bit toned but really sexy, especially in his calves and thighs. His hips and rear were still the same but that would soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's better.\" smiled Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept walking, he began to giggle lightly as he fel the grass soon nip his feet. Holes were opening up in his shoes as they got smaller, more parts of his feet being exposed. Eventually, the front disappeared, showing his toes as the tops of the shoes became mere straps, forming a pair of silvery sandals, to which Nate smiled at as he looked at his dainty feet in them. He smiled as he saw his feet shrink slowly, gently fitting the sandals better. His toenails were manicured perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look gorgeous. I must thank Mother for them.\" he said to himself as he kept exploring the backyard.</span></div></div>",

With only a mere five minutes clocked into his bathtime, he had already grown to 25 years old, though he only grew a single inch from the aging. Come to think of it, the entire time he's been changing, he never grew a single piece of hair. In fact, what little body hair he had before seemed to evaporate, leaving nothing but unbelievably smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is truely wonderful,' the changing boy thought. 'I suppose it is best to relax once in a while. I do believe I deserve it.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, he dunked his hair into the water and allowed it to soak. As his dark brown was absorbing the water, it began to grow at an incredibly fast rate. By the time Trevor rose his head up, he had wet dark locks sticking to him all the way down to his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the wettening of his hair, he reached to the side of the tub to squirt some shampoo in his hands. As he rubbed his hands together to start washing his hair, the fingers on said hand elongated and became painted blue. Also different was that while Trevor was rubbing his head with the shampoo, his dark hair started to lighten to a honey blond. The hair actually did grab his attention as he looked at his reflection in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My, my,' he thought to himself. 'I really was gracious enough to earn my mother's golden hair.' The woman he had in mind was not Lynda Wilson. In fact, she was much older than her.

In fact, it looked downright appalling now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why must I be surrounded by such common folk?\" Nate questioned to himself. \"Am I not deservent of a more suiting location of housage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Nate!\" called one of the cooks from the front door. \"You left these candies on the dining room table.

For some reason, he was appreciating all of his royal belongings as if he just earned them. With a new appreciation of life he hadn't felt in a long time, Nate skipped down his family's large castle feeling giddy all over. As he was skipping, though, no attention was put upon his changing hips and thighs.

Oddly enough, there was a voice in the back of her head saying that something was really off here, but she couldn't be sure what it was. She felt some kind of rumbling in her belly, as if she was getting hungrier and hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird. I'm usually never this hungry.\" spoke Lynda as she entered the area. As she did, she noticed that the walls of the room seemed to be getting a little taller. Either that or she was getting smaller, but she didn't believe that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello.\" bowed Melissa as Lynda came over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Melissa. Do you mind if I have something to eat? I don't know why, but I feel famished.\" smiled Lynda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll get your usual snack ready.\" Melissa bowed again while leading Lynda over to a seat. Lynda wondered briefly about what this \"snack\" was, but she didn't complain.

No need to worry.\" said Lynda. As Melissa left, Lynda's clothes began to shift. Her home dress began splitting along the waist, becoming two separate pieces of clothing, turning to a darker color in the process. If she could see herself right now, she'd look like she was in her teens, the candies' magic working rapidly on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I feel a lot more energetic today. Maybe after this I'll go see my older sister.\" said Lynda before stopping. \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she questioned herself, her \"skirt\" flowed over her legs, splitting into two leggings that covered down to her ankles. Her house slippers turned a dark brown color while crawling up her legs, becoming a pair of fine royal boots. Her \"shirt\"flowed over her torso as her breasts began shrinking, her bra transforming into a white undershirt. The top shirt covered her torso and began to go down her arms, turning a royal blue color and becoming quite sturdy. Along her pants, her curves shrank and gave way to manly fat and tissue, while underneath her changing underwear, a new appendage grew between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this happened, <i>he</i> kept feeling younger and younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel very young.

Just as he was beginning to give up though, he ran into someone. It was Aaron, looking gallant as always in his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aaron, what are you doing out here?\" asked Mike with a smile. Aaron turned to him with a smile of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was searching for Natalia, but I can't seem to find her around.\" he said. The name \"Natalia\" didn't sound that familiar to Mike, but he didn't think that much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you'll find her soon enough.\" said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" said Aaron, running off through the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, having some of that youth back would be great.\" said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that and kept walking through, the walls of the castle began to feel a bit higher to him. Mike stopped and looked around, wondering why things seemed to be higher. He couldn't tell, but he was shrinking fast, growing down to under 5 feet now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everything look bigger?\" he asked himself. Like with Lynda, the magic was working fast on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, his shirt and jeans fused along the hem into one garment, eliminating any space between them. The colors began to brighten from their usual dark colors, as an assortment of red and pink began to flow over the garment. As Mike kept walking through the castle, the garment began to fuse the leggings of his jeans, turning into one long skirt but starting to become fluffier, allowing his shorter legs some room. Underneath, his white socks vanished, and his dark shoes were beginning to brighten as well. The shoelaces began to vanish as the dark colors were quickly replaced by pink, a bow appearing in the front. The tongue of the shoes vanished, as they became a pair of pink lady flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked down at his pink shoes, and actually smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my shoes look so cute.\" he said as he shrank even further, beginning to look like a pre-teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt continued to get fluffier, exposing a little more of his legs. The skirt became pink in the middle, while shades of red covered the sides. His smaller and daintier hands gently picked at his skirt, making him curtsy a bit with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, this makes me feel kind of pretty. I wonder if Leon would like it if I showed up in this.\" he smiled before stopping. Who was Leon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the neckline of his top began to expand, showing the top of his torso and exposing a bit of his small shoulders. The light pink sleeves began to flow down his small arms, until they came up to his waist. As a tiny jewel appeared at the front of the expanded neckline, he was wearing, for all intents and purposes, a dress. A small pink appendage formed around his smaller waist as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his age decreased lower to about 7 years old, his white underwear became a pink pair of princess panties. Underneath, his manhood quickly shrank, becoming a little girls' womahood. The new <i>she</i> looked around at the castle, starting to become even more attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder my lord brother loves this place so much. I wonder where he and Leon ran off to.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, her brown hair flowed down to her shoulders in curly locks. Her neck smoothed out, until her Adam's Apple was gone, creating a sweet and young voice. As a pink tiara formed on her head, her features softened as the new little girl and princess took control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting a second, Princess Miranda skipped off in search of her brother and best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Princess Miranda*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.spirithalloween.com/images/spirit/products/interactivezoom/processed/01117951.interactive.a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.spirithalloween.com/images/sp...</a></span></div></div>",

He was glad that he could enjoy comfort like this. He thought that he should take a bath more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is so relaxing.\"</i> thought the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he hadn't gotten much taller, he was still growing older, reaching into his 30's. His body kept changing to reflect that, although it still looked incredibly beautiful for his age. Of course, some of the bigger changes were still to come. He still had a lot of \"growing\" to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Trevor lifted his head out of the water, keeping his honey blonde locks behind him. The long hair felt good on him, and he quite enjoyed it. As he did, his hands ran across his slimmer body. At his waist, it began to contract, starting to become smaller as his internal organs got slight smaller to compensate for it. He kind of liked that. With that larger waist, he would have felt a lot hungrier, but a \"lady\" must be careful what she eats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his hips and butt began expanding, as womanly tissue and fat began to build. It slightly pushed him up in the bath, as it grew to a reasonable size. The force of it all really pushed against his groin, as his appendage there began to shrink into womanhood. After about another minute, the manhood shrunk into a new womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was going on, she felt pressure building in her chest. She looked down and saw her nipples getting bigger, swelling up underneath them. Slowly, she saw them balloon out, filling with breast milk, the kind you'd have after giving birth to two children. She smiled as she saw them float on the bathwater. She poked one of them playfully, as they grew to a near D-cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother was quite endowed. I'm happy to be like her.\" Trevor smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, her features softened, her eyes becoming a bit angled as her eyelashes extended. Her eyebrows thinned out while her nose and ears became smaller and cuter. Her cheekbones rose as well, becoming good for a Mid-30's woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Tiffany looked over her body, still as beautiful as it was when she had gotten married so long ago. She felt blessed to have her wonderful daughter and son, as well as this kingdom to watch over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's enough for today.\" she smiled as she lifted herself out of the tub, grabbing a towel and wrapping it around her torso and drying herself off.</span></div></div>",

For some reason, he felt like eating anything he could get his hands on and the grilled cheese sandwich in his hand was solving that craving. The taste, no matter how simple the recipe may have been, just seemed even better than before and much more prominent. It was as if her taste buds were anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny thing though, his entire mouth <i>was</i> changing along with the rest of her head. Despite already shrinking with his age, Lynda's head was just starting to look more masculine. Well, masculine enough for an eight years old boy, what with the redepositing of some baby fat. His nose grew a little bit and his eyes changed from blue to brown with the eylashes shortening. Even his teeth were youthening, becoming their immature counterparts, give or take a couple of growing mature ones. Lynda did enjoy those presents brought by the Tooth Fairy. Granted, they weren't too big a deal considering all he has access to on a regular basis. By now, he had finally gone down to eight years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was done with the sandwich, he noticed that he got some crumbs all over his royal garb. Lynda then got up and started patting the crumbs off. As he was patting, a medal happened to appear on his shirt. A solid gold metal with his family's royal crest: a three-headed dragon. To the rest of his family, the crest symbolized honor and strength. To him, it was an awesome dragon and didn't need to symbolize anything. A small shash also appeared on his uniform that seemed constricting at first, but started to feel more comfortable once his breasts were pushed back into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his now flat chest cleaned off, Lynda started to eat his chips with equal delight. While eating, however, his hair gradually retracted into his scalp until it didn't even touch his ears. The changes finished off as soon as Lynda finished off his lunch and gave a large burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Prince Leon apoligized to the cooks around in his cute little boy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, Prince,\" Melissa chuckled. \"You sure have quite an appetite. Did you enjoy your lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mam. Grilled cheese is my favorite, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said pancakes were your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was last week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook couldn't help but chuckle. \"Of course, master. So, do you want anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon thought. \"Well, Miranda is coming over later. Think you could make some ice cream?\" he asked while giving the most hopeful of faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, young master,\" she chuckled back. \"When will she be here then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now!\" shouted a cheerful voice from the dining room door. Princess Miranda was here to play with her BRFWIAAB (Best Royal Friend Who Is Also A Boy). At least, that's the title they accepted so no one would accuse them of \"like liking\" each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway, the reason I came here was to announce the arrival Prince Aaron and Price-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Aaron is here?!\" Nate practically screamed. He immediately jumped out of his chair and ran over to his mother. \"Where is he? Do I look presentable enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany chuckled a bit and smiled back at her son. \"Of course, my dear. If you must know, he is just outside the front vineyard while his little sister plays with Leon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let him near Leon without me?\" he asked gravely. \"That can't be good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, dearest daughter.

Walking through it easily, he walked down a few steps, heading towards the vineyard to the right. It was quite a beautiful sight, the vineyard being one of the more spectacular spots in the castle. As he continued to walk, he felt a bit of pressure forming in his chest, as small budding breasts began to poke through his dress. However, that wasn't his major focus right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, where is my prince?\" he wondered as he kept walking, liking of the feeling of he grass beneath his sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard some laughing, and he could tell who it was. He began running a bit more, his breasts continuing to grow and starting to bounce a bit. Soon enough, after a bit of navigating through the vineyard, he came across Prince Aaron, amusingly watching Leon and Miranda play together. Aaron smiled as he saw Nate enter. As Nate saw him, he felt his heart flutter, his breasts fully forming into firm C-cups beneath his dress. All appearances-wise, he looked the part of a princess. Only one part needed to be finished, as a void began to open up in his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my princess. Wonderful to see you again.\" he said as he gabbed Nate's hand and kissed it tenderly. Nate giggled at the prince's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here?\" asked Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just watching my sister. I think she's taking quite the liking to your brother.\" smiled Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can wonder how.\" sighed Nate. Aaron chuckled a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. I think they look lovely together.\" whispered Aaron so the playing children wouldn't hear. After that, Aaron gently grabbed something in his pocket, something Nate couldn't see properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close you eyes for a second.\" said Aaron. Nate did as he was told, closing his eyes as his manhood continued to shrink. He soon felt something hard on one of his fingers. When Aaron told him to open them, Nate gasped, seeing a diamond engagement ring on his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aaron...\" he started in that female voice of his. Aaron fell to one knee as this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dearest princess, will you marry me? I've been wanting to ask this for some time now.\" smiled the prince. Nate smiled, not even having to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! I do!\" he happily smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, Aaron rose and Nate happily met Aaron's lips with his own. As he did, the last remnants of his manhood vanished, leaving behind a mature womanhood, and completing the new princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and Natalia kissed for some time, happily in a world of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew!\" groaned both of the kids, getting Natalia and Aaron to separate. Natalia just smiled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so rude. I bet you'll be doing this to each other when you're our age.\" smiled Natalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would I kiss her?\" asked Leon in an accusing matter. That seemed to cause a reaction from Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why would I kiss you?\" she replied. That sparkled a tiny childish argument between them, which amused the new couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I kind of wish they would be happy as we are sometime.\" said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do I, my love.\" said Natalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Princess Natalia*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img.costumecraze.com/images/vendors/disguise/50485-Adult-Deluxe-Cinderella-Costume-large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img.costumecraze.com/images/vendo...</a></span></div></div>",

Natalia was so happy that she was to be married soon to the love of her life. Everyone in the kingdom was happy for her. The small kingdom enjoyed such events tremendously. Queen Tiffany was delighted to hear of the reunion. Now, Aaron's family was over all the time, to which Aaron spend most of it kissing with Natalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the displeasure of the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, all they do is oogle each other now.\" groaned Leon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit it's kind of cute though. You think I'll get a kiss like that from a boy someday?\" asked Miranda with a cute look. Leon gave her an odd look, like he got a bit flustered from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you think about stuff like that? That's gross.\" said Leon. Turning his head, Miranda looked a little hurt from that statement. Leon didn't feel good about that. In fact, he got even more flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What I mean is that, um...well....\" Leon trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" inquired Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's just that.....y-you're by best friend.....so only I get to kiss you...\" he said before he could stop himself. Both of them turned red, although Miranda adorned a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....want to kiss me?\" she smiled. Now Leon's face was inventing a new shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I....well...that is...\" he started. However, he didn't get to finish, as Miranda crashed her lips into his, trying to replicate how she saw her big brother do to Natalia. The kiss was rather short, with both of them red at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....let's not tell anyone about this.\" whispered Leon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\" smiled Miranda as she grabbed his arm. \"You know, I actually like the idea of you and me getting married. I don't know why but I would love to marry you. Maybe, in some past life, we were married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you get that from your crazy brother? Who believes in that stuff?\" scoffed Leon, although he didn't remove Miranda from his arm. He liked the feeling of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while sweeping in front of a large window, Nicolette looked down upon the young lovers. She smiled, as it reminded her of the fairy tales of her own youth. She felt immensely happy for both Natalia and Aaron, as if she had known both of them for a very long time. She remembered hearing those fairy tales from her mother, although she could have sworn something felt a bit off about that. Oh well, much ado about nothing. Everything seemed peaceful now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Miranda, I found something!\" said Leon.

He was alone, in someone's apartment, without his parents around. This was a little too much for the 7-year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's someone around who can help me.\" said Trevor. Right as he began to walk around, he tried to get a good look around. He had no idea what kind of culture this was, but it certainly wasn't anything like it was at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they're low income, if what mom said is true.\" Trevor said, remembering a past conversation with his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around a small hallway, which seemed to lead to a closet of sorts. It was kind of big, bigger than the one Trevor had at home. He didn't want to intrude on anyone's privacy, but he was really curious as to find out where he was. With that in mind, he grabbed the handle and gently pulled the door open. He was a bit perplexed by what he saw in there. There were quite a few school uniforms, ones that Trevor would only see on TV. There was the occasional dress and blouse in there too, along with skirts and sweats and such. It was pretty clearly a girls' closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a girl lives here?\" asked Trevor, a bit surprised and worried. His mom always told him to not intrude on a girl's stuff. He quickly closed the closet door after that and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what?\" he asked himself. The place wasn't that big, so he couldn't explore much. There seemed to be a bathroom that smelled of flowers a bit, and a laundry room of course. He looked around the floors,which also pointed out something to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his red t-shirt, which was actually starting to look a little brighter in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my shirt?\" he said to himself. It looked a tiny bit brighter, with a couple spots starting to turn white. Very weird was all Trevor could think about.

And, of course, when a child gets hungry, they can only focus on one thing: food. So, with that on his mind, Trevor helped himself to this girl's house. It's not like she would notice anything amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come to think of it,\" the lost boy started to think. 'What would the girl that lives here think of me being here? Would she know why I'm he-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GROWL!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it, Mr. Tummy, you made me lose my train of thought,\" Trevor said to his stomach. Though, it didn't seem strange to him that he was talking to his stomach. He may have been a little kid, but even he thought talking to parts of his own body to be childish and stupid. Guess he saw nothing wrong with doing something so weird anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, he started looking through the kitchen's cabinets for something easy to cook. Pop-Tarts, cereal, ramen noodles, whatever. That was when he noticed something: Everything was in Japanese. He found a packet of ramen noodles (though he only knew how to make the cups of ramen without any help) and couldn't read a single word! He could only assume it was ramen by the picture, otherwise the words \u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3 would have left him clueless. Trevor looked at the back to see if there were any instructions on the back, but all he found was \"5\u5206\u9593\u304a\u6e6f\u306b\u6cb8\u304b\u3059\u3002 34;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man,\" he said to himself. \"What kind of person has only Japanese food?! I can't even read this! How am I even going to...\" He looked at the instructions again. \"<i>Boil in hot water for five minutes?</i> Wait! Did I just read that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe read the back of the packet again and again, and he somehow read the same thing everytime. It didn't look any different from when he first looked at it in confusion. And yet, he could understand it perfectly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow...\" he muttered to himself. \"I can read Japanese!\" he said while bouncing up and down excitingly. \"Kore wa totemo subarash\u012bdesu!\" Trevor cupped his hand over his mouth in shock. \"Did I just say that?\" he asked himself, but it came out as \"Watashi wa ch\u014ddo sore o itta?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I speak English?!\" he yelled in Japanese. \"What is going o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GROWL!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok.

As he was about to put it up on the sink to start filling it, he realized something: He couldn't reach the sink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baka! I'm only seven! I can't reach the sink!\" However, after that was said, he started growing. The seven years old didn't notice it while he was slapping his head in stupidity, but he was growing past his original 4'4\" height, starting to reach 4'10\". His entire body and muscle structure seemed to grow also, until he looked a good ten years old. Additionally, his shirt was now completely white and somehow managed to grow a pocket on the left side. After a while, he looked back up at the sink. He could reach it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how this happened, but I don't care!\" he cheered in the Japanese voice he also didn't care about anymore. A couple of minutes later, he had water boiling the noodles up on the stove as if he's this many times before. However, after a while, Trevor started to feel something was missing. Perhaps this dish, no matter how simple it was at its core (though miles beyond what he could have done a few minutes ago), it still seemed to require something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bean paste!\" the boy shouted, despite never even hearing of such an item before. He started searching every single cabinet for said paste, but none turned up. However, he did find yellow peppers, chocolate syrup, watermelon cuts, almond milk, and zesty salt, so the dish did not go bare. Though, it did boil for a good ten minutes after he took it off the stove. Come to think of it, it probably would have boiled for much longer if Trevor didn't have the thought that his breakfast didn't want anything to do with him and had to throw it out to stop its little fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were his exact thoughts, by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trevor instantly braced himself for something bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who are you?\" a girl asked in plain Japanese, although Trevor could hear it as well as English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor opened his eyes, and had to look up to see a teenaged girl towering over him.

Good thing too, because as he walked down the sidewalk with her, everything around him looked pretty confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you end up here? I mean, you have parents right?\" asked Tatsuki. Trevor knew that he needed to come up with some excuse for that.

Exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any kind you want I guess.\" She was a little weirded out by the kid's behaviour, but it was nothing she wasn't used to. \"Glazed, chocolate, sprinkles.

Well, Tatuski was eating her's much slower than Trevor since she was busy looking at Trevor eat his. Actually, it was more like <i>devouring</i> than eating. Even while he was chomping to get another huge bite, his mouth was drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Tatuski stammered while inspecting the boy's strange eating habits. Almost <i>similiar</i> eating habits. \"How are you, uh, enjoying those donuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor could only mumble with the pieces of donut in his mouth before he swallowed and started to repond. \"It's soooooo goooood!\" he anwered in a daze with drool running down his chin. His voice seemed even more out there than before along with being higher in pitch. Paying no heed to this, he started stuffing his mouth with his remaining donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... So, you know anywhere you could stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh,\" the boy answered nonchalantly, too focused on his chocolate donut's rich flavor. \"No idea where to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. Do you have any information that would help me find your family then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Trevor's reponse was followed by some om nom noms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you could stay at the dojo while I go to school. My parents'll kill me if I skipped school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor dropped his jaw a little and Tatuski finally had his attention. \"Dojo?! You know kung fu?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karate,\" she corrected with a toothy grin on her face. \"Number one, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The boy was gaping in awe at the girl's statements. \"How many fights have you won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them for the past six years!\" Tauski answered with great pride. \"I even won a championship with a broken arm once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Trevor bursted, awesruck at this teenage girl's apparent accomplishments. \"YOu haven't lost a single fight before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she trailed off. \"There was this one time. A friend of mine was in a really bad mood at the time.\" By now, she looked almost somber. Trevor, however, was eyeing the remaining glazed donut in the box. He glared hopefully at Tatuski, who stared back. The two exchanged stares for a good two minutes until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Tatuski shouted. \"You can have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!

One minute, he's having breakfast. The next, his little brother's inside his favorite anime! He also noticed he seemed to be changing. Fan-freakin'-tastic. How could this even be happening? The last time he saw him, all he did was wish Trevor would see how great Bleach was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God! The wish! The candies! They were real! His own idle wish had sent his little brother into Bleach! To be honest, he was a little glad to see Tatuski have more screentime, but wasn't happy about it being with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Nate thought to himself to calm his nerves. \"So, Trevor is stuck inside an anime. Maybe it was my fault, maybe not. Point is, I got to fix this. Perhaps the best soulution is totry to use the candies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that about Trevor?\" called a female voice at Nate's door. He turned around to see his thirteen year old little sister, Erin. Her expression was a little confused with a hint of worry. She had obviously heard her brother's ramblings to himself. \"And what's this about candies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had to give out a large and lenghthy sigh before looking at his computer screen again. He noticed with dull surprise that Trevor's hair was now a much lighter brown now. Damn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M\u0101, watashi wa iku junbi ga dekite imasu. Ikagadeshou, Tatuski?\" he heard his brother say to the supporting character. Luckily, he could read that he meant \"Well, I'm ready to go. How about you, Tatuski?\" through the subtitles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Trevor?!\" Erin blurted while looking at the same thing. \"The hell is going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had to give another large sigh.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she felt something small go through her, although it wasn't much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what was that?\" she asked herself as she finished up some dishes. \"Well, that's all for the dishes. Hmm, I guess Trevor's room could use some cleaning. He never does clean it himself after all.\" she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor was notorious for never really cleaning his room all that much. For some reason, Lynda began to get a feeling that she should go up to his room for one reason or another. With that, she finished up in the kitchen and began to go upstairs. As she did, something odd caught her eye. She looked around the walls, and it was as if the walls were beginning to get higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are the walls getting higher?\" she asked herself before shaking her head. She was probably just imagining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she began walking up the stairs, her height and age slowly began to shrink, beginning to go lower than 5 feet. She could still hold on the staircase, but it seemed like it was getting a bit more difficult now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Lynda imagined that it was just nerves after some cleaning. She walked past Nate's room along the way. She could see that Nate and Erin were in there, perhaps about to come out, but she didn't say anything. As she passed that room, she found Trevor's room and entered it, room being as messy as it ever was. She sighed as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she began walking around, clearing some random things off the ground. As she kept walking around, he kept decreasing in age, easily going past teenage years and into her childhood years.

Like any parent, Lynda found most of it silly, but as she picked up one of the games Trevor had, a smile adorned her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a good game.\" she said before shaking her head. \"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this happened, her blouse shifted material, becoming a bit sturdier than usual. The buttons along the middle disappeared as the folds fused together into a simple t-shirt. The light color soon faded, being replaced by a nice red color.

Her shirt reformed itself into two leggings, fading blue as they did. Before long, she had a pair of blue shorts to accompany the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, she was going through Trevor's Pokemon stuff, more admiring it than cleaning it. For some reason, she seemed to have a profound interest in it now. As she did, her brown hair retracted into her head, becoming short and very similar to Trevor's old cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's this?\" she said as she came across a DVD of Pokemon: Diamond and Pearl. That was a series she liked a bit, mostly thanks to the characters. In particular, she looked at the newer character, Dawn, finding her to be a personal favorite among the females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked her. She was cute.\" she said, not really thinking like Lynda much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, her female facial features reformed, beoming that of a young boy. She now heavily resembled Trevor appearance-wise, and before long, as her panites reshaped into underwear, a small appendage grew there, completing the change into a young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should watch this again.\" smiled Trevor, as Lynda completely became a new Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

She was annoyed, but amused. \"See, this friend, his name is Ichigo Kurosaki. And I tell 'ya, he used to be such a big baby when we were little! Always by his mom, always crying when he got beaten in karate, which was every time. He was a nice kid and all, but a horrible fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatuski now had Trevor's full attention. He himself remembered when he used to be a momma's boy, all those years ago. But he had to be at most seven back then, and he was thirteen now.

And traffic is getting busy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Trevor grumbled. \"Just let me use the bathroom before you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I wait for that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't leave until I'm done! Is that too much of a stretch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatuski let out a long groan. \"Fine. Just hurry up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Trevor went into the nearest restroom, not even noticing it being the girls', and sat down on the nearest toilet to do his business. As he did so, he felt his seat becoming even more cushy, not realizing it to be his enlarging rear. Nor did he realize his shrinking boyhood that never seemed to grow with his age. As soon as he was done, he looked at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed as usual: His fifteen year old body was still only 5'2'' and still seemed to be an even 99 pounds. Puberty was rather small on him. In fact, any body hair he may have had before it had already evaporated. Though, he supposed his back-length hair more than made up for it. Hell, he even had two strands that reached down all the way down to his shoulders. Couldn't remember why he let it grow out so much, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the quick inspection, Trevor met back up with his equal aged friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finally ready?\" Tatuski asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" Trevor saluted playfully. And with that, the two darted off to Karakura High.</span></div></div>",

Further more, as they kept walking, Trevor could feel himselt beginning to walk differently. He looked down for a bit and saw that his shorts were seemingly a dark grey right now, different from their blue color before. The leggings even seemed to be fusing together, as it didn't prohibit his walking as much as the shorts did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this friend of yours go there too?\" asked Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Ichigo?

She looked around a bit, but it only confused her further. Honestly, if it weren't for the magic, she'd be having a panic attack by now. But since she was only there because of magic, she was abnormally calm. Confused, but calm. Although, she did get a little scared when a large man, most likely Japanese, came over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jigoku wa anata ga yatte iru to omoimasu ka?\" the man shouted at Nicole, though she did not understand. However, she didn't need to know what he said to be hurt by it. In fact, she was already in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was sobbing, Nicole was changing rapidly. Her very DNA was being rewritten as ripples appeared all over her body. All of her skin turned from its usual pale Caucasion tone to a more yellowish tint. Nicole could recognize it as similar to his brother's friend, Heather Yamamoto. Though, Heather was Japanese-American. Nicole was becoming a full-blooded Japanese. The tears coming from her eyes started to recede, somehow changing her eye color to brown from the Wilsons' regular blue. Right above her new sparkling blue eyes, her eyelids started to meld into her skin, gaining epicanthal folds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole now seemed completely Japanese, but her new genes still caused her body to shift ever so slightly in some places. Before long, her facial features and mole on the right side of her back made her heritage traceable to Hitomi and Shiro Hashimoto. Not that it mattered to Nicole. Besides, she loved being told how much she resembled her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkahana Hashimoto loved her parents after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with her emotions finally in check, Akahana looked back at the man. \"Watashi wa watashi ga koko ni iru hazudatta to omotta,\" she finally answered the man, meaning \"I thought I was supposed to be here,\" in English.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the two were given a psychic image of a little Japanese girl around their sister's age. It took them a few seconds of confusion for it to dawn on them that this girl <b>was</b> their sister. The simultaneous realization caused them both to gasp at the same time. Wait until they saw what changed next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Akahana decided to sit down on a chair against the wall of the pool at the request of the man from earlier, she was stuck with sudden jealousy. The man was directing a calender photo shoot at the pool, so there were obviously plenty of bikini models there. Akahana thought these women were beautiful and could only wish to some day be as pretty as them. Even though she already used up her candy's wish, the magic didn't transport her to a photo shoot for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire body tingled and started to grow far past her prepubescent standards. In an instant, she grew from 3'8'' to a sleek 5'6'', with the womanly legs to match. The girl's face matured to reveal a beautiful Japanese woman's, free of any of her former baby fat or blemishes. A necklace and bracelet appeared on her neck and left wrist repectively. Her hair grew even longer and became more volumous than ever, even curling a bit at the ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkahana's blue dress was ripped to shreds by now, but the remains were already forming into a new set of clothes. A two-piece bikini, to be exact. It looked strange on her flat chest and immature figure, but those problems were soon corrected. Her hair was pushed up from her chest a little bit as a couple of modest breasts were starting to grow. More womanly fat was applied to her hips that also allowed her curves to show in full flaunt. Akahana was far from the five years old she was but moments ago. She now resembled a downright gorgeous 26 years old Japanese model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, everyone knew she was. Akahana Hashimoto was known across all of Japan for her beauty and occasional acting gig. In fact, she was in the middle of a shoot now, with a good five bodyguards protecting her and her fellow models. Life was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Akahana Hashimoto: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCvTHw9BpBY/TzntR37UyeI/AAAAAAAAD4s/zRASTqpySVk/s1600/Japanese%20Model%20Yuko%20Ogura%20In%20The%20Summer%202.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCvTHw9BpBY/Tz...</a> )</span></div></div>",

As far as he knew, all three of his kids were running around somewhere. He seemed to think about a fourth sometimes, but the idea of him having a fourth kid sounded very weird. He shook his head as he thought that, figuring that there wasn't much to think about there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have another kid, right...\" he trailed off as he kept channel surfing. As he kept on watching, a different show appeared. It was one of the kiddy shows that Nicole used to watch. As Mike was about to hit the channel button, he suddenly stopped. Something in him didn't want to change the channel, which was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's going on here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, he felt a small shock go through his body, although it wasn't enough for him to really think about it. However, he soon started to see the walls begin to extend, if that made any sense. It felt like the room was getting a bit bigger. Mike raised an eyebrow at that. The room couldn't be getting bigger, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be seeing things.\" he said to himself. However, as he ended up taking a look at the show, his height was slowly decreasing, along with his age for that matter. Quickly, he wasn't looking like a mid-30's man anymore, as he rapidly grew down past 20 years old, looking a bit more like a teenager. With that, his height was rapidly going down, nearing 5 feet, far from where he would end up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I guess this show isn't bad. I can see why the others watch it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the show was over, and Mike got up from the couch and stretched. However, he noticed that the room looked much bigger now, as he had grown down past 5 feet, and past 4'6 as well, looking ever younger as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd something else seemed to catch his eye as he looked down. \"Am I wearing sandals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis socks had vanished by now, exposing his feet as his shoes were rapidly shifting. Their color was going towards a bright blue color, and more of his feet were beginning to be shown. Mike was beginning to wonder if he was hallucinating or something.</span></div></div>",

Although, part of him really didn't have too much of a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as he walked up the stairs, he had to hold onto the railing, as his height kept decreasing. Now, he truly looked like a little child, barely at 4 feet right now. His skin was much softer now, and hairless for that matter. He didn't think about such things though. He just wanted to find out what was happening. He got to the top of the stairs, bypassing Nate's room, and happened to see Nicole's room. However, while he normally would just go past it, something beckoned him to walk in. As he did, his shorts and shirt began fusing together at the hem, becoming one single garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on his toes for a bit to open his door, being pretty short and all, and got into Nicole's room. Like any little girl, her room was filled with dolls and the like, with some stuffed animals as well. A little bear was Nicole's favorite when she was around, and Mike even began to find the dear cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Mr. Stuffy.\" he cooed at the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, his facial features softened, his little mouth once again having mostly baby teeth, with some adult teeth coming in. His face took on Nicole's soft features, including the little freckles she had. As this happened, his brown hair began flowing out of his head, flowing down to his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, Mike walked over to the collection of dolls and animals and began to play, honestly having a lot of fun. He laughed and giggled through most of it, his voice becoming Nicole's high-pitched one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this happened, his shirt and shorts, which ere now fully fused, turned a bright blue color. The leggings of his shorts tore and came together in a single skirt form, creating a light blue dress for the little kid. Beneath his changing underwear, which was becoming little girl panties, Mike could briefly feel something pop in his groin. He reached down and felt something small slowly slip away, as \"she\" became Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? Oh well, back to Mr. Stuffy.\" giggled Nicole as she arranged a little \"party\" with her animals and dolls.</span></div></div>",

All of his surroundings were new to him, yet he had an absolute sense of regularity sitting next to his tomboy friend in a Japanese classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was taking longer than usual, so Trevor just started to glance around the classroom. It seemed pretty normal (for Japan, that is) with some pretty average students. Well... Maybe not completely average. Just from his seat in the back, he noticed a guy with almost impossibly shiny glasses sewing embroidery, a dark-skinned guy who could pass as a full grown man (an almost impossibly buff grown man, at least), and another guy with bright orange hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait.

Although he'd never seen this woman before in his life, Trevor was somehow able to identify the woman as Ms. Ochi, the class's teacher. \"Sorry I'm late. There was some kind of freak accident down at Mistsumiya. I think it was some type of spontaneous explosion or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was suddenly erupt with murmurs of the accident. Annoyed by her student's interuptions, Ms. Ochi saw it fit to clear her throat as loudly as possible. \"Since you all seemed so interested in explosions, perhaps you'd enjoy our chemistry experiment today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire class gave a collective groan with the exception of Trevor, who seemed almost excited of the idea. Tatuski looked at his expression and gave a nervous chuckle. She didn't know if she trusted this guy with chemicals. Or anything that could potentionally lead to an explosion.</span></div></div>",

Both of them hadn't realized that their parents were gone, having become newer versions of their little siblings. Lynda, who was now Trevor, had walked into Nate's room, looking for his big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" he wondered out loud. As he did, he looked forward, seeing the jar of candies that Nate had left behind. Of course, no kid could resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, candy.\" he smiled as he climbed up Nate's chair and grabbed one of the many candies inside, instantly putting it inside his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this is good!\" he smiled, before jumping down from the chair and walking out before Nate could realize he took one. He ran back to his room, closing the door as he did. After closing it, he looked around at his toys all around. One of them was a DVD for the Pokemon show, which was one of his favorites, especially in the recent series. One of the newer main characters, Dawn, was someone the little kid thought was very cute. He had a crush on her, although he told no one about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could see someone like her.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Back with Nate*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wish was made, Nate had just exited the bathroom, feeling refreshed after relieving himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe I should try and find Trevor or Nicole.\" he said to himself. He hadn't seen either since the wish, so perhaps it was time to look. Quickly, he began walking towards Trevor's room. Opening it a peek, he could see \"Trevor\" inside, making him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, so the wish worked I guess.\" said Nate. Instead of going back to his room to see if he was still on the TV, Nate instead began walking downstairs. He could tell the news to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he began to go downstairs, he felt the handrail get higher to lean on. He turned to the side and saw that he actually had to reach up a bit to keep a hand on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened here?\" he asked, looking around and seeing that the area looked a little bigger than normal. However, that wasn't the case. Nate was rapidly shrinking, growing down and closer to that of a kid, possibly around 10 years old. His new height was rounding out at about 4 feet or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe all this stress is getting to me.\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he reached the bottom of the stairs, he didn't notice his figure and skin start to become more feminine, with his skin getting softer as if it was taken care of daily, and his figure became more petite. </span></div></div>",

He looked down, seeing little kids feet attached to smaller legs. He couldn't see all of him, but he looked a lot like a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he still wanted to tell Erin about this, so he tried to look around for her. However, he couldn't find her in the kitchen or dining room. He then walked towards the family room, but couldn't find her there either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, where is she?\" he asked in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he walked, his hair began to grow, becoming darker as it began to flow past his shoulders. His t-shirt was also beginning to lose his sleeves, becoming darker as well. Nate didn't notice either of these as he was focused on finding Erin, but he still felt the odd feeling throughout it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just watch some TV.\" he decided, jumping onto the sofa. As he did, his t-shirt finished turning jet black, while also losing any sleeves it had as it confirmed closer to his thinner body. The undershirt he wore also seemed to be getting smaller in a sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Nate turned the TV on, putting whatever he could find on. He briefly saw a commercial with Akahana on it, but didn't care much for it. He just wanted to see what was on. However, to his surprise, he actually ended up on Cartoon Network, where a Pokemon episode was airing. Surprisingly, he smiled at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, another episode.\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, his hair flowed down past his back, some of it twisting into a particular hairstyle that used two hair clips on the sides of his head. In addition to all of that, it began to even get a bit of a blue shade to it. Quite unnatural normally, but Nate wasn't becoming someone normal at all.</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, the ends reconnected, and the pink skirt was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, Nate heard someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate!\" cried \"Trevor\", who was really the transformed Lynda. However, Nate didn't know that and smiled as he came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Trevor!\" smiled Nate, whom Trevor hugged upon coming over. As this happened, Nate's socks rose up his legs, turning blackish as his new look began to complete. His facial features were already feminine now, including his eyes turning a bright blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you come over?\" asked Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now.\" said Nate, not wondering why Trevor would ask such a thing. However, as his underwear began to turn into pink panties, an opening was forming in his groin, as his manhood began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're watching the show. You look so much like the girl in this.\" smiled Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" smiled Nate, who by now was even beginning to sound like her. His manhood continued to shrink away, as Nate began to feel Trevor's eyes on him. He turned towards Trevor, making him turn his head quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.\" Trevor said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiled at him. It ended up being his last as Nate as his manhood faded away, leaving what almost looked like a real anime-like girl in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, tell me!\" smiled Dawn as she shook Trevor back and forth. Trevor blushed and didn't answer. It only made Dawn even more curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I'll see what it is eventually. Let's go watch another episode in your room before my mom has to pick me up.\" said Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game for that.\" smiled Trevor as he took his 10-year old friend up to his room.</span></div></div>",

See, today's chemistry lab didn't exactly work out all too well. By that, I mean Trevor kind of caused his and Tatuski's flask to explode after making their solution unstable with his lunch. It never crossed his mind how he suddenly had a girly pink backpack he didn't come into the building with, or how he had a homemade lunch inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, him and Tatuski had to wash off whatever formula he ended up creating. Whatever it was, it smelt just like Trevor's cooking: terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you'd do something so stupid!\" Tatuski growled while washing her face with the faucet. \"Why would you even try put your lunch in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Trevor replied apologetically. \"I was just trying to eat a good luck ramen and watermelon sandwich, but I guess some of the mustard and hot sauce must have dropped into the flask. I'm so sorry, Tatuski-chan.\" His teenage girl face was starting to wilt while his feminine voice cracked a little. Tatuski didn't like the looks of it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, it's okay, Trevor. Just try not to do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" he said while saluting playfully. \"Would you like to try some of my sandwich to make it up to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... No.\" The two shared a brief laugh and got back to washing off whatever chemicals may still be on them. Trevor took the time to adjust the bangs of his lenghthy hair. He took a pair of flowery hairpins out of his pocket and used them to tuck his bangs behind his ears. He worried less about where the hairpins came from and more about why he did't have them on before. He usually always had them on, in memory of his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... His brother wasn't dead. Or was he? No, last he checked, Nate was... a person? Who was Nate? The only image that came to his mind when he thought 'brother' was Sora. And he knew he was gone. Safe and sound in... Heaven? He knew that much was true, yet the name 'Heaven' seemed wrong. What was the real name again?</span></div></div>",

Possibly even an <i>evil</i> one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he was not scared. For some reason, he actually felt <i>empowered</i>, like he knew he could take on whatever he was feeling. Though, a small voice in the back of his orange haired head told him that Tatuski couldn't get involved. He had to find this thing without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...

She proceeded to head back to their classroom, noticing her Ichigo, Yasutora Sado, and Uryu Ishida rushing down the hall also. Either they all had to use the bathroom at the same time, or something fishy was brewing. This wasn't the first time they've all rushed out at the same time, though there was usually someone else who rushed out with them.

It looked kind of like a giant gecko but with a skull for a face and a sharp knife for a tail. Also, it was about 50 feet tall and had at least ten feet, unlike most geckos. Trevor could swear he'd seen other things like this, though not quite as large. He did a double take to the front entrance of the school, waiting for someone and ignoring the giant abomination in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, where are they?', he thought to himself, not even knowing who <i>they</i> were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, idiot!\" the giant skull-gecko shouted at Trevor. \"You can obviously see me, so why are you ignoring me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor looked back at the huge monstrosity with a calm look. \"Sorrry, I'm just waiting for some of my friends to arrive. I'll get back to you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" it called out, aghast at the boy's unwavering attitude towards itself. \"You're just going to wait? You're just going to <b>ignore me?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not ignoring you. I just politely asked you to wait until I can attend to you. My friends will be here shortly, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you little...! Fine! I was hoping to eat the Soul Reaper I was smelling, but you look delictable enough. Time to say aww!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast opened its gaping maw and charged towards Trevor. He quickly dodged out of the way, accidentally causing the Hollow to smack face first into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Trevor was a little frightened by the sudden charge, but then something dawned on him. \"Wait, why would I say 'Aww'? You're the the one trying to eat <i>me</i>.\" His question wasn't much of a taunt, more of an actual case of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Shut up!\"</b> the gecko demanded while charging towards him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Trevor didn't even flinch. He could sense the stronger spiritual pressure coming from above at a breakneck pace. And he saw the orange haired teenager with what looked like a giant kitchen knife stab the monster's back.

To tell the truth, the only reason the fight wasn't over already was because Ichigo didn't account for the Hollow to move before he could cut its mask off. Oh well, at least he got to skip some more of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the orange haired teenager started slicing the out of control giant, Trevor just watched in awe. This boy, this Ichigo Kurosaki, was amazing! Somehow, he felt like he knew him longer than just today. Even weirder, he felt like Ichigo was more important to him than he could believe. Like they were good friends, but Trevor wanted to be something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor simply watched as Ichigo sliced off the gecko's legs one by one, only getting wacked with its tail after the third one. He didn't dare worry, though. He knew Ichigo had it under control. Trevor just watched his hero get back up and start fighting again while cupping his chest in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Strange. His chest felt oddly softer than usual. Actually, it felt kind of plushy. Oh well, it was nothing out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Trevor notice the strange thing he was feeling on his chest <i>was</i> his chest. Or, at least, were breasts growing on said chest.

Orihime could be a little excitable and weird at times, but at least she meant well. He knew she couldn't possibly be dumb, since she was one of the school's top ranking students. Still, her out-there attitude did tend to surprise him at times. It was something you always got used to, but always noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, Orihime?\" Ichigo muttered while rubbing off any blood the monster must have left. \"Why exactly are you so excited to kill the Hollow? Haven't you done this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Of course, Ichigo-kun! I just haven't defeated any Hollows since when I first summoned the Shun Shun Rikka to protect Tatuski-chan. This is still a victory on my part. Maybe not a gold one, like my first Hollow fight, but at least a silver victory. A Hollow victory, in you will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime couldn't help but chuckle at her own pun. Besides, she did tend to get pretty talkative around Ichigo, but he didn't seem to mind. In fact, she could swear she saw him crack a smile at her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good for you,\" he smiled back. \"That was some quick thinking. I'm sorry if I couldn't protect you in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that, Ichigo-kun! I'm sorry that you didn't get to defeat the giant gecko monster like you wanted. I promise that the next time there's a giant gecko on the loose, whether Hollow or not, you can have it.\" All of this was said without a hint of irony, all genuine concern on Orihime's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Ichigo sweated off. \"We should probably be getting back to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where's Chad and Uryu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They kind of got stopped by the hall moniter on the way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you were able to get past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had the advantage of having my Soul Candy handy, so she couldn't even see me in Soul Reaper form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kon's in your body right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" There was a slight pause. \"Wait... Crap! We should probably hurry up now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way, Kurosaki-kun!\" Orihime saluted before the two headed back to their classroom.

You can also feel your face contorting, at the same time as you develop an hourglass figure. You then say \"Oh my god! It worked!\" and shriek right after that, realizing that your voice is high pitched, and very feminine sounding.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLooking down, you see you have female legs, and you see your testicles ascend into your body, and your penis shrivel up into a clitoris, before a hood develops to hide it. You can feel the ovaries and Uterus form inside of your body, and suddenly, you feel really thirsty. While looking down, you see your scales starting to form on your hairless legs. Panicked, you begin to run, but suddenly, your feet begin to hurt because they are becoming flatter and your toes are getting incredibly thin, and incredibly long. Suddenly, you trip and fall down because your legs have fused together, starting at the thighs and working on down. You begin to cry, soon after, because you look down and see nothing but a mermaid tail. But you quit crying, and instinct kicks in, you you begin crawling to the nearest body of water.</span></div></div>",

I wish Nate was dried off, and wearing... let's says a Japanese girl's school uniform, just for fun.\" All the moisture seemed to magical towel off of you, before a silky bra covered your D-cups, followed by a white long-sleeve button-up blouse over your torso, then an orange wool sweater vest with your school's insignia on upper left section. A Green tartan pleated miniskirt wraps around your hips and covers the area where flesh ends and tail begins, your blouse cutely untucked atop the skirt, with a leather belt in the skirt's belt loops. Finally, a green necktie wraps around your neck and ties itself in a loose windsor knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I was hoping for a sailor fuku, but this is good too.\" Heather says, taking the half-dissolved candy out of her mouth and putting it in a napkin in her lap. \"Alright, now that you're dressed, I was going to say, since when have you been such a mermaid fan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, your face tenses up, then finally you just start gushing on your love of mermaids like a crazed otaku fangirl... and barring your blue-scaled mermaid tail, you'd pretty much fit the bill in terms of appearance. \"<i>OhmygodIlovemermaidsMermaidsaresokawaii-desuIhaveasecretstashofmermaidfi gurinesandfanartIt'sbeenmydreamsincesinceIwas6tobeamermaid!!</i>\" you blurt so fast in a high-pitched fangirl voice that if this were a comedy anime you'd have stars in your eyes. Heather kind of swore she did she stars in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as 'yes.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a dream come true!!\" you keep going in your fangirl haze, but then, \"...but don't you dare fuck this up!!\" you go yandere creepy mean, again, if this were an anime, Heather would had seen flames shooting from your eyes as you point at her, and more importantly, the candy she still had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay...\" Heather said, a bit unnerved, before asking, \"but if you wanted to be a mermaid, why not go to the mermaid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a 360 and a computer.\" you say plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather gets the weirdest look, \"You didn't go to the ocean because you have an Xbox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. This is the place where my stuff is, and going to the ocean, while it sounds like fun, I couldn't run out on my family and friends, and even though I love being a mermaid, I likes my gaming, and electronics no workey underwater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait?\" Heather spoke curiously. \"So you were...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I had actually planned to make the very same wish you made so I could get back in the house after I got done swimming. Besides, we got school Monday (Today was Saturday).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were intending to go to school, as a mermaid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no plans whatsoever of undoing this wish!!\" you almost yell, giddy and proud of your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are really dedicated to this mermaid wish, aren't you Nate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Mizuko from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, 'water child,' how creative.\" Heather sarcastically deadpans. \"But that's your decision, not mine, Mizuko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use a candy to wish your name was Mizuko, and people always knew you as a mermaid. The wave of magic washes over the world, altering the memories, pictures, and documents on you to reflect this. However, Heather seems unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nate... I'm not sure it worked...\" Heather said, but then, Nicole ran out through the sliding glass doors and asked you, \"Mizuko, have you seen my dolly!! Trevor's being mean and hiding it again!!\" You shake your head no, and she runs back in, grabbing a stick, and before the sliding glass door closes, you hear the sounds of Nicole wailing on Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it worked, but why wasn't I affected?\" Heather wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think because you've used the candies. Apparently, if you have used one of these, no one can rewrite your memories.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, after seeing your dedication to your mermaid dream, I have a particular form I want to take that I've always wanted to be myself, and I'm going for it.\" She pops the candy back in her mouth, saying, \"I wish I was...\"</span></div></div>",

Its structure is slimming down, its hips are rounding, its hair is lengthening, its lady-like legs are taking shape, its features are feminizing, and its chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, lets not talk about the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a girl.  <i>Literally. A. Girl.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shriek, and so does Trevor.  Just that, the octave of your voice is pitched the same as Trevor's!  WHAT THE?  It's as high as tweetie bird's!  Wait, hasn't your voice already broken? Mom used to joke about you sounding like Darth Vader right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember the magical candy, the wish, and... the sweet wrapper in Trevor's hand.  Maybe it can tell you something? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're desperate, so you lunge for the flimsy wrapper like a deranged sugar-high kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(What happens next?)</i></span></div></div>",

What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor has two sides to him.  The Angel Side, and the Devil Side.  Sometimes I wonder if he's bio-personality-disorder because he acts them out so well.  I mean, he can win any adult's love, and yet, he can also re-create hell for anyone he chooses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he's so anxious he's probably unintentionally playing Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme the wrapper!\" You order.  \"I need it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... you're a girly!\" Trevor merely gasps again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to be reminded that again.  <i>Gosh</i>.  Impatiently, you tug hard on the sweet wrapper, and this time, it tears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn!\" you curse angrily.  \"Trevor, gimme it!\"  You hope that it's not completely torn.  Maybe you can piece it back together and read it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor's still in shock.  Instead, he recoils at the touch of your hand as though you're some lethal bacteria, causing the tear to deepen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wrapper tears itself into two clean halves.  And the moment it does, another bout of tingling sensations zip up your spine.  This sensations's different from the first - it's... it's almost numbing.  It's like getting pins and needles all over your back.  The sensation spreads like wild fire, and the next thing you know, your entire body's under that strange spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor's eyes tore themselves out of their socket.  He's sitting right in front of you, gaping at you like you're about to destroy his favourite fire truck - and mind you, that's a jolly great shock to him.  After all, no one dares to touch his toys because Mom loves him to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demand, not fancying being a museum artifact.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you're changing...\" he stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what he means again.  So you turn and stare back at your reflection in the television screen.  True enough, you've got to give this one to him.  You <i>are</i> changing.  In fact, you're changing back to yourself! - you can tell by the way your features are '<i>masculining</i>' themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes!  At last!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sensations has completely left you, you realize how Mom's evil 'wish' had been broken.  The sweet wrapper tore and KA-BOOM, the wish had been reversed!  You realize devilishly that you could use this to your advantage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spy the jar of candies on the table and then sneak another glance at Trevor who's currently wetting himself on the couch.  This sounds evil, but you immediately know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to have some fun! :D</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment Mom exits the living room dramatically, the lights flicker and go off on cue.  And the entire house plunges into a bout of pitch darkness.  At first, you suspect it's Mom who's purposely dolling this out as punishment.  But when you finish mentally countdown-ing from five to zero - and the darkness hasn't lifted, it occurs to you that something isn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor's the first to scream of course.  Well, at least he quit singing.  But when his shrieks get shriller and shriller, you begin to prefer his singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power Outage!\"  Mom yells frantically from the second story.  \"Mike!  Get the torches and candles out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad's completely prepared.  It's as though he's been training for years already.  Professionally, he zips to the kitchen to dig the stuff out, faster than Trevor can say 'Barney' (and mind you, that's hard, especially if you can't tell the difference between your fingers and your toes in the darkness).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finds out a way to get her sweet revenge.  \"Nate, quit standing there!\" She orders.  \"Help your Dad out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, Mom,\" you groan reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, that's <i>no</i> fair.  Trevor's job is easier, considering he's just sitting on couch yelling his lungs sore.  And that's pretty easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble in the pitch darkness, tripping over some of Trevor's cars and trucks, and slipping over your younger sister, Nicole's puzzle pieces.  Oh gosh!   The pain's <i>intoxicating</i>!  Especially Trevor's fire truck.  Ouch!  That one probably caused a big dent on the sole of your foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mom intended to torture you, she definitely succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the kitchen at last, after clearing all the obstacles in your path.  Dad's already in there with Erin, ransacking through the cupboards for the torches and candles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... Need any help?\" You ask the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Trevor howls like a lonesome wolf.  Everyone turns in the direction of the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we've enough people already,\" Dad finally replies half-heartedly.  \"You should go on out and keep Trevor company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT?  You'd wasted your effort overcoming mountains and valleys to get here...  WHAT THE...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl back furiously.  \"I'm staying!  I don't care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Nate, chill off,\" Erin snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom made me come here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Erin replies nonchalantly.  \"Fine, you help out Dad while I'll go tend to Trevor.  Don't forget, you owe me a favour, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes.  Favour, favour, favour - hadn't Erin learnt anything from Church?  Didn't look like it, you know.  So you don't reply.  Owing Erin a favour is almost as bad as keeping Trevor company.  She really knows how to use her favours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... keeping Trevor company is <i>still</i> the utmost worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" you finally decide irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin grins evilly, and you begin to regret your decision.  She's probably already thinking of a million and one ways of using the favour against you.  You sigh - life is unfair.  Erin flashes another triumphant smirk before stumbling to her feet and groping her way out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlucky you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crashes right smack into you, sending you sprawling chest-flat on the stupid floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin-\" you start to yell.  But then, something else catches your attention.  It's the uneven feeling between your chest and the floor.  Is the floor... uneven?  Can't be, right? I mean - it's a floor for goodness sake!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, so at least you've cleared that possibility.  But if the floor's flat... that means <i>your</i> chest is the uneven one...  But how... But how...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap, remember your Mom's wish?</span></div></div>",

As this happened, Tranessa's underwear shifted into pair of purple silk panties while a matching bra materialized on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down to smell the food and a smile appeared on his lips which began to fill out becoming poutier and coated ina bright red lipstick. \"This smells absolutly divine.\" he says. A pair of long dangly earrings appeared in his ears. \"So what time will the guests arrive?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard just smiles before giving his answer.</span></div></div>",

When he sees the couple standing outside the mansion, a bright smile appears on his face. \"Welcome, please come in.\" he says as he welcomes them in what will soon be his home. As they come in the changes to Tranessa continue further. His age jumps up all the way to forty as some signs of aging and lines around his eyes and mouth appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in he closed the door behind him and led them outside where most of the event was going to be taking place and once he got outside, his fingernails turned a bright red color to match what was on his toenails and lips. The rest of his face finished off as his cheekbones rose, eyes widened while the lashes got thicker. Makeup then coated his face making him look beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the gym, both Nallen and Tommy had gotten their gear on and were ready to start sparring. \"Don't think I'll take it easy on you just because you're more delicate than I am.\" Tommy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNallen just laughs him off. \"Oh don't worry about that, and I don't plan on taking it easy on you.\" he quips back with a feminine giggle as he closes in on Tommy. This cacthces Tommy off guard and he gets planted with one punch which knocks him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back later when you want to get serious.\" Nallen says as he searches for a new sparring partnet, as he does so, his ass swelles outwards, giving him that perfect shape that could make any man drool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy just gets back up and brushes himself off. \"Don't worry babe, I will be back.\" he says as he warps back to where Tranessa is.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that was slowly changing itself as Tranessa aged even further going all the way to forty-seven, even more wrinkles and signs of aging appearing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He still looks very pretty even with how old he's getting.' Tommy thinks to himself as he approaches Tranessa to get closer to him and sees that he's really fitting in with his new self, engaged in conversation with many other women who are in their fifties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got even closer to where Tranessa was at and saw a swelling begin on his chest as his breasts started growing in underneath some larger, darker nipples, reaching a B-cup for now. 'I think I'll stick around until this finishes out.' Tommy thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\nBack at the gym, Nallen decided that he was done getting his workout in as he was pretty tired and sweaty. Making his way back to the locker room, he got out of his workout clothes and took a towel out of his bag before heading into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Nallen lets the warm water hit his soft skin which feels really good, causing him to coo. \"I could stay in here all day but unfortunatly I got a schedule to keep.\" he says as he gets himself cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he's done, he makes sure to dry himself off and then wrap his towel around his entire torso like a woman would and goes to put his regular clothes on which have changed since he was away from them. His shirt and pants had merged to become a black dress which would hug his curves nicely and his shoes were black high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets dressed and then goes back out to meet Howard who had been hanging out in the lounge area. \"Ok I'm ready to go.\" he says.</span></div></div>",

So, let me get this straight, you used one of these 'magical candies,' to change my son into 'the woman of your dreams?'\" Mike laughed again, mockingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Tommy nearly scolded Mike again, but, instead, thought of a better way to show it to Mike. In that, Tommy responded only with a mischievous smile. \"Exactly! And... Now that I think about it... I think I've got something planned for you too, Mr. Wilson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What would that be, Tom? Another one of your 'dream women'?\" Mike answered, again, insultingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Not exactly...\" Tommy smiled, placing a candy in his mouth and wishing...</span></div></div>",

The youngest, prettiest and kindest teacher there! The kind of teacher that would make the men drool and the females envious!\" Tommy wished, very specific in his desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ha! Oh, that's a good... One...\" Mike was about to laugh, but noticed that something felt peculiar. He looked down and noticed that gone were his regular clothes. About his body was a dress, a rather short, feminine one at that. To be exact, the dress went about mid thigh and was an azure blue color. On his feet were a pair of black heels. Just as Mike was about to ask Tommy about what was going on, a tingle waved through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   His height rapidly declined from 6'1\" to a petite 5'4\". The muscles about his body dropped rapidly, becoming softer and feminine. The hair all about his body was cleanly removed. His legs and arms became slender and more shapely and defined. His fingers extended in length but grew skinnier, his feet becoming daintier as well, as to fit perfectly the heels. Signs of age sloped downwards, stopping at about 24. The hair on his head grew to about shoulder's length and retained Mike's original, brown hair color. He closed his eyes, and, upon opening them, his eyes were no longer blue, but a hazelnut-like color. Next, his features, skin and such, became very soft and warm. And, finally, his 'male members' departed and were replaced with 'female parts.' He was now a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She closed her eyes, and opened them slowly. She batted her eyes and looked about the strange room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Where in the world am I?\" She asked in her sweet, soft-spoken voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She looked down and beheld Tommy, one of her students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Tommy? Where am I? What's going on?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, Ms. Belle, you don't recall?\" Tommy asked with innocence. \"You were just here tutoring me for that test on friday. You know I'm not really all that good with math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Suddenly, Mike, or, rather, Sandra Belle recalled it all. \"Oh, now I remember! I'm so sorry, Hon! It must've slipped my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's fine, Ms. Belle, it happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh please, Tommy, no need to be so formal! We're not in school or anything\" Ms. Belle chirped sweetly. \"Please, just call me Sandra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"One down, the rest of his family to go...\" Tommy thought, sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Man, if he got to spend the rest of the school year with <i>that</i>, school might just be worth it. Hell, maybe he could skip school entirely. All it would cost was a single candy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the candy in his palm. Should he use this for himself or one of Nate's family? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, messing with other people's life roles was kind of fun,' Tommy thought to himself. 'Come to think of it, with Nate as my celebrity girlfriend, I would be short one best friend. But who would best fit the bill?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a while, until a certain memory popped up in his mind. Nate's mother, Lynda Wilson, always came between the two whenever Tommy wanted to stay at Nate's a little longer or vice versa. She even called his parents on him after a mere two minutes of warning. Perhaps it would be fun to make <i>her</i> his new best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devilish teenager popped the candy into his mouth. \"I wish Nate's mom was right in front of me.\" Then, in a bright flash, Lynda Wilson was looking around confusingly before looking straight at Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy Iverson, what am I doing here?\" she asked in confusion, yet still seathing with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already given my whole speach to your husband, I mean Ms. Belle, so I'm not even going to bother you with an explanation.\" The teenager sat down on his couch, pulled out two X-Box controllers and popped a candy in his mouth. \"Please, take a seat, Ms. Wilson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you mean <i>Mrs.</i> Wilson, Mister Iverson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd believe that to be true, wouldn't you? You know, you really need to take a load off, Ms. Wilson. I bet we'd be able to get along very easily. Maybe even be best friends.\" He widened his grin even further at the confused but nontheless furious woman. \"I do wish you were my best friend.\"</span></div></div>",

But that doesn't mean they'll happen, young man.\" The 36 year old woman and mother smugly told the teenage boy before her. Lynda never thought all too highly of the boy called Tommy Iverson. She thought him to be only trouble, and, in that, she never did approve of her son, Nate, spending so much time with him. Lynda actually believed him to be the spawn of the devil himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I beg to differ, Ms. Wilson.\" Tommy replied blankly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You know I'm a married <i>woman</i>, Tommy!\" Lynda shot furiously. \"Why do you keep calling me 'Ms?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh, so I can see you don't know of what's become of your husband...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What did you do to him, you little punk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Tommy, upon hearing those words, took another suck of the candy and wished again, \"I wish Lynda Wilson knew what happened to her husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lynda gave a strange look to Tommy, but suddenly, her eyes went wide. Several images flashed before her eyes. First, she saw Tommy wish Mike, her husband, into his room. Next, she saw Tommy pop a candy in his mouth and heard him make a wish. Finally, she saw the man once her husband become a youthful, pretty young woman. He, or rather she, didn't even know who she was! She, the woman once Mike, thought herself a brand new woman! Lynda, with that, knew everything, and exploded into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You, terrible, terrible boy! What have you done to my hus-!\" Lynda was suddenly cut off by a most peculiar feeling that shot through all about her body. <i>It was beginning.</i> She then remembered Tommy's wish. Her petite, womanly height, first off, shot from 5'4\" to 5'6\". Her shapely legs and slender arms became more masculine and bulky. Her smooth, shapely legs grew more muscle about them, and hair sprouted from every which way. Her feet grew in size, as well, also growing hair. Her arms, they became the slightest bit shorter and stubbier, also erupting hair and muscle. Her breasts essentially vanished, and, her chest sprouted even more hair and became significantly stronger. Her long brown hair shrank drastically, leaving behind a cut fitting for a teenage boy. Around her throat erupted an Adam's apple. Her face grew more masculine, all womanly features rapidly fading, though more youthful at the same time. Her blue eyes remained constant. All this was followed by the most drastic of changes. <i>She</i> became a <i>he</i>. Finally, her, or his, clothes from a womanly dress and flats to a pair of blue jeans, a tee shirt sporting a video-game logo of some sort about it, and a pair of black sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The boy closed his eyes, and kept them shut for but a few seconds before reopening them and happily greeting his friend, Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey, Bro! How ya doing?\" Lenny Atkins greeted, with his masculine voice, walking up to Tommy, providing him an intricate hand-shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Just, fine, Len, just fine. Take a seat, let's play some X-Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sounds great, Man! Y'know, I can't help but feel a little off today, not myself... Maybe some X-Box with my best bud will fix that!\" Lenny exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Maybe it will.\" Said Tommy blankly. \"Maybe it will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hot chicks, upcoming parties, the hot new teacher, Sandra Belle. Tommy seemed to <i>really</i> like that subject. By the sound of things, Lenny was every bit as unpopular as his friend. The thought of still being unpopular despite being in possession of all-powerful wish candies left a sour taste in his mouth. However, after about two straight hours of marothoning, the two best friends started to feel hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, do you have any food around here, bro?\" Lenny asked his friend, not taking his eyes off the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy laughed a bit before pausing the game and taking the jar of candies. \"Well, I bet these'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding, right? I need real food, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lenny, what would you say if I could get us some food <b>and </b> a hot chick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you're lying. Dude, just go in the kitchen and pop some popcorn or something!\" Lenny was starting to get impatient. \"We can talk about hot chicks later, but let's try to focus on food for right now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" Tommy responded while getting up to go to the kitchen with the candies in hand. When he was certain he was all alone, he took out candy and popped it in his mouth. \"I wish Trevor Wilson was here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Nate's younger brother was in front of the teenager with a confused look on his face. \"Tommy, what's going on here? Do you know where my parents or Nate is? I haven't find them all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older boy laughed at the younger's statement. Not only was he too young for proper grammar, he also had no ideas of what was going on with his family. Should he make their position known to the boy? Nah. He was too young to comprehend it enough to get a fun reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor,\" Tommy started to talk. \"You've always wanted to play with me and your brother, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" he answered confused. His expression lightened up a couple seconds later. \"Wait, you mean I finally get to play with y'all?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. You get to watch as your mother and I play and you serve us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you were my family's foreign maid.\"</span></div></div>",

You must tell me what you've done of my mother!\" Trevor pleaded to Tommy, his speech pattern changing without his knowing, and, his already poor English becoming more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    7 year-old Trevor didn't quite understand Nate and Tommy sometimes. Trevor looked up to both of them! He thought they were so cool! Yet, most of the time, they were only jerks to him. Not inviting him to play with them, and, if Nate or Tommy did invite, it was only for the shortest of times. And, even then, he was only invited to retrieve them drinks when their 'lazy-butts,' as Trevor described it, couldn't, or wouldn't, do it themselves. But, even though he was only invited for service, Trevor enjoyed it no less. It was a little time with some boys he looked up to, and, hey, he always loved to lend a helping hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, since you won't remember in a few seconds anyway, I'll tell you of your mother, father and brother. Your mother is, or was the boy sitting next to me. You will refer to him as 'Lenny-san.' Your father i've turned from your father into a young adult woman with a bright future ahead of her. So, don't be too sad on his loss. Finally, your brother, well, he's becoming the girl of my dreams, Ellen Page.\" Tommy explained, in a manner almost condescending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"WHAT?!?!?!\" Trevor freaked out. How could all those things have happened? Had he really just heard that? That his mom is now a teenage boy, like Nate and Tommy. That his father was now a big girl, a lady teacher, like the nice ones he has at school. And that his brother was turning into a girl whose name he's heard on TV and movies before. Could all these things really have happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You serious, Tommy-san?\" Trevor asked, his speech altering further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Every word.\" Tommy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Just then, whether or not  the things Tommy described were true, Trevor began to feel... Weird. <i>It began.</i> A most peculiar chill ran up Trevor's spine, this chill caused Trevor to stand completely straight as his body twisted and contorted. As his body spasmed, his eyes were forced shut and his height transitioned from 3'8\" to about 5'3\" in seconds time. As his height grew, his body became evenly proportioned. His legs grew taller, his arms longer, his hands and feet just the slightest bit bigger. Whilst this happened, his arms and legs lost the little muscle he had and left his arms and legs long and slender, especially his legs. His muscle was instead replaced with a womanly fat that mainly went to his chest, hips and legs, particularly the thighs. His face contorted and particular features changed: His eyes became almond-shaped and slightly slanted. His adam's apple vanished, leaving him a high-pitched feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Speaking of eyes, they changed from his blue to that of a caramel color. His white skin became significantly more pale in color and appearance. His short, dark-brown hair lightened up in color, becoming light-brown and grew notably longer, to where his hair went slightly past the shoulders. Finally, his 'male members,' were replaced with a fully functional reproduction system of a healthy 22-year old woman. As a final touch, his, or rather, her jeans, t-shirt and tennis shoes became a french-maid outfit. Her shirt became a black and white blouse, and, her jeans, they fashioned them self into a matching, mid-thigh length skirt. Her ankle length socks became socks of the knee length, and looked more like leggings than socks. Finally, her tennis-shoes fashioned themselves into a white pair of ballet flats that fit her dainty, feminine feet like a charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>It was done.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Just then, the 22-year-old Yoko Sato slowly opened her eyes. When her eyes were finally opened, she batted them, as if just awoken from a rather long slumber. She looked around confusedly and kept on doing that until her name was called by a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yoko!\" Tommy called to his family's Japanese maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes, Tommy-san? What you need?\" Yoko asked, anxious to help, her English flawed. She was still attempting to become accustomed to the language. After all, she had just moved to the U.S.A from Japan less than a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Can you make Lenny and I here a couple of sandwiches?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes, Tommy-san! I get that right away!\" Yoko said, tending to the son of her master's needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Just then, Yoko heard another call, a woman's voice, erupting from downstairs, to be specific, the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yoko! Can you help me with the dishes?\" Joan, Tommy's mom called to their maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, Master! I help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yoko! You can just call me Joan!\" Joan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ok, Joan-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And, with that, Yoko rushed to her aid, and, after which, to retrieve her young master some food. She just loved lending a helping hand where needed. Especially the Iverson's. After all, they did pay for Yoko's transportation from Japan to the U.S. So, why wouldn't she help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Yoko was busy, swamped, even. And she loved it.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Imagine the fun he could have with this information!  \"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, are you freakin' blind? Whenever she's anywhere around us, she turns pink and stammers. Man, you are blind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, Erin was always like that around me, wasn't she?' Tommy thought to himself. 'Well, I suppose she does have good taste, I'll give her that. Perhaps she deserves something nice. Well, her brother is about to become my celebrity girlfriend, so I suppose I have no need for lower girls. Sure, I like that cheerleader, Janet Day, but she's no Ellen Paige. Though, she really could use a boyfriend...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lenny, I'll be in the bathroom. Don't look at Yoko for too long while I'm away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time is inappropriate?\" the teenager joked, but to a nonexistant audience. Apparently, Tommy <i>really</i> needed to use the bathroom. \"Oh well, at least I can help myself to hi-<b>DAMMIT!</b> Who takes candies with them in the bathroom?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tommy was busy in the bathroom formulating his wish. He had to word this perfectly. Nate turning into Ellen Paige was just a pleasant accident. The next time couldn't be as satisfying. He could just wish Erin here and wish on her then like he's been doing, but there was no reason for her to be here. Besides, it's not like him and Lenny need a third wheel right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could change by herself and he could just watch. But then he couldn't break the news about her family to her. That was the best part! Well, maybe she could just find out for herself. Okay, Tommy was sure he was ready now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Erin Wilson would learn of her family's transformations before turning into Janet Day's ideal boyfriend while I can mentally watch.\" There, done.

I\u2019m tired when I get home and besides, I take care of everything outside,\u201d Mike snapped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda frowned, \u201cMike I\u2019m not putting you down and denying that you don\u2019t work, but I\u2019m not exactly on a cake walk here either.  It\u2019s a lot of work keeping this house up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet the kids to help, they need to earn their keep,\u201d Mike retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike, they do help and I appreciate them for it, but you wouldn\u2019t know that.  You seem to take no interest in the way I keep things going around here,\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want more acknowledgement on what you do, then, thanks for taking care of the household,\u201d Mike said snidely as he continued getting ready for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour an ass!   All I\u2019m asking for is a little help with the daily chores in the house.  Picking up after yourself, taking some dirty laundry to the washer, helping with the meals and clean up.  That\u2019s all,\u201d Lynda said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Mike said as he started to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard your father coming and quickly hurried down the hall so your parents wouldn\u2019t know that you had been eavesdropping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ducked into your bedroom and watched your dad go past.

You were startled since you thought he had already left.  As he came in you notice it looked as if he had been crying.  \u201cDad is everything okay?\u201d you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it okay,\u201d he said as he quickly headed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused by what had just happened.  You were even more astonished when your mother came down 30 minutes later wearing clothes that looked like your dad\u2019s work clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRunning late, gotta get.  See you tonight, Nate,\u201d she said as she rushed into the garage.  You heard a vehicle start and pull away at a rapid speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting at the table stunned at what you had just seen when you heard someone come into the room.   You looked over and saw your dad, only he was dressed completely wrong.   He was now wearing his wife\u2019s clothes.    \u201cUh, hey,\u201d you said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Nate,\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the usual.  Have to start cleaning, laundry, get a shopping list put together,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at him as he stepped over to the sink and started cleaning up some dishes. <br>\r\nHe was wearing red low heeled shoes, a pair of white capri pants and a red blouse, all of which seemed very snug on his larger frame.  Looking closer the outline of bra straps were noticeable across his shoulders and back. You continued to watch him as he moved around the kitchen.  He was having no problem walking around in the heeled shoes and as he turned toward you, you realized that clothing wasn\u2019t the only thing he was wearing of your mother\u2019s.   Quickly looking away so not to appear to be staring, you took in what you had just seen unsure how you had missed it the first time.  Your dad was wearing makeup.  He had red lipstick on and noticeable eye shadow on his eyes and you weren\u2019t an expert, but you thought it even looked as if he had mascara on his lashes.   You looked again and saw that he even was wearing her wedding ring and earrings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell did that wish do you wondered.   Your sisters came into the room and sat down at the table.  Your dad turned around, \u201cMorning girls, give me just a minute and I will get your cereal,\u201d Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you mommy,\u201d they both answered in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were floored.   Neither of your sisters thought anything about your dad wearing their mother\u2019s clothes, in fact they seemed to think he was the mother.   So no one seems to notice that anything had changed but me.  Interesting you thought wondering what the rest of the day would bring.  </span></div></div>",

You could tell that he was still physically a man, but he was starting to behave more like a woman as time went by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours had passed while you had played games in your room.  School had been called off due to weather which made you and your siblings happy, but had put more strain on your dad as he was having to find things to do to keep your younger siblings busy and out of his way.   You were deeply engrossed in a game when your dad came in your room with an armful of clean folded clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNate, you need to put your clothes away this time, just don\u2019t put them on the dresser,\u201d Mike said his voice now different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay mom,\u201d you answered to the voice which was clearly your mother\u2019s.   Realizing what you had just said and heard you turned around.  Your dad was already turned and walking down the hall.   Pausing your game you quickly threw your clothes in a couple of drawers completely undoing the neat folding job and took off to find your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard drawers opening and closing in your little brother\u2019s room and hurried there.<br>\r\nLooking in the room you saw your dad closing a drawer and he turned around startled to see you there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNate!

It had been awhile since this morning and more changes had occurred.   You saw the clothes he was wearing were no longer quite as snug and the front of his pants no longer had a noticeable bulge although there was bulging elsewhere, most notably in his chest.   The most evident change though had been his voice.   He now sounded just like Lynda. </span></div></div>",

Your father was behaving like your mother, dressed as her, wearing her makeup and jewelry and even sounding like her, but this was still not quite what you had planned to happen.   Although your parents had apparently swapped roles, your dad at least, did not seem to be aware of the change. He was acting just like your mom.  How would they learn from this if they did not know?   You pulled out your tin and popped another mint in your mouth.   Thinking about it for a moment, you made an addition to the original wish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish that my parents had knowledge that they had switched roles, but they can\u2019t stop behaving in their new roles and the more they try to act as themselves normally, the stronger their new behaviors and actions become and for an added bonus their bodies will start to match you say out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finish your wish, your dad passes by your open door.  As the wish takes place, he pauses and drops the empty laundry basket he was carrying, as an awareness of what is happening comes over him.   Watching from your room you see him panic, his hands quickly touching various areas of his body and clothes assessing that he was dressed in the wrong clothes, his shock at realizing what he was wearing caused a gasp to escape his lips and he rushed into the master bedroom.   You quickly slipped out and snuck to the door, peeking around the corner to continue observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad rushed to the mirror on the dresser and looked at his reflection.  You watched as his fingers traced his face and could see he was shocked to see he was wearing makeup and earrings.   He then recognized that his hands looked different, he had polish on his nails and his wife\u2019s wedding ring on it left hand. \u201cOh my goodness,\u201d you heard he exclaim as continued to touch himself in shock.  He suddenly realized his voice was wrong.  \u201cWhat is happening?  Why am I wearing my makeup and jewelry? No, this isn\u2019t mine.  I\u2019m not supposed to be wearing this.  I\u2019m Mike, no, Lynda,\u201d he said confused, his mind believing he was dressed correctly but yet knowing he wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad started unbuttoning the blouse he had on and stopped halfway down when he saw that he had on a bra that seemed to be pushing away from his body.  He put his hands to the cups as to verify what he was seeing and felt a swelling of flesh.  <br>\r\n\u201cHow is this possible, this shouldn\u2019t fit Mike, I mean me?\u201d he said to himself, his mind still trying to figure out what was happening.    Your dad grabbed the edges of the cups and pulled them out and stared down at the small breasts inside.   He quickly buttoned his top back and grabbed a phone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed and you heard him begin a conversation.</span></div></div>",

Bye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deduced by the conversation that your dad had called your mom.   By the tone of the conversation it had become obvious that your mom was experiencing the same changes.  You wish you could have heard what you mom had said to him as you watched him slowly put the phone down.   He grabbed a tissue and dabbed at his eyes then started to turn toward you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly returned to your room and watched as your dad walked out and picked up the basket he had dropped.

I\u2019m going to have to go to the store in a little while.  Would you rather stay home and watch your brother and sister or come along?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, let me think about it,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding he turned and went down the hall.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that last wish has changed things around you thought to yourself.

He had tried to revolt against his feelings of having to do the housework, wanting to do something more in line with who he knew himself to be, but it wasn\u2019t happening.  He soon found himself in the kitchen fixing lunch for his kids.   His behavior continued to be motherly.   As you and your family sat eating lunch, your dad found himself doting over each of you as your mother would have.  After everyone had eaten, he cleaned up Nicole and the area where she had been sitting, who as usual had made a complete mess.  Just as you had wished the more he tried to fight what was happening the more he found himself conforming to his new role.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter straightening up the kitchen, your dad came back to your room.  He looked in and asked, \u201cNate, I\u2019m getting ready to go to the store.   Where you going to stay home with the others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this as an opportunity to see how he would act in public you chose to go along. He had changed his pants for something more appropriate for being out in the cold. You also notice that your dad had changed in appearance from just a couple of hours ago.  He was now shorter and had developed more feminine curves.  \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, I would like to come along and if it helps I\u2019ll help keep an eye on the little ones,\u201d you tell him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad gave a genuine smile, the first time you had seen him do that today.  \u201cThat\u2019s great, I could really use it.  It\u2019s such a challenge taking Trevor and Nicole to the store,\u201d he said.   You found it strange to hear him say that as he never went to the store with them, but it was a regular occurrence for your mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and headed to the living room to get the others dressed to go out.  You grabbed your coat and went to join them.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoining your family, your sister Erin was already in her coat as was Trevor.  Your dad was struggling to get Nicole in hers.   Finally getting her coat on, your dad put Lynda\u2019s coat on and slung her purse over his shoulder.  \u201cOkay lets go,\u201d he said to all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another short battle getting the young ones in their car seats, your dad pulled out and started to the store.   He was very nervous about driving on the snowy roads and got in no hurry, especially with the kids in the car, unlike how he would normally drive.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later for a normal fifteen minute drive you arrived at the grocery store.  Getting everyone together your dad led everyone into the store.   You watched as he grabbed a cart, draped his coat over the edge and put his purse in the basket.  You lagged behind watching the rest of the family interact.   Your brother and sisters seemed to pay no attention to the fact that their father was looking and acting like their mother.  They all responded and reacted as if he was Lynda.   Your father was going through the store in the same methodical way that your mother would.   You watched as he walked around, still astounded at how he moved and behaved.  You could see that occasionally he would try to act like his old self but it just wouldn\u2019t happen.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes to him physically amazed you also.   His hips had become wider and his butt more rounded.  The growth of breasts had continued and his chest had almost reached the same size as Lynda\u2019s had been.  His hair had also grown in length and he was constantly brushing it back out of his face as it had not been long enough to style earlier.   Finally frustration got the best of him and he dug in Lynda\u2019s purse and found a hair clip and expertly pulled it back locking it in place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your word and helped keep the younger siblings under control as your dad shopped.  An occasional argument over something trivial happens between the young ones as normally happens, stressing your dad more.   A full shopping cart and an hour and a half later, your dad had finished.  Everything was rang up and your dad pulled out Lynda\u2019s wallet and started writing a check.  You both recognized the fluid handwriting as Lynda\u2019s, but no one said anything.  You saw your dad paused as he reached the signature.   You guessed that he was wanting to sign it as himself but as he continued your mother\u2019s name appeared on the line.   You noticed a slight shaking of his head as he surrendered to the will of the wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the car, your dad asked you to put the groceries in the back while he put the kids in.   You smirk to yourself as just before he started to pull out your dad checked his makeup in the mirror and reapplied lipstick.  The furrowing of his brow indicated that he was not happy about having to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a slow return trip to the house, you and Erin help bring in the groceries then help Trevor and Nicole take off their coats, while your dad starts putting things away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your dad starts preparing dinner as you and the rest of the family go about your day. </span></div></div>",

You are in your room when you hear the familiar sound of your dad\u2019s truck pull up to the house.   Interested in what will happen you make your way to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive before your mom comes in.   Your dad is working on a few final touches on his meal.  His appearance has changed some more.  You see he is now about the same height and size as your mom.  His breasts, fully developed, and hair now look like Lynda.  Since arriving home he has apparently taken time to style his hair just as his wife.  He also had changed back into the capri pants from earlier.   His own facial features make for an odd appearance in contrast to the changed body.   You wonder what your mom is going to look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question is answered as the garage door opens and Lynda enters.   Much like your father her appearance is quite surprising.  She is now much larger in height and size.  Mike\u2019s clothes she had on from this morning no longer hang loosely on her body as her body had grown to fill them out.   You have to keep your surprise in check as you continue to study the changes.   Your mom\u2019s face is still present but the characteristics and not hers.  Dark beard stubble is noticeable on her once smooth cheeks, her hair now short and thinner.   \u2028\u2028Your dad looks genuinely happy to see your mom as does she.   \u201cI\u2019m so glad your home,\u201d he says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, so am I,\u201d she answered with your father\u2019s voice.   \u201cI\u2019m going to go change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom leaves heading to the bathroom and after taking a moment to check that dinner will be okay, so does your dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving them a moment to reach the bedroom you slip down the hall to try and eavesdrop.  </span></div></div>",

Time for a wish you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping a mint in your mouth, you make another wish.  \u201cI wish that mom and dad would discuss their changes openly at the dinner table.  They will be able to discuss it as  their normal selves, but no one else will understand what they are talking about except for them and I,\u201d you say out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation stops and you hear steps coming toward the door.  Quickly, you duck into your room and seconds later the door opens and your dad comes out and returns to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the kitchen also and take a seat at the table.  Your dad calls for the rest of the family to come eat and your siblings take their places.  A few moments later your mom came in the room, smoking a cigarette and sat in the seat your dad usually did.  Your dad, following the normal routine of Lynda, places the meal on the table and everyone starts eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the family starts to eat, your parents begin talking about the day.  Per your wish, your siblings pay no attention to what is being discussed and having their own conversations.  You follow their lead pretending not to understand what is being said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney,\u201d your dad starts looking around nervously at everyone, \u201cI have to say this has been a long day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah and strange,\u201d Lynda answers watching for any reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what or how any of this happened.  I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d he says still nervous talking about their current situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda nods, \u201cYeah, it was as if I was in a daze for part of the morning then I suddenly realized I was at your work.  The worst part was the more I tried to sort it out and think normally the more I found myself behaving like you.  I wasn\u2019t thrilled about smoking but I couldn\u2019t stop and irritatingly I found myself enjoying it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was puzzled by the lack of any acknowledgement from anyone else at the table but continued.  \u201c Yes, I saw that you didn\u2019t seem to be having any problems with that. Right now, I actually find myself not missing it all.  Its like I never cared for it.  I was rather shocked to say the least when I realized what I was wearing and doing and just like you it seemed the more I tried to fight it the stronger I wanted to act like you.   I mean look at me, I fixed dinner, took care of the kids, did the shopping.  I never have nor do I even know how to do some of this.  Topping it all off my body isn\u2019t even mine anymore,\u201d he said then quietly adding, \u201cI grown breasts and I\u2019m even fully female, you know, down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda and Mike both scanned the table and saw no one even seemed to be paying attention.  You were having a hard time trying to keep a blank expression on your face listening to their discussion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda continued, \u201cYes, I have noticed that.  Your body looks just like mine and I have the same problem.  It is definitely a strange feeling having IT and it seems to have a mind of it\u2019s own.  Even now, although personally I don\u2019t want to feel this, I can\u2019t help but think of you as me and it turns me on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, cause I feel to weirded out to think of anything else, but on another note, I do believe I understand how you feel about the housework,\u201d your dad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now maybe you\u2019ll help out a little?  Honestly I never doubted that you put in a hard day and now I know first hand that you do.  I am worn out, but I will help clean up after dinner,\u201d your mom answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise I will work to help out around the house,\u201d your dad said with a loving smile as he reached over and patted your mom on the leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour were pleased to hear that your little experiment seemed to work and decided that you would wish them back by tomorrow morning.  If it didn\u2019t you could always change them back.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this the conversation turned to more of a normal \u2018how was your day\u2019 topic and your really did become uninterested.   Dinner finished and true to her word, your mom helped your dad clean up.   Everyone eventually moved into the living room and went about a normal evening.  You all stayed up a little later than normal due to it being the weekend. <br>\r\nEventually the younger kids began falling asleep and your parents directed everyone to bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went to your room you debated your next wish.  </span></div></div>",

Your mom and dad seemed especially happy having their old bodies back, but you pick up that they may have taken a little time last night to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, your dad started helping out your mom that morning by watching your younger brother and sister.  It wasn\u2019t long before they began arguing and fighting, stressing your dad.  After separating them and getting them to behave he went in the kitchen.   \u201cHoly crap, those two do that every day?\u201d he asked your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, every day it\u2019s something new with them, fighting over toys, t.v., and what have you and its always the same results.  They begin bickering and it turns into a fight,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t ever remember being that bad growing up.  I will be glad when they get older and grow out of it,\u201d your dad answered, lighting a cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving overheard their conversation a new wish came to your mind.  It was kind of mean, but it would be funny, at least to you.   Popping a mint in your mouth you say, \u201cI wish that Lynda and Mike and Trevor and Nicole would begin to behave like their counterpart.  Like yesterday they will know that they are acting wrong but be unable to stop.  They will change places and roles within the next two hours.\u201d   That should make it interesting you think.  My little brother and sister in charge and my parents as the kids.    You sit back and start waiting for the wish to take effect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t but a few minutes before you started seeing changes.  You were in the living room watching t.v. with Trevor and Nicole when you noticed it happening.  Nicole and Trevor had moved up to the couch and were sitting side by side.  They were no longer fighting and seemed to focused on the t.v. show.   You saw it in your little sister first.  What you saw wasn\u2019t what you had expected though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was wearing one of her play dresses.  You began to notice her exposed legs looked different.  Looking closer, you realized it was hair, darkening and growing longer.<br>\r\nI stifled a laugh as you realized just how you worded your wish.   Lynda and Mike with Trevor and Nicole.  Due to the order you had put the names, apparently your little sister was changing places with your dad.   Oh this was going to be most interesting. </span></div></div>",

The thought about changing it, but in the end, chose to leave it be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more moments passed and Trevor hopped off the couch, \u201cWell, nothings getting done just sitting here,\u201d he said as he headed off to another part of the house with a confused look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he left your mom and dad both came into the room.  Your parents, instead of sitting down in a chair or on the couch, sat down in the floor and began watching the t.v..  Within fifteen minutes your parents had started to play with the toys that surrounded them, both with looks of confusion on their faces.   It was obvious that they knew what they were doing, but like yesterday they couldn\u2019t stop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had continued to sit on the couch as her body and behaviors continued to change.  You could see that there were physical changes occurring.  Her little face was starting to show signs of stubble and dark hair was appearing on her chest and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked over at you.  \u201cKeep an eye on them,\u201d she said motioning to your parents, a strange look on her face knowing that something wasn\u2019t right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as asked.  Your parents were obviously trying to fight what was happening, but couldn\u2019t stop.   Your mom was playing with Trevor\u2019s toys, but reached over and took something from your dad.  He responded with a whine and slapped at your mom, demanding his dolly back.    You chuckled inside at the sight.   As you watched them it was becoming apparent that they were becoming smaller.  The clothes on both were starting to hang loosely from their frames and both were starting to lose physical characteristics defining them as a adult man and woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad had already lost most of his body hair and his skin was now smooth and younger looking.  The same thing was occurring with your mom.  Her long hair was looking shorter and her breasts were starting to appear smaller.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both continued to pick on each other, causing the receiving party to whine and complain loudly.   Nicole returned to the room about that time.   You did a double take as she walked by.   While she was gone she had apparently been to your parents room as she was now wearing articles of clothing that belonged to your dad.  She had gain close to a foot and half in height, but they were still way to big.  It was rather comical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had came in just as your mom had hit your dad.  A scowl came across her face and she grabbed your mom\u2018s arm and pulled her up, following with a smack across her butt.    Your mom had obviously lost some height as she was now about the same size as Nicole.   \u201cTrevor I have had enough of your picking on your sister.  Now go to your room.  And put on some normal clothes, dress up time is over.\u201d she said appearing surprised to herself saying it.   Your dad smiled in a short lived victory.  \u201cAnd you get to your room too,\u201d Nicole scolded her father.   Your dad got up and looking dejected trudged away.  As he left you could tell that he was also smaller. <br>\r\nYou watched as Nicole sat down in your dad\u2019s chair and lit up a cigarette.   You were taken aback seeing your five year sister smoking, but she was just acting like your dad.<br>\r\nShe grabbed the remote and scan through the channels finally finding a channel that was more suited to her changing personality.</span></div></div>",

Instead, you hear muffled moaning coming from your parents' room. Skulking up, you see the door cracked, and almost jump out of your skin when you see your parents hot and heavy in a fury of lovemaking. Then you notice something off. The one that you assume to be your dad yells out, \"Mike, if I had known it was like this for you I'd let you have more quickies!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynda... Lynda...\" the figure that looked like your mom was calling out. Finally, they climaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?! You guys have every right to as horny as you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" you wonder, popping a mint real quick and wishing to know why his previous wish didn't take. His mind got bombarded with their marathon make-up sex, starting with the line from Mike, \"Who knows?! We may never get another chance to try this out from the other point of view!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a piece of paper comes out of mouth as though it were a dot matrix printer, as well as the mint you used to make the wish to change them back. The document said, \"As a result of their coitus, a new life was conceived, and our magical powers are forbidden from taking a life, therefore your wish was nullified. Until the child is carried to term, the one you know as 'Mike' cannot return to his previous male form, or any form that would compromise her female reproductive organs (Lynda though can return to her female form). Also, before you ask, swapping their consciousnesses is right now as well, as that would involve detaching souls, and everyone in magic agreed that unless you're looking to create mindless zombies (or bimbos), mind &amp; soul detaching and swapping is also to be considered expressly forbidden. However, all is not bad news... You may swap their roles in reality, allowing Mike to resume his, now her, work until such time she would have to use maternity leave, and Lynda be able to be a stay-at-home dad. Also, the candy you used to make it has been refunded to you. Enjoy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wunderbar.\" you mutter as you walk on, wondering if you wish to un-see what you saw without weird temporal consequences...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, you quickly take the refunded candy and use it to do as the candy suggests, wishing, \"For reality to change, everyone believing Mike is a woman and Lynda a man, but only Lynda, Mike, and myself would be aware of the changes.\" You put some bread in the toaster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Mike came down, dressed in a red double-breasted suit blazer, white blouse underneath, red necktie, red miniskirt, and 2\" red heels, carrying a brown leather purse. Lynda followed her, carrying a briefcase. \"I don't think I have time for breakfast!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda runs over and swipes the fresh toast you made for you, saying, \"At least take this... Bye honey!!\" They kiss, and Mike (in Lynda's body) is off to the races. Meanwhile, Lynda (in Mike's body) got to work making breakfast for you and your siblings, as well as your lunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grumble, eating your eggs (without toast!!), the sound of the bus fills the air. \"Bus!!\" Lynda begins to shoo Erin and you out the door, as <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">s</span>he normally did, but this was a bit rougher and faster, given he had the upper body strength of your dad's body backing him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wish I had my toast...\" you say, stepping on the bus, unaware bits of the mint you had used at the table still in your cheeks. Suddenly, the toast that was sitting on Mike's purse vanished as she drove down the freeway. Sitting down, the toast appeared dangling in your lips like a stereotypical moe anime cliche. \"Um... Yay toast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Neither one of them thought it was odd, as they began to redress in the clothes that each had just been wearing.  Within moments Lynda was wearing Mike\u2019s work clothes as she hurriedly put on his watch and wedding ring that Mike had laid on the dresser, while Mike forced Lynda\u2019s earrings mounts into and through his earlobes, oblivious the pain, as his ears had never been pierced, then started expertly applying Lynda\u2019s makeup.   He was still sniffling from the emotional feeling that he had gained from Lynda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda now fully dressed as her husband, looked at him doing his makeup in the bathroom and felt Mike\u2019s shame for having the argument earlier.   \u201cHoney, I\u2019m sorry about earlier.  I promise I will make it up, but now I\u2019m really running late.  I got to go, see you tonight\u201d, as she rushed from the room.  When she passed you in her hurry to get to work, you had been shocked to see what had happened due to your wish, wondering how that would effect her as you went to see what was happening with your dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda drove as quickly as she dared in a rush to make up time from running late to Mike\u2019s, now her, job.   She became frustrated every time somebody got in front of her and slowed her down.  As she sat at a stoplight waiting for the green light, she absentmindedly reached in her shirt pocket and pulled a cigarette and lighter out.  She had never smoked before, and didn\u2019t necessarily care for Mike smoking, but by your wish that your parents could trade places, your mom had now became the smoker that her husband had been.  Without a problem or second thought she placed the cigarette between her lips and put the flame of her lighter to the tip, taking a deep pull, as Mike\u2019s acquired behavior and habit started to take over.  She coughed and felt her eyes water as the smoke filled her virgin lungs.  Instead of thinking it odd, she assumed she had swallowed wrong or something and continued to take another drag, quickly becoming accustom to the taste and behavior, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke into the cabin of the truck, something else she never care for Mike doing, but since she currently believed she was Mike, she didn\u2019t think anything about it.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda arrived at work and started doing Mike\u2019s job.  As she worked things started to change with her body.  Like her husband at home, his clothes she had put on had not fit this morning, having been very loose and baggy on her body, just as his had been snug and tight on his frame.  But now as the morning had progressed, Mike\u2019s clothes were beginning to fit better as her body had began to grow and change.  In the short time since she had arrived at work, Lynda had grown several inches in height and gained fifteen to twenty pounds in weight and muscle.   Lynda hadn\u2019t noticed any of this as she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t really Mike.  In addition to her body growth, Lynda had and was also gaining other masculine features and traits of Mike.  She had of course gained his smoking habit, but she was now starting to grow hair on her body that she shouldn\u2019t have, while the hair on her head began to disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As in neared 11 o\u2019clock, Lynda had changed noticeably, she now had a visible five o\u2019clock shadow of a beard and mustache, chest hair covered her diminishing breasts and spread down to her abdomen and onto her back, her legs were also covered with a thick layer of hair.  Her long locks that had been on her head only a short time ago, was now almost half the length it had been as it continued to disappear.   As Lynda made phone calls and did his work, her voice had changed to become deeper and now made her sound like Mike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda had just went to the bathroom and was finishing up taking a piss with her new penis.  It was about this time that your added wish took place.  Lynda was giving her dick a shake as the realization wish took effect.  She almost screamed as she saw a dick in her hand and she realized she could feel it.  She swallowed hard as she looked around and recognized she was not at home, but in a men\u2019s bathroom, and she was holding a dick, and it was attached to her body.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed it back in her pants as she had seen her husband do many times over the years and hurried to the sink and mirror.   The reflection she saw left her dumbfounded and confused.  There in the mirror was her face, but everything else was wrong.  She had stubble on her cheeks and face. The clothes she was wearing, she recognized as the ones Mike had put on this morning, fitting her larger body.  A body that was decidedly male in appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly washed her hands so she could check further.  Done with that, she felt her face, confirming that she had the start of a beard.  She could see hair in the open collar of the shirt she had on, and when she unbuttoned it some, she saw it was completely covering her body and her breasts were almost gone.  Having to verify one last thing, she undid her pants and pulled them down part way.  She saw she was wearing men\u2019s underwear and a noticeable bulge filled the front of them, a sight that should not be possible.  Hesitant to look, she pulled the waist band out and saw a penis and balls protruding from her no longer female body.  She put her clothes back in place and washed her hands again before stepping out of the bathroom to realize she was at Mike\u2019s work.  She nervously made her way back to his office, unconsciously pulling a fresh cigarette out and lighting it, taking a deep drag, before realizing what she had done.  She wanted to put it out, but found she couldn\u2019t, instead finding herself taking an another drag, and enjoying the rush of nicotine and the calming effects of smoking.  Lynda found herself acting like her husband, no matter how hard she tried not to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cellphone on her pocket rang she jumped in surprise.   Taking it out she saw it was her cellphone calling.   With trepidation she answered it.  \u201cHello,\u201d hearing her new voice for the first time and realizing that she not only was looking like he husband, but now sounded like him.  A familiar voice replied on the other end, a voice she recognized as her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s me,\u201d Mike said.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike?!   What the hell is happening, my body is changed,  I look like a man, I look and feel like I\u2019m you.  I\u2019m even smoking my damn cigarettes,\u201d Lynda said in a hushed tone.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I know the same thing is happening to me,\u201d Mike answered, not catching that his wife was now smoking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhere are the kids, are they okay?  Do they seem to realize something is wrong?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike answered, \u201cYes, they are in a different room and I\u2019m alone....and.....I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just noticed a few minutes ago that I\u2019m wearing the clothes you had put on this morning and they are even starting to fit me.   What about you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike glanced at himself, \u201cI\u2019m DRESSED in your, mine, I don\u2019t know anymore, I can\u2019t seem to make any sense of it, but a red blouse, white capri pants, red shoes and a bra and panties. I\u2019m even wearing makeup and jewelry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I, you, had put on this morning and your wearing your makeup and  jewelry, but that\u2019s not right, that should be what you would wear.  Uggghhhh, I can\u2019t seem to think straight,\u201d Lynda groaned, taking another drag from her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s what you or I put on this morning....I agree I can\u2019t seem to stop thinking of myself as Lynda,\u201d Mike said nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing though, I now have a penis, my breasts are almost nonexistent and I have chest and facial hair, even the hair on my head is disappearing,\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes me too, I have small breasts and I think its getting worse!\u201d Mike said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, since we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening yet, you have to try and remain calm.\u201d Lynda instructed, suddenly feeling the need to take charge, as she stroked her chin whiskers, a habit of Mike\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but,\u201d Mike started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, you HAVE to stay calm. We don\u2019t know if the kids have any idea what\u2019s happening here, but just try to do and keep things as normal as possible.\u201d Lynda said, snubbing out her cigarette then quickly grabbing another and lighting it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019m am and I am still doing some cleaning,\u201d Mike answered softly, feeling the confident tone his wife\u2019s, now husband\u2019s voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust remember to act as normal as possible, keep doing what you, I, would normally do. Ahhh, you know what I mean. I love you, Lynda and I will see you after work,\u201d Lynda said, not realizing she had called Mike by her own name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon. Bye.\u201d Mike replied, feeling reassured by his \u201chusband\u2019s\u201d actions, not realizing that she had had called him Lynda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda disconnected the phone call and took a deep pull from her cigarette.  Exhaling a thick cloud of smoke from her nostrils down across her chest.   \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m smoking and doing it without hesitation, but I now know why Mike, I, enjoy it.\u2019 She said out loud to herself, before she took her own advice and went back to work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike\u2019s knowledge of what needed to be done continually filling her mind. She picked up the desk phone and started dialing a phone number she didn\u2019t know a moment ago.   She absently put her free hand in her pants pocket, and started fondling at her dick and balls, as she waited for the other party to answer.</span></div></div>",

You male clothes look ridiculous in my body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing mom is right, you head into her bedroom.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The candies could be the biggest birthday practical joke ever... or, they could be some really powerful magic. Thousands of possibilities for their use whirl through your mind as you think of all the things you can wish for. You could wish to be rich, or to be famous... you could wish to have any girl you wanted become your girl friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you think about it however, the more you start to worry about consequences. If you wished to be rich... would people wonder where the money came from? Would you wind up in jail because people thought you stole it? Or, if you wished for someone to like you... would they really like you, or would it be like they were always pretending because the magic made them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need someone I can talk to about this,</i> you thought at last. Briefly you considered talking to your parents, but dismissed that right off the bat. All they would do is tell you what you should be doing with them, instead of helping you figure it out. Or worse, your dad would probably take them from you because 'you weren't responsible enough to use them wisely', and then use them himself. No, what you needed was an adult you could trust to just give you some good advice. And there was only one person you could think of who fit that description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping on your bike, you set off across town for the hour long ride it would take to get to Aunt Bethany's. Fortunately, most of the way there was down hill, and you were hoping that you could convince her to drive you home with your bike in the back of her SUV. She'd done it before when you and Erin had pedaled over and stayed too late to ride home after dark, and it would be way better than pedaling up hill all the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at Aunt Beth's down town apartment, you racked your bike and rode the elevator to her 14th story apartment, nervously fidgeting with the candies the whole way up. Knocking on the door, you smiled at last when aunt Beth opened the door, her brown hair up in a pony tail and holding a towel that she was using to mop a faint sheen of perspiration from her brow. She looked really good in her short black athletic shorts and pink sports bra, and you figured you'd probably gotten here in the middle of one of her treadmill sessions. She might be 33, but she looked younger and whenever she came over your friends  were always drooling over her. Not that you noticed too much... after all, she was Aunt Beth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate,\" she said, waving you to come in. \"I wasn't expecting to see you until your party on Friday. Happy birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Aunt Beth,\" you said, taking a seat on one of the living room sofas and looking out the window at the awesome view. \"Where are Max and Sam?\" you asked, referring to her two kids. Samantha was only six, and she was an annoying tag along most of the time, but Max was almost twelve and he liked a lot of the same video games you liked to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're at their father's house this week. They'll be coming back here for the weekend. But this year, Max is old enough to go to the Science and Engineering magnet school and it's closer to their dad's place, so we're going to try them with him for a school year and see how it goes,\" she said with just a touch of bitterness. She'd been divorced for nearly three years now and she still hadn't forgiven her ex-husband Dan for running off with his busty blonde secretary. She'd always known he was a boob guy, but she'd stubbornly refused to get the implants he wanted her to have, saying her C-cups were big enough. Well, obviously they weren't big enough for him, and he'd found what he wanted in a 22 year old para-legal who'd been more than willing to do whatever her boss asked her to... right up to helping him fill out the divorce paperwork and moving into the home in the suburbs that Dan used to share with Bethany after Beth moved out. \"Sorry,\" she said, bringing herself back to the moment. \"My mind wandered off there for a bit. So what brings you all the way down here in this heat? It's a long way to ride just to come say hi, and I figured you'd be out with your friends celebrating your birthday tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's something I got for my birthday that brings me down here. I got these candies, and I think they're magic. They grant wishes. I tried one, I wished that I had thirty dollars, and then I found thirty bucks in my pocket. I swear the money wasn't there before I made my wish. Now, I counted and I have 29 of them left... but if I'm reading it right, these things are kind of like jaw breakers... until the candy is all gone you can keep wishing so you can make more than one wish per candy. I just... I don't know what I should do with them, and I don't want to get myself in trouble, so I thought I would come talk to you about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if those candies are real that's certainly some powerful magic. But why talk to me? Why not go to your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think mom would believe me, and I think dad would just take them from me. Or they'd tell me what I should do with them and it wouldn't be something I would like. But I really trust you and I figured if I could talk to anyone it would be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate,\" she said, truly touched by his statement. \"I'm really touched that you feel that way, here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>29 Candies remaining, what does Aunt Bethany say?</u></span></div></div>",

I guess I'm just going to have to \"reunite\" with my old self\" she states half jokingly and half excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Just what kind of woman do you think I am?\" Nate jokes back, \"I'm not letting you touch me like this! This is my body!\" <br>\r\n\"Actually, it's really MY body and this one is YOURS! Plus, I've touched that body much more than you have\" She winks.<br>\r\nDeciding that it is too wrong to stick it in, considering that you guys are family and a retarded baby is not good, she just fondles her old boobs and has her old body give her a rather stimulating hand job before she finally \"releases the pressure\".<br>\r\n\"Now that that is over with,\" she laughs, \"What to do about the candies?\"<br>\r\nNate replies making Bethany's voice sound mischievous, \"We have fun!\" </span></div></div>",

On the way there you discuss what you are going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you said, \"I have an idea, let's switch the bodies of my family just like you and I are switched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Betheny said, \"everyone does that.  I have seen it hundreds of times in movies and stories.  It's done all the time.  Hell, even we did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, you thought of something else.  \"How about the whole family is wearing diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, do you want to change everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could let them change themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has also been done.  People become babies, they even have a name for that.  Age regression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing fun about pooping your pampers.  If you think so, I can get you a babysitting job.  Then you'll know how much fun changing someone's diaper is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom and dad are adults.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, then I'll get you a job at a nursing home, adults poop themselves there all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMMM, let's see then.   maybe mom can dress like mom but act like dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the same thing as before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she won't know anything is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later, I think we should start with something small and then build up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I have something totally silly and I'll bet it has never been done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.  I wish...\" you said and then put your hand over your mouth so Bethany could hear the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you arrived at your house and ring the bell.  You could have used the key but you wanted Bethany to get the full effect.  You hear from inside your mom calling, \"Trevor, can you get the doorl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour seven-year-old brother Trevor opens the door.  You made sure that Bethany was in front of you so she could have the first look.  Standing in the doorway was indeed Trevor but he was wearing a fancy ball gown in a blue color.  It was a full-length halter top dress that came down to the floor.  The skirt was extremely full and definitely contained many petticoats to keep it poofed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor turned and shouted, \"Mom, Nate and Aunt Beth are here.\"  Then the boy turned you Bethany saw that the dress left his shoulder and bock exposed and was laced-up in the back corset style.  You and Bethany entered your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the boy could scamper away Bethany said, \"My that is a very pretty dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" was the boys reply, but he didn't know why Bethany was making such a fuss.  To him he was wearing what he normally wore, nothing special, like the jeans and T-shirt he was wearing before you made the wish.   As the boy scampered off, for the first time, Bethany relized that not only was the boy wearing a fancy ball dress, but he was also wearing matching high heels.  Bethany wondered if the boy was also wearing pretty panties or his usual tighty-whiteys.  But there was no way of telling..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the house, Bethany realized that everyone was wearing fancy ball gowns.  Each was in a different style and color depending upon the personality of the wearer.  Lynda (your mother) who had been doing the dishes in the kitchen was wearing a red strapless ball gown.  She was the only one wearing a strapless gown since she had boobs to keep it up.  Mike (your father) was watching sports in the living room.  He was wearing a navy ball gown with spaghetti straps.  He had to sit on the edge of the couch instead of reclining to keep his dress down as it would fly up with all it's petticoats if he sat back.  Upstairs in her room, 5 year old Nicole was laying on the floor wearing a pretty pink ball gown.  She didn't care that her panties were showing nor that she was dressed more elegantly than the Disney Snow White doll that she was playing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one in the family thought they were dressed oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Lynda knew what Nicole had to wear as well as where all her clothes were so she was very quick in getting everything on.

Then she went to join Nicole in Lynda's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was still trying on outfits when Lynda entered the room.  The discarded clothes were thrown carelessly on the floor.  Lynda helped Nicole select an outfit.  It was a short sleeved button down blouse with a matching skirt with the zipper in the back.  It was dressier than the clothes she was wearing today but it was still casual.  \"You look darling,\" Lynda said.  \"But do you know what you are missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you are going to dress like Mommy, then you have to wear some of Mommy's jewelry and makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makeup???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I think I should help you put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wanted to try herself, but she let Lynda lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lynda was putting makeup on Nicole.  She told her to pucker her lips and close her eyes at the appropriate times.  When they were finished, Lynda led Nicole down to the living room.

Nicole ran towards the door.  \":Aren't you forgetting something, 'Mommy'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you will need your purse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah...Momm...Nickie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now when we go out, you have to act like mommy, can you do that honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have to call me Nickie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't forget?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you two should come with us, in case there is a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't miss it,\" Bethany said.</span></div></div>",

It was a relief for everyone to finally get away from the toils of work and school. Nate certainly appreciated it. The jar of candies were in his room right now, but he had yet to even touch them. Who knows why, but perhaps he felt like staying away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, news came at dinner time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone, I have an announcement,\" Mike got everyone's attention. \"We've decided to spend the week out of town on vacation, and head to that resort we told you all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Yay!\" cried Trevor and Nicole, both clapping. Nate and Erin seemed happy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's awesome Dad!\" said Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice.\" said Nate, the most unenthusiastic one so far but it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tomorrow we're going to pack up. We've got a plane to catch and it leaves tomorrow.\" said Lynda. \"We wanted to keep the surprise so that's why we told you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so pack up what you can tonight. We leave early tomorrow.\" said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" said most of the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate continued as normal that night, packing up a few things. However, his thoughts turned to the jar, and he felt like keeping them around. Well, he wasn't sure what to make of it, but the jar fit easily enough in his bag. Satisfied enough, he went to bed that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's the worst that can happen.\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****The Next Day*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day, everyone was bright and early, so they were soon off to the airport. Nate quite liked flying, though he was always nervous on the way up and down. Some things you never get used to. Still, getting in was all well and good, and soon enough, the plane was in the air, heading towards their destination. The rest of the day seemed to whirl by on this Saturday, just a rush from their home to the hotel. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>       \"Wow! Finally here, after that HUGE trip, we're finally here!\" Erin laughed, admiring the view of the ocean vast and blue from the rather large window near one of the beds, all before she threw herself onto the large, fluff ball of a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yeah! This is gonna be loads of fun!\" Trevor cried, plopping himself onto the couch facing the bed on which his older sister, Erin, lay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Nicole said nothing, but, simply let out a giggle before following her older sister, slamming onto the bed gigantic, snuggling onto one of the pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Meanwhile, in the midst of this immense joy, this relief from lives dreary, there was a bitter aura between a certain patriarch and matriarch, that is, Mike and Lynda. Mike set down all the luggage he carried with Nate, all the while, Lynda shot her husband a stare furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Lynda, before proceeding, made sure Erin, Nicole and Trevor were all not listening. Sure enough, all three were fast asleep, completely knocked out by the trip. Nate, sensing the aura, and growing more and more anxious about it as time moved, was finally told by his mom to leave the room. Nate listened to his mom forthwith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I guess there really is no fury like a woman's scorn...\" Nate thought as sat on the seat closest to the door, this way, he would be able to hear whatever his parents from the hallway, where they had been off to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Nate pushed an ear against the door and listened to the muffled voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Mike...\" Lynda mumbled under her breath, clearly concealing anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Lynda, please...\" Mike started, fear in his voice. \"... The family needed a vacation, you know we did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But at what cost?!\" Lynda scolded her husband as if he were a child. \"How are we supposed to afford this? There is no way that we'll go through this without some financial loss! What were you thinking?!\" Lynda cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     Nate cringed in his seat. Even now, without even seeing this argument occur, he could see his mother furious, hands on her hips, shaking her head in disapproval, both mannerisms she took on as she scolded either Nate himself, or, his siblings. But, to his father? Impossible. He continued to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I was thinking I was making the right decision. I was thinking that we'd pay for it all now, and, we'd worry about the expenses later, it's not about the money, anyway. I was thinking about the kids... I was thinking about... Well... You and I..\" Mike continued, emotion in his voice like he'd never heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Even now, Nate imagined the scene in his head. His dad was leaning in for a hug of some sort of forgiveness... That's when he heard the voice of his mother make itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You get away from me!!\" Lynda took a step back from Mike. \"If you were thinking about us, you should've thought about our financial well being!\" Lynda cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Right about now, Nate imagined the argument ending. Quickly, he pulled his ear from the door and sat by, fiddling with the jar of candies he held. And, just as his mind foretold, in stomped his mother, not even passing onto her son so much as a look. Straight off to the restroom Lynda went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate, shocked, looked to the hallway, where the argument took place. There stood his dad, a blank, defeated look about him. No words, no emotion, only defeat. Suddenly, without warning, the look of defeat became that of fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"She never appreciates what I do for us, for her!\" He looked directly to Nate, Nate cringed slightly, scared stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nate, get whatever you need, you and I could use a vacation from this vacation.\" Mike firmly insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    With a gulp and a deep breath, Nate mustered the courage to ask... \"W-Where are we heading to?\" Nate grabbed the candies and followed his father out the door and into the hall, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike stopped, looked to Nate, and answered simply...</span></div></div>",

Things had been rough all of a sudden. Truth be told, neither extreme was totally right. The family expenses weren't too bad, not to Lynda's extreme anyway. However, there was truth in how things had been rough as of late to the point where the family did have to be a little more judicious with their expenses. Mike thought that the vacation would help the family get away from the doom and gloom of it all, while Lynda was more uptight about it. Nate had seen it before, though not to the extreme he just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Mike said as he began walking down the hallway. Nate looked over his clothing one more time, just to make sure since he didn't want to look out of place. He wore his typical light blue shirt, tan cargo shorts, and socks and shoes. All normal stuff. With that in mind, he began walking to keep up with Mike. Who knew where this would lead, but Nate hoped that the vacation would work out in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he could only wonder how a trip to the mall would help. Mike was never fond of the mall, though maybe it was the right chance to at least clear his head. Nate followed Mike through the hotel until they reached the bottom floor. It was at that time that Mike noticed Nate's jar. He recognized it as something Nate got for his birthday, but not much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Nate...if it's not too much trouble..would you mind sharing one of your candy treats there with me?\" Mike asked his son. Neither one knew what they could really do, so Nate saw no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Dad, I don't mind.\" Nate smiled as he allowed his dad to have one of them, popping it into his mouth immediately. It had a nice sweet taste to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Mike said with a smile as they continued to walk after that. As they did, Mike kept talking to himself. \"Lynda just doesn't understand, and I don't think she ever will....Honestly...I wish I had a wife who did understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one but him heard that, but no one needed too. Everything was set in motion after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Back in the hotel*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the hotel however, Lynda had come out of the restroom briefly to check on something. However, she spotted something near where she rushed by Nate. There was one candy on the ground. Normally, such a thing on the ground wouldn't entice anyone. However, these were no ordinary candies, and Lynda found herself picking it up, eating it before she could think otherwise, her thoughts coming out. Her thoughts ranged from many things, from Mike's vacation idea to Nate's own withdrawn personality. Honestly, Nate didn't have too many friends. If not for Mike borrowing him, he'd probably just be sitting in here doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all people, Nate really needs a mindset change, especially if he can't see what's wrong here. I wish Nate would become a lot more open, then perhaps I might actually be able to converse with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, two wishes were made in a short time, and they both had their sights set on the unsuspecting Nate Wilson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he did was feel a slight chill as he and Mike left the hotel.</span></div></div>",

The sun shone bright, the wind was cool, the atmosphere as vibrant as the sun, the hustle and bustle of the resort ever present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow!\" Mike exclaimed, presenting himself with a demeanor too far from his flaming hot anger. \"What a day, eh, son?\" Mike inquired, continuing the hike to the conveniently close shopping mall, which, as far as Nate could see, was a generally neat looking mall, decorated with all sorts of greenery on the outside, and extending as far as four stories. Though, surprisingly enough, for such a high mall, with such a vacation-esque atmosphere, the mall appeared small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As Nate noted all the people passing by, the couples of men and women young and old strolling along the beach, mothers and fathers with children young, groups of teens and adults hanging around in clusters... As a group of women, all bikini-clad, swayed past Nate, gaining Nate's eyes like a magnet, Nate noticed something. Staring at these women, he didn't necessarily feel... Attraction, as he normally would. All he saw were women in their swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Sure is.\" Nate agreed, handing his father a polite smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Y'know, son, I feel like you're the only one I can talk to sometimes...\" Mike confessed, as the two went through the revolving doors leading into the mall, which was certainly far bigger than the outside may have insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate offered a light blush, feeling his cheeks redden slightly. \"Really?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah... I mean... Your sisters are wonderful and all, and, your younger brother is definitely a blast, but... You're my oldest son. I feel like I can connect with you the most...\" Mike sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      This statement Nate found to be strange, very strange. Was he being compared to Erin? To Nicole? To Trevor? Was he the favorite? Surely this wasn't right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Are you saying you play favorites?\" Nate accusingly uttered, as he did, his height slightly fell to 5'5\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Ugh... No.\" Mike answered firmly. \"I'm just saying... You're like a friend. I can talk to you, is what I'm saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      As strange as it was, for one reason or another, Nate felt awkwardly flattered, his words... Touched him, made him feel special. Seriously, Nate couldn't emphasize, iterate enough how strange this conversation was, how strange it was getting. These words sounded as if they should've been written on some cheesy card from a husband to a wife, or, vice versa. But, despite the peculiarity, he continued...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thanks.\" Nate smiled, genuinely. \"I guess I can talk to you, also.\" Nate smiled as the short hair he called his own grew a shade or two lighter and an inch or two longer, both changes notable only to the deeply focused eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good to hear!\" Mike bellowed. \"Now, what should we do now that we're here? You know I'm not one for the mall, so, why don't you decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate looked around at the plethora of options at his disposal, putting a hand to the chin as he did, not noticing the softer touch, the softer skin that spread about all of him. The mall was crowded, swarmed, even. People here, people there... There was hardly enough room for someone to hear their own thoughts... But, in the end, after but the quickest moment of thought, Nate decided on...</span></div></div>",

You came up with that quickly.\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about midday so it's a good time for lunch....besides that would leave the whole afternoon for shopping.\" That last part came a little bit late for Nate, kind of making him wonder why he said that. That wasn't exactly something he looked forward to, though it didn't sound too bad right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll go with whatever you want.\" Mike smiled, which seemed to make Nate feel a little bit better. It was nice getting to talk to Mike like this, without Erin and the others to interfere. Nice and quiet time....well as much as you can have inside a mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with that settled that they began their walk through the mall. Overall, the scenery was rather nice, making Nate curious as to what else was there to see. The place was well air-conditioned as well, and he could even feel the cooled air on his softer skin. Frankly, he wondered why that was, though maybe it was just the new humidity or something. Probably best to just leave it be for now and just get adjusted. They kept on walking for a bit, looking at a map along the way to see where the court was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" Nate began as they walked. \"Um...why can't you talk to Lyn...I mean Mom about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike seemed to think about that for a bit, sighing as he did. \"It just....I don't know but it seems like there's a disconnect between us now and I don't know what to do about it.  Actually, I don't know if I really want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Nate replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was actually all that happened as they approached the court. There were many little restaurants, but they settled on the local Chick Fill'A. Mike got what he usually got, which made Nate smile a bit at how much he could eat while still being very fit. However, he kind of began to wonder himself. His stomach felt a bit.....what was the word....flatter. A hand went to that spot underneath his light blue shirt, feeling a little bit less than normal. He went with the smaller chicken sandwich, kind of similar to what Lynda got at times actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got a spot rather quickly, thanks to it not being too busy. When Nate sat down, he actually briefly crossed his legs before correcting them. It felt a little odd for a second, but he just let it go for now. Still, in addition to that, he didn't see his height go down to about 5'4, where it seemed to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will say though Nate....you are more pleasant to talk to.\" Mike said as he ate. \"At the very least, I feel like I can tell you more than I tell Lynda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....very nice.\" Nate didn't know, but he felt a tiny bit shy about the attention, though it felt really good. He had to admit, Mike was quite the man. Maybe even more than just a father, but that train of thought felt more confusing to Nate. He actually gently curled his hair a bit as they talked, said hair actually getting a bit longer as he did, growing down to at least past his ears and to his neck. His former shade of brown was really fading too, closer to a much lighter color now. Between that and what seemed to be a thinning waist, Nate wasn't sure what to think of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"Ah!\" Mike let out a sigh of satisfaction as he finished up his meal, throwing a napkin to what would be the trash. He took a sip of the soda before him and leaned back, nearly falling, igniting a delicate laugh from Nate, which, again, went unnoticed by either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mike shook the cup in his hand. Nothing. \"Only ice.\" He sighed. \"Looks like I'm going to be needing a refill... You need a drink, too?\" Mike inquired, getting to his feet. Nate looked into his cup and, like his father, found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes, please.\" He politely accepted his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Another diet coke?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Actually...\" Nate thought for a moment, suddenly feeling a desire for lemonade, a drink that had never really peaked his interest, even in the slightest, until now. \"... Just a lemonade, I guess.\" Nate handed Mike his cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You got it!\" Mike exclaimed, taking their cups and heading off for refills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What a gentleman...\" Nate thought to himself, a small smile spreading across his face. As Mike stood there, at the counter, Nate couldn't help but notice Mike's body, a fit, strong, toned body. Nate giggled at the sight of it, immediately stopping himself, confused at the thoughts of his Father's body, his kindness... He dismissed these thoughts immediately as the man approached the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Here we go! One lemonade!\" Mike held the filled cup out to Nate. Nate blushed before taking the cup from his hands. \"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I guess I should get the trash, too.\" Mike insisted, grabbing the tray an dreading off to dispose of it. As he went off, Nate felt an itch about his right leg... As he lowered himself to tend to this itch, he failed to notice the shrinking muscle tone once his, the absence of hair... No, even as he continued to lower himself, the absence of his socks didn't even manage to capture his attention. He just scratched the itch on his skin smooth, and got to his feet as Mike again neared him, this time, standing there, waiting for Nate to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, we ready?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure!\" Nate smiled, getting to his feet as his hair elongated, brushing his shoulders as it did, ceasing for the moment. Finally, the duo left the restaurant, Nate swayed his hips slightly as they did. And, did his shorts feel softer? Much softer than the usual roughness the shorts had against his legs? His shirt? Was this also getting a bit tighter? All these thoughts he dismissed as Mike spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where do you want to head now, Nate?\" Mike inquired, looking down to Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate sipped his lemonade followed by a look to Mike. \"I don't know.\" Nate answered, his pitch surely the slightest bit higher. \"I feel as if there are so many options here. There are four floors of all this, after all... How about, for now, we just walk and talk, talk and walk, like we've been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Mike heartily laughed. \"Whatever you say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As the two continued, the shorts Nate wore certainly developed a particular lightness and flow about themselves... But, this, too, went dismissed for coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Y'know...\" Mike began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What?\" Nate replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know we've only just gotten here, I know we came here with family... But, I feel like, through all this, all I need is you.\" Mike smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      At first, as he did earlier, Nate was filled with a sort of apprehension, with the way Mike so readily dismissed Erin, Nicole, Trevor, even Lynda, whom Nate now saw as Lynda rather than Mom. But, for some reason, this apprehension flew, and, Nate just came to accept this flattery, embracing this warm, fuzzy sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, aren't you sweet!\" Nate's voice continued to rise as features softened up, as his nose became more button-like, as muscle mass almost died completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate, just as he was about to embrace Mike, was caught off guard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"OHMYGOSH!\" Nate exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What, what is it?\" Mike asked, concerned, given the panicked tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Nate...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sorry, but I really need to use the restroom!\" Nate said immediately. That exclaim was probably louder than it needed to be, but Mike just smiled all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, go and get that done. I'll wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" smiled Nate as he rushed off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Nate really felt like he couldn't hold it in anymore, though he usually was good about waiting to use the restroom. Well, apparently he couldn't know. He didn't even really notice how he just ran in his new skirt. Yeah, that new feeling of flow he had was due to the tan shorts become a nice and free skirt of the same color. Of course, that meant his wallet wasn't there anymore due to the lack of pockets, but he wasn't concerned with that right now. He ran up to where the restrooms where and ended up having a brief moment of wondering where to go exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to go......\" He mumbled before just running into the ladies room. Thankfully, it was empty right now. \"Oh, that's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate walked over to one of the stalls, locking it behind him. He looked down and pulled down his new skirt, not really sparing a thought for why he was wearing one now, though a thought did come that it was a good idea to wear it to such a warm place. As he did, he pulled down his white underwear as he sat down. However, as he did that, the material of the underwear began softening, changing shape slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Nate didn't even look down as he did his business, instead thinking about what had been happening as of late. Mike....he was being such a gentleman. Why hadn't he seen this before? Perhaps it was something he just hadn't paid attention to in the past. Perhaps it was time to start taking that into account. I mean, he even valued Nate above Erin and everyone else. That had to speak for something. He smiled contently at that, even though he started feeling a tiny bit of extra padding in his behind. He didn't really care though and finished up, even using the toilet paper to make sure. Once he was done, he pulled everything, including his new and softer panties up to his smaller waist, along with the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent, Nate walked out and washed his hands. However, he looked up at the mirror for a brief moment. Still, it ended up catching his attention. He didn't see a teenage boy's face, but rather that of a woman, a very beautiful one at that with long blonde hair. The mirror only showed up to his chest, which Nate could make out large breasts beneath a light blue top. He looked down at himself, seeing himself still the same. Though, for some reason, he liked that image in the mirror. That woman was beautiful, and the kind of woman Mike would love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where did that thought.....\" Nate wondered as he was finished and began to walk out of the restroom. As he did, another person passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me ma'am.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry.\" Nate smiled a bit as he got out of the way, not unnerved by what he was just called. Anyway, feeling relieved, Nate began to walk back. However, as he did, he had to use a soft hand to comb his hair out of his face. It had grown longer, down to his waist now in long, blonde strands of hair. Though, it didn't seem to bug him. Mike liked long hair right? Well, his opinion seemed to matter more anyway. His hips still swayed gracefully in the skirt, with them now being a little bigger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike!\" Nate called as he approached Mike, who smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, all done?\" asked Mike as he handed Nate back his lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\" smiled Nate. This feeling of comfort was almost beginning to overwhelm Nate, but it wasn't a bad feeling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"Anyway, I...\" Nate started, as if about to ignite conversation, but, something caught his attention. He fixed his long, mane of hair, adjusted the skirt and beheld a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yes, Nate?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Would it be okay if we... Made a stop here?\" Nate stepped up to the display window of a clothing store primarily aimed at the womanly demographic, he stared in awe at the mannequins before him, admiring the dresses, skirts and blouses each gracefully donned. In his mind, seemingly did he imagine himself wearing each, wondering if Mike would enjoy him in these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Mike let out a hearty laugh. \"Sure, why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Great!\" Nate giggled, adjusting the shirt he wore, not noticing the softer texture about it, also failing to recall that surely the sleeves were shrinking... Was the shirt a bit tighter? No matter the answer, Nate continued. \"After all this time we've been together, I know how much you hate these things... So, i'll be quick!\" Nate laughed, unsure of what he meant by 'all the time we've been together,' but, these words naturally came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"No! Please, take your time!\" Mike insisted, despite his reluctance, following Nate in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Nate wasted no time waiting for Mike and skipped on in, with a lighter step, surely. As he did, the sleeves of his shirt were definitely departed, and, the male collar, too, was gone, beginning to widen and leave the upper chest more viewable. The place felt like a candy store to him, all these clothes, all these departments and rows and columns of clothes, all at his disposal, at his leisure. Mike playfully rolled his eyes and followed Nate, giving his rear end a stare, he, too failing to notice his hips and butt widen and become more defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Ooh!\" Nate cooed in pleasure as he noticed a small, tight, club-type dress, black in color. As he did, his voice continued to elevate, sounding more like a young girl than a teen boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What do you think of this one, Mike?\" Nate playfully asked, waving the dress from its hanger to the man, who smiled offered a whistle and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I like that one. Alot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Nate let out a giggle. \"He's so cute...\" He thought to himself. \"And... It's just my size!\" Nate examined the dress. \"I'll take it! Maybe I can wear it, and, you and I can go dancing tonight...\" Nate winked as the girly voice of his matured, sounding more like a young woman as his Adam's apple faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I like that idea!\" Mike complied as Nate decided on purchasing the dress. Next, Nate noticed a cosmetics section, even including employees handing out samples of certain products. Nate had never been the kind for makeup, but, it felt right. He smiled and walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, can I have a sample of this particular lipstick?\" Nate requested as his soft, gentle, yet, mature voice continued to age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Of course, Ma'am.\" Smiled the employee as she handed Nate a sampling of a light red, almost pink colored lipstick, which Nate applied gracefully to his lips, as if he were a seasoned pro. As he did apply the lipstick, sure enough did his lips become more defined, slightly more plump and certainly becoming a certain softness and shape that any man would love to kiss. Nate looked into the mirror and smiled in content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Looks like i'll be taking that, too!\" His voice finally settling on the voice of a 36 year old woman, gentle, sweet, kind, yet, still young and fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      As he proceeded, facial features rearranged... Cheek bones lifted, skin smoothed, eye lashes lengthened... All as he tried on various cosmetics, eventually, coming to decide to purchase them all. Two mounds from his chest bubbled slightly as he approached Mike, having already purchased the dress, the makeup, and all such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Wow, looks like someone went all out!\" Mike grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Of course!\" Nate agreed in his new voice. \"We are on vacation, aren't we?\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed a bit spur of the moment, but he really liked what he saw. Heck, even that thought of going dancing with Mike....the thought left a small blush on his soft cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've had my fun. So you should have yours now.\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good to me.\" Mike replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began walking in the other direction, ending up back at the map where Mike could look at the options. Nate smiled at how things had been going so far. He and Mike seemed to be getting ever closer. Technically, they were kind of close before, but....as time was going on, Mike seemed to be someone incredibly important to Nate. Though, he couldn't help but feel like he knew Mike in a different way. He had known him since he was born right? His mind didn't seem too sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here we go.\" said Mike, pointing it out to Nate. He smiled and agreed to let Mike have his fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the two of them went up a floor to where Mike specified. Nate finished his lemonade as they did, throwing it away in the process. Nate's limbs were all pretty different now, nice and smooth. His legs constantly brushed against each other underneath his skirt, but that felt totally natural now. In addition, the laces were vanishing on his shoes, with the tongue disappearing as the material stiffened. As they approached their destination, a pair of nice black flats adorned Nate's feet, perfectly going with his clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as Nate predicted, Mike had chosen a sporty-type store. Nate smiled at that, since Mike was really into that stuff like most men. Then again, he didn't dislike it himself. Heck, if he recalled correctly, Mike even got him a small jersey in his size some time ago. So, with that in mind, they entered the shop, which wasn't too busy at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they got a bit of everything here.\" Mike was rather surprised at the variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, take what you want. That's what I did.\" Nate said in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike began looking though, Nate couldn't help but feel some eyes on him. He briefly glanced around, noticing that some men had given him some looks. In spite of that, he smiled that they thought he was good looking enough to stare at. The skirt flowed around his nice hips and butt well. Also, the top, with a wide neckline, showed a good amount of chest too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, as Nate actually looked around himself, his breasts continued to push against his top, steadily growing ever larger. It was an A cup to start, followed quickly by a B cup. Then it was a C cup, before they gently stopped at about a large CC cup size. Nate felt a little omph as they stopped, but felt nice when he looked down, seeing his womanly assets. In all the ruckus, he could see a white bra that had formed underneath the top, completing the clothing look. He smiled at that, as if not surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I'll take this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate heard Mike purchasing something, which was totally fine. He glanced around a bit more, seeing a couple more looks. All the same, he smiled a but, but it didn't feel as good as when Mike looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm satisfied. Shall we go?\" smiled Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we shall.\" said Nate.</span></div></div>",

The long, dirty blonde mane of hair he effortlessly brushed away from his face, smiling as he did. He looked to Mike, Mike looked to him, a certain air between the duo. An air of deep admiration, almost like being in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now I remember why I don't like the mall...\" Mike sighed, still retaining a smile about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Why's that?\" Nate asked, his face continuing to soften, finishing the feminization process about the face. The nose was softer, the eyes offered a softer look, the face left smooth and flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"My wallet hurts...\" Mike laughed, Nate entered with a soft giggle, his laugh sending Mike flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I hope you don't mean that... It was never about the money, even though money is a nice little thing.\" Nate smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah...\" Mike agreed, as the two neared a simple wooden bench perched in front of a palm tree that seemed to loom into infinity. Mike politely gestured that Nate sit first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What a gentleman!\" Nate happily squealed in his voice womanly, followed by a soft blush about his cheeks as he held the skirt against her skin as he sat. Mike followed and sat next to him, wrapping an arm around his long, smooth neck, making Nate feel as secure as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It's not about the money, you're right...\" Mike said, handing Nate a purse, his purse, which had formed from the aforementioned missing wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"My purse!\" Nate cried joyously, recalling that this was indeed his purse, a purse Mike had purchased for him quite some time ago, on an evening out about the town back home... Nate couldn't recall details, but, the more he thought, the more the fog cleared itself. Meanwhile, the small bulge slightly visible from Nate's skirt shrank and faded within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Mike continued, \"...It's about only two people... Us.\" Mike smiled. \"Just you and I, Stephanie!\" Mike proceeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"STEPHANIE?!\" Nate asked himself in apprehension into he back of his mind. Protest and fear rioted through his mind for only a fraction of a second as this anxiety faded along with the foggy memory. Suddenly, he was a she. A strange feeling surrounded the ring finger on her right hand, yes, this was the formation of a simple wedding ring, silver colored with a small diamond on the center. With the sight of the ring, it all made sense to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Stephanie suddenly sounded familiar... Yes, Stephanie Booker, well, at least until she married Mike, then she became Stephanie Wilson. He proposed after both had graduated form college together, at a graduation party filled with both their family and friends. Stephanie wasted no time in accepting the proposal, becoming his wife in no time. The purse, too, made sense, he bought for her on their first date in their freshman year during college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It all made sense. As he leaned in to kiss her, her to him, time froze. She looked him in the eyes and observed the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The woman in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Mike!\" Stephanie cried, meeting him in the middle, each offering the other a simple peck on the lips, nothing more, nothing less, the passion for each other seemingly immeasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, hack to the hotel?\" Mike asked, happy as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Right!\" Stephanie chirped, getting to her feet, brushing off her skirt, softly grasping Mike's hand as the two walked off.</span></div></div>",

Stephanie's hand never left Mike's, since she liked it there so much. The candies from before were still in her purse. Still, those were far from her mind as she lovingly looked at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, remember how Lynda said that she was coming with her kids? Maybe we should go meet them now.\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they're not done unpacking?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lynda will be fine with it. Nothing to worry.\" Stephanie smiled. Lynda Butler was her old friend. She had come here with her own kids. Three of them actually, to which Stephanie kind of wondered how she handled on her own. Well, it was a touchy subject so Stephanie didn't even think of it. Eventually, they entered their hotel again, and Stephanie remembered where Lynda was staying. Going up to what used to be the floor for all of them, Stephanie knocked gently on the door, revealing Lynda on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lyn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Stephanie!\" The two women greeted each other. They had known each other since elementary school after all. Mike and Lynda were civil towards each other though, though Lynda seemed to think that Mike should treat his families' money better. Stephanie would always assure her that they were good. Stephanie's job paid very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's the kids?\" asked Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're around. Trevor can't stay in one place for too long.\" Lynda smiled as she let them in. Nicole was playing with her dolly as she usually did. Erin was listening to music, and Trevor was flying around. The adults smiled at the kids as they began to talk. As they did, Stephanie brought up how she got a new dress to go dancing tonight and decided to offer to Lynda for her to come as well with the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it sounds fine.\" smiled Lynda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" said Stephanie happily. This was turning out well so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, things weren't all good. Perhaps Nicole was too young to understand, but Erin and Trevor felt a bit odd. Something didn't feel right. They knew Lynda was their mother, but seeing Mike and Stephanie felt odd to them, like Mike was supposed to be their dad or something. Nothing seemed to make sense to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, perhaps they would do something later.</span></div></div>",

It's just one night, besides Stephanie and Mike were kind enough to invite us out with them, when, really they didn't have to! The leastww we can do is look half-presentable... Besides, look, Erin!\" Lynda chirped. \"We're twins!\" Lynda struck a pose in her dress, one identical to that which her daughter wore, heels identical, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"There is such a thing as too presentable...\" Erin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I like it!\" Nicole smiled in her small evening dress of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"That's the spirit, Nicole!\" Lynda laughed. \"Now, c'mon, look happy!\" Lynda opened the door to the restaurant, an eatery on one side, a bar on the other and a dance floor in the center, all complete with lighting atmospheric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Table for how many?\" an employee asked for the front counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Oh, we're here looking for someone...\" Lynda scanned the room. \"Oh! There they are!\" Lynda waved to Mike and Stephanie. \"They're friends of ours.\" Lynda justified as she and her kids made their way towards Stephanie and Mike. Though, as they got closer, it seemed that both occupied a two person table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Hey, Lynda!\" Stephanie called as Mike politely waved to her and the kids. Lynda looked to the two person table, then back to Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, this. It's all they had, but, we managed to save you guys a table somewhat close to ours.\" Stephanie pointed to a booth at least 2 or 3 families/ tables away from the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, no, it's fine, it wasn't anyone's fault.\" Lynda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"But, don't worry! When the place gets less full, we can always take a bigger table and mingle then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"OK...\" Lynda sighed, leading her kids to the booth saved for them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n      Nicole slid in the booth seating, Lynda following. Erin slid into the seat across form her mother and sister, her brother sitting at the edge. As Lynda and Nicole began speaking, both Trevor and Erin looked suspiciously to Stephanie and Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Something seems weird about those two...\" Erin noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yeah, I feel like I... know them? Both of them. I'm just not sure how.\" Trevor sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"And it's kind of weird that they don't feel the same way.\" Erin poked her brother and gestured to Lynda and Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know!\" Trevor agreed, fixing his getup. \"It looks like it's just you and I sis...\" Trevor looked to Erin and smiled, she returned it. He always felt that the strongest relationship among the siblings was between he and Erin. She felt the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Candy?\" Trevor pulled a small handful of candies out of his pocket and offered one to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where did you get those?\" Erin inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Found them in a jar at the hotel room earlier. I took a few cause I didn't think i'd like the food here...\" Both Erin and Trevor laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure!\" Erin took two candies, putting one in her purse, and, the other, on the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Trevor smiled and put one in his mouth, the other one on the table. He and Erin continued to stare down Stephanie and Mike as Trevor sucked on his candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't know...\" Trevor began. \"I just wish I could get closer to them. Maybe they're talking about something that'll help us out.\" Trevor justified. As he wished, a strange, dull feeling went about his spine, causing him to sit up straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You Ok?\" Erin asked, noticing her brother's strange actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yeah.\" He answered, his height elevating an inch or two. \"I think I just need to go to the restroom...\" He got to his feet and walked off, Erin handing him a peculiar look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Trevor rubbed his back and continued walking along, as he walked on, he suddenly found himself in front of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trevor soon found himself in front of the restrooms. Not even really caring, he rushed into the men's room, finding himself a stall as he liked to sit down. Though, as he did enter, he felt like he really needed to sit down for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I like sitting down anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, he kind of took his time as he sat there thinking. Trevor, being the kid he was, usually didn't dwell on things, but he felt really odd right now. In fact, ever since he ate the candy, he felt odd. Then again, it had to be coincidence right? Surely, those candies weren't magical or anything. Still, Trevor couldn't quite dismiss the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he sat, he even felt a little queasy in his stomach. He clenched it a bit in discomfort, hoping that maybe it was just gas or something. Something really felt off in his spine too, like.....well he couldn't really describe it. It was like his spine was trying to stretch out or something, and his stomach was feeling flatter and flatter the more time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....I don't feel so good....\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his dress shirt up a bit, seeing his small waist remain small. He felt a little jolt in his lower back for a second, almost forcing it forward a bit as it made his back arch. He had no idea that he was already beginning to surpass 4'6 feet tall, hardly looking like the kid he was before. His limbs still seemed nice and small, though he had the feeling that he felt...softer somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This almost feels like Erin....\" he said absentmindedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, the discomfort subsided, allowing him to sit up straight and finish his work. He was actually sweating a bit, causing him to wipe his forehead. As he did though, he felt as if his bangs were more noticeable now. In fact, his whole head seemed a little shaggier. Well, after catching his breath, he stood up and flushed. He pulled his underwear back up, but he didn't notice something else. His underwear had softened, with even a couple bows on the sides and no opening in the front. Still, he pulled the fresh pair of panties up to his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...when did my underwear feel this nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, even with all those questions in his head, he exited the stall and washed his hands. Something in his head told him that he needed to be clean now, though he didn't know why. No one else came into the bathroom thankfully. He didn't want to explain to anyone what was going on. Maybe Erin would have some idea? Well, that was on his mind as he left the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he wouldn't be going back to his table.</span></div></div>",

Nate took it, knowing that it had his wallet with all his ID inside along with his keys, makeup and other knick-knacks which included his candies of course.  Along with his appearance, his ID was also changing.  The picture on his school ID had his new picture on it along with his new stats such as height, weight and hair color.  He slung the purse over his shoulder.  With its long strap crossing his body, the purse fell to his narrowing waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis right arm was bent at the elbow to hold his lemonade.  Now with his purse over his shoulder it was perfectly natural for him to bend the other arm at the elbow too.  His hand comfortably hung limply from his wrist as the bones in his wrist became smaller and more refined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Mike, I like walking with you,\" Nate said and he meant it.  Of course even before all this started he had enjoyed his dad's company so it wasn't anything special for Nate to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat I like walking with you to,\" Mike said not realizing the slight change in Nate's name.  Inside his purse Nate's ID proclaimed his name was now Natalie.  It was also shifting from a school ID to an ID that was carried by people older than his previous fifteen years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should do it more often,\" Nate said and gave Mike a quick peck on the cheek to establish their closeness.  Nate thought that if he wasn't carrying his lemonade that he would get closer to Mike let him support him as they walked the halls of the mall.  But since he was carrying the lemonade and it was a public place in the middle of the afternoon that probably wasn't a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we should.  We shouldn't argue anymore either.  You know I don't even remember what we were arguing about.\"  As the relationship between Mike and Nate changed the argument that Lynda and Mike had had was being attributed to Nate and Mike instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was something silly.  No need to go into it.  Just say your sorry and I can forget it too.\" Nate was now walking with the graceful gate of an adult woman.  His shoes had even changed to flats that matched the rest of his outfit.  The shoes were much more comfortable than a few seconds ago since his shoes now were designed to be worn without socks.  His socks had vanished without Nate noticing before he had entered the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....\" said Mike.</span></div></div>",

There were many shops to choose from. However, his thoughts soon landed on that clothing shop just a little walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that clothing shop over there?\" Nate pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" said Mike, though Nate could tell that he wasn't too thrilled about it. Still, he seemed to be willing to bear it for him, which was rather sweet in itself. The two of them began walking towards the shop, with Nate throwing his lemonade cup away once he was done with it. Overall, his body size was so much different, almost completely like a woman, not too different from what he saw in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as he walked, his top seemed to feel a little tighter as they did. The neckline was widening a bit, showing a little bit of his torso, though there were no breasts there yet. Part of Nate hoped that it would change, much like the mirror reflection showed him. The rest of his clothes were quite fitting so far. His new hips and butt felt nice in the new skirt, though Nate kept those thoughts to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here we are.\" said Mike as they walked in. It was mostly women's wear in the store, which seemed to be perfect for Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, there's so much!\" Nate nearly cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you gotta pick something.\" said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about I meet you in a bit. I want to look around.\" said Nate. Mike seemed to agree, looking at the section more towards men. That left Nate on his own to explore.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate looked around the store.  There was so many pretty things but he didn't want to be a pig about it.  Mike was being nice in apologizing to him the least he could do was select something modest.  Besides he had brought plenty of clothing on the vacation.  In actually Lynda had packed his suitcase with the usual stuff a teen boy would need, mostly jeans and T-shirts.  But since the wishes that isn't how he remembered it.  Nate now remembered packing not only his suitcase but one for Mike and the children too.  Except for Erin who had insisted on packing her own suitcase.  Although Nate did inspect what Erin had packed to make sure it was appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the clothing that Nate was wearing now, the clothing in his suitcase were changing by the minute.  He knew he had packed some dresses and other outfits but he couldn't quite remember what they were.  Although he knew they were all beautiful and could we worn no matter what activity that came his way during the vacation.  The argument about not being able to afford this vacation was wiped from both Mike's and Nate's mind.  There was the lingering rememberance of an argument but neither could pinpoint what they had been arguing about.  Besides what did it matter since Mike did apologize and was buying Nate a gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate decided to buy some jewelry instead of clothing.  He could get some pretty earrings at a reasonable price and wear them tonight.  Any dress he bought that he wanted to wear dancing would be expensive.  Nate knew that if he picked something too expensive that Mike would still buy it for him but it would hurt him.  Nate knew how Mike thought in so many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the jewelry counter Nate struck up a conversation with the saleslady.  The old Nate avoided the help from sales people, but because of the wish Nate was now much more friendly with everyone.  The wish made several people back at home who had been acquaintences to Nate now his friends.  Total strangers that Nate had only saw a few times and never talked to he could remember having conversations with and even sharing a laugh or a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Nate said to the saleslady with a smile, \"my man wants to get me a present.  Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, what are you looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a nice pair of earrings.  But I don't want them to be too expensive.\"  Nate's ears had become pierced while walking around the store although Nate didn't know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want hoops, studs or dangling earrings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that I can show off while dancing tonight.  My man is taking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow a gift and he is taking you out.  He must be some guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He definitely is.  I LOVE HIM TO DEATH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation went on like this for a while as the saleslady showed Nate earring after earring.  It took a while before Nate could find one that looked great but wasn't too expensive and would go with the dress he now remembered packing for the trip.  Nate had the earrings on and was looking at them in the mirror when Mike finally returned.</span></div></div>",

Not like Mike minded though. He was happy that things were making up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling again, Mike took Nate's hand in his own, and they walked out of the store together. Nate seemed to enjoy this new closeness, as it seemed like he was understanding and learning about Mike much more now. How his body continued to look was further proof of that, as he clearly had the physique now of a more typical woman. He was still lacking assets though on the chest but everything would come in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" asked Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I'm not sure. We've still got a lot of time,\" said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. Surely you have a better answer than that,\" Nate replied. What kind of answer was that when there were many things surrounding them. Did he have to spell things out for Mike? As he was pouting a bit, his shirt finished tightening against him as it became a top with a wide berth at the neck, fitting with the skirt he wore now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay..how about we explore the place a bit more?\" offered Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with their hands still together, the two of them continued walking briskly through the mall. Nate was enjoying this time very much, a lot more than he thought he would when they first walked in. He really wondered just what they could do next. Though, he did kind of wish that Mike had a bit more initiative. He loved the guy of course, but looking back, he could really use a fire underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was a bridge to burn some other time.</span></div></div>",

The lower level was much smaller than the two level's above it.  The lower level.  Had only three stores and a post office.  Few people came to the lower level because there was only specialty items there who needed the extra space of a huge store.  One of the stores sold mattresses and used the huge size of the store to show all the different types of mattresses in their individual glory.  It also had a huge warehouse in back to store its wears.  There was also a piano store and a furniture store in the lower level.  as such the lower level was secluded, especially the hall to the restrooms which lied between the mattress store and piano store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the lower level, they saw it nearly deserted at least as compared to the other levels.  There were people about but they were widely spaced.  Seeing the long hallway to the restrooms, \"Hey I have to 'wash my hands.'\"  Which was Nate's way of telling Mike he had to use the restroom.  Just yesterday, Nate would have told him that he had to take a piss, but Mike expected his women to be less crass than a boy and so that was the phrase he now used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll wait for you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was starting to act not only as Mike's wife, but one that knew him very well and understood what he wanted.  Looking down the long hallway, Nate knew that Mike wanted to get him alone, but he didn't want to seem too forward in public.  Mike was a gentleman at heart and he liked his women demure and ladylike.  Nate knew this and he knew he had to give Mike an excuse to do what Mike really wanted to do but thought he oughtn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should come with me.  That hallway looks long and dark.\" Nate appealed to the Knight In Shining Armor persona that was part of Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At your command.\" and they both set down the hallway.  On the way, walking hand in hand, Nate pretended to stumble which was as much a pretense as his need to use the restroom.  Soon Nate was in Mike's arms looking up at him.  Mike held Nate protectively and soon bent down to give Nate a kiss.  Mike didn't consciously want to get romantic alone in this hallway.  But because of Mike's inadvertent wish a while back, Nate knew Mike better than Mike knew himself.  Nate's mouth was held slightly ajar and soon they were kissing like teenagers that Nate had been just a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were heading back to the room to have makeup sex.  Nate used this opportunity to pop another candy in his mouth and wish....</span></div></div>",

Nate really hoped that they would finally get some alone time there. He knew that Mike wanted it just as much, even if he didn't think so. Nate slowly wrapped looped his around Mike's, while still keeping their hands together. To anyone watching, they looked like any romantic couple, and Nate liked that thought. It was just another sign of how close they were now. And hopefully, if they could get some alone time, they could get ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Mike smiled, seeing the smile on Nate's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing. Just thinking.\" Nate smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right as he said that that Nate felt the urge to use his free hand to move a strand of hair out of his face. He slowly began feeling it brushing against his neck and bare shoulders, as his hair seemed to be growing. Of course, that was something else Mike liked. He really liked a woman with long hair, even if he always said the right things like any style Nate wore was good for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they finally reached the hotel, heading back up to their room. Mike retrieved the key he had, opening it up for the both of them. It was devoid of people when they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did everyone else leave?\" asked Mike, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe....\" Nate said, though he still smiled. This just made things perfect.</span></div></div>",

It was the third wish all of which had to be followed.  Everything had to be as normal seeming as a man and his wife returning to their hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was true then who was Lynda?  Families didn't go on vacation with an extra woman around.  But two families could go on vacation together and so the candy changed things to make this true.  Lynda was now married to Trevor who was seven before the wish and now he was just a year younger than Mike and married to Lynda.  Nicole was now their child not, Mike and Nate's.  Erin was regressed to Nicole's age and made here best friend.  Now the two families going on vacation each with a girl around five seemed perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda announced to the girl, \"Hey who want's to get ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!!!\" the little girls said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, put on your shoes and socks and we'll go.\"  The little girls seemed to loathe wearing any type of footwear so they had to find and put on the hated items, but anything to get ice cream.  Soon everyone was all ready to greet the out doors and they all left five minutes before Mike and Nate returned to the hotel room.<br>\r\nNate could never know that such a small wish would have such big repercussions for so many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike opened the door for Nate but let Nate enter the room first.  Nate was overjoyed that the room was indeed vacant.  Nate now had to decide to get changed or to just seduce her husband without any ado.</span></div></div>",

Erin was okay with it too, although she kind of felt odd about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they had left the hotel, she was playing dolls with Nicole, yet she honestly wondered why. She hadn't been into dolls for some time. There was also how she never seemed to have the kinds of clothes she wanted. She liked the kinds of clothes teenagers would like, yet she was stuck in clothes that better suited her age. It didn't quite seem fair to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as much as Erin thought this was weird, nothing was weirder than Nicole's dad, Trevor. She even had one or two choice words about him, to which she got scolded for when she spoke them. The guy kind of seemed lost at times, letting Lynda direct most matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Erin?\" Nicole gave a look to her friend, getting Erin's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing. I'm fine.\" Erin smiled back. At least being with her friend cheered her up when she felt odd. Perhaps that's how Trevor dealt with things. He at least had Lynda, even though it seemed like she mothered him too at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I want ice cream too!\" Trevor said, a bit too excited for a man his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, I know.\" smiled Lynda. \"My goodness, everyone is excited today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, a little ice cream stop wasn't too far from the hotel, so it was an easy walk there. Lynda tried keeping Trevor under control, which only sort of worked. At least it was enough to reduce the odd locks that got sent their way on occasion. The girls were just fine though, chatting while getting their snack for the day. Though, the kinds of topics Erin liked to talk about kind of went over Nicole's head at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know some weird things,\" said Nicole with a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\" replied Erin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then one dollar at a time gave the money to the counterman.  Trevor's intellect had grown with his age, just not many of his social skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach person got their own flavor of ice cream.  When Trevor got his he licked it with reckless abandon.  he got it all over his face and clothes and even his hands.  Even though the ice cream didn't have time to melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole also got a bit messy on her face but not as much as Trevor.  Erin kept much of her face clean although she did have to eat the ice cream like Nicole with the ice cream in one hand and her dolly in the other.  She didn't know why she carried a dolly.  It was just expected of her.  When they left the house she was going to leave it back in the room, but Lynda found it and gave it to her before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin didn't mind playing dollies with Nicole.  She mostly let Nicole play and she sort of followed right along, much like a babysitter playing with a young girl.  Carrying her own dolly didn't seem right to her, but she had had her for as long as she could remember and Nicole always carried one so she would to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" Erin asked, \"would you like to play dress up with makeup when we get back?\"  Nicole liked to play dress up and Erin did too although for different reasons.  Erin imaged herself in pretty clothes and makeup and starting to flirt with boys (older boys than herself.)  Whereas Nicole just liked feeling silly in other people's clothes.  To Nicole it was as much fun to wear her mom's clothes as to dress up like a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it'll be fun, especially the makeup.\"  The makeup is really what Erin wanted, the clothing wouldn't fit her five-year-old frame but the makeup could be put on to make her look pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can play with makeup if I can be a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now they had to ask Lynda for permission.  They had gone out now its time to get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erin asked her, Lynda told her that they weren't going to the room, that they were going to the pool instead.  This suited Erin just fine, there would be cute guys at the pool.  She could watch them while playing with Nicole.</span></div></div>",

He could make changes to his family and everyone would not know anything was wrong and the candies wouldn't change them so it would be their true reaction.  This got Nate to thinking.  Nate went into the bathroom so he could make his wishes in peace.  Nate put a candy in his mouth and set out to change his family and see how people reacted to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that mom (Lynda) wore the pants in the family and that dad was a cuckold husband who did everything that mom wanted.\"  Nate thought it would be great to see his once proud father being bossed around by his formerly demure wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Nate wished, \"I wished that Nicole and Trevor would swap, clothing, hair and names.\"  Nicole who would still be a five-year-old girl would look like a boy since its really the hair and clothing that lets people know which are the boys and which are the girls.  Would people treat them any different if they saw what looks like a five-year-old boy who was carrying a dolly and acting as girly as Nicole had been.  Most people would probably think that Trevor was a tomboy.  Nate was happy that Nicole usually wore swimsuits with ruffles at the waist so no one could see the outline of his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the final wish, Nate decided to be nasty at his sister Erin.  They had been rivals for many years now since there was only two years difference in their ages.  \"I wish,\" Nate said.  Nate had to word the wish right. \"the whole family treated Erin as if she was a toddler under two years old and that Erin wouldn't complain.\"  Then to make totally sure, \"I wish that Erin talked like a toddler when strangers could hear her.\"  \"There that would do it,\" Nate thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate returned from the bathroom to look around.  Mom was supervising dad as he was unpacking the suitcases.  Trevor looked like a girl while wearing Nicole's clothes that had been resized to fit him.  With her short hair cut and transformer's t-shirt, Nicole looked like a boy even though she was also carrying her dolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate saw the biggest change when he looked at Erin.  Erin was dressed in a big bird t-shirt and was sitting in a stroller.  She clearly wanted out of the stroller, but since Mike hadn't finished unpacking, Lynda stuck a pacifier into Erin's mouth instead to quiet her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiled broadly as he thought about what fun he was going to have watching his family.</span></div></div>",

Lynda was leading the way with Mike pushing Erin who was in a large stroller which could accommodate her thirteen-year-old body.  To Lynda's left was Nicole who thought her name was Trevor.  She looked like a little boy because of her clothing and short hair but she was still carrying her dolly in her left hand.  Her right hand was holding Lynda's.  Trevor was walking next to his father.  He wore a yellow girls top that had a kitten and teddybear on it.  He wore girls jeans but they were in a style that could be worn by either sex.  Of course there was little doubt that he was a girl to a stranger because of the length and style of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they were in the hall where people might be able to hear them Erin was saying \"Wanna walk.\" to indicate that she wanted out of the stroller.  But Lynda was having none of it, Lynda knew that it was easier to deal with a toddler in the stroller instead of letting them walk with the family.  Mike would have agreed but he had no say in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Erin's request to walk changed to, \"Gonna potty.\" Which was Erin's way of saying I have to go to the lady's room.  But to Mike and Lynda, Erin was too young to potty, which was why she was wearing a diaper.  They ignored her and waited for her to use her diapers and then would change her.  Of course, Mike would be the one taking Erin to the changing station at the men's room when the time was right.  Either that or he would simply put down a changing mat and change her in public like any other toddler.</span></div></div>",

Mike did as he was told and pulled Erin out of the stroller.  Mike carried Erin in his arms so that the little rugrat wouldn't scamper off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor and Nicole removed their outer clothing to get down to their bathingsuits.  Trevor who thought his name was Nicole was wearing a one piece girls yellow swimsuit with Minnie Mouse on it.  Minnie was also wearing a red and white dotted swimsuit and had a matching bow on her head.  Trevor's swimsuit also had ruffles that formed a pseudo-skirt that hid the outline of his penis.  With his long girlish hair and swimsuit he looked like a little girl even though he was occupying his time playing with his cars.  His play included the VROOM, VROOM sounds and the sounds of the cars crashing into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stood next to her mother waiting.  She wore nothing but boys swim trunks which left her chest exposed not that anyone minded.  Even though she was carrying her dolly she looked just like a little boy because of her clothes and short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was wearing the same swimsuit as Trevor although in a larger size.  The toddler style swimsuit was  not designed to highlight her developing cleavage which was probably a good thing.  The only difference between what Trevor and Erin were wearing was the fact that Erin wore a swimdiaper.  The pseudo-skirt that hid the outline of Trevor's penis did nothing to disguise the bulge of the diaper that Erin was wearing.  Since Mike was carrying Erin she couldn't get away.  She wanted to hide but there was nowhere to go anyway.  As with any young toddler Mike or Lynda always kept an eye on her so she couldn't scamper away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda told Nate to help watch the kids while they were in the pool.  That job used to fall to Erin but since everyone (in the family) thought that Erin was a toddler that new responsibility befell Nate.  Nate didn't mind since he wanted to watch everything that happened anyway.  When Lynda thought that the family was ready she led the family toward the pool.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">All right, my 6th interactive story! Basically, this story revolves around magical occurances in the world. The things that happen mostly include TG sequences. For example, body switching, magical items, revenge, etc. Please update! I don't want to do this by myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will keep track of girf points and, when I can, distribute them accordingly. Big points for great chapters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Edit (2/1/2012): </b>This story has surpassed 40,000 views and over 1700 chapters! Thank you so much everyone for your help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Edit (4/29/2013): </b>This story has surpassed 78,000 views and over 2000 chapters! Thank you so much everyone for your help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Note (2/27/2012): For anyone who is really interested in Candies of Change and enjoys it, please check out my new Candies of Change 2 story. I'm looking for anyone who would be interested in helping add to it. Thank you for your time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn  addition, I plan on possibly creating new stories. If you wish to help me with that, you may contact me regarding that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if there are any of you that enjoy Fire Emblem, I'd like to get my Fire Emblem story going again. If you like that series and would like to help, contact me as well.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep it PG-13! <br>\r\n2. You can have sex, but not descriptive and try not to have too much.<br>\r\n3. Keep language PG-13 and also keep it tame (like not cursing every sentence)<br>\r\n4. Keep the story going and no killing the characters.<br>\r\n5. Try to make it a good length if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's the story: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate (you) just had your 15th birthday. However, you find some candies that aren't what they seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the characters (I may add more):<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Nate Wilson (You): Male, 15-years old, short brown hair, blue eyes, average height and weight, about 5'6, kind, likes to be around friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kate Smith: Female, 15-years old, your crush, long dark hair, green eyes, about 5'3, kind of a tomboy. You have crushed on her since kindergarden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Tommy Iverson: Male, 15-years old, short sandy hair, blue eyes, about 5'6, loves sports, your best friend since kindergarden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.

Heather Yamamoto: Female, 15-years old, hazel eyes, short dark hair, japanese-american, friend of you and Sonia, likes to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Lynda Wilson: Female, 36-years old, long brown hair, blue eyes, your mother (who takes care of you and your sister alone because your father is gone). Despite being 36, you could probably mistake her for late 20's because of her rather young appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Mike Wilson: Male 37-years old, short brown hair, blue eyes, your father, like your mother he looks rather young for his age, cares about his children equally,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Bethany Farmer: Female 33-years old, shoulder-length brown hair, blue eyes, sister of your mother, has a good relationship with you, has 2 kids,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Carly Goode: Female, 13-years old, waist-length blonde hair, blue eyes, friend of Sonia's, really a girly girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Josh Howards: Male 17-years old, really short brown hair, brown eyes, friends with you, likes to mess with you sometimes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Janet Day: Female: 16-years old, long strawberry-blonde hair, green eyes, a head cheerleader, kind of arrogant but has a nice side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. Nicole Wilson: Female, 5-years old, brown hair, blue eyes, your younger sister,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13.
