She has a sense of hero worship about high-ranking adventurers, and would never question anything they tell her.  Long, blonde hair, and a short stature.  She is somewhat plump, a step beyond puppy-fat.  Her specialty is healing magic.  Actually, she can only use healing magic.  Surely she'll learn more, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone Sandrovic<br>\r\n-Leone has the experience of adventuring with a high level party.  She was forced out for unexplained reasons, although likely due to her inability to handle money, and has been waiting around in the guild hall for months, waiting for an oppourtinity to get out there again.  Tall, with jet balck hair and an impressive bust.  Her recent bout of inactivity has lead to a fair ammount fo weight piling on, giving her a definite gut.  Specializes in buffs and debuffs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Marissa von Howerton<br>\r\nMarissa is a grade A prodigy, capable of feats far beyond her experience level.  Despite this, and her family's connections, no party has managed to last more than a single job.  Her demanding attitude, superiority complex, and general laziness make her a complete nightmare to have one a long journey.  An average stature, with pure white hair.  Outright fat, with a double rolled belly and no hint of muscle.  Can use everything, healing, buffs, debuffs, and any other support magic</span></div></div>",

The top of the mountain pass offered little cover from the heat, nothing more than sandy ground and a few small brown rocks sticking out.  Johan grabbed his waterskin and took a long gulp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  That hit the spot.  You want some Leone?  Leone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back towards his compatriot, she was nowhere to be found.  Taking a few steps back, he peered down the slope.  There, about fifty meters down, he saw her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time away from the field had not been kind to Leone.  What was once a toned body, fit for being in the thick of the action, had become bloated and soft.  A doughy gut hung over her belt, thick thighs pinched by the thigh high black stockings she wore beneath her boots.  The black robe she wore barely covered her wobling backside, and did little to contain her swinging breasts, straining at the material even as they shook vicaiously with her motion.  Sweat drenched her face as she grabbed onto a nearby outcrop to pull herself forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohan sighed.  It would take a while for her to reach him at this rate.  Maybe he should give her a hand?</span></div></div>",
