She's also always hungry which is odd for an undead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolem/Gauntlet- Earthaterra. (German like.)  Has a Koneko (highschool dxd) like personality almost capable of reading Bell's thoughts and calling him a pervert when another woman is near by.  She also enjoys sitting on his lap when hes resting.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScallya- Nami  Has a severe dislike for land and phobia to earth, so much so that she causes a flood of water to wash away the earth, making the dungeon room waist high in water.  This often upsets Lilly and Welf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentaur- Cylla/Cyllara (Is like Caboose, but lusty.  So a combination of Sister and Caboose.  If you've ever seen Red Vs. Blue you know what Im talking about.  Unintelligent, often hits her own allies and is turned on whenever she is touched by Bell in any way.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlime Girl- Tiialia/Tidia/Tiddie (Innocent little sister sterotype that says inappropriate things innocently.)  She'll say things like Tiddie needs a good sucking when she wants to drink from the water bottle that Bell carries or wants to suck his sweat directly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamia- Piper (Rattlesnake ish.)  Feeling like a baby sitter of Bell's party members and sighs alot at having to have to take care of Bell's dead weights.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWerewolf- Scooter.  Enjoys fighting and doing things for Bell, often desiring to make him happy.  And expecting pets on the head from him.  Often will chase after her own tail when not fighting monsters.  Feels like she's in competition with Lilly as she sees fetching the magic stones as a game and gets rewards with head pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlrune- Floret (French maid.)  Has a french maid personality and wants to clean up after Bell while revealing her busty and lewd body.  She often cleans up in front of him both to get his eyes to gaze at her and to clean up the area where he's going to walk, claiming that he shouldn't dirty himself by walking that far ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadless Knight- Maid Marian.  Often will despense justice and make sure everyone is safe.  If a pass parade ( when one party of adventurers passes a bunch of monsters to another) happens she'll slay the monsters as quick as she can and then chase after the dishonorable party.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarpy- Aero.  Loves to fly and only does things for Bell with the promise of sex later.  She will try and have sex anywhere, but if often told that sex is in only in a hotel.  She likes to have her breasts caressed by Bell and likes to caress him as she carries him in flight.  Often trying to stroke him off through his pants.</span></div></div>",

How could Bell be gaining so many unique abilities, skills and spells?  This puzzled her very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small quick nod Hestia used her blood to update the hieroglyphs.  Making his status update official.  She had then had paper copied his Falna.  After pulling the paper off his back she climbed off his back a she showed the paper to the sitting up Bell.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the paper was the new status and new spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><b>Level 2 Strength: D 578    Defense: D 500    Utility: F 356    Agility: E 499    Magic: G 271    Luck: H 187</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><b>Magic Firebolt- Swift Strike Magic    Summon- Swift Assist Long Duration Magic</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\"><b>Skill Heroic Desire, Argonaut- Charges Automatically with Active Action</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell was all sorts excited as he said to the Goddess, \"Goddess, can I go try out this new spell.

After you tell me about it, then we'll see if you can use it past that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell as a bit depressed by the answer, but decided to not show it.  After all he did almost die a few days ago.  Still, he couldn't wait to show off his new spell.

He was wearing his new Pyonkichi Mk-IV which was made by Welf rather quickly yesterday.  He had picked it up at the post office since Welf wanted to mail it saying he'd be out of commission on personal business.  The silver and red armor went well with his black under clothing as usual.  The main difference with this armor set was that he has his minotan daggers on his back now in back sheathes.  In the left sheath was the shorter of the daggers Ushiwakamaru and in the right the longer dagger that was made just yesterday along side the armor thanks to Welfs new Forge ability Ushiwakamarunishiki.  On the back of his waist above a square boxish potion pouch was the sheathe to his new baselard made from a drop item by the Baby Dragon from the eleventh floor Drahoine.  And safely tucked into his left fore arm protecting light armor was a armor sheathe that housed the most treasured item of all, the Hestia Knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell closed his eyes as he thought to himself on what the possibilities of this new magic could be.  Suddenly, he bumped into something that made him open his eyes and look up from the blue sweater tank top.  The gold hair and eyes of Aiz Wallenstien who seemed rather silent and said to him with her stotic expression, \"...Where are you off to Bell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed flooded his face as Bell leaped back and bowed several times, \"I'm sorry, so sorry Aiz.  Please, forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSullen by his shyness Aiz walked up and hugged his head into her breasts again, \"...Please, don't apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust quivering and knees buckling Bell nearly fell down from the embarrassment.  Disappointed she decided to stop making him so vulnerable and embarrassed.  She released his head and said to him, \u201c...So, what are you doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell then placed his fist into his hand as he told her with his embarrassment gone, \"Oh, that's right.  I just got a new magic that was going to try out today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz quickly said before he could escape based on his facial gestures, \"I'm going with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell loss for words could only nod in defeat.</span></div></div>",

Crimson slashes with sparks licking the blades crossed and jabbed the goblins.   The white haired 'rabbit' boy with red eyes landed with a skid as he put his daggers away.  Trying out his new magic he threw up his right hand, \"Summon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin looked at him expecting something, but nothing happened.  Bell looked at his right hand and stuck out his left hand not thinking about it.  He looked at his right hand as he said questioning, \"Why didn't my Summon-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his left hand came a burst of green light.  The light smashed through the dirt and stone as if formed into a seal.

Her hair was like that of pyrite and ruby red eyes.  Her giant gauntlet fists went in and slammed into a goblin that made a dash for Bell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin crashed and turned into ash as the magic stone in it's chest broke.  The golem girl looked stotically at Bell as she said to him, \"Summoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz looked at the girl and saw that the golem girl had several of her own traits and Bell's.  She gave a slight smile with a faint blush as she said, \"...She looks like our daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell looked at Aiz as he said to her, \"Uh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was of if the golem girl was being nursed and then cared for by Aiz.  And then Aiz was in an apron welcoming him home.  The golem girl interrupted his thoughts by calling him out, \"Summoner is a pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruck by the statement Bell lost his face.  After regaining his face he then asked the golem girl, \"So, uh, I'm Bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem girl replied to him, \"I know that already, Summoner Bell.  I am Earthaterra or Terra for short.  I am your Golem and Gauntlet.  Should anything need punching, I'm your summoning you want.  The others wanted to come, but I assessed the situation and decided you needed my help.  It would be more useful next time if you simply aim your left hand and called my name after saying Summon.  Or you can call on any of your other summonings: Sahara, Nami, Cyllara, Tidialia, Piper, Aero, Scooter, Floret or Marian.

Looking at all the goblin bodies he then said to the pair of girls, \u201cUh, with my Familia\u2019s life savings given to the search party that took the request.  I kinda am broke, so let me just collect these magic stones and drop items.  And exchange them up in the Babel Tower\u2019s Exchange and then we can go to lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz then said as she pulled out a small knife, \u201cI\u2019ll assist in doing so.  I am hungry as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz and Bell gutted twenty goblins as Bell looked at Terra and asked putting the last of the magic stones away, \u201cSo, why are you still here?  Also, why don\u2019t I feel more Mind Down symptoms while you are here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra explained as Aiz got her last goblin, \u201cThe spell is a low mind cost long duration swift assist magic.  Meaning that the cost of the magic is relatively low per summoning you summon.  And once we\u2019re summoned our duration is based on how much energy we the summons have, so I won\u2019t return til I choose to or am over thrown by fatigue.  And we are a swift assist meaning that we need a single word to summon us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz then said to Bell and Terra, \u201c...I\u2019m done, shall we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three went up to the surface and got on the Babel Tower elevators.  It was a little cramped inside with Aiz having Bell in front of her.  And the back of his head resting against her bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell noticed that Terra rested her cheek against his groin.  She rubbed her cheek on his zipper making him blush.  He was completely still from the nuzzling that he felt from Terra.  What happened next was almost worse, Aiz put her arms on his shoulders.  And pulled him into her bosom tightly, then placed her nose in his hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator opened and the three got out.  Bell pulled himself away from the two girls and stumbled a bit.  Panting he caught his breath as he then gained back his pale skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three arrived at the exchange as Bell noticed Eina and said with realization, \u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday, right? Miss Eina should be running the Babel Tower Exchange today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman heard her name as she said to Bell with a small smile, \u201cBell.  I\u2019m glad to see you are alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lids lowered as she said to him sternly, \u201cWhat have I told you about not adventuring?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she said to him pushing her glasses back up, \u201cNever mind that, so, what do you have for me today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz and Bell placed the two bags of magic stones on the counter.  The tray was pulled behind the glass wall and the stones were counted.  Eina placed several Valis into the tray and said to them slidding it back, \u201cYou have been given 4,000 Valis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small bob of gold hair at Bell\u2019s waist moved as Terra asked, \u201cSummoner, is this the Ms. Eina that you think about for hours after visiting the Guild?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping Bell said to Terra, \u201cHey, stop reading my thoughts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina gawked as she stood up from her chair to look down at the short golem.  She looked down at the golem and asked shocked, \u201cWho is that Demiperson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell smiled nervously as he told her, \u201cI learned a new magic called Summon.  And I summoned Terra here.  We\u2019re going to get lunch now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her clock Eina said to the three, \u201cLunch is right now and I\u2019ll be coming with you.  I\u2019d like to find out more about the summonings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with four in the group outing they arrived at the Hostess of Fertility.  Syr smiled as she greeted them holding up her tray, \u201cHey, Bell, the usual table in the corner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked thoughtful and bemused at the sight of the golem girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seated themselves at the table. Bell took a seat opposite Eina, and Aiz chose the seat next to him. Terra, without a moment's hesitation, seated herself squarely on Bell's lap. She did it in a very matter-of-fact way, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyr looked amused at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's cute,\" the waitress commented, nodding to Terra. \"How old is she? Twelve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve and a half,\" said Terra flatly. \"<i>Centuries</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyr blinked. It was a testament to her professionalism that she did not especially react to this claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you are,\" she said in the kind of softly indulgent tone that one might use with a very small child. \"Now, may I take your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell, Aiz, and Eina each placed their usual orders. Terra did not.

I'm not really sure, myself,\" he said. \"It's n-not like I'm <i>really</i> thinking those kinds of things about you two!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina could tell right away that this was a lie, and quite a feeble one, but Aiz seemed to  believe it, judging by how her face imperceptibly fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't?\" she said in a tone that was subtly disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell looked at her for a long moment. His face slowly lost some of its excess color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe a little,\" he admitted shamefacedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz perked right up at this, although again it would have been difficult for a casual observer to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra cocked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two want to sit in your lap, too, Summoner,\" she said, glancing from Aiz to Eina. \"I don't want to let them, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Eina's turn to blush and abashedly avert her eyes. Aiz simply nodded a quiet confirmation, as if this was perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh...\" muttered Eina, looking very red indeed. \"What are you, girl, a mind-reader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBluntly, Terra answered. </span></div></div>",

It is easy to read the faces of humans because there are so many.  With constant observation of my stotic face, I can gather all details of your current face.  Even Aiz is easy to read.  Though among humans she is the toughest to read of you all.  With a golem it is impossible to read their face.  If I met another golem, I would observe that golem single face.  If they were a happy face then they'd be excited at all times and unpredictable, because they'd only do more and more excited things to maintain their happy face.  With my face, of being stotic, I shall always be matter of factly and dead pan.  If I exhibit an unusual emotion it could very well cause a crack and any small crack will lead to bigger cracks.

I require to powder my nose as they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Aiz didn't look or seem it, she did apply a little bit of make up and knew the phrase.

It is troublesome to maintain one's body because of irrational fears such as erosion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz felt sorry for the demihuman that looked like a future child of hers and Bells.  She wrapped her arms around Terra from behind the short two and a half feet tall golem.  Showing an unusual amount of humanity Aiz said to the golem with a slight smile, \"You will never crack while I am here.  Understand this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra knew that her neck was still drying and said looking straight forward in her usual deadpan style, \"I can't look up at your smile, but I would like to make your smile even bigger.  I may be twelve and a half centuries old, but golems are made of magic clay.  And when we are contracted with a new summoner.  We are reduced to a fresh pile hot clay.

A smile that was unusually long came to her face and her eyes closed in happiness.  A giddy feeling rushed in her as she quivered in happiness.  The giddiness calmed and receded like a wave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra then said to Aiz, \"Shall we go and rejoin Summoner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz smiled still and said as they left, \"Yes, let's go rejoin your father.\"</span></div></div>",

With a sovereign mastery of her demeanor she nodded and waved this away, taking it with apparent good humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she afraid I'll eat her out of house and home?\" the dusky-skinned mummy lightly inquired as Lyu set the new plates of food before the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm,\" Lyu hummed, an uninvested and noncommittal response. \"I didn't ask. But your little friends are unsanitary.\" She gestured to where one of Sahara's scarabs scittered across the table. \"Do try not to let them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Sahara, but her face twitched a little. \"They might be sacred creatures, but if you think they're <i>unsanitary</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell interjected before anything could be said that might later be regretted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're a mummy,\" he said. \"And another summon?

I am intrigued by this new magic, find out more.- F.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----At the Guild----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina was called into her superior's office.  Eina reported as a member of the guild.  The superior was a black lab animal person.  His ears perked up and then flopped down as he said clearing his throat while holding the papers of Bell Cranell's file, \"Eina, the record holder is becoming more and more interesting.  It currently is in the guild's best interest to have him be direct contracted and chronicled.  His own accounts and the accounts of others can no longer hold up his file.  We smell something fishy going on.  And so, we are directing you to be apart of the Hestia Familia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina gasped as she looked at the papers placed in front of her.  Her superior told her looking straight into her eyes as calmly as he could, \"From today onward you are a Chronicler and Dungeon Advisor with field duty.  Meaning, you will be going into the dungeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina looked somewhat fearful as she then calmed herself.  She pulled the paper up as she said to the man, \"Understood.  And these papers will make sure I get a Falna from Hestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer superior gave a short nod, \"Yes, if she refuses then she'll have to pay the entire debt of 30,000 valis she owes Hephaestus and she'll have to face having Bell Cranell being black listed.  If she wishes to avoid these things, she'll have to give you a falna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina did not feel comfortable with this, but these were orders from the Guild.  She walked out of the office and arrived at the Hestia Familia's house.  She held her breath as she knocked on the secret door under the church.  </span></div></div>",

She was not happy about being forced to accept a new child into her Familia, especially one that liked Bell so much.  But, at the same time, the very threats she was getting were making her worried.  And the papers did mention that her main job would be to observe Bell for whoever was mysteriously pulling the strings.  Making him slay a minotaur or learn a magic from a Grimoire and the attack from several black robed attackers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHestia sighed as she said to Eina grabbing a sewing kit, \"Very well, Eina.  You shall be the second member in my Familia.  You'll have to take off your shirt so I can give you a Falna.  But, try not to swing those sweater puppies in my face.  Just cause you are a bit bigger than me, doesn't mean you have to show off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing at her new goddess's unusual mannerisms Eina did as she was told.  Eina laid on Hestia's bed with her tatas resting on the mattress.  Her back exposed to the small goddess, she felt the ichor drip on her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHestia placed a paper on Eina's back.

What kind of date do you think you're going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz ducked under a Yeti's swing and thrust desperate her rapier into its chest.  The Yeti burst as it's magic stone was pierced.

I read that it was romantic to recreate your first encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Riveria placed her head on her head as she watched the Kenki race up to the Mammoth.

After slaying and cleaning the monster of it's magic stone which was the size of a woman's shoe.  Aiz picked up the Mammoth Fur and said to Riveria, \"It'll make a nice scarf or shaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiveria couldn't exactly argue with her logic.

Allen took his spear to the latch as he said to the other two, \"I don't like how Lady Freya is paying so much attention to this newbie.  And just to test his new magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe casket opened as a tiger headed monster walked out.  Growling he monster let it's human hands wrap around a pair of wands.  The wands were given to it by Allen.  Mia told Allen with a smile, \"If he can defeat this Rakshasa from level 25th, then he'll gain a new magic.  And that magic might make him so powerful, that he'll rival Lyu or Ottar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOttar glared as he said to Mia, \"The mistress will test him against me when the Little Rookie gets to my level, level 9.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rakshasa growled as a piece of cloth was placed in front of it's nose.

From the wand came a stream of water and shot forth at Bell.  Lilly detected the attack and said to Bell, \"Mr. Bell duck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell's eyes widen as he fell to the ground dodging the water shot.  Pulling his baselard out from his back waist known as Drahoine.  His right right hand shot forth as he shouted at the Rakshasa, \"Firebolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElectric fire flowed from his hand and struck the tiger headed monster.  The fire dispersed with the wave of the right wand.  The wind made a funnel that soon gathered stones to chuck at the three.  Lilly used her bow rifle to fire at the Rakshasa.  The arrows flew at it's legs and stabbed into the ankles of the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina was unarmed and just hid as best as she could.  Bell reached for his shorted minotan dagger, Ushiwakamaru.  Pulling out the crimson blade he said handing it to Eina, \"Here, for your protection Ms. Eina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina nodded as she held it in front of her.  Bell switched his baselard to his right hand as he threw up his left hand.  A green light appeared as he said with a shout, \"Summon Sahara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearing above Bell in the air was the mummy summoning.  With a smile and a bounce of her breasts Sahara said throwing her left hand, \"Sand Tsunami!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSand came out of the Dunegon floor.  It gathered in a wave and blanketed the field.  Several level one adventurers were swept up by the sand.  Bell shouted at Sahara in a voice of alert, \"Sahara, try not to sweep away the adventurers.  We need to get them to safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSahara landed on sand as ice pillars shot up through the sand.  She looked at them as she said with a smile, \"Ice is just frozen water.  And for a girl that is always thirsty and hungry, I'll have my fill thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarabs crawl from her bandages and go after the ice shards.

Bell flew back with a flip as he said grabbing at his left forearm pulling out his Hestia Knife, \"Guh, got to slay this monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina went from behind her rock and walked around to the back of the monster.  She stayed hidden for now to try and give Bell some time.  The beasts roared as more goblins approached.  The goblins growled and the giant rats sneered as they went at the various adventurers.  Bell swung down and stabbed with his weapons at the monsters.  They all turned to ash as Bell was stabing their magic cores, only caring about defeating the Rakhasa with little to no bloodshed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell panted as he slayed another monster and threw his right hand in Eina's direction, \"Firebolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire engulfed the two of the goblin.  A giant rat stood between the Rakhasa and itself.  The fire burned the giant rat to cinders and licked at the Rakhasa's skin.  Water splashed the fire as Bell decided that he needed to change up tactics.  He threw his Hestia Knife with his left hand to slay a giant rat.  From his left hand came a green light, \"Summon Terra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the green light came the small golem, Terra.  Her pyrite hair shook to the left as she turned on her right food.  Pulling her fist sent the very sand flying with the throw of a punch.  The punch was so strong that it sent the Rakhasa back and right on Eina's dagger.  Eina had snuckup to the monster hoping to slay it.  But the force of the punch made it's back land n the magic.  The crack of the magic stone could be heard from the Rakhasa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fell from the body as the Rakhasa gasped and collapsed into earth and ash.  Enia just looked at the broken magic stone shards.  Freya's forces pulled out and left for their home.</span></div></div>",

Giant ferrets, goblins, raccoon folk, Kobolds and Dungeon Lizards giving the white haired adventurer their attention and killing intent.  Bell put his hands on his waist as he shook his head and side stepped.  Walking backwards he leaned his back on a rock pillar and said to the tall womanly figure covered by shadow, \"Ms. Eina, you are up.  I'll assist if I believe you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing up her glasses Eina walked foward wearing a blue hooded robe that went down to her waist.  A pair of daisy duke kakis were visible on her buttocks.  Covering her legs were a pair of long leg brown leather low heel stilettos.  Light plate mail was on her lower legs to protect from low ground attacks.  A silver belt was worn with blue magic strings connecting to small floating shields.  The belt was known as the Shieldabell, a moving shield that protected it's adventurer.  In her left hand was a onyx revolver with short barrel.  The chest sash she wore under her bosom around her robe held the revolver's bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina pulled the hammer to the revolver back as she said taking aim of the monsters, \"Time to face your nightmare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smirked as she stood back by Bell, \"Ms. Eina sure is fired up after having half a million valis spent on her gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell chuckled as he scratched his cheek nervously, \"Actually, it's a little more than that.  Basically, I had to pull a goddess moment and put in for a loan.  I'm currently 800,000 valis in debt in that gear.  I wanted to make sure Ms. Eina was well protected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly glared at him as she said to him, \"So, Ms. Eina gets new equipment and Lilly doesn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell laughed as he reached into his square pouch and said pulling out a green gem necklace, \"Actually, you do too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly's eyes sparkled at the magic enigma that Bell held out for her.  It was elegantly crafted as Bell said to her, \"Ms. Asfi did a favor for me to make this three powers necklace.  Once worn by it's owner, it will not work for anyone else.  It provides a weak shield to melee attacks allowing you more time to duck instead or make your counter attack be a few more seconds faster.  Its shield is made of energy that is made to absorb ranged attacks completely of any monster that is level three and below.  The third power is something called peerless sight.  She wouldn't tell me anything more than it allows the wearer to see what's most important no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took the necklace and pulled down her hood.  Pulling it over her head and placing it around her neck she fingered the green gems.  A blush graced her cheeks that was illuminated by the glowing green gem.  Her werewolf ears were laid back as her tail wagged back and forth kicking up dirt and stones from the dungeon floor.  She then leered at Bell as she said biting her lower lip, \"Mr. Bell, watch yourself.  Never know when this Werewolf prum will do more than fetch for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell guffawed confused, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina threw her arm out after shooting one of the monsters, \"<i>Craft yourself for your master a trap that will ensnare all!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree seals of blue light appeared on the floor and exploded as soon as goblins and kobolds unknowingly stepped on them.  Dirt flew into the air as the monsters were burned into ash with their magic stones shattered.  Eina reloaded the bullets to her revolver with a speed loader.  Placing the chamber back into the gun she pulled the hammer and aimed at the approaching Dungeon Lizard.  She pulled on the trigger misplacing the lizard's left front leg and causing it to roar in pain.  Pulling the hammer a second time she shot the other front leg.  The monster groaned as it died letting out its last breath, just like all the other monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina panted sweating as she said placing her small revolver into her robe's right bosom holster.  She wiped her brow with the back of her left forearm.  Swaying her head back she said after her eyes focused again, \"Whoa, a bit of mind down symptoms.  Well, Bell how was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell smiled as Lilly carved up the monsters digging their bodies for magic stones, \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A buy one set of lingerie and get one Succubus Lace Item free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina gasped as she said to Misha after looking everywhere, \"Why would you say that?

The zipper was a bit hard to fit, but Bell made it fit with just a bit more effort.  Pulling the zipper up he heard Eina told him with a hand on the window, \"No, Bell.  Don't zip it up.  Quickly, zip it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell attempted to do what he was told.  But, the zipper would not budge.  Eina looked as back as he could trying to pull on the zipper some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't notice was Eina walking out from behind the window.  When he finally noticed her he said to her holding up his hands, \"I'm sorry Ms. Eina, I thought that this was a gift from you is all.  And I wanted to accept it like a man was all.  I'm trying my best to take it off, but I can't seem to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina had a small smile on her lips as she said naughtily, \"At least I know you desire me, Bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell looked at her questioningly, \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEina smiled as she looked at him with a spark in her eye, \"You know, Succubus Lace only makes those that the wearer desires to desire them back.

He was currently in his new house with his five girlfriends: Eina, Aiz, Hestia, Syr and Lilly.  Hestia was busy changing into her usual outfit after her job at the Hephaestus weapons store.  And when Bell's eyes would not leave her body, Eina noticed his love muscle begin to stir.  Smiling at the loin cloth clad pecker the half elf decided to lavish it with attention.  Pop him once to prevent an all out orgy.  That was the plan at least, until he let out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stopped what they were doing and turned to the half elf and boyfriend.  Syr at the stove looked with a lewd smile as she saw the shirtless boy aware of the fact that three days ago the girls had decided for the week that it would be kinky to forbid any clothing in the house on boys except for loin clothes.  Being out numbered made Bell's objections useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly stopped counting her vals as she leered with a grin.  Seeing his slowly recuperating body finally catch it's breath from being stroked so mercilessly.   She loved seeing his halted from popping one off, almost as much as she loved seeing him recover from popping off one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiz looked at Bell in her usual stotic passive face, only adding a slit smile.  She currently polished her sword and decided to tease Bell as his eyes finally landed on her.  She smiled a bit more and lowered her eye lids as she stroked the rapier in her hand with the white cloth rather suggestively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHestia was the last one to look at Bell as she said with a lick of her lips as well as looking down on him from her short stature coming up with a devilish idea, \"Let's play a trendy new game with Bell.  I believe the mortals called it: Truth, Dare or Dirty Dare.\"</span></div></div>",

It was pretty straightforward, all told, and honestly self-explanatory. He was a little anxious at the looks in the girls eyes, looks which suggested that for them <i>dirty dare</i> might as well have been the only option in this game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped and tried to pull the front of his loincloth the whole way down over his manhood.
