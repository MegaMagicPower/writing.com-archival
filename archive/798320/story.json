It is known that you have magic powers and a magic stone but that is all.  You must choose your weapons here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you carry a long bow and a quiver of never ending arrows.  That is a given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wear green clothes of the forest but possess a golden gown for those rare occasions when you appear before royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair is golden blonde with silver streaks that is long, past your knees, often braided, your eyes are gray, your lips a perfect shade of pink, full and shapely, nestled against pale flesh.  Your cheeks are naturally rosy with sparkles dancing across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are strong, lithe and powerful.  You are still considered young by the elves, although you are over three hundred years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, choose your weapons.  Choose wisely.</span></div></div>",

I stare out into the clear night and down into the valley. It is the elven valley my father lives in, my mother had lived in Galendia, a land not far from the sea that she loved, but 100 years ago she was killed in battle. I know Death knows how much this place means to me but the others don't have to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a valley up here, we've reached Alanis, the capital of all the elven cities.\"  I yell back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE WANT TO TRUST THEM BUT ON THIS JOURNEY WE CAN NOT, DO NOT TELL THEM ANYTHING.\" I hear Death call forward.  \"YOU CAN NOT TELL YOUR FATHER OF OUR MISSION, NOR CAN YOU TELL DARIAN. DARIAN LOVES YOU AND WOULD NEVER LET YOU COUNTINUE, AS WOULD BE THE REACTION OF YOUR FATHER.' Death whispers in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a whistle from Micheal, he has never seen an elven city, that's what he had told us on the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we staying here?\" Micheal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe look at each other, deciding.</span></div></div>",

Yes! I'll buy <i>everyone</i> a round at the bar!\" Micheal says, jumping down from his horse. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"They don't have bars here but they have ale avaliable if that's what you wish to have. We elves don't often drink the liquid but we keep it for when we have guests.  We prefer Dreamberry wine.\" I say, my eyes shining, I would see my father and beloved Darian again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"DON'T GET TOO HASTY, DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT OUR QUEST!\" Death warns us all, \"AND YOU, MICHEAL, DON'T GET TOO DRUNK AND TELL THEM!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Now I have never gotton so drunk I've let my tounge slip, well except for that one time, but that was a completely different, oh fine I won't get <i>that</i> drunk.\" Micheal says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is a fine young man, and good to have on our side when he isn't too busy searching for ale. Now Shadow on the other hand, well he worries me, Shadow seems like one of the warlocks who want complete world domination, if you get what I'm saying. Death is somewhat an enjoyable fellow, and he isn't a bad person to have on your side either. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWe walk down into the valley, where my father and Darian great us with joy. Darian and I run off together, joyous to see each other once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarian pulls me off to his quarters, \"So what is this quest you're on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In all honesty I have no notion, they came to the town of my mother's and asked for the  best warrior elf there and they choose me. That is all I know, but enough of that. What have you been up to? How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of that matters now that your here.\" He says, wrapping his arms around me and kissing me ever so softly, \"Love, I missed you so, please promise me you'll come back here after your quest, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" I say in a hushed voice and we fall asleep in each other's arms, completely clothed, and rest peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun has barely rosen and I feel a mental prod, \"COME NOW, YOU'VE HAD YOUR NIGHT, IT IS TIME TO LEAVE, AND MAKE SURE TO SAY FARWELL TO YOUR FATHER AS WELL AS DARIAN.\" Death whispers in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and rouse Darian, \"Love, I must leave now.\" I whisper. I kiss his lips lightly and then I walk to my father's quarters, \"Father?\" I call into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Sharla, I was afraid you would not come and see me before you left once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always do father. I love you, I will miss you, goodbye.\" I say hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you sweetheart. Have a good journey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI meet Shadow, a hung-over Micheal, and Death in the town square, \"Are you ready at last, then?\" asks Shadow coldly. At my nod, we walk off into the growing light of morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe soon come to a fork in the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left or Right?\" Micheal, whose hang-over was gone now, asks. Which way should we go?</span></div></div>",

That was my curse. The witch had made me sickly addicted to Rum. I need it to live. It is not the hardest drink to come by but it is the worst of all the drinks. No bright side to it.

I need food and Rum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard a rustle coming from the bushes in front of me.

The emblem on their shields was the emblem of the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE KING! A GOOD FRIEND OF YOURS.\" chuckled Death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king had been the reason Michael had this curse on him. Michael had been the king's most trusted scout and messenger and secretly a spy. When the king's daughter fell ill the king went insane. He spent every gold piece in the treasury looking for a cure and then when medicine failed he resorted to magic. And that's why Michael was sent to talk to the witch. Rumor had it that she could even bring the dead back to life and so the king sent Michael to talk to her. What the king failed to realize was that a witch that is as powerful as her wouldn't have amassed that much knowledge and power without sacrificing her soul in return and that left her with a thirst for magic and no soul or mercy inside. Either way when she saw him she didn't even bother listening. Just cursed and cast him away. Since that day he hasn't returned to the king and he's been hunting the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AREN'T YOU GOING TO ATTACK?\" whispered Death greedily. The prospect of somebody dying and him adding a life to his collection was something that always made Death happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not stupid enough to attack five armed men alone.

I found myself at the town common in some unnamed hamlet with little else to describe it save a tiny well, so I sprinted to the well, scooped out handfuls of water, and splashed it all over my face, one vengeful thought coursing through my drunken skull: Drown the little buggers!<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed contentedly as I plopped down next to the well and tilted my head to one side, to drain my ear of any remaining ant corpses.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sat there for a moment, deciding whether or not the trees would stop spinning around me before I vomited, when I realized the townsfolk had taken a keen interest in me.  I was used to such rude awakenings in strange surroundings, and had exhibited such behavior for many months, and I was familiar with the Blood Wine hangover.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The townsfolk, however, seemed much less in a fair mood about my vulgar display.  They gawked and sneered, keeping to the far end of the road as they passed.  A few snickered to themselves, most likely, but I was far too hungover to hear any disparaging comments they might have made -- especially since I had heard them all before.  The first thing I lost to my addiction was pride; I cared not.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What's that, you might ask, addicted to Blood Wine?  Impossible!  The very thought of drinking such a vile concoction made many a sturdy stomach turn; nobody gets addicted to something that is guaranteed to make them hurl.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This, of course, is a very true and obvious statement.  One that I am all too familiar with.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There is no excuse for my burden, and I never give one, for no one would believe me anyway.  I am pitied, abhorred, a laughingstock.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am also cursed.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, of course!  A curse, you say.  That makes sense; I mean, who would drink Blood Wine <b>willingly</b>?  But then... who would be so devilish as to curse someone with a Blood Wine addiction?  A low blow indeed.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And there is a story to that, one which I will soon explain, but first I deemed it necessary to find my clothes -- the townsfolk were getting snarky.</span></div></div>",

But what I really wanted was the tavern.  Every town had a place for its populace to meet and drink, and it had to be nearby because I was too swilled to walk very far.  To my left was a small, shack-like structure that looked about as solid as a chicken coop, and its windows were open to allow the urine odor to properly vent.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tavern.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though it hurt my bare knees, I increased my pace until I was sheltered by its overhanging roof.  No sign adorned its facade, maybe folks just used their nose.  Another nameless addition to this unremarkable burgh.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luckily enough, my belongings were together in a relatively neat pile by the front door, though one boot hung precariously from the roof's edge.  I plucked it free and shook out the vermin before returning it to its rightful place upon my foot, then inventoried the rest: a short bow with about a dozen arrows, three daggers kept hidden under my belt, a heavy skin containing bountiful coin, and a crummy sword that I rarely used but kept out of spite regarding its true owner -- the king.  I was once King Heddenforth's Royal Bowman to His Majesty's Official Huntsman, which is a lot like being a page, except instead of toiling for a knight, I generally just skinned what the Official Huntsman shot and killed in the king's name.  The sword was merely an honorary thing bestowed upon me, and I was supposed to return it when my Blood Wine curse effectively got me fired.  I kept the sword, however, on principle.  I felt I had been wrongly dismissed, and as soon as I found a way to cure my curse, I would have my old job back and, of course, my sword which bore my title.  It was practical, really, not stubborn, to keep it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I slung the scabbard around my hip and breathed in the morning air... or perhaps it was afternoon by this point.  I needed to get my bearings.</span></div></div>",
