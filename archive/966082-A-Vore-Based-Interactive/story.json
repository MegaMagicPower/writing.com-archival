So the snake wasn't lying!

In his charming tone, the serpendine hissed, \"At first, I thought you wouldn't beleive me... but I could've always gotten another meal.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" she glanced at him suspiciously, swishing her fluffy tail.

This man had tricked her and was planning on eating her when he came back! She only had a little time, but with those cuffs around her ankles... Thankfully, a thief always comes prepared and she had hidden a lockpick on her person before heading up to the mansion. With her eyes darting to the doorway, just in case the serpent came back, she began to hastily work at the locks of those cuffs. She just needed a little more time and some concentration, then maybe she could get some payback for this betrayal.

Fred bared his antlers for the world to see, the dark brown molted fur shortened in patches on his neck, he luckily had several bellies in which to fill, but since an unknown stranger donated the former deer to the Lilith association, he had no observations.

And with as few as you have, if your friends start disappearing, chances are you won't be getting any others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Besides... With that 'partner' of yours coming to work together on your project later... Let's just say you'd rather not spoil your appetite. Biting your tongue, your hope your stomach quiets down, and just try to concentrate on the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A couple of hours and more than a handful of games later, though, he's still nowhere in sight. Chances are he's ditched you, just out of spite, knowing that you need the grade enough to do the project on your own without him... Not knowing that you'll pay him back afterward, of course, in a way that will make him regret ever bothering you. ...For the few minutes he'll have left, at least. But for now, you have a bit of a problem- Jeremy's starting to get hungry himself, not to mention your own constantly-rumbling gut. It's hard to think of anything BUT food, now. And as your friend stands, glancing nervously at you and mumbling something about getting something from the kitchen, you stand too- to get something yourself, truth be told...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething a bit more lively.</span></div></div>",

The evil beast looked human, but he was most likely a demon. The demon was tall, had black and red streaked hair, and wore black clothes. He could summon black balls with red rings that had spikes on them and fire at them at will. And he never ran out! His name was Lord Axis. He had proven to be a nuisance in all worlds, even those Klonoa had not ever gone too. The last time a bad guy of this magnitude was around was when the Dark Overlord, a ruler of Darkness and a race called Shadows, tried to conquer all worlds and realms. <br>\r\n     Klonoa finally scored a lucky hit and shot the pendant that Axis had over his heart. When it shattered, Axis fell. That pendant gave Axis his powers and immortality. Axis began to grow shriveled up. He was 500 years old after all. He grew sick looking and thin.<br>\r\n     \"Why?\" he said in a weak old voice. \"I shall get my revenge Klonoa. Even in death, I shall strike back. Powers of Darkness, here my plea. Bind my evil to the soul of he!\" Axis collapsed, dead. Klonoa turned around, pitying how he had to kill Axis in order to protect others. He hated killing. He walked home, but did not notice a black orb hovering above Axis's corpse, which had dissolved into ash. The black ball zoomed behind Klonoa and went into his back. Klonoa cried in pain for a few seconds.<br>\r\n     \"I guess he was right when he said he could strike back in death.\" Klonoa said. He headed home. He lived alone. He was bored. He could invite a few friends over. Ever since the Dark Overlord incident, he had a new item. It was something the Overlord had given him when he turned good. It was an object that allowed him to visit the real version of dream realms. The Dark Overlord had caused problems all over, from Kinetica(My personally created planet.) to Mobius to Lunatea to Sonic-Earth to Hyrule to Jak and Daxter's planet, and much more. He decided to invite Guntz, Popka, Lolo, Tat, Huepow, Crimson and Aquarius.<br>\r\n     After they all arrived, Huepow was sitting on the couch talking to Klonoa while everyone else had gone elsewhere. Klonoa looked at him strangely. His mouth began to water. He snapped out of it. 'He's your friend, you can't eat him.' a voice said in his head. Another said, 'Come on, he looks good.' Klonoa then. . .</span></div></div>",

Crimson can change his shape, body, colors, and voice. He cannot change his mass, however. He shows up when Klonoa is warped to Kinetica, a planet similiar to Earth. Klonoa has been framed by Crimson, and Klonoa is brought before Lord Alexander Kazati for a trial. Crimson eventually turns good once the Dark Overlord is defeated, and is given a gift by the D.O.(Dark Overlord), who also turned good. He is given a permanent form, and with permission from Klonoa, keeps his real form, which looks like Klonoa. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    For a pic of Crimson, go here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19560158/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1956...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Aquarius: Aquarius is a blue cat who posseses a ring that controls water.

As he took a shower, he thought about what to do. He could tell Aquarius, his brother who was bisexual, who also lived in this mansion that their grandfather had owned before he died. He could also invite Klonoa, who had been given the Key to Realms by the Dark Overlord, which allowed Klonoa to visit the real version of all the Dream Realms he had visited.

Thanks to the \"assistance\" of your followers you had at last been set free into the Digital World, free to begin the process of \"cleansing\". In the ancient past your powers had ended a great war, but if used correctly your powers could inflict damage far greater than any such battle; the destruction of the Digital World would be a swift thing. As he lifted high on your eight wings you gazed across the endless sky, taking in the flawed curropt world around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a final deep breath, casting off the slight fatigue from your awakening, you prepared to begin your objective. It was at this time you were struck by a feeling you had all but forgotten.

However your will was absolute and you forced down your hunger for the moment. Indeed it was only fitting that those whom had fought so hard to prevent your revival be the first to fill the void. There was little doubt that they were aware that you had finally been set free and so you decided to first send them a beacon to follow. Beautiful fresh air burst by as you soared high on your eight wings, quickly surveying for a suitable location. Nearby was a small village populated by approximitly one hundred digimon, mostly rookies, and it stood out as the perfect point. The distant movements of the many digimon once more sent a pang of hunger through your body but you reminded yourself that you would have a far more satisfying meal once this was completed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowed your ascent the powers of light and creation began to surround your body, focusing into your right palm. Soon it formed into a sphere within which could be a seen a mirror image of the universe itself, the Grand Cross. As you halted in mid-air you flung the ball downward towards the unsuspecting village. Moments later a massive explosion erupted in the village center, consuming many of the towns buildings. Indeed the ball had been small but it was formed of highly compressed creation energy; the big bang squeezed into the palm of your hand. There was no need to pick off the digimon fleeing from the town, afterall you needed witnesses to relate the story, but nevertheless you tossed down a second Grand Cross. The powerful explosion vaporized a number of digimon, their data rushing up on the winds to absorb into you.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one is sealed away patience is generally the first virtue that they learn and so waiting for the Chosen Children to arrive was not so large an issue. It was likely that they were planning an ambush however your vantage point had enabled you to make out the group of humans long before they came into sight of the village, it was time to make yourself known. With a slight smile you descended at high speed and stopped directly in front of them, wind from your wings blowing against the humans. \"Well well, I'm glad you finally made it. I was surprised at how well you handled Cherubimon and my knights, but I won't be quite so easy to deal with.\" The humans had obviously not expected you to appear so soon and all of them reached for their D-Tectors in unison. In this instant you had the time to stop any one of them. You knew well you mental warfare and decided that there was only one choice for your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoki's D-Tector clattered to the ground as you rushed at him with your full speed and grasped tightly to his shoulders. The other tamers gasped, stalling for a moment, however they quickly realized that it was more important to evolve than to react to the attack. As the humans began to change you opened your mouth wide and pulled Tomoki upward, shoving his head snugly into your mouth. It would have been wise to first remove his hat however there was little time for this and you were instant content to taste the fabric rather than his hair. Occasional hints of his organic matter made it through however, and at the very least you could fully taste the skin of his face. There was little time to savor the sweet taste, your enemies were almost ready to begin their full assault, and you widened your throat as fast as possible. It was amazing to the tamers how fast their young friend vanished one moment he was there, though his head was obscured by your stretched cheeks, and in the next he was gone. Turning about you gave a wide smile as Tomoki's face was visibly pressing out against your expanded belly, his face locked in a scream, before he was fully sucked down into your lower intestines. In an instant your belly returned to normal, Tomoki fully dissolved, and you gave it a soft rub. \"That will be that fate that befalls each and every one of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fury the other children entered their spirit forms and rushed at you in a barrage of attacks. A ball of fire burst to your left and you quickly flitted above it, directly into the path of a dark wave. A slight pain echoed through your upper body as the attack struck you, but it was altogether meaningless. Instead you turned to shake your head. As you did this you noticed that Fairymon was now descending over you behind first. You were familiar with her Arid Hug attack however it's charm effects were useless upon a power such as yours, nevertheless you dodged to the side. Now in the clear it was your turn to counter attack, but you needed to decide whom would be your next meal. The darkness user struck you as particularly tasty looking though eating their leader, even if he was unspoken, would demoralize them further. Lastly there was Fairymon. There were many ways to eat someone and her attack had reminded you of one that might be especially fitting. It did seem a tad indignate but at the same time the irony and sheer horror of your enemies would be the sweetest thing of all.</span></div></div>",

She could unbirth people.  Unbirth, also known as gential vore, was something of a rarity.  Only one out of 100,000 girls could unbirth someone.  Officer Jenny used her gift to stop criminals...and have the BEST orgasms of her life.  However, she never unbirthed anyone under the age of 18 (hey, she's an Officer of the law) and most people liked being in Jenny's womb.  The person in the womb would be connected to Jenny via an umbicial cord and live for days if need be inside the womb.  Criminals hated being in the womb of Jenny, not being able to escape eaily from the prison.  Jenny could give 'birth' to whomever she unbirthed.  <br>\r\n        Today, Jenny was sitting on her motorcycle.  She was bored.  It had been a slow day.  Nobody broke the law, nobody seemed to get unbirthed today.  That is until a certain kid spotted Jenny.  It was Brock, of course, followed by Ash and Misty.  <br>\r\n         \"Oh, it's Officer Jenny!\" yelled Brock.  \"the famous one that unbirths people!\"<br>\r\n        \"Take it easy, Brock\" said Ash.<br>\r\n        The news of Jenny's gift spread throughout  the Indigo League.  It was no surprise for Jenny that some kid would know about her.<br>\r\n         Brock was begging to be unbirthed, but Jenny refused him.  <br>\r\n          \"Excuse me\" said Ash, as Misty dragged Brock away like she does on the show.  \"where's the pokemon gym?\"<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

He is 13, has white skin, black hair, and wears shades in public. That is due to how the look in his eyes which are red seem to scare people, as his hometown in China taught him. He  tells everyone his eyes are sensitive to light, and he rarely speaks, while in human form at least. He also wears a red shirt, has black pants, and has shoes that are black and red. He wears a black jacket that has a black chinese dragon with red outlines in a curled up shape on the back. <br>\r\n   His grandfather/dragon master is the Dark Dragon. Drake is the dragon of Darkness and Sin. He also is the bearer of the Seal of Destruction, which is the Greek letter Omega colored red in a red circle burned into both his palms. His sister, Vira, is the dragon of poison and pollutants. And his distant cousin, Mana Lee, is the bearer of the Seal of Creation, which is the Octagram of Creation in a circle burned into his palm. Mana also is an expert healer and helps Jake. <br>\r\n    Drake in dragon form is very similiar to his human form. He is black and muscular. His eyes are completely blood red with no iris or pupils. His underbelly is yellow. The Seal of Destruction in his palm dissapears, while it reappears on the back of his hands and a large Seal appears in the middle of his back. The seal is in red color when he is a dragon. There are red spikes going down his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Now, on to the story. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Drake was busy going through books in his grandfather's lair, trying to find a way to defeat the American Dragon. Even his true master, the Dark Overlord, a powerful being who was sealed inside another realm and the master of a race of monsters called Shadows, could not give him assistance. The whole reason Drake wanted to kill Jake(Jake has the Seal of Existance, which recently appeared on his palm.)and Mana was so he could obtain their seals, open the Dark Gate, and allow his master's servants entrance into this world. Then the world would be sucked into the Dark Dimension, where the Dark Overlord could rule it with more ease, since his own realm was easier to control. Drake found no success.<br>\r\n    \"I'm stronger than that damned American  Dragon! But becuase of the traitors of the Lee Clan, the Shen Clan cannot defeat him!\" </span></div></div>",

I think...\" He trails off, looking at her in the eye \"I think someone is eating them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa looks at him, realizing he's serious and trying the best she can not to burst into laughter, but then stops and looks at Kurz up and down.

As she got down to his torso, she pushed on his bottom as hard as she could with pleasure and a grin. He struggled more and more, but she loved the feeling it was giving her as he weakly tried to escape, finally with one last gulp, she finished off down to her boots, letting out a massive belch and leaning back up against the wall feeling oh so satisfied, patting a massive bloated stomach from her fresh meal. She had never felt so wonderful in her entire life. If someone was eating the ships crew members, she didn't blame them. It was absolutely heavenly. She unbuttoned her cargo pants with another burp, letting her stomach bloat out to its full size, rubbing it happily and contendedly. The strange thing being, even though she looked stuffed, she was still hungry. This could be fun. She stood. It would be alot more difficult to sneak around now, but now that she satisfied her hunger, she needed to hide more than ever. She looked down the hall to see a Shadowy figure making their way to the restroom...</span></div></div>",

Kai looked at himself, and blushed when he realized he was naked, his privates in clear view. He also felt something odd just above his butt. He looked behind, and saw a long, black furry feline tail. It had crimson stripes.

He breathed heavily for a bit, then sighed. \"It was all a dream...\" Rei said smiling. Then his eyes shifted to his body, he was wearing only undergarments, he was naked besides the boxers he was wearing. His eyes went wide open, he saw..was that a bite mark on his shoulder? No, it couldn't be...He then looked on his arm, his leg, bite marks everywhere. He was paralyzed with fear.<br>\r\n     \"B-But it was a dream...\" he said silently.
