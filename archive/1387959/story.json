He now had A-cup moobs, though they where hardly there. His butt was very... flat compairitively to the rest of him, though it made him slightly taller when sitting.

He had three chins, and a start of a fourth, with the rest of his face being rounder. His arms where big, and where kind of annoyong to move around. His legs where huge, looking more like tree trunks. if he walked, you see the, jiggle with fat. His thighs where mot much better, making him 5 1/2 feet from side to side. His butt was also very bis, takong up the entirety of the chair he used. His most dominant feature: his belly. It was 3 feet in front of him, went down to his knees, and jiggled when Lucario breathed.(he really liked that) Heck, his moobs where now C-cup, and bounced when he walked. As the new fatty left the store to mew's house, he found it hard to walk. He was heavy for one thing, and his legs made him waddle. his belly had to be pushed up to walk, because he could not force himself past the huge mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, this is GREAT! I feel so soft, and very warm! I want to keep this stuff!</i> He thought, and that's before he stopped on a store: Fattys R Us.

He grabbed the plate and licked the plate of any scraps, whipping it clean.

His arms had become heavy and it was difficult to grab food and put it to his mouth, so he took asuggestion from Mewtwo and used his poweres to eat the food.

And how did you know I liked fat Pokemon so much?\" said Mew, through a hose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo, Lucario, and Mew (who had insisted on being a part in this), were strapped down on tables. Mew had a controller nearby (which she could operate with her psychic powers), and the tables, contoller, and aforementioned hose (there was one in each of their mouths, actually) were connected to a massive machine with more gibbets, odds, ends, creases, folds, etc, than a seven-ended pinapple. \"Yes. Now, i call this the 'Gain-O-Matic'. I made it when i was trying new things, but never had a chance to actually use it before. It basically feeds us a mixture of a formula designed to instantly fatten us (while sending our tastebuds on a pleasure cruise), the most fattening foods ever, and this element I discovered last week called 'Fat-Mercury'. It also sends us oxygen so we can breathe. Now, when I say 'Go', Mew, concentrate on activating the controller. Ready? GO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Mew activated teh controller, and a strange-looking viscous goop began flowing into their mouths... and they began gaining! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mewtwo?\" Lucario said, using telepathy. \"What did you set it for?\" </span></div></div>",

The large pile on Mewtwo's end was shrinking fast. His large purple balloon belly, though made like rubber, was being pushed to it's limits as more and more food was inhaled. Lucario was still going at his pace, taking the large chunks and eating them. The pile got smaller and smaller as Lucario's belly got larger and larger. With a few more gulps his belly pushed the table to the floor. But Lucario snatched the plate with his powers. since there were onl a few small piles left he lowered the plated and let the food slide into his mouth. He chewed the food and swallowed it, gulping donw the last of his meal. With a few licks of the plate he had cleaned it off. Lucario let out a satisfied burp, then smiled as he looked at his form. His bodily features were ballooned to huge proportions, his limbs like tree trucks, buttocks like monster truck tires with a bloated tail in between and a belly bloated far outward, laying on the floor standing out in front over several feet from it's master. Lucario patted his belly. \"Good work little guy, now rest for a moment.\" Lacario said with praise. Mewtwo how ever was not resting and had finished the Bigger than Texas deal. He was eating the smallest pile, the mountain meal, sucking it up like a vacuum cleaner. In less than a minute Mewtwo has cosumed the whole thing! Even so, his belly had taken major abuse, grugling and moaning, struggling to keep the massive amount of food in side it. It was ballond out majorly, in a shperical shape, his other body parts ballooned in a comical fashion. \"Ugh, I feel sick, but this pain is nothing compaired to the fruits of victory.\" \"Not so fast...\" Lucario butted in \"...You forgot about dessert!\" \"*gulp* Dessert!?\" Snorlax then came out, wheeling a cart with a huge bowl of special whipped ice cram. Mewtwo want to ask for dessert as well, but his belly was in far too much pain for that. \"Oh, I've lost!\" Snorlax wheeled the cart next to Lucario. \"Here it is, dig in!\" This time instead of multiple gulps Lucario consumed it in one big swallow! He sucked down the cream like a giant drain in no time! In a matter of seconds the cream was down Lucario's throat and into his belly. It was now ballooned enormously, bloated up to over twelve feet out. It had a half circle shape, like some rising sun. It gurgled and rumbled loudly, indicating it was done. \"You did a great job belly, thanks!\" Cheered Lucario as he let out a huge burp. The crowd that had gathered over the coarse of the contest to watch the showdown cheered widely. Mewtwo looked at Lucario and sigh \"Heh, I guess you win.\" \"Yep, guess Mew's goona be spendin' time with me now.\" \"Oh no you don't this is not over yet, just wait till tommorow!\" \"When nobody's going anywhere til they pay the bill!\" Said snorlax strongly. \"B-bill?\" The two bloated competitors said together. \"Yeah, you boys did bring money right?\" \"MONEY!?\" Said Mewtwo and Lucario, looking at each other with flushed faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mew was busy finishing up her magazine when the phone rang.

Not only that then have no dough to pay for they're meals, so unless you want them to be my restuarants mascots I suggest you get down here right away.\" \"Ok, I'll be there.\" Mew said in a dissappointed voice as she hung up the phone. Mew grabbed her ruby red purse, and floted to the middle of the living room. \"Ugh, what have those two done this time?\" She said disgruntedly as she teleported away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teleported to the front doors of the restuarant, letting out a long sigh. \"Ok, once again they went Johnny Knoxville on me and did something stupid. Just act cool, give the restuarant owner the money, then straggle those two when we get home!\" She pushed the doors open and floated into the main dining area. \"Alright you two ju...\" Before Mew could finish her sentence she saw Lucario and Mewtwo, sitting on the floor belching and rubbin they're bellies. Mew suddenly felt, shocked, angered, and even more outraged, but also felt a sense of futher sexuality between the two. Her love for fat pokemon had always been her dirrty little secret: she didn't want others except other legendaries that she had a fat fetish. She was day dreaming of rubbing they're bloated stomachs and kissing them, but her thoughts were interupted by someone tapping her shoulder. \"Um, my money please.\" Snoralx said. \"Ok, how much?\" Snorlax whipped out his old calculator and started punching in numbers. \"Well, The fox guy ate a Large/in charge and a Bigger then Texas meals plus an extra large desert. Your clone buddy over there had the two meals plus the moutain man deal. And Lucario broke a chair so that sets you back $1,578 dollars short.\" \"1,578 dollars!?\" \"Sorry, that's how the cookie crumbles.\" Mew fidddled around in her purse and got out a  thousand dollar bill plus 5 hundreds, 7 tens, and 8 ones. \"Here's your change.\" Mew said in a grumbled voice. \"Thank you, come agian\" snorlax replied in a friendly tone. \"Don't bet on it...\" Mew grumbled back. she floated over to her two bloated boyfriends. \"Urp, hi Mew.\" Lucario said in a friendly but nervous voice. \"Oh, sorry about the mess.\" Mewtwo replied. Mew let out another long sigh. \"Just drop it. Lets take you guys home, clean you up, and set you two to bed. We can argue in the morning.\" Mew then flaoted between the two massive slob blobs and teleported them back to her house. As she teleported, she was thinking about her friends new found weight. Though on the outside she looked tired and defeated inside she felt absolutly giddy. \"Oh man,  hate them for what they did but now they look so sexy, especially Lucario, no Mewtwo. Oh, if only I could share it with them.\" And with that she got an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Lucario and Mewtwo were resting in the living room, sleeping off they're huge feast. Mew, quietly spying on them, picked up her cellphone and dial a number. The phone on the other end rang loudly, slowly waking up...</span></div></div>",

All righty then here you go and with a wave of Jirachi's Mew started to gain weight. Her stomach started to bloat out with fat and flab and had enough love handles for both Lucario and Mewtwo love. Surprisingly her tail didn't gain but her butt definitely did. If you wanted to see her tail with the amount of flab that is on her behind, lets just say it would be easier to find a hay colored needle in a haystack. Her cheeks are so puffed out that she can't see anything from the right or left of her. Her arms and legs look like deflated monster truck tires. When its all said and done Mew look like a cute pink blob. Thanks Jirachi for doing this, said Mew. No problem but can you do me a favor. Sure what is it. Never call me this late again.

It's stripes where in a pattern: Black white, black white, like bands all around his body. His four twig-like fingers and three stubby toes were black, his horns and tail following the pattern of his body. One eye was white, surrounded by a black patch while the other was black surrounded by a white patch. This strange creature was Charley Zimmer, famous FA and story writter, as well as movie lover. He slowly woke up, wiggling and rubbing his eyes. He sat up and mindlessly fimbled his hands around til he found the phone. He picked it up and put it to his ear. \"Hello?\" \"Charley, you there?\" \"Uh, whose there?\" \"Don't you remember me?\" Charley scratched his head a second, then it came to him. \"Mew!?\" \"Yes!\" \"Oh hey Mew, been a long time since you called, why you waking me up?\" Mew then explained everything as quickly and as clearly as she could in great detail. \"So, the boys were at it again?\" \"uh-hu.\" \"And you want me to come over there bcuz...\" \"Because I wanna show them I love them both equally, can you help me do it?\" \"Sue thing!\" Charley said, snapping his fingers. \"I'll be there before you can say, bye!\" And with that Charley hung up the phone. Mew rubbed her hands together, smiling from ear to ear. \"Now all I have to do is wait..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew waited for about thirty minutes, starting to grow impatient. \"Oh, where is he?\" She then saw headlights shine though the forest. \"oh good, hes here!\" An old, rusty tanker truck, a 55 Peterbilt to be exact, roared out of the forest with Charley behind the wheel. It was hauling an old tank, with the word 'Flammable' written in faded letters on the sides and back. \"Oh boy..\" Mew said smiling, shaking her head side to side \"...so typical of Charley.\" The truck soon came to a stop and Charley turned the key, making the engine slow then stop, becoming quiet. As the motor and brakes hissed lightly, Charley climbed out of the cab. 'So, what do you think? Huh, HUH?\" Mew but her hands to her sides. \"I think you've been watching too many movies Charley.\" \"In some ways, NOT ENOUGH!\" Chuckled the striped being as it jumped off the truck. \"So, this what you got?\" Mew said as she floated next to Charley. \"Yep, this what I got.\" Said Charley as he walked down the side of the tank. \"Hmm, doesn't look like much.\" \"Oh baby, this stuff is podent!\" He said with flare as he rubbed the tank. \"So what is this mixture yo got in there?\" \"Liquid butter, cooknig oil, grease, a few other household chemicals, and the proper perportions.\" Mew laughed lightly at his last comment. \"Ok, set it up.\" \"Ok, if you say so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew put a tube into her mouth, gribbing it lightly with her jaw. \"Now, you sure you don't wanna back down?\" Mew gave him a fierce flare. Charley let out a light sigh, he was a little worried just how BIG the effects were gonna be. \"Ok, don't say I didn't warn you..\" He then turned the wheel on the side of the tank, opening up the valves.

Lucario on the other hand was stuck, unable to move around, the fat ancoring him down. \"Um, a little help please?\" \"Oh, sure.\" Mewtwo used some more of his mental energy to lift Lucario off the ground givving him some movement. \"Oh, thanks.\" \"No, problem.\" Soon the floated out the front door, calling for Mew by name. \"Mew?\" \"MEW?\" \"Mew?\" \"MEW...\" Mewtwo freezed. He mentally tapped Lucario on the shoulder. \"What, wha...\" Looking up, the two saw Mew. They found her all right, a very BIG her! Her belly and body where bloated out of preportions! Her belly was enormous, bigger then a balloon in a parade. It's big pink mass quivered lightly, degesting it's belly busting meal. Mew's buttocks were huge, each three times the size of monster truck tires. Her tail surprisingly absorbed little fat, but as a result had been swallowed by her butt cheecks. Her legs were like to big round balls on each side, swallowing her feet. Her arms were in a similar state, though they were each bloated like two balls with tiny, nearly swallowed hands at the ends. Her back was hugely bloated and her neck was swallowed in three extra chins. Her cheeks were extremely puffed up, giving her the look of a squirrel with it's cheeks filled wth nuts almost to the max(It's kinda easy to imagine since Mew looks like  a squirrel anyway). She giggled softly, her quivering mass shaving like a blob of Jell-O. \"M-mew, you ok?\" Asked Lucario as he and Mewtwo both starred wide-eyed. With that question Mew used her powers to float them up over to her level, since her back streched to acomidate her new form. The floated up the peaks of the mountain known as Mew until her were settled down near the peak, on Mew's large chest, staring at her bloated head and neck. \"Mew, is that you?\" Asked Mewtwo. \"Yes, it is.\" She let out another giggled, making her fat quiver more. \"I, don't understand you...\" Before Lucario could finish Mew butted in. \"Well, seeing you to guys bloated just got me running wild. I wanted you guys to understand I love you both the same, You each have qualities that I like, and I don't see how you can't share.\" \"Heh, it's wont be hard...\" Mewtwo retorted \"..there's plenty of you to go around.\" Mew smiled, her eyes giving off they're friendly glow. \"But, now your so huge...\" Said Lucario \"...Are you ever gonna be the same?\" \"Oh, I'm still the same, theres just more of me to love.\" The three of them then just burst out laughing, they bellies jiggling like Jell-O.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the peak above, Charley Zimmer stared at the sight though his binoculars. Seeing them all happy he smiled, leting out his large grin. \"Well..\" He said as he put put his hands to his side, standing in a proud stance \"...Another job well done.\" He said with a wink. </span></div></div>",

His tail, which his pants did have a hole for, was now 25% bigger than normal. His butt was stretching the pants. As Mewtwo stretched down for his belt, he heard a SNAP, as the belt came undone. Now, Mewtwo was 1/5 done with his clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo looked at his legs, both pretty thicker than when he kidnaped lucario. They where not even close to touching, but they wher<br>\r\nre not even close to touching, but they where big none the less. Mewtwo Grabbed a scale, and was now 165 lbs. 35 pounds in one night. And with his nightly check up done. He heads to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nin the morning, day 3<br>\r\nLUCARIO POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario Woke up again, right after that, he sat up in bed, only to hear a SNAP . Looking down, he saw two belts, now on the ground. \"Hello Lucario, looks like you are too fat for a belt.\" Lucario Looked up only to see Mewtwo, witbout a belt, and with a belly. You got fat as well? is it because of guilt?\" Mewtwo scoffed. \"tch, no. I wanted to be mew's fat boy, so that is why you are here. Now, stand up and take a look at yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario did as he was told but had trouble walking, mostly because his fat made it slightly harder to move. \"ah!\" As lucario made his way to the mirror, he saw why it was harder. He had a big belly, moobs, and a Big butt. He sighed, and left the area hoping he could find a way to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEWTWO'S POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo wondered if he would be able to incrase the amount Of food Majorly, or minorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
