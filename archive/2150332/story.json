We'll begin just at eh beginning of chapter 2, where Snack wakes up in the forest. As a note, if you want to progress in the story's main timeline, follow the reserved chapters to jump ahead a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those not familiar with the stories, here's a link!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://aryion.com/g4/view/381834\" target=\"_blank\">https://aryion.com/g4/view/381834</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then...an actual start to the chapter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yawn* I feel great! I thought sleeping out on a tree branch would make me sore, but I feel better than ever. I try to stand up\u2026before I realize that I\u2019m not on the branch. Looking around, I\u2019m floating a few hundred feet in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hell did this happen?! I never made anything about faeries flying in the sky while they sleep. Wait, I did make something like that to a type of faerie\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStatus\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnack<br>\r\nRace: Royal Faerie<br>\r\nOccupation: None<br>\r\nElements: None<br>\r\nLV: 10<br>\r\nExp: 1430<br>\r\nExp to next LV: 70<br>\r\nHP: 800<br>\r\nMP: 13000<br>\r\nAtk: 4<br>\r\nDef: 90<br>\r\nMDf: 111<br>\r\nAgi: 16<br>\r\nMag: 807<br>\r\nInt: 102<br>\r\nLuk: 2<br>\r\nTitle: Creator, Monster Lover, Prey, Black Widow, Annihilator<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026What the hell?! 4 titles and an evolution?! Why are the stats so high?! Even the high class equipment didn\u2019t make me this strong before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, what\u2019s with these titles?! I get monster lover and prey. It comes from being pleasured by a monster and the other is from being eaten alive. But Black Widow? That\u2019s supposed to be for people that kill someone that they pleasured\u2026oh yeah. The snake counts\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Annihilator comes from dealing over twice the damage of a boss monster\u2019s health in a single blow. That explains why the Rainbow Snake was different than normal, it was a boss class monster. Sky Piercer is way too strong\u2026Let\u2019s put a level restriction on it before players start logging in. Let\u2019s say\u2026whatever my level is when the world becomes public. What? I\u2019m not a hypocrite! I need it to survive! If too many people have that kind of destructive power from the start, they might kill me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminds me. What happens if I die? I have things set up so that when players die, they awaken at the last city they visited in a cathedral. Since I\u2019m living in this reality now, dying could be the end of me if I encounter a glitch. Well, I doubt it but I\u2019m not going to test it on purpose. After all, I\u2019m just a petite little fae-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nROYAL FAERIE?! Did I seriously evolve into a Royal Faerie that quickly? I knew that the minimum level for evolution was level 10, but to go for the highest tier of evolution I needed to meet more requirements. Be over level 10? Check. Slay a rare boss class monster? Check. Hold an intensely high level of magic? Check. Have a rare title? Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, I guess I did meet the requirements. But I gotta say, this makes me really happy. Royal Faeries are the rulers of the faerie kingdom and are regarded as the strongest sorcerers in the entire world. Lore says it takes centuries to become a Royal Faerie, but I did it in one day. In fact, a few hours. Although it was more of a coincidence than anything else. My mana is through the roof and my magic power is high enough that I could be considered an intermediate mage. Well, if I unequipped my items I\u2019d only be at apprentice level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in lore, Royal Faeries float in their sleep because they are above everyone. I\u2019m gonna miss the comfort of a warm bed\u2026well, I guess I can tie myself down or stay under the covers to be stationary. Of course I could just stay in a belly. My unconscious levitation wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to lift a predator\u2026right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I\u2019ll figure that out when I get to it. For now, I should focus on living. Since I made a ruckus in Mezra, I should probably make my way to the next village, Anon. I can see the path down below, but I\u2019m still flying over the treetops. As much as I\u2019d love to experience all the monsters on the way to Anon, I\u2019m hungry. If a character doesn\u2019t eat enough, they get a starvation buff which slowly drains health. Plus it doesn\u2019t feel good to be starved. After eating a few berries the size of my head, I\u2019m satisfied enough to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, flying through the air feels amazing! After my evolution, I can fly around 50mph. Not as fast as my giant golem sprinting, but much faster than walking. And I\u2019m barefoot, so walking would hurt my feet. I never saw the point of making high class footwear. Why would a boot make you tougher against a sword slash?! So, while shoes are offered in the game they only offer small buffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to this, many people walk around barefoot. Especially in the amazon country. The most you see from locals are basic cloth footwraps. I love the look of those~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hell, even the woman being cornered by goblins is barefoot. Just the style I like too. Short leather skirt, leather tube top, barefoot. She had short purple hair, a few piercings around her face and light violet eyes. Light touches of dark make-up and black lipstick compliment her features. Her breasts were small, but still pretty nice. It looks like her knife is broken\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOLY SHIT A HOT WOMAN IS IN DANGER!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops. Sorry. Got a little excited there. I shouldn\u2019t be so surprised, random encounters like this are common. But GOD this one is hot. She\u2019s got a real punk look to her. Like she\u2019d be a total bitch to me. Like she\u2019d try to make me a slave. Like I\u2019d have to lick her feet and call her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping down, I activate my new skill &lt;Camouflage&gt; to remain hidden. Her situation is worse than I thought. She has a large cut across her smooth stomach and is bleeding badly. Her broken knife is tossed to the side and is fighting the goblins with her bare hands. There were two dead already, but the other three had surrounded her and were trying to cut her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five of the goblins were males, so I have no problems killing them. How can I tell? Fool! The males wore simple loincloths while females wore a top piece to cover their small breasts. Why would I make any species male only? I wanted to make the entire world female only, but the stupid company said it would be discrimination\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, time to be a hero. I deactivate camouflage to save on MP and pull out Sky Piercer. I point at the human girl and cast &lt;Heal&gt;. Her wound began to slowly mend itself, but stopped short. I guess that\u2019s the extent of a single heal spell. If I cast a few more, then she should be completely healed. But at least her life isn\u2019t in danger anymore. But the goblins are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cast &lt;Fire&gt; on one of them. The hot blue flames killed him instantly. It didn\u2019t even have time to scream. For the next one I tried &lt;Ice&gt;, which resulted in the monster being completely encased in ice. After a few seconds, it shattered. Lastly, &lt;Thunder&gt; seemed fun. From the clear sky a bolt of lightning struck the small monster. Its body was charred to a crisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Skill \u201cFire\u201d has leveled up to Lv2&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Skill \u201cIce\u201d has leveled up to Lv2&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Skill \u201cThunder\u201d has leveled up to Lv2&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Snack has reached level 11&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Snack has learned High Heal Lv1&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. Maybe I should start using a weaker wand. It\u2019s practically stupid how overkill I am to these beginner monsters. Well, at least the hotty is safe. Speaking of which, she hasn\u2019t noticed me yet. It\u2019s kinda cute the way she\u2019s looking around like nature itself saved her. Well, let\u2019s show her a hero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026you\u2019re still hurt. May I heal you?\u201d I ask. I lower myself a few inches from her nose so she can see me clearly. It takes her a few seconds, but her violet eyes fix on me. But she just stares silently. \u201cMiss? May I heal you? I know I did it without asking the first time, but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026a faerie? Who do you belong to?\u201d she asks, sounding bewildered. Her eyes had shifted, focusing on my slave brand. I suppose I do look odd. A slave branded faerie wearing only a sexy ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t belong to anyone anymore\u2026\u201d Technically true. I want my character to appear to be an ex-slave that enjoys serving others despite having enormous power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Well, if you\u2019re offering then I\u2019ll accept your help.\u201d She\u2019s not what I expected at all. Instead of being an overconfident bitch she\u2019s actually a cool, calm person. Well, since I offered my assistance I might as well try out that new spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c&lt;High Heal&gt;\u201d I say. Waving my wand, the adventurer became my test subject for my healing magic. She cringed as the wound sizzled and steamed as it closed. In seconds, the horrendous gash was gone without a trace. Her stomach is pretty toned\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. The pain is completely gone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s no trouble. If anything, I wish I could\u2019ve helped before you were injured!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what do you want?\u201d Her face completely changed. She was looking at me like some kind of scam artist. <br>\r\n\u201cN-nothing! If you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026\u201d I say, floating back down the path. <br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast.\u201d Her hand snatches me out of the air and holds me in a tight grip. I weakly struggle in her grip, but it\u2019s just for show. The pain of getting the air squeezed from my lungs always feels so nice~ Not to mention, there\u2019s no way I could get out without killing this girl. My strength stat is so low that one of her hands could probably crush me to death\u2026if I wasn\u2019t equipped with high class armor. I told you, it\u2019s armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026miss? You\u2019re hurting me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you save me? Surely you had a goal in mind. Money? Honor? Perhaps you wanted my body?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! I just couldn\u2019t stand back and watch someone get hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026You have to be joking\u201d she said flatly. Her cold eyes don\u2019t change as she squeezes me tighter. It takes all my willpower not to cry out in pleasure.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would a runaway slave save a human? It makes no sense.\u201d Oh, that\u2019s right. My character should hate humans, since they were the main slavers of the world. The brand on my leg is also the sign of human property. By all means, my character should hate all of humanity.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026weren\u2019t the one\u2026who did\u2026this\u2026to me\u2026\u201d I wheeze out. My HP is still at max, but getting air in my lungs is still hard. She looks sternly at me for a few more moments before finally loosening her grip. She\u2019s still gripping me firmly, likely believing I\u2019d run away. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an odd one. While I am thankful, I refuse to allow myself to be in debt to someone. Tell me, what can I do for the equivalent of my life?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me. I will not stay in your debt. I will provide you with anything you wish in exchange for your assistance.\u201d Is she seriously giving me, a pervert, a blank check? I can ask for anything at all. Maybe I could ask her to eat me. I miss the warmth of flesh\u2026but I just experienced it yesterday. Let\u2019s go for something small.<br>\r\n\u201cW-well\u2026if you truly insist\u2026maybe just a\u2026small\u2026kiss?\u201d That\u2019s good. Just a small reward from a maiden. But her face gets red and she tightens her grip again. <br>\r\n\u201cA kiss? Is my life something that insignificant to you?! I told you to tell me an equivalent!\u201d Shit. I offended her, big time. Well, she said she wanted something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Snack ask for?</span></div></div>",

She had been waiting for over an hour for her new game to install. \"Mythrios Unleashed\" was a new bestseller that hit the market a week earlier. She was a little hesitant to get it due to the rumors of the creator being paralyzed while playing, but her friend Elizabeth talked her into it. She was a bit of an oddball, but she usually had good taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she needed to clear over 100 GB from her computer in order to fit the large game on it. It seemed excessive, but it was due to all the content that the game had. From what she found on the forums, it was just like real life. There were dozens of races, the NPCs had actual personalities, and hundreds of undiscovered skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the game was still unknown since it only recently came out. She read a news story that someone tried hacking into the system to try and pull out more information. His character was deleted while he was playing, and it took three days to safely pull his mind back together. That was one of the dangers of virtual reality. But she wasn't a hacker, so she didn't have anything to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter plugging in the virtual reality helmet, her vision faded to black. Soon after she was taken to the loading screen. After selecting a NEW GAME, she was moved to the character customization. There were over a dozen options for races! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking over the list, she chose...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once her ethnicity was selected, Amanda got to work designing her avatar. She started with giving herself a light tan skin tone. Sleek, black hair that fell halfway down her back. Dark brown eyes with flicks of gold in the iris. Then she worked the sliders to give her body a slightly pear shaped body. Modest breasts, slim waist, and big hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she added a few decorations. A tattoo of a black stripe from the center of her lower lip to the bottom of her chin. Small golden piercings on the edges of her eye brows. Blush and eyeliner makeup, not much, but enough to accentuate her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe confirmed her appearance and the screen faded to black. The next thing she saw was a blind fold being removed from her eyes. Amanda looked around swiftly. She was sitting in a wagon with several other woman. All were wearing thin harem outfits with their hands and feet in chains. Amanda included. The wagon was being pulled by some monsters that looked like bison, and six guards walked along the sides. Further out, there were large dunes of sand in all directions. The woman sitting next to her turned and spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you're awake!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...what's going on?\"<br>\r\n\"You don't remember? I don't blame you. That guard hit you over the head pretty hard. I can't say how they got you, but we're being sold as slaves to some rich merchant.\"<br>\r\n\"Keep it down!\" a guard yelled. All the women lowered their heads and listened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda did as well, wondering who would make a start like this. But after a few minutes, the wagon stopped and guards began yelling. They were approaching the walls of an enormous city. Marble walls rose over 200 feet up, blocking the view of anything inside. Amanda guessed it would only take another ten minutes before they reached the gate. She took the chance to view her status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda<br>\r\nRace: Human<br>\r\nOccupation: None<br>\r\nElements: None<br>\r\nLV: 1<br>\r\nExp: 0<br>\r\nExp to next LV: 20<br>\r\nHP: 100<br>\r\nMP: 60<br>\r\nAtk: 11<br>\r\nDef: 3<br>\r\nMDf: 2<br>\r\nAgi: 8<br>\r\nMag: 5<br>\r\nInt: 9<br>\r\nLuk: 2<br>\r\nTitle: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a different wave of shouting came from the side. Amanda turned to see a large group of people on horses racing towards the wagon, brandishing swords. The guards tried to defend, but were quickly over run by the numbers. The driver of the wagon took off, leaving the others behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one of the attackers followed close behind and jumped onto the wagon. It was a woman wearing an egyptian style dress that showed a lot of skin. Pulling out a sword, she started slicing at the chains binding the other woman. Amanda was the last one to be freed before she killed the wagon driver with a single swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it came to a stop, the woman jumped off the wagon and all others followed behind her. In the distance, a large group of guards were charging towards them. <br>\r\n\"Quickly, everyone follow me! I can get you into the city safely!\" her savior yelled.<br>\r\n\"No!\" a surviving guard yelled, running up. \"Don't listen to this criminal! She will lead you to execution! Stay here with me, and serve your rightful owner! Loyalty shall not go unnoticed!\" he argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman split into two groups, one going with the woman and the other going with the guard.

Next, she made sure that the body was on slim, but still femininely charming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she started the decorations. Her nails were painted to a blood red. She gave herself geisha style make-up that would look good if she wore a kimono. Obviously that wouldn't be the starting armor, but eventually her look will be complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her character done, she accepted it and the screen faded to black. A few seconds later, a ruck sack was pulled from her head. Looking around, she saw that she was inside a prison cell! A woman wearing a guard uniform glared at her with hate in her eyes. <br>\r\n\"Well, today is your last day as my prisoner. I hope you've had as much fun as I have.

She heard that it was possible for players to get that kind of work, but she just started! Then again, she did feel gratitude towards the NPC for saving her. That adventurer was clearly a high level, and it would have been impossible to fight him off on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the elf, Amanda couldn't help but marvel at the power of VR. This woman was an NPC, considering how Amanda couldn't get a status bar to open on her. But even still, she was simply gorgeous. Long, green hair, sparkling blue eyes, pale skin, and a face that would put most models to shame. Not to mention her curvy body, visible from her elegant robe with a slit over the chest, giving an eyeful of creamy cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't suppose you have...a different type of work I could do?\" Amanda asked nervously. The lovely elf smiled sweetly and patted her shoulder. <br>\r\n\"Not interested in being one of my girl's? Hm, that's a shame. you'd be a popular one. But I do have a few other tasks that you could help me with. Come\" she beckons, moving towards the back. Amanda followed closely behind her, passing over eight armed guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce threw the guarded back door, the atmosphere changes a bit. The decorations seem more luxurious, and the only people around are more guards. Just how well protected is this place? While thinking of that, the elf guides them into a room with a large desk, and enormous vault behind it. She sat down in a cushy chair before prompting Amanda to sit across from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, let me introduce myself. I am Eva Redwood, and welcome to my brothel. Now, you say you're looking for work...but not as a courtesan?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"N-no...thank you for the offer, but I'm trying to be an adventurer...\" Amanda replied meekly. <br>\r\n\"An adventurer?! In that case, there is certainly another task you can help me with...\" she said, seeming more excited than before. \"And do keep in mind, I pay <b><i>much </i></b>better than the guild does...\"<br>\r\n\"W-what do you want me to do?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"No need to be nervous, sweetie.

It makes a wonderful aphrodisiac when properly refined. I'd post the request to the adventurers guild, but they always keep a lot of the materials for themselves. So you job will be to kill it, and bring it back to me\" she explained. <br>\r\n\"That...makes sense. Yeah, sure!\" Amanda agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still in the early stages, so this must be a tutorial mission, right? That means the monster couldn't be too strong. The elven owner gave Amanda a lovely smile as she intertwined her fingers. <br>\r\n\"Wonderful. I shall make the preparations, all you need to do is kill the beast. My employees will handle everything else. I shall have a carriage ready in the hour\" she said happily. <br>\r\n\"Sounds good...but what kind of monster is it?\" Amanda asked.

She gave herself long, white hair that was tied back in a ponytail. Her eyes were set to a sparkling green. With the body proportion sliders, she gave herself moderate breasts, a slim waist, and a large butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to herself, she knew that she made her ideal avatar. There were a few options for decorations and markings, but she decided against it. It never looked natural to her for a character to be glammed out at the beginning. If she wanted to decorate, she'd do it once she was a higher level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she hit the accept button and faded away to darkness once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was a sack being removed from her head. Looking around, she was surrounded by a group of ruffians wearing leather armor. The leader, an asian looking woman, stepped forward with a smirk. <br>\r\n\"Well, we got you into the city as agreed. But here's the thing...we're keeping all your belongings. You should be glad that we even let you live.\" She pauses for a moment, and you have the urge to ask several questions. It's likely that this is a point to ask for information. <br>\r\n\"But wait, how am I going to survive with nothing?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"Not my problem. But if you want some work that isn't strictly legal, come find me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said that, a large man walked up from behind her and punched Amanda straight in the face! Everything went dark again as she passed out. She opened her eyes moments later to find the room empty. <br>\r\n\"I guess this is the start...\" she mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda<br>\r\nRace: Human<br>\r\nOccupation: None<br>\r\nElements: None<br>\r\nLV: 1<br>\r\nExp: 0<br>\r\nExp to next LV: 10<br>\r\nHP: 100<br>\r\nMP: 10<br>\r\nAtk: 10<br>\r\nDef: 8<br>\r\nMDf: 1<br>\r\nAgi: 7<br>\r\nMag: 1<br>\r\nInt: 1<br>\r\nLuk: 7<br>\r\nTitle: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reviewed her stats and information.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that the opening sequence ended, Amanda felt like getting to the first quest. She could finally start the game for real! She walked out of the empty building to the street and looked it up and down. The city felt very medieval. The main roads were cobblestone, while the smaller streets are dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were packed full of people. Beggars sitting on the sides, asking for coins. Mercenaries walking boldly down the street. Shops and stands trying to get more business than everyone else. <br>\r\n\"Wow, this game is so...detailed\" Amanda muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the street corner, she spotted the adventurers guild. With a smile on her face, she ran over quickly. If she was going to get a quest quickly, that would be the place! Once she swung the door open, Amanda was amazed at interior. People of many fantasy races were inside, drinking, telling stories, and grabbing quests from a big board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, noob!\" someone shouted. Looking to her side, Amanda face eye to eye with an angry dark elf. \"You're blocking the entrance\" she said. <br>\r\n\"S-sorry\" she said, stepping out of the way. The woman scoffed and walked past her. It was a bit rude, but she was blocking the exit. So Amanda dropped it and walked to the receptionist. It was a slender cat girl wearing a uniform close to maid clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome! How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n\"I'd like to register as an adventurer!\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent!  I just need 50 gold coins as a registration fee and I\u2019ll issue you a membership card.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...I was just robbed. I have no money.\" The receptionist's smile wavered for a moment, but she recovered. <br>\r\n\"I see, that's awful. If you like, I can issue you a temporary license. It'll only be valid for one quest. Once you complete it, instead of the reward you can use it to pay for the fee. Plus an extra 20 gold coins for the temporary license. So you'll need to take a quest with a reward greater than 70 gold coins.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess I have no choice...\"<br>\r\n\"Great! Here you are\" she said. The cat girl handed Amanda a slip of paper with a lot of notes on it. It listed that she agreed to the terms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with no other choice, Amanda proceeded to the quest board. Most of the beginner quests had little rewards, so she had to look at a few of the tougher quests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was an orc subjugation.  It entailed an adventurer going into the plains outside of town and killing ten orcs. The time limit was three days. Orcs started at level 15, so it would be tough to kill them within the allotted time. But the reward was 100 gold coins. An extra 200 gold coins would be rewarded to anyone that kills the field boss orc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother mission was a troll extermination. It was spotted in the area and was killing the lower level monsters. Trolls were boss class and was around level 30. It would be much harder to kill it, but only one needed to be killed. The reward was 250 gold coins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly seemed the safest. Reports were that an unknown monster had appeared near a lake in the forest. Someone needed to go out and discover the species and report it back to the guild. The reward was exactly 70 gold coins. It felt like a rookie trap, or it could be the standard rookie quest. However, it mentioned that dying meant the quest was an instant failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich quest does she pick?</span></div></div>",

Amanda smiled and rushed out of the guild, failing to hear several other players snicker at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda passed through the city gate by showing her license to the guards. Outside of the gated walls were large plains that span miles. Following the road, Amanda walked for over an hour before she finally reached the forest. It seemed to span even further than the plains, so she used the mini map to guide her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another 45 minutes before Amanda could hear the sound of water. After walking through the last grove of trees, Amanda could see the lake. It had cool blue water that seemed more still than glass.

Sleek, purple hair was the first thing visible. As it rose higher, Amanda could see one large, closed eye. Suddenly, it burst upwards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater splashed all over Amanda and the surrounding area as it burst out of the lake. Amanda shielded herself by turning around. When the downpour stopped, she looked back at her quest target. Her jaw dropped as she stared at the monster in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight purple hair that descended past the shoulders. Smooth pink skin was bare everywhere she looked. Breasts that were bigger than wagons. A trim belly with large hips that met the water just above the waist. A gorgeous face with a single blue eye had a happy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a female cyclops! The water made it just below her belly button, but Amanda guessed she was at least 70ft tall. Honestly, rather than monstrous, this cyclops was beautiful. <br>\r\n\"Haaaaah, I love baths!\" she said to herself, stretching her giant arms. It seemed unaware of Amanda's presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have gotten away...but Amanda was too entranced by the bathing monster to move.  When she took this quest, she never imagined this scenario happening. It must be some kind of fan service to the players. But as she thought this, a blue eye fell upon her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! PERVERT!\" the cyclops squealed. Amanda was shaken out of her trance as an enormous pink hand reached for her. She turned to leave, but was quickly snatched off the ground. The new adventurer was brought before the cyclops's lovely face. Large tears were forming in the giant eye and her lower lip was pouting. It was actually quite the adorable sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you were watching me bathe!\" she accused in a cute voice. <br>\r\n\"I-I didn't mean to! It was an accident!\"<br>\r\n\"Liar!

Please don't cry!\" she said, trying to calm the monster down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cyclops cried for a minute before she finally calmed down.<br>\r\n\"Y-you're a pervert...\" she said, clearly still upset. \"There's only one way to deal with perverts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the Cyclops do to Amanda?</span></div></div>",

A delicate face with a dainty nose and sky blue eyes. Her lips were given a coating of pink gloss. She originally thought to max out the breast size, but the slider went so far, they could become bigger than her body! It looked too comical, so she stopped it once they were a few sizes bigger than her head. A thin waist and trim stomach, followed by wide hips with a shapely rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor any other decorations, she added pink nail gloss to her hands and feet. Also, a small tattoo on her back that looked like a magical symbol. With that, she clicked accept. But instead of being sent to the game, she was taken to another screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, there were a few options for the elf starter, each with different lifestyles. The first one was a city elf. Elves that live in human cities, usually beggars and prostitutes due to human oppression. They weren't given equal rights, and lived hard lives. This start gives a boost to dexterity, but lowers magical talent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one was the classic forest elf. Elves that live together with nature in thick forests. They acted as guardians of nature and fight off invaders. Although smaller villages have a high risk of being attacked and enslaved. This start gives a small boost to magical power, but no stats are lowered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a slave elf. Elves that lost their homes to invaders and taken away as slaves. They have a variety of uses, from pleasure slaves to battle slaves. Either way, they are treated like animals. This start gives a large boost to health, a small boost to attack power, but lowers all other stats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the option of an exiled elf. Elves that committed crimes in their villages and were banished because of it. They can't return to the forest, and have to live their lives without a home. Many become criminals or mercenaries to survive. This start gives no boost, and no demerit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich to choose? </span></div></div>",

Her only other garment was a pair of leather shorts that struggled to hold her meaty rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plump face was still that of a pig's except for neon pink hair that was styled in a mohawk.

Curious of what she looked like, she decided to check the 3rd person camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw her body. It was a small glob of blue slime. She realized why she wasn't able to customize herself. The different species of slimes can be identified by their appearance. The color variations are important, so she couldn't alter her appearance at the beginning. She decided to look at her status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda<br>\r\nRace: Training Slime<br>\r\nOccupation: None<br>\r\nElements: None<br>\r\nLV: 1<br>\r\nExp: 0<br>\r\nExp to next LV: 10<br>\r\nHP: 10<br>\r\nMP: 10<br>\r\nAtk: 1<br>\r\nDef: 0<br>\r\nMDf: 0<br>\r\nAgi: 1<br>\r\nMag: 1<br>\r\nInt: 1<br>\r\nLuk: 2<br>\r\nTitle: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo weak!

It said that it was a beginner slime that was extremely weak, but is raised quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to test it out by moving over to a nearby plant.

It seems Beginner slimes can learn at an accelerated rate this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also decided to see what evolution condition she met. It seems that by gaining a level, she can evolve into a Slime. The standard type of slime. Also, for learning a healing skill, she can become a Lesser Healing Slime.

Curious, she moved through the bushes to remain undetected towards the noise. After a few minute of travelling, she was greeted by the sight of a battlefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few corpses lying around, and two opposing sides were exchanging blows. On one side were three humans. They were all female and seemed to be an adventurer party. They had severe injuries and were probably losing. All three seemed to be warrior classes and didn't have a healer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side were five lizardmen. She couldn't tell the gender of them since they looked like walking alligators to her. They also seemed to be injured, but they were in a half circle trying to defend something. It looked like a nest with several eggs inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like either side could win at any moment. Amanda rushed through the possibilities in her mind on what to do. No matter what, this seemed like a golden opportunity for her. There was lots of stuff for her to eat that she could use to get stronger. She could simply wait until the fight ends and eat the bodies after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she could also help the human women. They were probably on a mission to get those eggs. Since she just gained a healing skill, she could increase its level by healing them. That way, they would win and she could get stronger! Then again, Amanda was technically a monster. They could choose to kill her afterwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option was to help the lizardmen. They were monsters like herself, so it would make sense to heal them and push back the adventurers. Not to mention they were just trying to protect their offspring. In a certain light, the humans were the ones in the wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a devious thought came to mind. She could sneak around all of them and take the eggs for herself. What kind of powers could she gain by eating those? </span></div></div>",

It must have understood her intentions, as it spread its legs to allow her to pass under. Rolling as fast as she could, she darted behind the wall of monsters.

The monster's voice was rugged and smoky, but was faintly feminine. Apparently it was a female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda tried to respond, but noticed she couldn't. Of course! Slimes don't have mouths, so there's no way she can communicate! The leader seems to notice her struggle and laughs. <br>\r\n\"You haven't learned to communicate yet, huh? Very well. As a reward for healing my subordinates, I shall help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dipped one of her claws into Amanda's body with her free hand.

However...what else could they give?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What kind of reward?\"</i><br>\r\n\"Needless to say, you are welcome to eat the corpses of those pesky humans. Those are already yours, so I need to give you more. Well...at the top of my head, I can give you some food. It seems you're still a Beginner Slime. Our food is filled multiple animals which can give you strength. Also, we could take you back to our village. If you wish, I can show you our maidens. You can take one as a wife. But if none of that works for you, I can just give you gold. I'll let you think on it while you eat.\" She gingerly placed Amanda on the ground on top of one of the adventurers. She wasted no time devouring the deceased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda thinks about the possibilities. First off, she could refuse the other rewards and just eat the corpses. It should give her some strength, and she won't seem selfish to the lizardmen. If possible, they could make good allies. Then again, eating their food also sounded good. If it had a lot of ingredients, it could make her much more powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the option of taking a wife. She heard that polygamy was a popular feature in this game, and it wasn't limited to just humans. People could have an entire harem of monsters. If she accepted, she could have a loyal follower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the last option. Amanda didn't have much need for gold at the moment. Right now, she didn't have any pouches or storage magic. Beginner Slimes could only eat items, not keep them. But...what would be the reaction if she ate gold? Perhaps she could unlock a rare evolution path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has reached level 4&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has reached level 5&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has reached level 6&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has reached level 7&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has reached level 8&gt;<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has reached level 23&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Ice LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Wind LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Fire LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Disarm LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Slash LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Dance LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Seduce LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Snipe Shot LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Archery LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Sword Mastery LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Dagger Mastery LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Staff Mastery LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda had learned Passive Skill: Mana Control LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Charisma LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Bargaining LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Charm LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Extra evolution conditions have been met, new paths have opened&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter clearing five adventurers and twelve lizardmen, Amanda had gotten quite a bit more powerful.

It took half an hour of walking through forest before they reached a large lake. Wooden huts surrounded it and many lizardmen could be seen moving around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the villagers spotted the chief's approach, a large crowd formed as they ran to check up on her.

Two stories tall, it had it's own cooking pot and sleeping area. A good supply of dried food was upstairs. The chief sat on a pile of hay with Amanda on her lap, gently petting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the women were brought in one by own. The first one had dark green scales and stood taller than the chief. She seemed to be pretty strong and sturdy. It could be a pretty decent tank...<br>\r\n\"This is the eldest daughter of our warrior family\" the chief explained. The woman growled a bit in response and moved to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one to walk in had grass green scales, and was rather thin. But her claws also seemed much sharper than the other's.<br>\r\n\"This is our village trickster. She's a bit mischievous, but I'm sure she'll be a loyal wife.\" The lizardman winked at Amanda before moving to the side. She seemed nicer, and also more rogue like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last one to walk in an oddity. Instead of the usual green gator looking monsters, this woman had dark blue scales. Her body was rather thin, and she was missing her right eye. <br>\r\n\"This is an orphan we picked up years ago. While she isn't a blood member of our tribe, we accept her as our own. She is also blessed with magic. Now, who do you choose?\" the chief asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, aren't you forgetting someone?\" asked the rogue lizardman. The chief glared at her.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"As I recall, there's one more person who's never had a mate...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" the warrior chimed<br>\r\n\"Chief, she's referring to you\" explained the mage. <br>\r\n\"W-what?\" the chief stuttered, clearly not expecting that.<br>\r\n\"What?

Once again, Amanda was alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't bother her. She had made a friend, gained strength, and earned some gold. She rolled her viscous body over the sack and got to work digesting it. The metals were more difficult than organic matter to digest, and took more time to break down. It made Amanda feel a bit sick. But she stuck with it and absorbed all the gold coins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has reached level 24&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Golden Spray LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Skill: Gold Statue LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Gold Drop LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Amanda has learned Passive Skill: Gold Sensor LV 1&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Extra evolution conditions have been met, new paths have opened&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, quite a bit came from eating the gold. Amanda decided to check her new status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda<br>\r\nRace: Training Slime<br>\r\nOccupation: None<br>\r\nElements: None<br>\r\nLV: 24<br>\r\nExp: 23901<br>\r\nExp to next LV: 109<br>\r\nHP: 30<br>\r\nMP: 30<br>\r\nAtk: 4<br>\r\nDef: 1<br>\r\nMDf: 1<br>\r\nAgi: 3<br>\r\nMag: 6<br>\r\nInt: 8<br>\r\nLuk: 2<br>\r\nTitle: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't changed much. The biggest downside to being a Beginner Slime is that the basic stats don't increase easily. But it did open many new doors. She checked the list of slimes she could still evolve into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly was the standard Slime, the basic evolution with no special traits. Next was the Lesser Heal Slime that she first unlocked. A new option was a Mana Slime. By gaining magical knowledge, these slimes are capable of launching many different spells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother evolution option was a Firm Slime. It was a slime that hardened its body to fight as its own weapon. It was a type that used only physical attacks. The next one sounded a bit unusual, an Aphrodisiac Slime. It specializes in making prey aroused and feeding on it while incapacitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was the Golden Slime. It was considered a rare evolution. Golden slimes had outstanding stats, and unique skills that manipulate precious metals. But, they can't evolve further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould Amanda evolve now, or keep looking for more possibilities? </span></div></div>",

There was a short timer for her to respawn, and Amanda watched it count down angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it. I'm going to exterminate all the lizardmen I find.
