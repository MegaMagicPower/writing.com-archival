The father named Lewis, is 33 years of age, and he\u2019s actually a school teacher, which incidentally is where his 8 year old son David is educated, and so they would see each other more than any other kids to have their parents to spend some time with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they\u2019ve never gotten to the same class yet as Lewis teaches the 5th grade, he would still be able to teach David with things at home, whether it\u2019s doing some homework, and other stuff to prepare.  At the same time though, he would always want to give his son a special treat, just for being a loving and caring boy in the family, which Lewis always wanted to make sure the boy has to have fun, so he would grow up as a better person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though, it was more like what to do since there\u2019s no school until the next month or so, and Lewis is sitting on the couch, trying to figure it out on what to do to keep David occupied for the time being.  The one thing that he likes doing is going out to some adventures and eating out for some dinner.  Now that he came to think about the, the father has his belly growled so much that it made him starting to feel hungry.  That\u2019s when Lewis had his smile to his face, as he feels exactly what he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I guess I should get my son and head out.  I wanna make a special treat just for the two of us.\u201d  Lewis says with his own suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, he would head over to the kid\u2019s bedroom and saw David watching TV, when he decides to greet him with a smile before asking in a curious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey David!  You wanna head out to ________, just the two of us together?\u201d  Lewis wondered.</span></div></div>",
