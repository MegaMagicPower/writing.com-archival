A boy with an unevolved Pikachu? This is unacceptable!\" The mob boss called out angrily. Sensing the rage rolling off the regal man, most of the varying grunts stepped back a bit as to not be caught in their employer's wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the video again as he studied the boys face more, the older man shifted his gaze to one of the admins beside him. \"Make him disappear. I don't care how. If I see this one interfering with Team Rocket's ambitions again, then he won't be the only ones I'll take care of personally.\" Giovanni hissed before turning back around as the multitude of monitors changed from the most recent clip of the organization's failure to various maps showing the different regions they were stationed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the room in a single file, the two admins who oversaw their boss's plans were the last to leave as they approached one of the scientists they worked alongside. \"Dr. Zager! You're in charge of this. You heard the boss. Create whatever you want to take out this trainer. Do it with whatever means you need. The number of funds is of no matter to how much this boy's cost us. Do I make myself clear?\" Ariana announced before walking away with her fellow admin, Archer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way back to his lab, the scientist set out to create his new device. He already had a plan in mind that was foolproof. If giant machines and weapons didn't work to stop this boy, then something a little smaller would do the trick. Something that would make him, a little smaller to be exact... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing too slowly as his vision blurred, Ash stared up at the sky with a lingering headache as he watched the clouds passing by. Why was he on his back? Leaning up slowly, the raven-haired trainer groaned before rubbing his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened?\" He saw some kind of light and then, he was on his back. This was weird... But, so was everything else now too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around slowly as he tried to register what was going on, the trainer's eyes widened as he saw the massive landscape he was now in. It was a forest, and the trees were all around him... But, they were gigantic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGawking at the sheer size of the different oaks and flora around him, Ash could only shake his head. \"What is with this place Pikachu? Pikachu?\" Looking around as no reply came, Ash soon began to panic. Where was his partner pokemon!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up quickly, the perturbed boy looked all around but there was no sign of his pokemon anywhere... or his Pokeballs. He was completely alone out here... Wherever here was... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWracking his mind as he tried to remember what had caused him to end up here, Ash thought hard for an answer... It was slowly coming back to him... But, what was it? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, where was she? Looking around, the perplexed trainer didn't see any sign of his friend. Did she not get sent wherever he did? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris! Hey Iris! Where are you?\" Calling out as loudly as he could, Ash frowned unsure of what to do now. There was no sign of the purple haired dragon trainer anywhere. Hopefully she was alright. Turning around and walking in the opposite direction he had been standing in, the diminutive boy tried to recall where he was. This place looked familiar to him but he still couldn't piece it together properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's see... I was traveling with Iris and Pikachu in this forest... I think. We had set up camp, and then I went out to check out a noise I heard... then I woke up...?' It didn't sound right, but it also didn't not sound right either. This was really beginning to get on his nerves! But, he soon came to a sight that confirmed his worst fears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked up a small incline, his campsite came into view. And it was just as big and large as the rest of the forest around him. 'I guess this means I somehow shrunk...' His memories were right after all. Looking around the camp, Ash's eyes soon lit up as he saw Iris eating across from the fire they had made. She was still here! But, gigantic... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping as he saw his dark skinned companion chewing on one of the sandwiches set out, the tiny trainer wondered if he could somehow get her attention. This could be bad... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to try and get her to see him, but how? </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a Pok\u00e9mon story featuring Ash from the anime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic premise being that after interfering with Team Rocket's plans for too long, they end up shrinking him. The aftermath that follows and who the one(s) who find him are, are up to you to decide. This is a free for all story, and anything goes when it comes to the cast of Pok\u00e9mon. However, this IS and should be focused on a giantess story. So please keep the use of giants away from Ash at all times. They can be mentioned or talk to him but CANNOT use his, or interact with him like the various girl's will. Female Pok\u00e9mon may be used as well if you so choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferred fetishes:<br>\r\nAnal Vore<br>\r\nInsertion<br>\r\nFemdom<br>\r\nEntrapment<br>\r\nSweat Play<br>\r\nEnslavement<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALL other fetishes are allowed too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings that are not allowed are as follows: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale/Male<br>\r\nMultiple shrunken people (Keep it just to Ash being shrunken)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll female characters in the series are allowed. None are off limits! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything else is fair game. While it's preferred for crueler scenarios in this story, the more gentler ones are by no means off limits. Feel free to write Ash up with a gentle giantess if you'd like, but also give the opportunity for others to write what they want to. DO NOT end a chapter you don't like simply because it doesn't fit with what you want it to be. If found, they will be deleted immediately and put back to their prior state so others may continue them if they wish too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll chapters longer then a paragraph will be awarded with points, so please feel free to have fun with this story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
