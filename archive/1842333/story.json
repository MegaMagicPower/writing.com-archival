My dad and I are both human.\"<br>\r\n\"Then why'd he send you to a monster school?\"<br>\r\n the werewolf inquires once more.<br>\r\nYou sigh, then say <br>\r\n\"Because he's as close to a monster as a human can get.

He's a murderer.\"<br>\r\n\"A murderer?\" Winnie asks. \"Why would he be such a thing?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a long story,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"I've got time,\" the werewolf replies, getting in your bed and sitting up next to you.<br>\r\n\"Ok then,\" you say. So you tell Winnie the entire story, how your dad became a murderer, why he kills, what he expects of you, everything. When you finished, Winnie just sits there awestruck.<br>\r\nFinally she speaks. \"That's awful of him to force what he wants you to be onto you,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you reply. \"I know I'll end up disappointing him, but I just don't want to kill people like that.\"<br>\r\nThere was silence. Then Winnie says \"So, that's your dad's mask?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"He makes me wear it.\"<br>\r\n\"Mind showing me what's underneath it now?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou sat there, staring at her, silent.

On the page is indeed the very man you saw in your nightmare. He wore a dark brown fedora, black pants, and a red and dark green sweater. He wore the same clawed glove that he had in your nightmare, showing the blades off menacingly. What caught your attention most, however, was his face. He seemed to be human, but his face was grotesque and horribly disfigured, almost like his skin had been burned. The top of his page proclaimed his name: \"Freddy Krueger.\"<br>\r\nWinnie begins to read the page.<br>\r\n \"'Once a man who was captured and burned to death, Freddy Krueger rose from the dead and became a monster. Wielding a clawed glove as a weapon, he has the ability to enter one's dreams and turn them into nightmares as he stalks and kills them in their dreams, causing them to'...\" Winnie gasps before reading on. \"...'die in real life.'\"<br>\r\n\"Oh damn,\" you say.<br>\r\nThe werewolf continued. \"'Freddy has fought with serial killer Jason Voorhees in the past. Jason won their battle, decapitating Krueger, but somehow Freddy came back and continued to kill.'\" Winnie closes the book and turns to you. \"That really doesn't sound good,\" she says nervously.<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" you reply. \"We're talking about a guy who can kill people while they sleep and has a beef with my dad. I might be in a lot of trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry about it too much, ok?\" Winnie say. \"Let's go back to bed.\"<br>\r\n\"...Ok,\" you mutter, still nervous about Freddy getting to you. You walk back to your room with Winnie and got back in your bed. \"Thanks for listening to me, Winnie,\" you say to her.<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" she replies. You stare at her for a second and suddenly you pull her face to yours and kiss her passionately on the lips. She seems shocked for a second but then kisses you back, both of you full of bliss. After what seems like forever, the two of you pull away. Winnie has a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"Good night Winnie,\" you say to her.<br>\r\n\"Good night Jason,\" she replies as she walks towards your door and closes it as she leaves. What a way to end the night, you thought to yourself as you drift off to sleep.</span></span></div></div>",

Then your dad turns toward you and the girls and approaches menacingly. You jump in front of them and hold up your knife.<br>\r\n\"Dad, it's me! Jason! Your son!\" you say to him. He straightens up and looks at you for a while. It seems to have had some effect. Suddenly your dad kicks you powerfully in the face, causing your mask to fly off, cracking.

She feels so good around your cock. You wanted to do this ever since the two of you shared that kiss, and now you were. You picked up the pace and rubbed her ass as you kept fucking her.<br>\r\n\"Oh Jason...Oooooooooowwwwwwwww,\" Winnie cries, letting out a small howl. \"I think i'm gonna cum!\"<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" <br>\r\nyou say. You keep thrusting in and out of your werewolf lover while lightly smacking her butt exciting her more. Finally you feel yourself on the edge, thrusting in hard one more time before spilling your juices inside her warm meaty love tunnel. This sets her off, causing her to spray her juice all over your member as she lets out a long howl. The two of you stayed there, panting and moaning as the water fell over the two of you rinsing the cum off your bodies.<br>\r\nYou spoke first.<br>\r\n \"That was so great, Winnie,\"<br>\r\n you sighed, pulling yourself out of her vagina.<br>\r\n\"It sure was,\" <br>\r\nshe moaned, standing up and pulling you into a kiss, during which you placed a hand on her ass. Then she slowly broke away. <br>\r\n\"Do you think...we should tell anyone about...us?\"<br>\r\nYou were wondering about this yourself. You didn't feel comfortable keeping a secret from the girls, but you were wondering how they would react to the interspecies romance. So what do you decide?</span></span></div></div>",
