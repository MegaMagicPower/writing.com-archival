These powers are called quirks, and they ranged from strong to weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour quirk was one that affected your life and has not done much in aiding your desire to be a hero. The power you posses allows you to shrink your body down to the size of a bug, along with it comes durability and the power to regenerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just gave bullies and even cruel adults more of an excuse to torture you when shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then in this super human world, what exact role do you play with your quirk?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tetsuya Hima was someone small, who could have a big presence. With a shrinking quirk and a loud personality it was to be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy grew up with one parent, due to adoption. His father Ginku was a tank of a man, being 6'8 and having very large muscles with a tuff of blond hair on top. Most of his memories with Ginku involved him nuzzled between his pecs or laying on any part of his body. Sometimes beneath his firm glutes, which his father claims is accidental despite humming in pleasure when Tetsuya is shoved in between his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up in this lifestyle has shifted Tetsuya's personality. He has a... let's not call it an addiction but a obsession with muscled males. This is what propelled his relationship with Izuku Midoriya and Katsuki Bakugou. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his father was for the most part cautious around him, Bakugou didn't waste a second in letting Tetsuya know who's boss. From stomping, sitting, and squeezing him the ash blond didn't spare any relief when Tetsuya used his quirk, and the tiny loved every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy had masochist tendencies and having a cocky and explosive bully torment him was a dream come true. Tetsuya had tried to get Izuku involved but the freckled boy always became flustered and refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsuya wished he could make a career in heroics using his quirk. Bakugou had said he should offer his services for pay, saying \"anyone would pay a fuckton of cash to feel someone beneath them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a spot in U.A was a chance to make this possible. Graduating would give him all the credit he needed to start a business in catering to that desire. It put a stupid grin on his face, imagining himself worshipping All Might or maybe being dominated by Endeavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would get into U.A. All those fantasies would come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 \u00b0<br>\r\nSo where is Tetsuya now?</span></div></div>",

It was a dream job really, he got paid to make the tired students and faculty 'feel good'. Massages, spa treatments, letting the giants take out their stresses and frustrations out on a helpless tiny. Yup! The tiny-quirk user couldn't have been happier with the set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a bit of a chore going through the necessary paperwork to set an unused room up as basically a 'Massage Parlor with Benefit's. But in Tetsuya's opinion that was all worth it in the end, what's a hand cramp or two when you get to service studs and hot students!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they chose their hero names in class one day, Tetsuya received enthusiastic applause when he revealed his hero name of 'Doctor Feelgood'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....like the song.\" Jiro caught on to the reference...obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was Tetsuya's favorite part of the day...AFTER school! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heights Alliance dorms now allowed for Tetsuya to make 'house calls' too! Nothing like being dominated in an environment where the giant was comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, he was making one of them just now! The normal sized lad had a dorm room of course, but he was usually so busy with requests for service that he wasn't really in there much other than to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at a list, Tetsuya hummed. \"Let's see...tonight is Denki Kaminari, Eijiro Kirishima aaand....whoa...Izuku Midoriya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku had never made an appointment with Tetsuya, much to the boy's disappointment...the kid was just waay too shy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the greenette had had a particularly rough day or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about a dream come true..his feet are HUGE and he's worked himself up a killer bod!\" Tetsuya drooled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who to see first..?</span></div></div>",

Tetsuya would be arriving soon and the boy would be before his large feet tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been training all week, jogging every morning had made his plump soles feel rather sore. Izuku had remembered Bakugou bragging about how good it felt to have their childhood friend beneath him, so finally putting aside his embarrassment Izuku booked a House call with Tetsuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I should change my socks!\", Izuku suddenly stood up as he thought of the damp cloth holding his sweaty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late however as a knock came from Izuku's door. The freckled boy tried to shake off his flush as he walked and heard squishing sounds from his soles. Opening the door, Izuku found Tetsuya with starry eyes as he greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called~\", Tetsuya grinned as he strolled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku began mumbling. \"T-tetsuya I think I'm fine actually! I wouldn't want you to smell my feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Izuku gasped in surprise as he couldn't find his friend. What he didn't know was that Tetsuya had already shrunk and was looking up in awe at the looming Izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eagerly drooled as the ground shook under the large socked feet, the bittersweet hit his nostrils and he grinned as the giant foot hovered over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SMOOSH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsuya giggled as the plump damp sole squished him to the ground. He knew Izuku would try and cancel his appointment so he was going sneak him stepping on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny grinned as the chessy foot put all of its plump weight on him. The next step is getting Izuku to let him pamper the soles unclothed. But first, Izuku had to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku was beyond confused as he walked around his room looking for Tetsuya. The boy probably shrunk and hit like always, but Izuku couldn't spot any scurrying figures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....oh shoot!\", Izuku flexed his squishy soles and sure enough he felt a pebble like object imbedded in, shaped like a human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly sitting on his bed, Izuku put his hand on his knee and sure enough he spotted Tetsuya grinning widely as he was pressed into his smelly sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Tetsuya I'm sorry!\", Izuku quickly pulled Tetsuya out held him in his cuffed palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny however held up a finger. \"That wasn't accidental Izuku, tell me how did I feel under there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blushed and looked away. \"I um no...it did feel nice stepping on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsuya grinned. \"That's it! Now onto step 2, I want you to release though mighty feet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sighed as he couldn't help but feel incline to do the action. Setting Tetsuya on his firm thigh, Izuku reached down and grabbed the hems of his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsuya watched in amazement as it took some effort to peel the stinky socks of the large feet. A chessy odor soon came off of the large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled slightly through his blush. \"S-sorry about the smell, I didn't think of washing up before your visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny shook his head and started sliding down the sweatpant clad leg feeling the toned muscle beneath. Tetsuya hummed as he walked around and looked up at the towering plump soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are some good feet Izuku, and I know how we can help you relax!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was first?</span></div></div>",

The boy began to dwindle in size, watching the familiar site of someone's body towering over you. He finally stopped at an inch between Bakugo large socked feet. The blond squatted down and grinned cocky. \"Hn, just the size that i like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugo reached down and wrapped Tetsuya in a fist, before standing up. The salty smell of Bakugo's palm sweat inflitrated his nose, Testuya eagerly sniffed it as it was one of the many smells he was honored with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond walked over to his couch, picking up the remote before sitting down.

You later were brought to the doctor to confirm that you shrinking was your quirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough excited, you soon realized your quirk wasn't something to be happy about.

It's just..there's never been a pro hero without one...you could be the first quirkless pro hero!\" Izumi tried to say cheerfully, not getting a response from his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come ooon!

Entrance Exam...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi hadn't been slouching around while his older brother was moving junk on the beach and undergoing brutal training and study to inherit One for All. Izumi had started working out and slowly learning how to meditate and focus to prevent at least some of the unintended shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking still happened unintentionally sometimes..but the amount of times (such as if he sneezed or daydreamed or anything) that happened was cut drastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi had always been rather durable at a tiny size, how else would he endure such punishment from bullies? But thanks to intense training, he had begun to develop a sort of enhanced strength at a tiny size as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made the Entrance Exam for U.A. a hell of a lot more approachable. Izumi currently sat next to Izuku at the dinner table with their mother. Izumi knew that Izuku was starting to lose hope after not hearing from All-Might for so long combined with him blowing the exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izuku? Snap out of it sweetie..\" Inko Midoriya said worriedly about her eldest son. Izuku had been staring at a fish for the past few minutes blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry...\" Izuku said, but it was clear to Inko and Izumi Midoriya that he wasn't really 'there' so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Izuku and Izumi were sitting together on the couch...Izuku looked extremely down in the dumps. \"Y'know...you won't know for sure until your results come in.\" Izumi said. \"Neither of us will....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly burst open and their mother said in a panicked tone: \"T-they're here! Your test results from U.A.!\" She waved an envelope in their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku and Izumi took the letter to their room and shut the door, their mother paced nervously out in the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku was staring at the envelope for the longest time, before Izumi spoke up. \"Listen...no matter what happens...we can't give up.\" Izumi nodded firmly at his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the envelope, a sort of disc fell out and projected an image of All-Might onto the Midoriya bros. wall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll-Might explained how Izuku passed due to something known as 'Rescue' points...even though he got 0 on combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi got 42 combat points and 0 rescue. Both boys eyes were wide, Izuku's were overflowing with happy tears as All-Might in the recording said: \"You both have made it! Welcome to U.A.!\" </span></div></div>",

Let's celebrate! We're going to U.A and we outta spend our last junior high days full out!\", Izumi said pumping a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled at his twin's behavior. \"O...ok, I get it. Let's have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe fun however, turned out to be the two of them eating some treats thier mom made, while watching the latest hero news. They didn't really have any friends to hang out with (God knows what Bakugo would do, hearing that thier going to U.A).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm hey Izuku I wanna show you something.\", Izumi said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what is..Izumi?\", Izuku started asking only to stop when his brother suddenly shrank down and stood between his socked feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting to show you my training and give an example!\" Izuku blinked confused at his tiny brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izuku, I want you to step on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....eh...EH!\", Izuku yelled surprised at the request. \"W..why would you want me to do that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi didn't falter. \"I've trained my strength and body. I'm not only more durable but stronger! I promise I'll be fine, just do it this once please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku was flustered, but eventually gulped and nooded. The older Midoriya stood up, towering over his brother like a mountain. With a nod from Izumi, Izuku lifted up his right socked footed hovered it over his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Izuku brought his foot down and waited to feel a lump from below. However, his foot stopped suddenly from reaching the floor. Izuku's eyes widened as he realized Izumi was holding his foot up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a triumphant grin, Izumi lifted his currently giant brother up. Izuku soon stumbled back and fell into his butt with a yelp. He smiled as Izumi grew back and pulled him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! So you can retain your strength even at that size?\", Izuku went off on his mumbling as he examined Izumi's quirk. The younger Midoriya simply smiled at his brother's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep this was a nice celebration.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nNow then were are the siblings now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He a Izumi were both going to be heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku fondly thought of his brother. Before he received the quirk his brother encouraged him non-stop. He even took the blows from Kacchan, agreeing to shrink for him if Izuku was left alone. Izumi deserved something, for all the encouragement and hours spend in his childhood friend's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All Might.....could I ask for a small favor?\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Izuku it's early, and on top of that a free day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi dragged his feet as he followed his brother. The sun was just rising and normally the younger twin would still be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you asked about my trainer so I decied to show you!\", Izuku yelled excited as they approached the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins walked onto the now cleared beach and looked around. \"Huh, could've sworn this place was a dump. So who's this trainer doing suppose to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar voice struck Izumi as he turned around to find the towering stature of All Might! The hero was dressed a coat for the cold weather, but that didn't lessen Izumi's shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the hero approached, the younger twin vanished. The hero looked in confusion as Izuku remained unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Sorry...that happens if he get's too excited.\", Izuku rushed as he bent down to pick up his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, Izumi looked up in awe. All Might was now truly a titan of peace, stretching into the heavens with that bright smile. His brother scooped him up and held him out to the number one hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-ou were training Izuku?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might let out a deep laugh as he held his palm out to Izuku's. Hesitantly, Izumi walked onto the much larger palm, seeming like a speck in the hero's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I have! Your brother has displayed the qualities that make a hero. I therefore have decided to help Young Midorya Izuku become strong!\",The hero called out as He brought the tiny to his striking eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see.\", Izumi said slowly as he was handed back to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asked by your brother to meet with you. He said you've helped him and that he wanted to repay you, and so he asked me reveal the secret of his training with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi looked up at Izuku. The two brothers smiled sincerely at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, young Midoriyas......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although a hero, he had motives different then All Might.The man wanted to father a child that was powerful enough to one day surpass All Might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first child he fathered was you. Your name was Sun\u014d Todoroki and unlike the children that followed, you showed no ice or fire quirk. This was discovered when at age five a servent showed you to Enji, shrunk down to an inch. Rather then comfort you, he grunted and walked away. The next thing he told you was that there would be another sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough excited, you soon picked up on the reason for the continued arrival of your siblings after your father grunted in disappointment at your third sibling. By the time you turned thirteen the last sibling was born and named Shouta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a lot of time with Shouta as he grew up. You were unable to play with your other siblings, as your quirk activated easily and you wouldn't grow back for some time. Still you liked playing with your brother. You'd shrink down and he \"rescue\" you from his stuffed animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day all that changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting in Shouta's cupped Palms, listening to him excitingly talk about heroes. Suddenly the door opened and your father walked in. \"Shouto. It's time to train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother sighed, before placing you gently on the floor. Shouta walked out the door, and just as Enji was about to follow you called out. \"Father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnji looked down at you. His eyebrows furrowed as he gave a grunt in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your working Shouta to hard he needs to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off as Enji clenched his teeth and fists. You were shocked as he lifted his slippered foot above your body and stomped down. You cried out in pain as you felt your bones crack. To add insult to injury, Enji lifted his heel up and began grind the front of his shoe. As if he wanted to hear the breaking of your bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally lifting his stomper off you, your bones began to heal and shift back to it's original form. Enji folded his arms over his chest and seem to smirk down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouta needs to focus on training. Not be bothered by a bug that I should've crushed years ago!\", Enji roared down at you before turning and slamming the door behind him<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u00e2 \u20ac\u00a2\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\nSince that day, you've been separated from Shouta. You spend your days alone, watching your brother return to his room tired and more stoic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you tried to approach him, your father would catch you and deliver punishment. This included spending the afternoon in his boot and even using you as a seat cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were living in your broken family, unsure of how everyone would live the rest of their lives. Your siblings were in college, and Shouta was going to U.A high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to....</span></div></div>",

I'm going to become a hero, and I'll achieve this using my right side.\" Looking up back up, Shoto was shocked to fight his brother gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be rooting for you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Shoto saw Sun\u00f5 shrunk between his slippered feet, smiling and waving up at him. \"Sun\u00f5-Kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got into U.A! I figured the least I could do was make you the BIG brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoto gave a rare smile before reaching down and cupping Sun\u00f5 in his palms, and bringing him to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.

In addition he had an impressive set of muscles including a six pack and large pecs. His dyed red hair reached his elbows and was usually tied back in a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was the older brother to Eijirou Kirishima, who was practically stuck to his side. Eijirou admired his older brother, wanting to be as strong and manly as him to protect others like he did. Whenever bullies picked on him, Hato would loom over them with a glare and threatened to \u201ccrush them\u201d if they didn\u2019t leave Eijirou alone. As Eijirou entered junior high the both of them worked out together, and Hato even dyed his hair red too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, in a ironic twist Hato\u2019s quirk contradicts his appearance as it let\u2019s him shrink.

If anything more routines were created.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nEijirou huffed as he did sit ups, sweat dripped from his body and his muscles pumped. As he worked out, a voice called from between his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Eijirou! You couldn\u2019t crush a grape with this pressure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Nii-San!\u201d.

This included getting accidentally stomped by his father and pumped by his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Your becoming more manly by the second!\u201d, Hato yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEijirou beamed. Hearing his brother\u2019s compliments was one of the best feelings ever.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nDespite Hato's strength, he didn\u2019t consider becoming a Pro-Hero. Being strong couldn\u2019t do much against a powerful quirk, and shrinking wouldn\u2019t give him any advantage.

All the dreams of Hato sitting, stepping, and pumping on him could be a reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEijirou focus was back on his brother, as he squatted and made his muscles pump and bring his large bulge into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then how about I grow you back? I'm sure you wouldn't want to be the tiny brother.\", Eijirou watched as his brother's palm approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Nii-san!\", Eijirou yelled causing Hato to remove his hand in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...i stay this size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHato raised an eyebrow in confusion. \"What are talking about Eijirou?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always the one who get's to be the giant, I want to be little during our workout and see you're manly form fill my sky!\", Eijirou passionately explained clenching a fist to his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up he saw Hato........</span></div></div>",

Preparing for this job had been a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst obstacle, keeping this all a secret from Eijirou. Hato both wanted to surprise him and make the class seem fair. The principal had given him the name Kise to use for his fist few weeks, he'd give his true name once it was shown he wouldn't be biased towards his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond obstacle, dressing appropriate for the job. Most of Hato's wardrobe consisted of workout clothes, since it was hard to find regular clothes that don't rip with one flex. Luckily a blond and boney stranger had helped him find formal wear, saying he had a friend who was large like him. Still it didn't stop the clothes from looking like they were painted on his muscles, and to finish he had his red hair in a low ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath the giant began to walk to his class. \"I've got this, I gotta be a man for Eijirou!\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe class of 1-A sat chatting amongst themselves, waiting for thier new teacher. The students had been informed that on certain days they would have a hybrid class called Heroic Fitness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chatter stopped once they heard the door. \"Sorry to keep you all waiting!\", a deep voice called entering the room. The class looked slightly surprised as a red headed muscle head walked to the front, with the top of his desk going below his waist. One red headed student had his jaw hanging as he saw who the teacher was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Mr.Kise and I'll be teaching you all!\", Hato said grinning, immediately making some stare at his familar sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my job is to help you heroes get into to grove of physical activity, make you ready to go out and use your energy to the fullest!\", Hato passionately explained clenching a fist. Now everyone was sensing something familar about the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, for my first lesson we'll be getting active!\", Hato yelled as he pointed at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH!\", the class yelled surprised they were starting so early. Eijirou however had not yelled as he was staring at the teacher in confusion.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe class was stumped. This was a fitness class, yet they were inside a room that had no workout equipment whatsoever. There was a platform with what appeared to be a miniature city and a TV screen in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kise-sensei! May I please ask what the purpose of this city is?\", a boy with glasses said while robotically moving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHato grinned. \"This city right here, is where you're working out!\". The class became more confused. \"Here let me explain. Hey umm you could you come over here?\". Hato said pointing at a green haired, freckled boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy known as Midoriya came forward, a little nervous as his head just went above Hato's waist. The giant placed a large palm on his student's head, making him immediately flustered. \"Don't worry, this will only be for a little.\". Before Midoriya could ask what he meant, the boy suddenly vanished before his classmates eyes. The students gasped in shock at the sudden disappearance of thier classmate. Hato however stayed calm and squated down and was shown picking something up before standing, with his palm opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do to Deku!\", an angry blond yelled at Hato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant merely smiled before taking out his phone and turning on the TV. On the TV through his phone it should Hato's large palm, there was a dot in middle. However, upon zooming in the class widened thier eyes as they saw it was actually Midoriya looking up in fear! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My quirk allows me to shrink myself and others down to miniscule sizes. This city will be roamed by you all at this size.\", the class couldn't believe it. Being shrunk down wasn't with the information they received!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain the rest in a sec, but first let's get this little guy back to normal.\", crouching down then standing up again, in the second following Midoriya appeared resized. After a pat on the head, he walked back to the group with a light blush, Eijirou frowned slightly. He was the only one who gets head pats from Hato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what would a tiny city be complete without? A giant monster to terrize it! Unfortunately I didn't bring a reptile costume with me\". A few students laughed at the reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok you'll be put into teams of five, your goal is too get to one of the checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, the monster will be rampaging without a quirk and you have to avoid it. You'll be sent to a random location so the giant can't win right away. You also will have a deterrent band, these will help protect you if any rubble or a foot lands on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class took in the task. Running from a giant while shrunk. Hato then looked through his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, the first team is Kaminari, Hagakure, Hanta, Midoriya, and Ashido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to form a line, the team was given thier red deterrent bands. While Midoriya was worryingly mumbling, Ashido was bouncing with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have our team, now all we need is our giant. So who's up for it!\", Hato excitingly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one raised thier hand however. Some where thinking \"it be too awkward\", others thought \"I wouldn't be a good giant\". And then there was one thinking \"heh, I could crush Deku like the pebble he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If no one volunteers, then i'll have to do it myself.\", Hato said folding his strong arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team began to sweat nervously. It was no secret that Hato seem to have immense strength and energy. There's no way he'd go easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds......</span></div></div>",

When he was born, the docter looked shocked as he held the speck of a newborn in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi's quirk was being an inch tall. Alongside this was the ability to regenerate from live threatening wounds. While his family still loved and supported him, he couldn't help but feel left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis two brothers cared for him very much. Though Tenya was more overbearing as Tensei's superhero career took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenya took his role as Tadashi's big brother seriously. He carried him almost everywhere, and even bathed with him just in case Tadashi forget how to swim. Whenever he jogged, Tenya had Tadashi nuzzeled up between his pecs.

Meanwhile Kowa had the ability to shrink to a inch tall and regenerate from wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a young age, Kowa realized that his chances of becoming a hero were slim. So he decided to attend normal high school and encourage Chizome to go to hero school. However, the boy didn't expect his brother to drop out saying the \"other student's resolve disgusted me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChizome began to train and while it seem to just be fitness, Kowa became worried when his brother started to practice using blades. He told Kowa how many heroes were fake, and a new society needed to surface. The boy was confused by his brother's ranting and couldn't follow it. He eventually would in the worst way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kowa finished up high school, tragedy struck. Thier parents died in a accident cause by a villian. Even after the villian was caught, the \"hero\" took in the praise not paying attention to those hurt. As Kowa cried in his brother's embrace, he finally understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were fake heroes, and he would rid the world of them.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nDespite the supposed uselessness of his quirk, Kowa found it had many uses. By touching something he was able to shrink it down with him. This wasn't just limited to inanimate objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good portion of time training, Kowa was ready to join his brother on a mission. By now Chizome had gone through a change. He had a more muscular built and lacked a nose, but Kowa didn't care. Him and Stain wouldn't be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mission was simple. Kowa rushed at the \"hero\", and just as he was about to be hit he vanished. The\"hero\"then noticed a tingling on his neck, when suddenly he dwindled down to a inch tall. The \"hero\" watched confused as Kowa smirked and hopped away as a large shadow covered the area. The \"hero\" then looked up in horror as Stain loomed over him, boot raised and hands clenched. He couldn't even cry out as the steel-toed sole came down and crushed the \"hero\" into paste. Stain then gave his boot a good swivivel to spread the blood before grabbing Kowa and escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on for a good while, but eventually it changed. Kowa decided they needed allies and thought joining the League of Villians could help. Chizome on the other hand refused, saying thier ideals weren't the same. This lead to a fall out with the brothers and they decided to go different paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the tension, Kowa still gave a hug and good luck to his brother. As he left he swore he good hear a faint \"be careful\" behind him.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nKowa walked up to the alleyway door. Behind it was the bar where he would join The League of Villians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you gonna go in or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKowa jumped at the sudden voice, before turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person was.......</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hey everyone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I'm back with another interactive. This one is going to focus entirely on the anime My Hero Academia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was inspired to to this because.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1, I have been posting BNHA chapters to the Giant World of Anime made by the macro anime senpai Darklord665.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2, I have been gifted a basic membership by an anonymous user, which I am grateful for. I just want to make the most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overall basis of this interactive is that the main character has a quirk which allows them to shrink to an inch tall. The character can go by \"you\" or can be given a name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will somewhat resemble the Micro Storylines interactive, in the sense that I'll give a few options of how to start the story. For example, one option could have the character be moving to Japan. But another could have him related to a character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe character can do more then just shrink. If you want to extend the quirk then go on ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then onto the rules <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Keep all interactions M/M. Female characters can appear, but keep the heavy interaction to men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Fetishes are allowed, though please refrain from scat  and piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- if you add a choice please try to add to it. If you add a chapter, please try to add at least a paragraph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, read on and go PLUS ULTRA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
