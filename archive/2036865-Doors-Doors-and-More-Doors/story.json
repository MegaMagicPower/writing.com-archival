Please do not vandalize this story and only enter quality rooms. The objective is to create a small adventure behind each doorway. Try to avoid leaving too many choices open ended in your mini adventure and if possible make it self contained. You may work on it day after day if you'd like and what lies in beyond the doorway may be anything your mind desires.
