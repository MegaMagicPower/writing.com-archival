We're waiting for you downstairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\" He yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember? I told you yesterday that I found some place for our summer vacation this year. But we have to take off today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it dawned him. Due to their financial situation they wouldn't be able to afford a holiday trip this year. Yet his mother seemed to have found something on short notice. It looked somewhat strange to them but it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take a shower, while I pack your things!\" She told him.</span></div></div>",

She said they could meet up at the beach tomorrow, have a soda at Rosie's Umbrella, the small combination kiosk / cafe overlooking an expanse of sun flooded sand. Oh yeah, baby. That's where he wanted to be, not some...some lame cabin in the woods where there'd be no one to talk to, no beach and no phone or Internet coverage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his mother spoke, and he realised she hadn't gone back downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I know what you're thinking. Don't. Give things a chance. Wait until tonight, and sleep on it. You never know what life brings sometimes...\" She trailed off, but her mysterious tone of voice checked his depressed thoughts, momentarily stayed his mind from thinking the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why though Mom? I had plans, you know.\" He cleared his throat and ventured information he didn't want to share. \"You know...like, plans with someone?\" It wasn't a question but his tone rose as if he was really saying <i>Duh. Get the picture will you. I hate this stuff. I'm fifteen now. Not ten.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe your plans need a rethink, son. Because that person who you think we know nothing about, just might happen to be coming with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth dropped open in shock, and he copped a mouthful of lukewarm shower water, with suds. Gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up,\" She said, and he heard her shut the bathroom door. He wondered how they'd found out. <i>Catherine!</i> He gritted his teeth and began to towel off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
