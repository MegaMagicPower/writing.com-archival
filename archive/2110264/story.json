In this timeline events happen before any events of the game took place. That means going so far back the royal family is still together, Asriel is fine and living with his parents together in the royal palace. Neither the fallen child nor Frisk has arrived at this time so things here change if the events of the game happened at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. - During the Game. These events take place any time after Asriel has been lost and Toriel and Asgore have separated. Things can happen any time between then and the end of the game. That does not mean it has to follow the events of the game, just that it happens somewhere in the time frame of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. - After the Game. Monsters are now living on the surface thanks to saving them at the good ending of the game. The races co-mingle and everyone is helping to start anew. Asriel might even be saved thanks to the endless Determination of Frisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. - Alternate universe. In this reality Asriel never lost his soul. He grew up to be a strong and handsome young prince of the Underground. A land where monsters <i>choose</i> to live but can visit the surface any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. - Something else. Have a different idea for an alternate timeline? Start it here.</span></div></div>",

She had spend her teen years trying to best him, to land a single hit and prove herself to be the strongest. Now that she had become of age, that day seemed to be closer than ever. Talk began to spread that Asgore may even make her the captain of the royal guard! This was something that did not sit well with other... Less pure of heart monsters, who had been training for that very position as long, if not longer than Undyne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe culprits met each other one quiet night in the forest of Snowden. Three hooded figures met in a clearing, the shortest of the three producing a rather thick book bound in black leather. \"I think I've found just the thing to take care of our fish problem...\" The short figure said, placing the book upon a stump as they began to flip through its pages. The tallest figure snorted, \"Oh my, now where did you find such a grimoire..?\" The third, widest figure added, \"And now just any grimoire. That there's older, more sinister magic...\" The short figure bragged, \"You'd be shocked what kind of secrets are left laying around in the royal archives... Anyways, as I was saying.\" The short one suddenly stopped flipping through the pages, finding the curse they had picked out from earlier. \"Look at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figures poured over the page, the tall one laughing, the wide one tapping their chin in intrigue. The wide one spoke, \"Well well, I admire your creativity.\" The tall one bellowed, \"Ahahaha! It's too perfect! With all those weird human animes our fish has been indulging herself in... She'll finally look like one!\" The short one finished, \"Oh believe me, she'll be wishing they were that small when we're done..!\" The three conspiring figures then began to perform the ritual detailed in the book...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne tossed and turned in her sleep. She was beginning to sweat, her room reeking of warm sushi. Well, more than usual anyways. Her chest was starting to get very sore, each bud where her breasts should have grown in were starting to itch! The soreness turned into a painful numbing sensation, each space on her chest throbbing with a pins and needles feeling. The same you'd get if you fell asleep on your arm, or the kind you'd get in your cheeks if you blew into a balloon too hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish finally woke up, coated in sweat and dizzy. \"W-whuh... Who's there? What's...?\" As Undyne gained consciousness, her eyes focused on something strange. Two little tents stood in her typical black tank top. \"N-nnn....\" She began to groan, eyes widened, \"NGAAAAAHHHH?!\" She cried out, gripping each tent in her shirt. She felt a small amount of soft flesh pushing back against her palms, \"I-I have... Boobies?!?!\" Undyne called out in both shock and excitement! They were merely small B cups, but they still felt slightly sore... As if she were still experiencing growing pains...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does this curse proceed?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Asriel dreamed that he was floating in darkness, a endless void where time and space was nonexistent. He felt warm, safe, but not completely comfortable. The goat boy didn't know why but for some reason he could feel an intense pressure around his mid section, a pressure so bad that it felt like he was going to pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel wondered why he felt like this, searching his body all over. He looked completely normal, a scrawny goat child with a striped t-shirt and black pants. Maybe he should...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beep! Beep! Beep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a muffled gasp, Asriel's eyes popped open. He was greeted with darkness again, but this time he could see shapes that could be identified as furniture and walls. He was in his room, tucked away in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel became aware of the alarm clock still buzzing next to him, and he silenced it. Rubbing the sleep away from his eyes, the goat boy attempted to rise, but he felt a heavy weight press down on his abdominal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting, his eyes adjusting to the darkness, Asriel could make out a bulge the size of a basketball under his covers. Growing concerned, Asriel reached to the lamp next to his bed and turned it on. Now with better light, Asriel threw away his covers to identify the bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he found made him groan in frustration, thumping his head back on his pillow. \"O, great!\" he mumbled, \"Another food coma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel watched his hands run over his bloated tummy, which was the bulge that he saw earlier. He could feel how his skin felt as taut as a over inflated balloon, his stomach making furious gurgling sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was straining against the buttons of his night shirt, which was ironically patterned with pictures of Butterscotch and Cinnamon pie, the very food that bloated his gut to this immense size. Though, it wasn't his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past month and a half Toriel had been acting strangely. The goat boy was used to his mother's love and how she would enjoy eating her cooking, but recently Asriel noticed that she was making larger and more pies for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would beg him to eat every slice, and after he was filled to bursting Toriel would urge him to devour more. Asriel would tell her that he had enough, but then his mother would get that look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a look that could melt his heart, a look that he dreaded more than her anger or scolding. It was the look of disappointment. When he saw this, Asriel would take up another slice, force it down his throat, and do the same with other she brought to him, devouring tin after tin until he felt drowsy, going off into a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, he would wake up here, no doubted moved by his caring mother and even dressed in his pajamas. Asriel wondered how she got the buttons over the large ball of flesh. She probably used magic. But that was the least of his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asriel stood in front of the mirror, after he heaved himself out of bed, cradling his heavy belly to the wardrobe, he knew this had to stop very soon. He was soon re-dressed in his usual clothes, but he saw that it wasn't coping well with his weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly had grown so big that it caused his shirt to ride up inches above his navel. His moobs were developing, visibly pressing against his shirt too. His shorts felt tight, his love handles spilling over the waist line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his one arm, studying it, and he saw that it, along with his legs, were much thicker, stressing the seams of his shirt. He pressed his hands against his cheeks and he felt how soft it was, for it was becoming rounder, a double chin developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this had to stop soon, or he would end up unable to do anything soon. Asriel decided that he needed to go out, get some exercise, go on a diet. Smiling, he waddled out of the room, his feet thumping against the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he approached the kitchen, the goat boy could smell the scent of food. His mother was cooking again. Asriel bit his lower lip, which was a little bit thicker than usual. He knew what this meant. If she caught him he would have no chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel had to be very careful now. He began to tiptoe, but when he was almost at the door a floorboard creaked mercilessly loud under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asriel?\" Toriel called from the kitchen, \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goat boy gave a silent gasp. Though, he could still make it. He quickly waddled to the door, not caring anymore about the dozens of floorboards creaking under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached to the door handle, but did he manage to get outside?</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to let her latest creation burn, the sound of Toriel's footsteps retreated to the kitchen. Giving Asriel enough time in turn to slip out the door wand waddle down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of sight he heaved a sigh of relief. He loved his mother dearly and her cooking was incredibly wonderful, but there was just so much of it Asriel had a hard time eating it all. If only she made smaller portions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting it out of his mind for now, Asriel wandered out and down the path out along the upper level that overlooked the capitol city. It was a fairly busy place, monsters moved all about among the grey stone buildings. And yet it was eerie. So many buildings were just left empty, only about one in three had anyone living in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel had never questioned it before, but as he waddled along the path now it certainly seemed odd. Finally, panting just a little, he made it to the elevator. He wasn't looking forward to the next leg of things, but his mom would find him soon if he didn't keep moving. So he chose to ride the elevator down to the hottest location in the underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in Hotland, Asriel's fur dampened with sweat in minutes and his panting became stronger. Fortunately there were some respites like the hotel which he eagerly accepted in order to enjoy the cool air conditioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" came the voice of a monster behind the counter of a nearby burger joint, \"No loitering kid. Sorry. If you want to stick around maybe you could buy something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel groaned at the thought of more food, but his belly burbled in agreement. In the end he reluctantly bought a burger and a soda. He tried to make them last as he enjoyed the cool hotel lobby, sitting by the fountain and enjoying the soft splashes of water, but all too soon (sooner than he'd intended) he finished his burger and soda. Incredibly Asriel considered buying another just to stay there, but he had to keep moving. His Mom would be searching for him and much as he loved her food, anything she offered plus the burger he'd just consumed, he was sure would be enough to make him burst something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he'd barely left the hotel and traveled down the steps, near where the royal labs were when another friendly monster offered him a free sample of something he called 'Nicecream'. And it was nice. Again Asriel might have resisted but the heat from the lava flows was intolerable on his own padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately he just had to go a little further before he found the ferryman, a strange hooded monster who held others get around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where too son?\" the figure asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel considered it. one the one hand Waterfall was closer, but it was home to Undyne, the head of the palace guard.She was sure to hold Asriel until his mom showed up. Provided he ran into her at all. Snowden was probably safer, but it was closer to their other home, and Toriel was likely to guess her son was making his way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Asriel go?</span></div></div>",

It was the last place his mother would think to look for him; the chunky goat boy had no extra home there, like in the ruins, and no friends or family members to stay with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there was the threat of Undyne finding him, but Asriel, ten spite his corpulent state, was confident that he could avoid her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the waterfalls,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ferryman nodded and Asriel jumped aboard, causing the boat's back to dip greatly and the front to rise high due to the added weight. Ten spite how awkwardly it now stood in the waters, it sailed anyway forward to the waterfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tra la la la!\" the Ferryman sang, \"Hmmm, it appears that my boat had sprung a leak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel didn't know what he meant, for he saw no leaks in the boat. He then realised the the Ferryman might be slyly referencing to his weight. Asriel felt slightly offended, folding his thick arm across his moobs, but he didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Asriel arrived at his destination and jumped out, causing the boat's front to fall back into the water, sending a large splash that made the goat boy a little wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" Asriel waved his hand to the Ferryman as he climbed the stairs, who waved back.</span></div></div>",

The flight of stairs weren't even that long, but the goat boy found himself exhausted, like he ran a mile non stop. He leaned heavily against a wall, panting and sweating a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants were digging painfully into his waist and butt, and Asriel had to tuck at it and readjust it. After he rested, the goat boy pressed onwards. He was going to Tammie Village, where he knew that he would be safe for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to speed-walk, something he always saw some monsters back at the city, for his first exercise for the day, his butt cheeks sliding up and down against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, Asriel took in his surroundings. The light blue glow of the rivers and plant life gave the area a magical and otherworldly air. It was beautiful to Asriel. So mesmerized was the chunky goat boy that he didn't look were he was going and nearly fell into a river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he cart wheeled his arms to gain balance, he took a step back from the edge and looked for a bridge, but there was none. Asriel groaned, knowing that he had to swim across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped into the cool water, which came up to his flabby chest, and waded across. The current luckily wasn't strong and he could reach the other bank without delay, dragging his fat and wet body out of the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to his feet and proceeded onwards, but suddenly his clothes were feeling tight on him again. Asriel tried to adjust his clothes again, but to his horror saw that it was shrinking. He didn't know why at first, but then he remembered that his clothing was made out of material which, if not handled properly, shrank in cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel was able to get his shirt off, but his pants was another story. It shrank so badly that it couldn't slide down his thighs, fitting him like a second skin, large tears appearing in his pants. Asriel groaned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, could this day get any worse?\" Asriel thought in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then it did...</span></div></div>",

Asriel looked frantically around, searching for a hiding place, and he spotted one just up the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large amount of bushes filled the pathway. They, Asriel guessed, would come up just below his chin, and if he crouched down he would remain completely hidden. He waddled as quickly as he could, diving into the bushes. Soon enough, Undyne arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel watched her from the bushes. She was dressed from head to heel in armor, holding her glowing spear. To the goat boy she looked every inch like a stoic warrior. No wonder she was head of the Royal Guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne suddenly came to a halt, bending and picking up Asriel's shirt. The goat boy cursed himself inwardly for not taking it along with him. She held it, holding it in both hands and studying it, noting a few tears in it, which had appeared when it was shrinking on Asriel's thick frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndyne scanned the area for a few seconds, then began to walk again, shirt still in hand. On his hands and knees, his belly almost in the dirt, Asriel watched her move by with relief. Suddenly, his pants, under enormous strain from his ample behind, gave way with a loud rip, revealing his underwear beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel grit his teeth, his eyes growing wide. Undyne stopped dead in her tracks and looked towards where the sound came from. She was staring directly at where Asriel was hiding. The goat boy was frozen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes, which felt like hours to Asriel, passed, and, thankfully, Undyne proceeded to walk away, this time more slowly.

It was a marvel that he hadn't burst yet. The goat boy only moaned in response, feeling light headed and very tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel another food coma coming. Asriel didn't understand it. Why did his mother break her promise? She wasn't suppose to over feed him, let alone force feed him. But the more Asriel thought about it, the more it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically Toriel didn't break her promise. She wasn't the one force feeding him. Alphys was. In her massive test room, the royal scientist was using the goat boy as a test subject for a new feeder she invented for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a reservoir that had a hose attached to it, which had a clamp that was tied around Asriel's mouth, preventing him from spitting it out and forcing him to swallow the pink sludge that came from it. Whatever it was that he was eating, it didn't taste bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was so great that Asriel was always graving for more, never satisfied no matter how much he drank, even though he was stuffed like a turkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a no then,\" Toriel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel fastened the hose back on Asriel mouth. She turned back to Alphys, who was standing behind a glass window, and gave her a thumbs-up, signaling her to begin again. The scientist nodded and pressed a button on the panel before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine came to life, and Asriel could taste the delicious sludge filling his mouth. He began to swallow it, and with each swallow his belly got even bigger with the sound of a stretching balloon. Toriel could only watch her son grow with a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached over to a bottle filled with a special lotion and began to rub some of it on his growing gut. The stretching sound began to quiet down, and the redness around his outie belly button began to fade back to white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel couldn't help but moan pleasure. His mother's hands were working magic across his bloated tummy. He began to dose off, his body swallowing the sludge by itself.

At the Temmie Village he was going to buy just that. He had some GP left in the pocket of his torn pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoi!!

The cute dog only stared at him blankly, as if she didn't understand what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel groaned. \"Never mind,\" he said and waddled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the shop on his own and went inside, and Asriel was greeted by another Temmie, this one differing slightly in color. It's mouth, eyes and nose swam around her face, like it had a mind of its own, not completely attached to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was slightly freaky to Asriel, but he chose to ignore it. Clothing was the most important necessity right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoi! Welcom to Tem Shop!\" the cute dog exclaimed happily, \"Tem got stuff. Buy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Asriel said, \"Do you have clothes, big ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute dog blinked. \"Tem got clothes!\" the cute dog said, \"Tem got lots and loads of stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Asriel was dressed in clothes the goat boy could only describe as armor.

Go get ten shiny rocks for Tem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel didn't know what these shiny rocks were, or where to find them (they were most likely somewhere in this area), but the goat boy knew he had no choice, for he wouldn't get no bargain better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I still keep the armor on?\" Asriel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" the cute dog said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel smiled too and said, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as he waddled, he began to grow uneasy, for he felt that he was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around nervously, swearing every now and then that he saw a dark figure dart between the trees. He heard a twig snap, followed by the sound of feet scurrying away, and Asriel turned around, trying to locate the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is anyone t-there?\" he called, afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel suddenly felt his back bump into something, and he could tell that it wasn't a rock or tree.

He knew that it would be only a matter of time before his large figure is noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my mom's pies kinda made me fat,\" Asriel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't say fat,\" Sans said, \"I would rather say...big boned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO, bad puns.

Thankfully Asriel's obese body broke his fall. \"Oof!\" Asriel cried out, momentarily breaking out of his trance. He then realized how big he was. His stomach was on the ground, swollen out by fat itself. His shirt was now acting as a bra for his now fairly large moobs. His rear had swollen out more and was wobbling slightly from the impact. His arms and legs had bloated even more. Asriel also noticed how soft he was being this large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, my child?\" Asked Toriel concerned. \"I'mph fine mom,\" Asriel said as he chomped on what was left of an of another piece of pie. \"Can I get you something to drink in order to wash all that down before we continue?\" Asked Toriel, sweetly, patting Asriel's large stomach. \"Yes, that would be appreciated mom.\" Said Asriel, who was now back in his trance.

Asriel was reigned a hero. He now didn't mind being a giant, but there were a few problems that had been brought up. Some of them had been fixed but one still remained and that was he was very lonely. Being the only monster of his size, he got very lonely.

Once Toriel had taken it, all they needed to do was wait. Toriel wanted to surprise Asriel, so she went anywhere but Snowdin, which was where Asriel always stayed. Like Asriel, her hunger and thirst grew. Unlike Asriel though, the overconsumption didn't effect her belly, but instead, certain parts of her body. Mainly, her breasts, and rear. With each day, Toriel got taller. Her voice deepened as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  By the end of a few weeks, Toriel was near Asriel's height. But she wanted to be a little taller than him, probably, make him look at her now-massive breasts. Since there were only two places that she could stay now. Hotland or Waterfall, but she preferred Waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Meanwhile, in Snowdin, Asriel had gotten a few inches taller, His growth had slowed down during this time, For Asriel, he was glad that it was gonna stop soon, as he didn't want to hit the top of the cave. A few monsters had gotten his permission to lay on his body. It was weird, yes, but hey, it wasn't his fault he was so fluffy. But still, it was lonely having no one his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Asriel swore he felt the ground shudder a bit. But thought nothing of it. There it was again! This got his attention, so the monsters got off, as Asriel stood, his small horns barely touching the ceiling. He then heard footsteps. He couldn't believe his eyes.</span></div></div>",

The motherly boss monster had been doing a lot of extra shopping lately, though she didn't mind at all, as it felt good to have another mouth to feed in her lonely little house in the Ruins. Frisk, a human child, had recently come into her care, and she was set on making sure that they felt as comfortable with her as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goat-like monster paused briefly, looking at her bags. She'd gotten a lot of snails, hoping to make one of her favorite dishes, snail pie. As much as she loved it, though, it disappointed her that Frisk had so far politely declined to try even a bite every time she had made it, meaning she'd needed to make an entirely separate dish for them. She didn't mind that much, as she loved baking for them and didn't want to force the issue, but she did wish that Frisk would at least give the pies a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pst! Miss, a moment of your time?\" a voice called out to her, catching her attention. She turned to find a cloaked figure in the shadows, stepping forward. She frowned, ready to set her groceries down and use her fire magic if threatened, only for the figure to stop and raise their hands defensively. \"I mean no harm, ma'am! I merely wanted to offer you something! You have a lot of food there, so you're clearly planning on making something delicious! I merely wanted to give you something special to add an extra oomph to your meals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloaked figure produced a small bottle of brightly colored liquid. \"This special additive will highlight the best flavors of a dish tenfold while negating any nasty tastes from it! No meal can compare to one made with this! Even the fussiest of eaters will love anything a drop of this touches...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel listened to the spiel with suspicion... though, the more they talked, the more she felt that this would be the perfect solution to her problem. \"How can I be sure it's safe? And... how much is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure merely chuckled, pulling out a spider doughnut from their cloak and opening the bottle, the lid having an eyedropper on it. They dropped a little onto the doughnut, resealed the bottle, and proceeded to eat the doughnut. With just a single bite, they began moaning in ecstasy, soon devouring the entire thing. \"Apologies for the noise, even I haven't grown used to how very good this tastes! And as for price... well, consider it a gift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel bit her lip as she thought about her options here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly later, Toriel returned home, an extra ingredient added to her bags. Frisk came out to greet her as she prepared dinner, not seeing her add a few drops of the additive to her snail pie. And soon after, it was time for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel helped herself to a slice of the snail pie as Frisk sat down to wait for their separate dish. The motherly goat monster took a deep breath, then spoke up. \"Frisk, would you please reconsider trying the snail pie? It would mean ever so much to me if you'd give it a chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk grimaced a bit, but didn't outright refuse. The pie did smell oddly good for once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's Note: To cut back on chapters, I'm leaving Frisk's gender ambiguous until it's necessary so that there isn't just a chapter of selecting their gender. Also, in accordance with the rules set, Frisk will change if they grow. I don't care for that distinction, but I respect the author's wishes.)</span></div></div>",

At the first bite, however, her mood was immediately brightened by the explosion of flavor that hit her tongue. She let out a simply orgasmic moan, startling Frisk and causing her to blush. She didn't care that much, however, immediately addicted to the enhanced flavor of the pie. She quickly ate her slice, moaning all the while, then had a second... then a third...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk watched in confusion and concern as Toriel devoured the entire pie by the time they had eaten their one meal, only for her to then lick the plate and pie dish clean. She sat back with a sigh and a dull look in her eyes as she patted her stomach, which felt rather bloated from over eating so suddenly. She didn't care though; this felt amazing.

The first clue that led to something was amiss was the chair creaking ever so slightly. \"Must be the age of this thing catching up, I'll have to get a new one later.\" She thought and continued to read her book. But with each turn of the page, she got more tired. She decided that was enough for today, so she got up. But she almost struggled out of it. \"Phew, that was hard.\" She thought. She put the book back and headed to her room. As she made her way to her room, the floorboards creaked. She didn't mind, after all, this wasn't the first time this had happened. But her movements felt more and more sluggish. When she managed to get to her room, she fell asleep before she hit the bed. Unbeknownst to Toriel, some parts of her body were growing. Specifically, her breasts and butt. She didn't hear them growing, however, it did feel tense. Toriel moaned every few seconds, she didn't wake up. Her breasts swelled past a few cups, while her butt puffed 8 inches. Her thighs slowly thickened, to support her growing rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When Toriel awoke, the growth had stopped. She didn't notice her body, that was until she got up. Toriel was shocked to see her body this way. Her breasts were an F cup, her butt was also large, but not as large as her breasts. Toriel swore, she felt her thighs were touching each other. She also noticed that her bloated belly was gone. \"This...\" She hesitated, \"Must've been that additive drops that must've caused this. I must...\" Toriel looked at her body again, her robe wasn't too badly damaged during the whole ordeal, but it did feel a tiny bit tight now. Then a thought struck her.

Frisk also swore that they saw Toriel gaining height, to accommodate her new features. Toriel blushed deeply as she grew, it was a bit embarrassing to do this in front of Frisk, but the human didn't mind. When Toriel stopped growing, she felt her horns, tapping against the roof. Her breasts were now larger than 4 pumpkins put together. Her rear was also having a near-miss with the human, as it was mere inches away from Frisk's face. In response, the human quickly backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now the human was equally as curious if that addictive had that effect on Toriel, does it have the same effect on humans.

Frisk had also tried numerous times to add that addictive in their mother's food, but they were always caught. Frisk was getting frustrated with each day. Then one day, Frisk decided one more time they should put the addictive in her food. Like always Toriel saw them but didn't say anything. She felt bad for Frisk after all that human never ceased to give up and seeing them almost giving up was almost heartbreaking. Besides, Toriel was starting to miss that wonderful flavor and the pleasure it was to grow to. So, she pretended to be asleep. When the food was ready, Frisk told Toriel that it would be nice to eat out of the house, in the ruins. Toriel, acting confused, asked why did Frisk request that. They told Toriel that it was a while since they had a picnic together. Even though it was a lie, there was some truth behind it. Toriel agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she put the food, which was a nice old Grilled Cheese sandwich, which the human had made and left to an area of the ruins. The area in question was an old Favorite of Toriel, although it looked like it really needed an upgrade. Old pillars scattered here and there, with one on the ground in half and cracks were everywhere on the walls. Only the ground and a few open spots of grass remained in tip-top condition. The roof was one of the few areas in the ruins to be high enough to even fit a giant in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel picked a perfectly flat spot, laid down the cloth and brought out the sandwich. Toriel and Frisk each picked a slice. Now, they didn't know which one had the addictive in it, since the two slices looked practically identical. Toriel didn't know which one the addictive was in since she was in the living room. Frisk, should have to know which one it was in but they were too busy looking out for Toriel, thinking that she would 'wake up' at any moment. Even if Frisk wasn't being watchful of Toriel, it was possible that they had the wrong slice. So Frisk wasn't really sure.

Frisk brushed their head with relief, as they watched their mother grow. Toriel's breasts swelled larger and her rear puffed even more. They also saw Toriel getting taller and taller. Somehow by some magic, her robe stayed on and always adjusted to the growing monster. Toriel then or at least tried to get up, while still growing. That proved to be extremely hard to do while growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This growth was lasting longer this time. Frisk nor Toriel actually predicted it would last this long but it did. It took a while but eventually, her growth stopped. Toriel had almost reached the size of the room and was halfway to the roof. If she was standing, she would've gone through mostly rock and dirt. Her breasts were extremely large, and her rear was huge but it was just not as massive as her breasts. Toriel didn't dare to stand as if she was afraid of causing a collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was worried For Frisk, either the human left the room or ah! There they were, on her breasts. Frisk smiled though they wished the addictive was here but it was left back at the house. Toriel sighed. \"Well, that was-\" Toriel stopped herself. Her voice was deep and loud. The area shook a bit, causing dust to fall onto the ground. Suddenly a large slab of rock fell from the roof and hit her breasts. It just barely missed the human by a few meters. The area was collapsing. Toriel couldn't move and even if she would take most of the damage, she would still be dusted. Frisk burrowed into the crevice in her chest and hoped for the best. Toriel wanted to grow bigger to get out of here but couldn't unless she had magic to do it.</span></div></div>",

However, the magic build was starting to cause her body to grow again,  she grew a few inches here or there, her breasts swelled even larger, but even more slowly, the same thing was going on with her rear, but most of this magic was being put into her stomach, which was swelling bigger and bigger. Toriel was too focused on the falling debris and her magic to feel her stomach warming and the feeling of bloatedness. Like a hot air balloon, her stomach blimped into her line of sight but she was too focused to notice. Toriel closed her eyes, as she had noticed an extremely large piece of rock falling towards her, and developed her fireball quickly. As she did, her belly began going back to normal, but her extra height and larger curves remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk also closed their eyes, feeling the warmth of her mother's breasts as a way of comfort.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toriel and Frisk cleaned up from dinner together, Frisk imagining the effects of more on Toriel's lovely body, while their expanded adopted mother tried to get the memory of that divine taste out of her mouth. The flavor had been overwhelming, so great that all other things she'd eaten in her long life paled in comparison. She desperately wanted more, but the side effects were so embarrassing, and on top of that what if they did more than just expand her bust? She couldn't risk it, even if it did feel like she could still smell the substance in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Toriel realized she wasn't imagining things. Something smelled good... really good. She sniffed the air, mind dropping thoughts of resistance as it locked on to the scent and made her stomach gurgle, begging for more food. Frisk was oblivious in the other room, unaware of their mother coming towards them, sniffing like a hound hunting a rabbit. Until, that is, she came up behind them, placing her hands on their shoulders. Toriel blushed, realizing that the smell was coming from Frisk from the additive they had ingested. She tried to stop herself, resisted the urge for a moment, before the hunger kicked back in and took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large, busty goat monster lifted up Frisk with ease, holding the small, surprised human child in her hands. She pulled them into a tight hug, holding them against her soft breasts as she licked their face, tasting the human with a moan. They tasted... amazing. Divine even. she knew this was wrong, but at the moment she was a slave to instincts, unable to stop herself. Frisk's constantly closed eyes almost shot open as their head was suddenly shoved into Toriel's moaning mouth, their mother attempting to swallow them whole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk struggled and even tried to FIGHT, but it was no use at this point. They were pushed slowly into Toriel's surprisingly stretchy maw, sliding down her tight throat. With a pop, their entire body went in, gulped down until they landed in her stomach. Oddly, there was no fluid in here, as monsters, being made of magic, had a different sort of biology to the creatures of the world above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frisk!? Oh no, oh no no no what have I done?\" they could hear Toriel crying out as she snapped out of it. \"H-hang on, I'll get you out of there before... before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off, her voice growing slightly hazy, before the goat mother giggled slightly. \"Oh~... Oh, dear, what is this... feeling... mmmm~ Frisk... I'm sorry but you... you tasted... so good! And the way you fill my belly... I can't wait to add you to my curves~... you'd like that wouldn't you, padding out these breasts and butt you love so much~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk pounded on her stomach, and Toriel seemed to come to her senses again. \"F-Frisk! I'm truly sorry, I don't know what's come over me! Please, don't worry! I love you, and I'll get you... get... out... mmmm... or... maybe you should stay in there, become a part of me... forever~...\" It was like Toriel was bouncing between two personalities, and Frisk was feeling frightened. Especially as it began to feel strange inside this stomach. It was hard to describe, but it was sort of like... they were melting. Realizing that Toriel's magic stomach was absorbing them, Frisk panicked, struggling further, which just earned a giggle from the mind-altered Toriel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Frisk got an idea. As their body broke down, they desperately did something they hadn't done in a while: pull up their menu to LOAD back to a SAVE point. As their body started to lose form, Frisk hit the button, finding themselves in a bright flash. When it faded, they were safe and unharmed outside of Toriel's house, relieved to have traveled back to before all of this happened. Stepping inside, though, the human child found a disturbing sight: Toriel, sitting on the floor, still expanded and still sporting a large round yet rabidly shrinking belly, staring at them in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frisk!? But I thought... how did you... oh, my child, I'm so happy you're safe!\" Frisk found himself scooped up into a hug again, panicking slightly before realizing with relief that Toriel wasn't trying to eat them this time. It seems, despite the LOAD not working right, that they at least no longer smelled of the additive. Still, this was troubling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Toriel's stomach was gone, and her breasts and ass swelled dramatically from eating Frisk (who, oddly was still in their belly after getting out? Perhaps Frisk merely made a new version of himself safe outside... now there's a terrifying though...), further straining her robe and catching Frisk's attention. They were a bit terrified of what happened... but admittedly excited by the results. They would have to be careful from now on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frisk, somewhat reluctantly, finally decided to humor their adoptive mother's wishes and nodded, holding out their plate for a slice. Toriel smiled wide and gladly plopped one down on his plate before digging into her own slice. The moment the slimy, snaily goodness of that slice hit Toriel's tongue, an explosion of flavor unlike anything she'd ever experienced before washed over her, overwhelming her senses to the point that she could only moan in absolute bliss at the taste of it. She began to dig into her slice of pie as though she were starving, slightly disturbing Frisk as they slowly guided a forkful to their own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it went, and Frisk's normally narrowed eyes went wide. The texture was, to be frank, disturbing, almost enough to make Frisk not want to swallow. But the taste... it was so good that Frisk managed to push through the initial disgust and send it down before going back for another bite. Their progress through the slice was slower than Toriel's though, and by the time they had finished the delicious yet slimy treat, their mother had already devoured the entire rest of the pie in her frenzy. Frisk, deprived of the chance to have seconds, huffed silently at Toriel with a look of frustration, causing the boss monster to blush as she came down from her gluttonous frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear... I'm terribly sorry, my child, I've no idea what came over me! Tell you what, why don't I make another tomorrow, and then I promise that I'll let you have as much of it as you want!\" Frisk seemed to accept this and nodded, still huffing at having to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, dinner progressed as normal for Frisk as Toriel, full from the pie, began to clean up. As she did, though, she felt... odd. There was a strange warmth in her stomach, along with a feeling... as though she could feel herself digesting her meal. The slight bulge the pie had added to her belly was rapidly dwindling, and as it did the warmth spread to her chest and rear. Both were already fairly impressive on her tall, thick figure. But, as she carried dishes to the kitchen, she could swear they felt more... cumbersome than usual. Her robe seemed tighter in the chest and hips, and she swore she could feel it rising on her. As she began to bump into things with them, she looked down and gasped to find them swelling out before her eyes, albeit rather gradually, only just fast enough to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel's thoughts raced for explanation before the only difference from her normal routine came to mind. The flavoring she'd added! It must have caused this! \"Oh, I should have known this was some sort of practical joke! Well, I don't find it funny!\" She stomped her foot, causing her newly enlarged breasts to jiggle under her tightening robes. Before, she was proportionally about a D-cup. Now, she was reaching and passing F-cup. Realizing this, she couldn't help but blush a little... as upset as she was, she couldn't deny there was something... pleasant about this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached up to grope herself, moaning softly from the sensation before stopping as she realized something. Frisk had eaten the pie too... less than she had, but still... she rushed out to see what was happening to her child, crying out \"Frisk!\" in a panic as she saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Frisk blinks awake slowly, sits up in bed and yawns, stretching. After realizing it was a Saturday, they leisurely get up and get dressed in what's pretty much the one outfit they own, accessories notwithstanding. As they enter the hallway, they can smell something delicious emanating from the house's kitchen, and they can hear the floorboards creaking under the heavy bare footfalls of their surrogate mother, as she waddles about preparing the two of them breakfast. Toriel had always loved baking, as long as Frisk had known her, and as she'd lived alone for so long and had no one to share her creations with but herself, she'd developed an apparent love of eating as well. At least, Frisk drew this conclusion after Toriel ate herself into a state of obesity in the short time they've lived on the surface. Every day seemed to bring a new recipe she tried, a new ingredient she discovered, and several extra pounds. Of course, Frisk didn't mind at all, not for a second, as that only meant more delicious food to try, and more Toriel to hug and snuggle. Frisk excitedly entered the kitchen to see what their massive, beautiful, and consistently growing parent had decided to prepare for herself today-oh, and for Frisk (though she always ended up enjoying the hugely proportioned lions share of her work, which was fair considering she made it). Upon hearing Frisk enter, Toriel turned her head to see them, and smiles warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, hello, my child! You're just in time to try the...\" she turns and reads the title that was given with the recipe she'd found. \"The \"Heart-attack snack.\" You won't believe how much butter is in this!\" She smiled once more, hoisting the tray up and resting it on her shelf like belly, just in front of her breasts. She waddled over to the kitchen table, working to balance the dish as her thick legs kick into the underside of her gigantic belly with every step she took, her steps too being made awkward by the multiple pounds of fat that had distributed themselves into her massive three-toed bare feet. She made her way over to the tables, the very floor she walked on creaking under her weight, and she sets the so called \"Heart-attack snack\" on the table, which creaked under the weight of the dish alone. She then sits her monstrosity of an ass down, sighing in relief as her feet were freed of the burden of carrying her tremendous weight, briefly wiggling and flexing her toes upon the release. The five chairs she sat in, all placed side by side just to contain her, and yet her ass still overwhelming them and spilling out enough for two more on each side and then some, groaned and bent in unacknowledged protest. Toriel exhales in relaxation, her belly easily filling her entire lap, spilling out past her knees, and pushing the table forwards a bit to accommodate its enormity. She then looked eagerly at Frisk, having to stretch her fat-roll covered neck a bit to see over her massive boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Frisk sat down across from Toriel, who loomed large and was significantly wider than the table itself, and looked curiously at the monumental amount of food she'd set before them. Frisk could definitely see how it got its name. The thing looked to be some kind of bacon-sausage casserole thing, and true to Toriel's word frisk could see the entire thing glistening with butter, not to mention it sat in a pool of the stuff, had it slathered on top and in between every layer, and it looked like several layers were just made of deep fried butter if they weren't mistaken. It also looked like it incorporated three full grown pigs' worth of bacon, and two more in sausage. There were other ingredients holding it all together, but Frisk couldn't identify them as easily. But, the fact that this thing was probably larger and weighed more than Frisk themselves, combined with it literally saturating the air around it with fat so much that Frisk felt like they were full after just smelling it, they knew this thing could probably clog a whale's arteries, and Frisk couldn't wait to try it. More importantly, they couldn't wait to watch Toriel eat almost all of it, finishing whatever Frisk couldn't (because that's what she's tended to do of late). It was truly a wonder Toriel was still clothed, as the dress she was on the verge of bursting out of barely clinging to her form and splitting along almost all the seams, exposing puffy little bubbles of soft, furry white flesh. It was honestly a wonder it lasted this long, and Frisk had often suspected it was actually two of her dresses stitched together. She waited eagerly for Frisk to take their share, the table creaking as her belly fat encroached and spilled onto it. She waited for Frisk despite the obvious hungry glint in her eye as she looked at the caloric nightmare before her because she knew if Frisk didn't take their part first, she'd finish it all, leaving them none. Frisk did take a slice, a quite large slice by normal standards, though it didn't make a dent in the meal as a whole. After taking one bite, they were overwhelmed by the sweet sweet taste, they felt it sit heavy in their stomach, and they knew right there and then that there is no way they could finish their whole slice. This was the fattiest, greasiest, most decadent meal Toriel had prepared to date, and that's saying something. Frisk resolved to finish what they could, and give the rest to Toriel, as they took a second bite which made them feel like their stomach would explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After feeling stuffed to the limit after only three bites of the increasingly aptly named \"Heart-attack snack\", Frisk looked up at Toriel and was almost surprised for a second, before happily settling down their fork to watch the show. Toriel was absolutely loving the dish, having cut a slice big as Frisk's head, and greedily stuffing her face with it. As she quickly finished the slice, she went for a second, barely managing to reach her pudgy arms around her own bulk to grab the meal, and when she finally did manage she simply lifted the whole thing to her face, and in a show of remarkable gluttony, began to lap up as much as she could, getting grease, melted butter, and meat juices all over her first few chins. She used both chubby hands to grab all she could at once, and stuffed herself relentlessly, her form actually slowly expanding as she ate, mostly her belly, the seams on her outfit splitting more and more with every passing second, the five chairs bending and groaning more and more, beginning to splinter, and her expanding belly pushing the table further and further towards Frisk. By the time she dropped the tray, which bounced once off her belly before clattering onto the table, completely cleared of all its contents, everything was on the verge of giving way under her enormous body, the chairs barely structurally sound, and the dress little more than rags clinging together by a thread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ahh...tha-<b><i>BRUARRRP</i></b>-at- excuse me, that was...\" Toriel paused, and looked over herself at Frisk and their unfinished slice, that hungry glint in her eye returning. \"Oh! My...my child, you didn't finish your slice!\" Frisk simply nodded, and slid the plate more over to Toriel. Toriel licked her lips, and even as she reached out with one fat arm, trying to no avail to reach it over herself, she said \"Oh, dear, no I couldn't...you mustn't starve yourself, dear!\" Frisk only got up, and brought the slice right up to within her reach. \"Oh- well...I suppose I can't go starving myself either, can I?\" With that, she grabbed the slice in her greedy, pudgy, plump little fingers, lifted it to her endlessly hungry maw, dropped it in and swallowed it and- in one move, like magic, a sight Frisk might've considered themselves blessed to witness, Toriel finally exploded out of her dress, purple fabric flying everywhere, and broke all five chairs at once, landing firmly on her ass with an impact that shook the house's foundation and made Frisk literally jump off the ground a little, her belly covering the entire length of her legs so that only her huge feet were protruding from under her own bulk, furious jiggles cascading across her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She simply sat stunned for a moment, as if it hadn't even begun to occur to her she was gaining weight until this very moment, until she...</span></div></div>",

The remains of her dress slide around on her front like a bib that gradually fall away, exposing her enormous belly and a pair of sagging breasts each the size of a beach ball and capped with saucer sized nipples that began to harden in the cool air of the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Toriel prodded her sides and felt her gurgalling middle stil slowly swelling with the tons of calories she's infused it with, she couldn't help breaking out in a small smile. A smile soon turned into a giggle, and then a full blown laugh as she wobbled and shook from her spot on the floor, seated atop the crushed remains of the chairs and a rear end that could have filled a couch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is... everything alright?\" Frisk asked somewhat hesitantly, looking over the massive mound of goatmom as she sat wobbling on the floor, \"You're not hurt are you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel slowly stifled her laughter and smiled at Frisk, \"I'm alright my child.

I was born to just another of the monster families. Things were certainly different back then...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel heaved a sigh reminiscing a little as she worked to get her tree-trunk thick legs under her, \"Back then there was little food for any of the monsters not rich or of nobility. Asgores father who fought in the war so long ago was hard and stern. He didn't neglect other monsters, but he was more... pragmatic than anything else. When monsters first went underground he rationed all the food we brought until more could be found. Everything was carefully measured out to the barest minimum so we could survive for years before new food could be found.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel paused as she got to the hardest challenge of standing up straight. Her free hand was placed on the table which groaned dangerously as she hauled herself up. She barely made it before there was a loud 'CRACK' and one of the table legs broke. She just barely managed to regain balance in time, though not before pushing Frisk into the counter and smushing them into her soft side. It was another five seconds before Toriel could shift her weight the other way and Frisk was released with a small gasp.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my dear!\" Toriel gasped, \"Are you alright my child?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Frisk managed a smile, \"I'll be ok, just had the wind knocked out of me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel giggled, \"Dear me, this new size is going to be most troublesome if this continues.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you're not going to try and diet and loose weight?\" Frisk asked, more curious than anything as they looked over the massive goat monsters full figure with a belly that hung almost to the floor and hips of amazingly wide sizes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel smiled, \"Why should I? Beauty is how one feels not how one looks. And I honestly feel wonderful. So soft and warm, like being wrapped in a big thick blanket filled with pillows.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But if you get much bigger...\" Frisk pointed out, their mental image of Toriel being a rolling mass of white flab filled hills, \"Then you won't be able to fit through the doors. Or leave the house. Or even cook.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel paused to think about it. \"Hmm, that is a problem. Well we do have a library full of books of magic spells we brought when we came to the surface. Maybe one of them will have an answer. Though as far as I know no monster has ever grown as large as this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Magic can't always solve everything,\" Frisk cautioned her, thinking about their own many uses of 'saves' and 'resets' in the underground and the single monster left behind that made the child's heart ache, \"Maybe Alphys has some solution? She's got that huge lab now and maybe she's come up with something that could help.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh I hat to bother her though,\" Toriel replied,gently nibbling her thicker lower lip in worry,\"She's so busy now with all those contracts and things by big businesses. She's probably far too busy to help.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I doubt she's too busy to help a old friend,\" Frisk smiled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel looked unsure as she thought it over.

We can search the library, and if we don't find anything useful <i>then</i> we can pay Alphys a visit.\" Toriel said, her stomach still gurgling, working to digest the thousands of calories she'd recently consumed into yet more fat, thickening her already corpulent form to an even greater extreme.<br>\r\n   Frisk nodded. \"Alright, that sounds fair to me.\"<br>\r\n   With a smile and a nod that she was barely able to perform with her many chins and neck flab firmly encapsulating her head, Toriel began to heave her soft, heavy bulk towards the library. She was moving rather slowly, the rest of her body being in a similar state as her head, rolls and rolls of white furred flesh pressing into itself, all the bulging round fat competing to take up as much space on her body as it could. Her belly protruding outwards and covering her legs down to the ankles as she stood up. Her legs, so thick they were forced to be spread, reducing her ambulation to an impeded waddle. She felt her legs kick softly into her belly with every slow, awkward step. She even felt the top of her feet repeatedly brush against the underside, her feet too having swollen to such a size it added to the struggle of her movement, each foot heavy and difficult to lift, plus large enough to be awkward, each toe like a basketball sized pillow and her bare soles pressing into the ground under her immense weight and the fat spreading out in little pools, the floorboards creaking dangerously under them. <br>\r\n    Despite her tremendous heaviness, each impact on her flab, each time she kicked her belly, each bare footstep resonating throughout her body with an audible loud <b><i> FWUMP</i></b> noise, her body was sent jiggling and rippling, quivering so much it set her balance off to the point where if her huge bare feet weren't giving her such a strong base, she'd probably fall over. Frisk watched in fascination as their monstrously obese surrogate mother made the journey from the table to the door which should take five seconds at most in over a minute, jiggling and wobbling all the way. Of course, Frisk didn't mind one bit in spite of themselves, it only gave them more time to watch their completely naked guardian inadvertently jiggle, and they had a particularly good view of her ass, large enough to crush to overflow a sofa, it was sufficient for providing a good counterbalance for her belly as she waddled. Each cheek was much larger than Frisk, easily, and it was astonishingly perfect and round, considering the sagging that normally occurred with obesity to a degree even half as extreme as Torie's. Frisk thought it was the fact that her ass was squeezed between thighs like an oak tree and a flabby staircase of back fat that made it jut out so much while retaining such a glorious shape.<br>\r\n    When Toriel finally made it to the door, she leaned on the frame, panting. The frame cracked and splintered, a part of it breaking off. She clumsily stood upright again, despite the weariness that came with heaving her blob of a figure around. She let her fat arms rest at her side, their definition lost in favor of doughy flab, which poured out as her arms laid on her love handles, which had been pushed up laying on her wide, tremendous hips. Her arms, while sitting on these natural cushions, were almost jutting right out on both sides like she was T-posing. Her hands were thick like mittens, and less dexterous than they used to be. It was all she could do to ball them into fists, and her palms and fingers have grown so much she couldn't even close it all the way. Her wrists had been swallowed by her own arm fat, and she let her hands dangle lazily in midair. <br>\r\n   She looked at the doorway in front of her, her breasts resting on her belly and thus being lifted into her vision, and even pressing into her bottom couple chins. This obscured part of the doorway, giving her the general perspective of there being two white furry mountains blocking her view, she couldn't see the nipples from where she was. What she could see of the doorway though made her sigh. She could tell just by looking that it'd be a tight squeeze through, if she was lucky. She steeled herself, thinking of all the food she'd be able to eat freely once they solved the few problems that came with an ever increasing size like hers. She waddled forwards determinedly, and with all the strength she could muster, jammed her gut through the doorway. The wood creaked and bent slightly, but she managed to get her entire stomach through. She gripped the frame as best she could with her soft hands, and pulled, attempting to get the rest of her body to pass through. Her gigantic bare feet pushed against the hardwood floor, the excess fat on her six toes pooling outwards as she pushed herself forwards with enough force that the floor groaned, bent, and a few disturbing cracks were heard, before with one great shove she finally popped through, both sides of the doorway being torn off to make room as she did. This great breakthrough, literally, had Toriel slam into the floor, which emitted more unsettling cracking, belly first. She lay on the soft cushion of herself, panting heavily. Frisk, Still in the kitchen, was gifted with the phenomenal show of Toriel's ass jiggling so violently Frisk could almost feel the vibrations, directly under that beautiful sight was Toriel's bare feet, which she'd fallen off of, her big round toes resting on the ground and her engorged heel pressing against the bottom of her ass. They were scrunched up slightly, and her soles had so much fat on them that they too were jiggling, though to a lesser degree than her ass.<br>\r\n  Frisk stood transfixed by the sight, and only when they heard the heavy panting from such a great effort did they remember that this billowing hill of flab, this beautiful monument to gluttony, was their mother- surrogate mother, excuse me. Frisk ran over, clearing the distance in one second, to the front of Toriel, her fattened hands hanging limp in her arms, and her face ringed in neck and chin. Plus, from this angle, Frisk could see her large, soft, light pink nipples. Toriel looked up at Frisk, and smiled, abashed. <br>\r\n  \"My...<i>huff</i>...child...This is...<i>huff</i>...somewhat embarrassing...But, would you...<i>huff</i>... bring me a snack? Just...<i>huff</i>...You know, for....<i>huff</i>... helping me regain some...<i>huff</i>... energy.\"  Toriel asked, that same hungry glint in her eye.<br>\r\n  Frisk nodded, \"Sure, of course, anything you need.\" Toriel smiling delightedly, Frisk hurried to the kitchen, and grabbed as many boxes of cookies as they could carry, as well as a gallon of whole milk from the fridge. Dutifully, Frisk returned to Toriel, who licked her lips and greedily reached for the cookies, but let her arm relax again once Frisk simply began stuffing them into her perpetually hungry maw. All Toriel had to do was chew and swallow, as Frisk did their best to keep her mouth full every second. Once she blazed through the twenty three boxes of two dozen cookies each, Frisk poured the full gallon of milk down her gullet, which she greedily guzzled all of in a matter of seconds. She licked her lips, and said <br>\r\n\"Thank you...my child...but I'm still... hungry.... how ab<i>bb<b>bBBRRUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPP</b></i>-out a bit more?\" Frisk simply nodded, and ran around the absolute blob that was their guardian to return to the kitchen. This time they grabbed a few party-sized bags of chips, a few of those big bags of candy bars you get around Halloween, and several boxes of donuts. Frisk also put some thick pizzas in the oven, in preparation just in case her appetite flared up again and she asked for more. Of course, Frisk was right, and despite Toriel's eager expressions, and her flabby arms and fat-incapacitated hands reaching out slightly, Frisk made sure to feed her slowly, and pace it so that the pizzas would have time to cook. Of course, once Toriel had swallowed the last donut, without even pausing to take a breath, she gasped out instantly, <br>\r\n   \"M-more! More! Please, my child, just a bit more!\" Frisk smiled and ran to the kitchen, getting out the pizzas, warm and aromatic, balancing them all in a massive stack. They also grabbed two alarmingly full five-liter bottles of soda, carrying them under their arms. While they were at it, they grabbed one of Toriel's many pies that she'd baked, and had stored to eat at a later date. Curiously enough, as Toriel grew bigger and bigger, it looked like her pies were doing the same. The one Frisk grabbed was a monster of a confection, the size of a truck tire, pouring out overflowing from the tin on all sides and swelling high into the air, it looked like a crispy golden-brown bubble, almost ready to burst with fruit, cinnamon, cream, butter, pudding, and whatever else Toriel desired to stuff herself with. Frisk returned to keep feeding Toriel, whose eyes lit up when she saw the feast, her maw hanging open and her thick tongue sticking out, salivating so much it poured down her first couple chins. Frisk stuffed her with reckless abandon, not even giving her a second to take a breath, her body jiggling so violently from her ravenous eating Frisk could feel the vibrations. Frisk had to work particularly hard to scrape all the messy gooey contents of the bloated pie into Toriel's mouth, making sure she didn't miss a single ounce of potential body fat. Once that was all finished, Toriel sputtered for a moment, before choking out \"More!!\" Frisk dutifully ran to the kitchen, but paused, realizing Toriel was literally expanding by the second, and they had to squeeze past her, body pressing into her soft toes, just to get to the doorway. Frisk thought it would be best to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Frisk went to the freezer, devising a little plan to take advantage of Toriel's borderline dangerously rampant gluttony. Frisk grabbed several tub shots of ice cream, their hands were almost getting numb just from holding it, it was so cold. On top of that, Frisk grabbed a massive pitcher of chocolate milkshake and returned to Toriel's head, having a little more trouble getting around her this time, having to scramble over her huge footpaws. Her head was sunken slightly deeper into her fat, her cheeks seemed to have gotten pudgier and she looked like she grew another chin or two. She reached her thick, fattened arms forwards slightly, her elbows too engulfed in fat to bend all the way, and her handpaws unable to clench completely shut, yet she still reached out greedily for the food. Frisk was sure to be as fast as they possibly could, considering they had to stand on their tip toes now to reach Toriel's mouth, as her growing belly had lifted her higher off the ground as she laid on it, allowing her to demolish the ice cream and take the entire gallon-pitcher of milkshake like a shot. It happened in an instant, Toriel began to cry out for more again, but yelped in sudden pain. She gritted her teeth and scrunched her eyes shut, trying to reach up to clutch at her head, but her arms had grown so fat she could barely manage to get them to above her shoulders. <br>\r\n    \"Are you okay? What's wrong?\" Frisk asked, sounding concerned.<br>\r\n    \"Ohhhh, <i><b>urp</b></i>- I- <i>hic</i>-oh dear...\"  Toriel shook her head quickly, as much as she could at least considering her tire of neck flab, an action which made her entire body wobble slightly. \"I- I suppose I allowed my own enthusiasm get the better of me, I ate all that ice cream so rapidly it gave me a rather painful trigeminal headache...\"<br>\r\n    Frisk blinked, and asked \"You mean...you got a brain freeze?\" Of course, Frisk knew that was what happened. They were counting on it. They didn't want to just tell Toriel to stop eating, and they figured this was as good a way to get her to stop of her own accord as anything. Toriel looked at Frisk, with an amused little smile on her face.<br>\r\n    \"Brain freeze? Is that what humans call it? My goodness, that's such a charming thing to call such an annoying phenomenon, I like it! Fortunately, it's not hard for me to warm up quickly, considering all my-\" She blinked, remembering the reason she entered the library at all. \"Oh- of course! That reminds me, we have to find some spell that can help me with my maneuverability issues.\" Toriel began to move, but stopped. She was still laying on her belly, and she found that no much she strained, tried to push herself up, and get up, she simply couldn't. So many doughy rolls of flab were competing for space squishing into one another and piled high on her back, that she could hardly bend her spine even an inch. Her useless arms were so fat she couldn't fully reach them out in front of her, and even if she could there was no way she'd be able to get past her boobs. Her legs were definitely much larger than her arms, but they were also much thicker, thighs constantly pressing into each other and the calves touching slightly, even as they were forced into a permanently more spread position by her invasive belly, and her mind boggling thickness was to such an insane degree that she couldn't bend her knees at all. Her feet were large enough to where even as she was lifted off the ground by her own enormity, she could get her larger than basketball sized toes to reach and press into the floor, though not much beyond that, and it was nowhere near the leverage she needed to stand herself up. She sighed and bowed her head slightly, seeming to retreat into her small sea of chins. She then looked down at Frisk, who from her perspective and compared to what she could see of her huge, naked body, looked particularly small. She gave a bit of a guilty smile, and said \"Hehe....ah, speaking of maneuverability issues, my child...would you...mind helping me up?\" Frisk looked up at the quivering mountain of furry white flesh before them. They were suddenly filled with a rush of determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After a good fifteen or twenty minutes of backbreaking manual labor, for Frisk at least, Toriel allowing herself to relax and lazily sink into her own comfy flab as her surrogate child did all the heavy lifting--literally--, Frisk finally managed to get the immense blob of their surrogate mother standing on her own two oversized feet. Of course, this task was made especially hard because she was close enough to the doorway still, and when Frisk had crawled under her surging tide of fat, and slowly rolled her back into a standing position, her gigantic ass pressed into the wall, somehow wider than the doorway she'd already broken both sides of. In the end, it gave way under her monstrous weight, and the doorway was damaged even more so than before. <br>\r\n    \"Ahhhh....thank you, my child.\"  Toriel waddled a few feet forwards, slowly, facing the same obstacles to mobility that she did earlier, but slightly more extreme, her belly almost resting on her feet now when she stood still. Every time she lifted a heavy foot, it took her a good five seconds or so to lift the sole off the ground so it didn't just drag along, and every footfall was fast, a visible relief to no longer have to lift the burdensome weight of a single foot. Every step she took sounded like a metric ton of pillows being dropped from a building, the floorboards creaked and splintered beneath her, and the impact made Frisk jump every time. <br>\r\n<i><b>FWHOMPH.....FWHOMPH.....FWHOMPH</b></i>. Slowly, clumsily, laboriously, she made her way to the large sofa in the middle of the room, and even though so much hard work was done to stand her up such a short time ago, she immediately plopped her fat ass down once again. She let out a relieved sigh, and took a moment to catch her breath, lugging her weight around truly being a chore by this point. Her ass was enough to completely fill the couch on its own, the flesh overflowing on all sides, pouring out over both armrests as well as the backrest. The couch was just barely holding itself together underneath her, and Frisk was surprised it didn't just collapse immediately. Her belly protruded way out in front of her, so big it rested on the ground and pooled out a bit. It was round somehow not sagging, and so big that even as the bottom of it was on the floor, the top of it was rising up, pushing her engorged breasts into her chins, bunching them all up. She was forced to bend backwards as far as her rolls of back flab would allow her to, and her legs were spread wide as she could, forced into that position all to make room for her astounding gut. Since her legs were far too fat to bend at the knees, they were just kicked out in front of her, of course pushed by her belly to be like a forty five degree angle away from their original position. <br>\r\n    Her big fat bare feet were kicked up in front of her, making her look very relaxed, which she was wrapped in the comfort of her hundreds of pounds of flab. She had her heels resting on the floor, the fatty flesh spreading out in a little pool of flab, her toes were sticking right up vertically in the air, which showed her pillowy soles off to anyone close to her. When Frisk stood next to her feet, her soles alone from heel to ball were a little bit taller than Frisk was, and twice as wide, not even counting the three massive toes on each foot, each one larger than Frisk's head. She shouldn't have been able to move them much, her skeletal structure being so completely frowned in all her flab, and that included her feet, but she was slightly wiggling her toes, stretching and flexing them as much as she could, considering the omnipresent obstacle that was her fat, her bulging white flesh on the soles squishing together into little rolls when she curled her toes, scrunching up the pounds of excess softness on her paws alone, every movement making the flab on her footpaws jiggle ever so slightly, but enough it notice. It looked like Frisk could use one of her footpaws as a huge, squishy, wriggling mattress it was so big, soft, and pure glowing white. Frisk was suddenly distracted from the strange direction they found their inner monologue taking, when they heard the doughy, heavenly white, stark naked mountain of flab with footpaws that was their mother- surrogate mother of course- speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"...<i>pant</i>...I'm...<i>pant</i>...hungry...<i>pant</i>...\" Frisk blinked, and looked up, needing to take a few steps back to make out the greedy little face past the fleshy obstruction of her belly, hips, and love handle. Frisk was...well, not as surprised as they would've been. Knowing Toriel, it makes complete sense she'd wanna get back to engorging herself with food after a while chapter dedicated to getting her not to do that.<br>\r\n    \"Are you sure? I mean, we did come here specifically for-\" Toriel cut him off.<br>\r\n    \"Oh, I know what we're here for, but we're already here now. We don't have to walk any further, which means I can take a moment to rest, and I'd really prefer to spend that moment enjoying...just, something small, relatively small, to tide me over for a while. Would you please be so kind as to do that for me, my child?\" Frisk pulled a face, they were conflicted. On the one hand, the quicker they found some answer to their little problem, the closer they'd be to...well, to Frisk not having to go grab Toriel something to eat whenever she wanted. She adopted a deliberately exaggerated sad countenance, making her eyes all big and shiny while pouting, \"Aww, c'mon, someone as kind as you wouldn't allow me to waste away, would you?\" Toriel slapped her gut, sending jiggles from her thick lower lip to her toes. Frisk bit their lip and started sweating. On the other hand...dammit, how could they do anything in this situation aside from...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frisk felt incredibly torn as he debated what to do next in his current situation. On a fundamental level, he knew that he should be more focused on his goat mother's mobility and health than her hunger being sated. He understood that what constituted a small snack to her at this point was actually a substantial fest. Yet despite that...the thought of his surrogate mom getting bigger and more snuggly was so enticing. And the exaggerated pretty face she was giving him tugged at his heartstrings in just the right ways that she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his crisis, the human child suddenly had a brilliant idea pop into his head. \"H-hey, mom?\" He spoke up, nervously wringing his hands as he stared not to discreetly at his massive mother jiggle and bounce. \"Do you think there are any spells in here that could bring you food without lifting a finger?\" If there was a way to keep Toriel sedated while he perused the library, he would have more than enough time to find the spell without having to run back and forth to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel closed her eyes as she pondered her human child's question. \"Hmmm...Oh, very good thinking, my child!\" Toriel suddenly opened her eyes with a wide smile. If she wasn't drowning in her own, comfy blubber, she would have picked up Frisk into her arms and give him a hug. With all her might, she slowly lifted her left arm to point towards the far bookshelf in the corner of the room. \"It should be in the very back of the big, blue book on the top shelf. Sorry if it's out of the way, for the life of me I can't remember why I put it there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk nodded and dutifully obeyed Toriel. He felt a creeping sense of dread when he realized that there might be an important reason why the book in question is so hard to reach, but an impatient whine from the goat's churning tummy made him quicken his pace and block out skepticism. After climbing up the old, wooden bookshelf to procure the blue book, he instantly began flicking through the yellowed, musty pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the very end of the book was a page that was almost drowning in critical red ink, with ominous messages on how he shouldn't use it sprawled across the paper. With a fearful gulp, Frisk saw that this was, in fact, the spell he was looking for. The title was scratched off and the footnotes were in another language, but the main text was still legible enough. Simply enchant a series of arcane words on someone, and they'll be supplied with an endless stream of fattening foods from thin air. Red flags were going off all over his head, but he was desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter memorizing the magic words, Frisk hopped down from the top shelf and rushed back to Toriel. The massive blob of white fur smiled sweetly at him. \"Go on, Frisk, don't keep a gal waiting!\" She teased, patting her comfy gut softly. Determination rising in him, he quietly spouted the words in question and pointed his arm out to her. Geometric shapes burst from the end of his index finger, scaring him greatly as it sank into Toriel's fatty flesh. There was no explosion, no shining light...nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing save for a chocolate cake as big as Frisk's torso suddenly appearing in front of Toriel's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel squeed like a little girl as she willed the delicious treat in front of her, much to Frisk's surprise. \"Oh, thank you so much, my child!\" Toriel purred as she sank her teeth into the chocolate cake. The human child blushed as he saw his surrogate mother so happy, so relaxed and content. He never knew that anyone could ever get so much satisfaction from eating food. He left her to her fattening foods as he began his search for a spell that could help her mobility.</span></div></div>",

Among the monsters was a goat monster named Toriel. She was Frisk's adoptive mother, and one of the best teachers in the new school that was finished building a year ago. She loved teaching both the monsters and the children there, so much so, she sometimes call them her '2nd family'.<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the school year and Toriel was finishing up a lesson about caverns and caves.<br>\r\n\"So, remember,\" she said after a video about stalagmites and stalactites \"stalagmites might touch the roof while stalactites could touch the ground.\" Toriel was wearing a purple dress with a purple top, and had purple glasses. She wasn't wearing any shoes, but that was expected.<br>\r\n\"Well, children,\" she said as the students finished writing down the last of the notes \"I do hope you all have a safe weekend and-\" she was interrupted by a flurry of hands raising. \"Er, yes?\" Toriel asked as she pointed to a human child.<br>\r\n\"Miss Dreamurr, we've been good all month, right? You said that if we were good all month, you would show us a spell.\" The child said.<br>\r\nToriel looked to a calender and saw it was the last day of the month.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dear, I almost forgot!\" Toriel said with a smile. \"I'll be right back.\" She then walked to the back of the room and entered a room filled with books, plants, and snails. She browsed through the books before finding the one she was looking for: the book of size manipulation. She grabbed the book, some plates and a couple of snails, and walked to the front of the classroom. The human and monster children all gathered around Toriel's desk.<br>\r\nToriel placed the snails on separate plates and opened the book. For a few moments, she flipped through the book, looking for the spell she needed, until she found the growth spell.<br>\r\n\"Now, children,\" Toriel started \"This spell is an advanced spell, so please don't try this at home unless you have the proper training.\"<br>\r\nShe then rolled up her sleeves, hovered her hands over the book, then began to, motion them in circles. At first, nothing happened, just Toriel waving her hands, but suddenly, white flames engulfed her hands, causing some of the students to squeal in shock.<br>\r\n\"Its okay, children, I am perfectly safe.\"<br>\r\nShe continued to move her hands in circles, but suddenly, the school bell rang, signaling the end of the day.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, children, but it seems we will have to wait until monday.\"<br>\r\nThe children groaned, but still packed up their stuff and left the room. Toriel sighed, she wanted to show the children the growth spell, but it seems that it will have to wait. She quickly shook her hands (a standard way to cancel spells that have a fire to them), and waited for the flames to be extinguished. She kept on shaking, until the flames suddenly flung off her hands and started ricocheting off the walls. Toriel quickly made a dash to the door, hoping the spell would hit something, but then she felt a sudden pain in her rear, as though someone slapped her. She looked and saw a singe mark on her dress where she felt the pain and started rubbing it. She then felt another pain in her breasts, like those were slapped, too. She looked at them and saw a singe mark on her shirt where the pain was.<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear...\" Toriel muttered as she rubbed there, too.</span></div></div>",

Her clothes stayed intact, and growed with her breasts and butt. Toriel was speechless. \"I think I'll get used to this, though i'm not sure the students will.\" As she got out of the doors, Toriel could feel that it wasn't the end of it. Since her house was a couple blocks away, Toriel deicided to walk. As she did, she began to feel weird. \"What on earth?\" Toriel asked and stopped walking before growing again. Her already big breasts started swelling bigger and bigger. The same could be said with her butt. She was also gaining height. Being pushed up to 10 feet, since her orginal height was 7 ft tall. This growth lasted a bit longer than the last. When it stopped, her breasts were huge! even her butt couldn't compare to them. \"Oh my.\" she said, looking around to see if anyone caught her growth. Thankfuly, the town was empty. She estamatied that every 10 minutes or so the growth starts. \"This is gonna be fun, but.\" she said. She was curious that if it worked on the others, and if it did then... But if she did that, would her friends agree to it? She was deeply counfused of what should she do next.</span></div></div>",

The East side was the easeist to climb, but the West side was both hard to climb and hard to go down. Truckers must stop at the the top of the hill to check the brakes. For those who had lost control, a runaway ramp was made at the bottom of the west side. It was right after an almost 60 degree turn. Toriel had to go up the west side, she didn't mind it at first but soon she regretted walking as every 10 minutes she would grow. By the time Toriel reached the top of the hill, she was exausted and huge. She had gained more height and her breast barley touched the ground. Her butt was the only thing to keep Toriel from falling. Thankfuly, the rest of the way was downhill and Toriel ran the rest of the way there. Alphys was sitting at her desk when the doorbell rang. \"Coming \"she said and opened the door. She gasped. Toriel was at the door, but she was so big that Alphys could barley see her face. \"T-T-Toriel?!\" She cried. \"Yeah\" said Toriel \"It's me.\" \"H-how did you get so big?\" asked Alphys.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention I've seen you wanting to be like Mew Mew Kissie Cutie.\" Replied Toriel. Alphys blushed, it was true. \"Alright, but will my clothes grow with me too?\" Toriel looked at her clothes, she hadn't realized that her clothes grew with her. \"I guess so.\" said Toriel. \"Just let me get it ready.\" Soon, she had the flames roaing again. \"Ready?\" Asked Toriel. \"As ready as I'll ever be.\" Replied Alphys. And Toriel fired her flames at Alphys. Just like it did to her, Alphys was hit on both her breasts and butt. It didn't take long for Alphys to begin growing. Her breasts grew and grew already surpassing an B cup and then C cup followed swiftly by a D cup. Her rear grew outwards gaining 8 inches in widith. Alphys moaned in pleasure, as she grew. She gained height rather quickly. Toriel was surprised that Alphys was already halfway to her size. At last, Alphys stopped growing. She was taller than Toriel, and her breasts mamothed Toriel's. Not long after Toriel grew to the same size as Alphys. But Alphys breasts was still bigger than Toriel's.

Toriel and Alphys got there in no time due to their size. \"Good, we've got a few minutes until we grow again\" said Toriel. \"So, now what?\" asked Alphys. \"I think a growth contest will do.\" replied Toriel. \"But, you're breasts are bigger than mine!\" \"Yeah, I don't know how they are bigger than yours, maybe because of my original size\" Replied Alphys. \"That kinda makes sen-\" Toriel began but was cut off by moaning. The growth had started. At the same time and the same pace, Toriel and Alphys got bigger and bigger. Toriel's breasts and butt swelled even bigger than before but for some reason, Alphys were just bigger than hers. Not to mention, Alphys was slowly getting ahead of Toriel in height but not by much. Meanwhile, a plane was flying over head. It was old and needed an overhaul. The pilot was taking it to the hanger at Eboutt airport to have it repaired when the engine blew. The propeller came of and of the blades hit the cockpit, knocking the pilot unconscious.   Toriel and Alphys was still growing by the time the plane came into a view. Alphys saw it first. \"Toriel, look!\" She cried. Toriel did and coming straight towards them was the plane. \"What do we do?\" Asked Toriel. Alphys looked at her breasts and got an idea. \"I'll try and catch it with my breasts, so it will have a soft landing.\" She said. \"Ok, good luck.\" said Toriel \"Just be careful.\" Alphys turned around, the plane was getting closer. Still growing, Alphys knew the plane would hit her breasts and hard. So, she started to move backwards. The plane got closer and closer. Alpys was worried that it will miss, due to her growing. But the plane hit her breasts and hard. Alphys lost her balance and fell over. Toriel caught Alphys just before she hit the ground. Alphys then took the plane out of her breasts and put it gently down. It was lucky that the pilot was unconscious, or else he would've seen the two giantess growing. At last, the two stopped growing. Alphys was slightly taller than Toriel. her breasts was utterly massive, still bigger than Toriel's. Her butt kept her from falling. \"Well, lets go to the mountains, so they won't see us.\" Said Toriel. Alphys agreed and they went to the mountains.</span></div></div>",

White walls, wall to wall carpeting in an ugly pattern, chairs that were just slightly too small... Alphys might have been a good scientist but she obviously had no decorating skill. The waiting room had 'government funded' written all over it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Which was more or less the case. Ever since Monsters had come to the surface it had been a struggle to integrate into society. There was still a divide, but some with remarkable skills like Alphys had been a huge help by getting noticed, receiving funding, and, in her case, opening a huge lab to help humans and monsters alike. Rumor had it she was even working on a process to convert Monsters into humans a vice versa, though she'd revealed nothing of the sort.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In fact, given Alphys shy and timid nature she rarely left the lab at all. The only time Toriel had seen her out and about was when she was on a date with Undyne. And that itself was rare due to anti-same-sex protesters. Not because they couldn't handle them, but rather the last time a group had badmouthed the pair in public Undyne had put two in the hospital and had to pay a large fine or risk jail time. Now the pair mostly stuck to private time in the labs, it was rumored.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Toriel looked around again she quietly asked herself just what she was doing there. True, she didn't <i>have</i> to be there, but Alphys was in need of some help and she was low on monster volunteers after the problem with the Amalgamates came to light. No one blamed her fortunately and everyone kind of got over it. But volunteers for further experiments did dwindle as a result.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ms. Dreemur?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel winced a little to herself as she looked up to see the bunny receptionist waving her over. She was not a fan of her last name. She and Asgore had a complicated relationship. After what he'd done she could not forgive him and left, but after a year on the surface and numerous apologies she had begun to recant slightly. She did not forgive him for what he did, but it was a new world and a new chance to start over. She cared about him but he was on thin ice  as far as she was concerned. And just having his last name made her feel uneasy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she approached the desk the secretary handed her a few papers. \"Just go down the hall to the end, take a right, and then the fourth door on the left. Alphys will be with you shortly.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Toriel nodded and sighed as she walked off down the hall. Finding the room was easy, but it was a surprise that it was fairly large. One corner near the door looked like a typical examination room, but the rest had various machines and lab tables covered in test tubes and racks of flasks filled with colored liquids. It was all a bit more than she could wrap her head around.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Curious she looked down at the papers she'd been handed, wondering just what sort of tests Alphys wanted her for.</span></div></div>",

Granted it was awkward at times, but Alphys was just so enamored with the brave and powerful fish monster. And Undyne couldn't help finding Alphys nervous stutters and deep blush adorable.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right now though she was feeling a little incredulous. Not that she believed anything Alphys would create could harm her, but the former royal scientist had never asked Undyne to participate in any experiments before. So this sudden offer seemed just a tiny bit suspicious.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It would just be for a month or so,\" Alphys muttered, the blush rising in her cheeks. \"And you wouldn't have to do anything different.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Undyne still looked uncertain, but curiosity was beginning to grow as she flipped her ponytail back over her shoulder and looked at Alphys with her one good eye (she was still waiting on the scientist to make her that robotic eye she promised someday).<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And just what would this 'experiment' have me doing?\" she asked trying not to sound accusing, even if it made Alphys blush and stutter in the most adorable ways.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The small scientist reached over to a nearby table and grabbed what looked like a tiny black belt studded with spikes. \"Here, you just have to wear this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hate yo break it to you Alphy,\" Undyne replied with a small smirk showing off her sharp teeth, \"I might be fit, but even my waist isn't <i>that</i> small.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually it's a collar,\" Alphys explained, \"It goes around your neck.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Undyne raised an eyebrow, already more intrigued as she imagined the cool look the collar would give her, \"Alright I'm interested, so what do I do? Just put it on? Is this going to be like those 'magical girl' animes you showed me? Because I have no plans on wearing a tiny skirt.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No no, nothing like that,\" Alphys promised, though her face turned the reddest yet as she imagined Undyne in such an outfit and made a mental not to begin work on such a project, \"Just wear it for a month and tell me if you notice any changes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Like what sort of changes?\" Undyne asked, taking the collar and looking it over, noting the adjustable strap near the buckle, \"Will it turn me into a werewolf or something? Because that would be cool.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No no,\" Alphys replied, again adding another mental note, \"But your physical needs might change. Like, you might feel less inclined to eat or get full sooner.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So it's just an apatite suppressant?\" Undyne replied as she slipped the collar on, \"That's kinda lame,\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that's one possibility,\" Alphys replied not exactly looking at Undyne at that moment, \"But there might be other things too, you might notice some... bulking up.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooh! You mean like building some muscle?\" Undyne smiled as she flexed in a nearby mirror, imagining herself looking beefier, \"Nice, I could get into a look like that. So I just wear it for a month then?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes,\" Alphys nodded, \"And don't worry about removing it. The collar is designed to repel water so you can have it on in the shower, and the spikes are blunted enough to not tear at sheets or poke holes in your water bed.when you sleep.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sweet, you always think of everything Alphys,\" Undyne smiled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pair parted soon after and Alphys felt deeply embarrassed about lying to her good friend. The collar was actually specially designed to work as a sort of 'outlet'. She had several other simple red collars she'd be giving to friends as well as using herself. If it worked, any food they ate while wearing them would be deposited in Undynes stomach, but since the 'flow' was one way anything she ate would not end up in theirs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deciding to test it, Alphys slipped on the red collar she had nearby and then went to the microwave where a bowl of instant noodles she'd been making was ready.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  The next morning, Undyne woke up at the crack of dawn, just like she always did. Having followed Alphys' instructions, she was still wearing the collar. She sat up and yawned, but involuntarily released a rather large belch. Immediately, she clapped her hand over her mouth, taken aback slightly. Gas buildup? How? Was it something she ate? She stood, and thumped on her chest a few times, before feeling her belly. She...felt fine. Didn't feel sick or anything. She walked over to her mirror and looked at herself. She reasoned that it must've been a side effect of the collar. If it worked like an appetite suppressant, it must've somehow simulated the action of eating food, which must've confused her body somehow, and that was what caused it. Satisfied with that explanation, she got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Little did Undyne know, that yesterday, after receiving her collar, Alphys approached Toriel, Asgore, Frisk, Papyrus and Sans, and given them each a simple red collar like the one she too now wore. She told them it was an experimental, but perfectly safe, method of weight loss. That it would purify whatever food was eaten with it on, and filter out the beneficial nutrients from the excess gluten and saturated fats and that sort of thing, resulting in a far healthier diet without having to sacrifice anyones favorite foods. She suspected Sans knew she was being dishonest, but if that was the case, he didn't care enough to say anything. And so, as Undyne sat down to her own hearty breakfast- rich in proteins, minerals, fibers, all the nutrition one could need for a full days worth of workouts, she was unaware that her abs were less defined than they were yesterday, belly bulging out the tiniest bit and just a tad softer, her flesh was bulging ever so slightly out from her waistband, forming the faintest hints of a muffin top. These were the effects of a relatively subtle layer of fat that had formed from when she'd technically consumed seven entire dinners- counting her own- last night. And she didn't notice as her mildly snug jeans became slowly tighter and tighter, as she inadvertently consumed six full breakfasts- aside her own which she normally ate- all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After Breakfast, Undyne went outside, for her customary morning jog. She made it a few blocks, but found herself getting winded, far sooner than she'd usually be. Only a couple blocks later, she was panting, and sweating, way more than she should be. It felt like she was nearing the end of her run, when it'd only been a fraction of what she was used to doing. Her thighs, squeezed into now tight jeans, rubbing into each other far more frequently than they should. As she jogged her wider than normal hips and enlarged ass swayed and bounced in tune with her slowing steps. Her exposed midsection, bulging outwards and spilling over her waistband in all directions, a small but respectable muffin top, was jiggling in ways it hadn't in a very very long time. Her breasts had grown to the point of straining her bra, the flesh of her cleavage also spilling out from her shirt. She slowed, slowed, and stopped, panting heavily and glistening with sweat. She felt like she had to sit down, so, she went over to a nearby bench and plopped down, her new stomach fat bunching up slightly as she did so. How could this be happening? She thought, could the collar have done this? No, no, that didn't make any sense, Alphys was a genius. There's no way she'd get it this wrong. But, that's when she realized, maybe it wasn't wrong. It was supposed to make her bulk up, gain more muscle, right? Well, weight train and cardio are different workouts, they affect the body differently, maybe an adverse effect of being stronger was being slower. <br>\r\n \"Yeah... makes sense...\" Undyne said, out loud, to herself. No one else was around, but, she just felt like saying it aloud, for no particular reason. She just needed to hear a voice, even her own. \"I guess I'll change my workout routine... light cardio, more lifting... I'll replace the jog in the morning with some bench presses...I might have to change my diet too, more protein... just more food in general. Need to get some mass.\"<br>\r\n Undyne stood up, wiped away some sweat, and licked her lips. Maybe it was thinking about the food she was gonna start eating, or maybe that run took more out of her than she thought, but she was feeling a bit hungry. <br>\r\n \"Speakin' of which, might as well start right away. Second breakfast, gonna get way more protein up in there if I wanna get <i>real</i> ripped!\" And so, she began to walk home, at a nice leisurely pace, her fat ass straining her jeans, wobbling and bouncing even at the reduced pace she was taking. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Meanwhile, Toriel was treating herself to an extra slice of pie...and, just one more. She couldn't help it, the knowledge that there wouldn't be any consequences to overeating, thanks to the brilliant Dr. Alphys, made the temptation of a little extra snacking impossible to resist. Alphys herself was eating at the moment too, in her lab, reading over some old research and devising an experiment or two to further test the proposed hypotheses, she was stuffing herself with a party sized bag of chips and a liter of soda. She was also planning to eat a chocolate cake she'd had lying around for a while later, but she hadn't before had the opportunity to enjoy. She admitted to herself she was being excessive on purpose, so more food would go to Undyne, but that knowledge that she wouldn't gain anything, no matter how much she ate, it was very freeing. And so, as Undyne herself walked home, she ever so faintly grew fatter and fatter by the second, without even realizing it, </span></div></div>",

A tiny amount of cum, both from her and Undyne, was at the bottom of the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the yellow drop fell in and made contact with it, the sperm turned a bright red color. Alphys smiled triumphantly, holding up the vial for inspection. Red was the right color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she still wasn't sure if it would work. It usually took a male to fertilize a womb, not two females. There was a chance of her getting pregnant, but the eggs she would give birth to would be infertile, completely lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went over to the device she would use to pump the semen into her, a device that could be mistaken for a dildo, Alphys could not help to let her mind wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys always wanted children ever since she married Undyne. An adoption or artificial insemination work be the solution for them, but Alphys didn't want that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted her own child with Undyne, but that was impossible, wasn't it? Not to Alphys it wasn't. Being the genius that she was, she thought of a plan to get herself pregnant with her and Undyne's semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered all of it last night. Both Alphys and Undyne spent the night together playing with each other's sex toys. Long after her lover went to sleep, Alphys collected some of the seed for the insemination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt bad for not telling Undyne what she was doing, but Alphys wanted her pregnancy to be a surprise. Right at the moment she was away, buying some groceries in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys threw the red semen into the device, alongside other chemicals. They were mostly meant to allow the pregnancy to run smoothly. The red semen was the key ingredient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling down her pink panties, lifting up her lab coat, Alphys brought the device to her vagina. She blushed when she felt how it spread her folds, entering her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went until it reached the very end of the walls of her womanhood, and Alphys injected the chemicals into her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation was strange, even a little uncomfortable, but it was quickly over. Smiling, Alphys removed the device, placing it back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her panties back up and smoothes out the wrinkles on her coat. Humming, she left her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was aching, gurgling and rumbling. Finally, not able to withstand the uncomfortable feeling, Asriel woke and sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain seem to subside when he did this, but only a little. Rubbing on sleepy eye, Asriel stared with disdain at his stomach, which was poking between his night shirt and underwear, his usual pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the ball of flesh. Asriel didn't know why (perhaps it was just because he was tired), but it felt and looked bigger. Suddenly, his belly rumbled, and with amazement Asriel saw it push forward a several inches, swelling larger and larger, straining his clothing, his stomach gurgling loudly. This woke Asriel completely up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel wanted to wake Frisk and tell him what was happening, hoping that he might help him somehow, but when the goat boy looked to the bed beside him he saw that it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel wondered where he was, but then he heard a crash, like a plate shattering, downstairs. Quickly Asriel left his room, cradling his basketball-sized belly in his hands. When he reached the kitchen Asriel was shocked at what he found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was a mess: food was smeared across the door and furniture, empty jam containers, dishes, and bottles of milk was littered everywhere. Frisk was in the refrigerator, gorging on Asriel's leftover pie like a starved animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asriel stared at this sight, a realisation, which he should have figured out a long time ago, dawned on him. Of course Frisk wasn't gaining any weight. All the fat was being stored in Asriel's body via the bond they shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel had to stop Frisk, or else he'll end up immobile.</span></div></div>",

He struggled with Asriel, the goat brothers dropping to the ground, rolling around, with Frisk eventually pinning his chubby brother down on the ground, and wouldn't you know it, right next to the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening it up, he looked inside, for the most fattening food inside. Ruling out most of the contents, Frisk was left with two options, either half a pie or half a cheesecake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to pick one, they take both out, balancing them on a single hand using a plate. Grabbing a piece of cheesecake, he's about to put it to his lips when an idea occurs to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of eating it himself, he jams it into Asriel's mouth, forcing him to swallow it, and then he grabs a chunk of the pie, cramming it into Asriel as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing to see how Asriel reacts, or rather, how his paunch reacts, Frisk notices it beginning to swell a bit, then stop.

Satisfied that the hedge was a perfect square, he turned his attention the the rest of his garden. All around him was well-kept flora, flowers of many colors, not a single weed between them, grew in their respectful beds, giving way a sweet scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore turned again, this time looking at the children that were playing on the green grass he made sure were cut short often. He looked at the school that were several feet away, which had vines growing all over its walls, giving it a welcoming look. Asgore swelled with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was his work. As groundkeeper, Asgore made sure that the school's yards were pleasing to the eye. Tending to plant life was a special talent, next to making tea, that this gentle giant harbored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asgore watched his hard work flourish, he was unaware that two children, a human and a monster, who were playing soccer, accidently kicked the ball towards him. He only became aware of it when the ball came rolling past him and into the bushes behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it for you,\" Asgore said when the boys came running up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goat man went to his knees and crawled underneath. The ball was in pretty deep, so Asgore, with some effort, squeezing in his bulky frame, had to crawl quite a distance. He finally grabbed it, but when Asgore pulled the ball to him he saw a small box right behind in. Frowning, Asgore picked it up, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling out of the hedge, he went to one knee, handing them the ball. \"Here you go,\" Asgore said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, mister,\" the human said, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy ran back to the field with his friend. Asgore watched them go, a smile still on his face, before he turned his attention back to the small box in his huge paw, his smile fading. Now who could be so careless to leave this behind, littering his beautiful garden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore decided to open it, and the goat man found, surprisingly, a gold ring inside. Picking it up, he studied it, and, if he looked closely, he could see words engraved in it, but it was too faint for Asgore to make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe responsible thing to do at that moment was to hand it in the school, so that they could figure out who it belonged to, but Asgore, for some reason, found himself slipping it over his ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt the ring give his finger a squeeze, like it was hugging him. Asgore tried to get it off, but it didn't budge no matter how much he twisted and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come off, you dame thing!\" the goat man said threw gritted teeth, sweating with effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally gave up, realizing that he might draw unnecessary attention to himself. Asgore didn't know who this accursed ring belonged to, but it seemed to weld itself to his finger. He had a feeling that this object had a sinister intent, and he needed to remove it as quick as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay calm,\" Asgore thought to himself, \"You can fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReasoning with himself, the goat man concluded that the ring was magical and that something that possess magic as well can remove it. He knew just the person.</span></div></div>",

As he hung up the phone, Asgore starts to pick up the pace, already close to Gerson's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before a sudden-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>RUMBLE</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmits from Asgores middle, putting his progress to a halt.

His paunch grows thicker as his pink button-up starts feel smaller and smaller, before slowly stopping. Asgore breathes deep breaths, trying to process what just happened to him. His hands rush around his pudgier gut, feeling around and rubbing his new chubby dome, seeing if there's any damage on the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, that surge, that concentrated feeling from before, seems to remain within Asgores stomach. It rushes around inside, he feels it move around like his tank of a gut is an actual water tank. But then, Asgore notices something, it seems to follow where his ringed hand goes. As the burly monster thinks on this, he notices the ring is aglow, inscription becoming bright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore brings the ring up to his face to inspect this, but as he tries to read the ring, the feeling within dips down then shoots up through Asgores chest and throat. Surging into Asgores head, his eyes, mouth, ears, brain and mind, leaving him feeling dizzy, not realising how he rubs his head with his ring hand. Glowing brighter and hotter, the magic within the ring goes through Asgores finger, and into his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese powers and magics culminate into a feeling of ecstasy, and slowly sink into Asgores throat.

Pressing the magic with his tongue, against the roof of his mouth, the burly bearded brute got a thick taste of the swirling spell. It felt like licking icing on a cake, smooth and soft, while tasting rich of butterscotch and cinnamon. Closing his eyes and moaning in pleasure, the boss monster nearly swallowed the bewitchment on his tongue then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Asgore's eyes widen for a moment, the timid rubbing stopped, and curious groping began. The monster grabbed the bottom of his gut and shook it, squeezing the sphere as he considered the consequences of what his instincts are telling him, and if it's what he wants. Hefting his big, soft and shapely belly, before letting it plummet and bounce before returning to its round and thick form again. Smacking his hands onto his fattened gut, enticing a moan from the monster, his hammy claws continued their exploration, sliding into his plump love-handles. Giving them both a squeeze and jiggle, his belly rocked again, the sloshing gut still trapped within the pink button up prison. Sliding on back, Asgore got a proper feel of his meaty hips and thunder thighs, before his hands reached a treasure trove of blubber, his trunk filled to the jiggling brim with all the right junk.

He guessed things like that didn't work on monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, out of options, he decided to resort to drastic measures: he consulted his former royal scientist for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore was beginning to regret that decision as he laid pantsless on this medical bed, his legs wide open, his ball and flaccid pink member exposed for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said Alphys, \"The last time I injected liquid Determination into anything, they ended up as...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abominations?\" Asgore offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say Amalgamates,\" said Alphys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore grunted in agreement. \"Alright then,\" he said, \"Just get this over with. It's kinda cold in your lab, and I want to pull up my pants soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Alphys moved in with her needle, and she blushed as she took his bullocks in her paw. She was glad that she was wearing gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on. T-this might sting a little,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it did. Asgore bleated when he felt the piece of iron penetrating his flesh, but he bit his lip and remained motionless, allowing Alphys to inject the liquid fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore felt a strange surge, like a fit of adrenaline flow through his body, and he felt the sensation of blood flowing to his penis, quickly making it erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is was Determination feels like,\" he though, smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys averted her eyes, blushing beet-red. \"Well, now that we know that it works,\" she said, \"I guess that you should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I will,\" said Asgore, sounding very merry, pulling up his pants. \"I thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mention,\" said Alphys, \"I'm more than happy to help you with your...dysfunctions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore felt as if he was walking on air as he walked down the street back to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does anything happen along the way?</span></div></div>",

As he walked down the dark sidewalk, which was lit by streetlights, heading towards a very large house, were he, his wife, and child resided in, he could feel his boner pressing against his jeans, his balls tensing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never felt this feeling, this absolute euphoria, in all his life. He was getting quite giddy from all the excitement, his heart hammering in his chest. He couldn't wait to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel was were Asgore expected her to be: sitting on the sofa, reading a book, her glasses close to the edge of her cute nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" Asgore announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel looked up, frowning, closing her book and pressing her index finger against her lips, shushing him. \"Quiet, Fluffybuns,\" she said, \"I just put Frisk to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, sorry,\" said Asgore, grinning sheepishly, lowering his tone to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you find what you were looking for at Alphys?\" Toriel asked, getting up from her respectful seat and walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore had to admit to himself that he lied to his wife, something he despised doing. He told a stupid story that he accidently forgot his trident at Alphys' house after he sparred with Undyne. Luckily she believed him and didn't press the matter any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid not,\" he said, shaking his head, \"I'll search the garage tomorrow for it. That doesn't matter. Right now, I think it's time for you and me to spend some quality time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Toriel knew was that she was suddenly scooped up in her husband's strong arms, being carried up the stairs to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little surprised by his action, and for his need for sexual intercourse, if his seductive tone didn't suggest already, but she decided to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But shouldn't you be getting to bed early?\" she said, teasing him, grinning, \"Big boys need their rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore quickly caught on what she was doing. \"O, come now, mommy,\" he said, playing along, pouting and looking sad, \"It's not a school night. I can stay up awhile longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the master bedroom, and Asgore set Toriel down, closing the door behind him and locking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for extra security measures,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on the edge of the bed, watching as Toriel undressed herself with great interest. Even though she was growing old, age seemed to have no effect on her body: she still had perky breasts, each dotted with a pink, erect nipples, and her waist was still curvy, along with her tight thighs and bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do first?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know,\" said Toriel, squashing her breasts together, \"Why don't you decide for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" said Asgore, pointing to himself, looking a little shocked at the offer. \"Usually it's you that calls all the shots for something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Toriel, \"But I've never asked you what you might want. So, I'm leaving you to decide for something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Asgore was left to decide for himself. But what should he choose? Should he allowed to be teased? Or should he skip to the main course?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throbbing penis was telling him to make up his mind quickly.</span></div></div>",

It had been a dilapidated suburb of a human city, but when Monsters emerged from underground over a year ago they'd been given it as part of the first negotiations with the humans. It hadn't been much at the time, but within the span of a year the whole place had changed completely. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Where once there's been sagging shops with dull windows were now brightly painted storefronts. Weed filled, overgrown ares had been cut back, mulched, and landscaped into beautiful parks. Even some of the old high-rise buildings had been completely renovated and, while a little small, were nice places to live. Not everything was done yet of course, many areas were still under construction, but the monsters had taken to the job with cheerful smiles determined to make their new home even better than their old one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feeling good with everything that had happened Asgore wandered across the street to look in a few shop windows. Maybe he'd bring Toriel a present to further spice things up. He'd just stopped to look in a bakery window and was trying to decide between butterscotch or cinnamon apple pie when a strange sensation washed over the former monster king.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't painful if anything it felt really good, as evidence by the bulging mass straining his pants. but the heat from it seemed to radiate out into his body. His muscles ached like he'd just gone through a serious workout and his face itched something unpleasant. And strange as it seemed the feeling of tightness in his pants only grew as he stood there leaning against the window.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually the feelings calmed down and Asgore heaved a sigh of relief, \"If that's a side effect...\" he began but paused as something seemed wrong. His voice sounded different. Looking in the window at his reflection Asgores eyes popped wide.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was... younger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hard as it was to believe, looking back at him was not the bearded, over-the-hill former king he used to be. Now the features that stared back were from a younger thirty-something version of himself he hadn't seen in years. The lines of his face had been smoothed away and the grey in his wheat colored hair was gone. His beard likewise had retracted, giving him some longish sideburns and only a faint mustache.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Asgore wasn't sure how to feel about such a development. On the one hand any being, human or monster, would pay huge sums to turn back the years like this. And he certainly looked and felt better. Some of the added pounds he'd gotten in middle age had also seemed to melt away giving him a tighter and more toned body. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the other hand a lot of questions began to pile up in his mind. What would Toriel think? Would she be happy or mad at him for doing this? And then there was the change itself. Was it actually done or was this just the start of things? Asgore had asked for a large dose of Determination. Maybe it wasn't finished and he should go back to Alphys before it got worse.</span></div></div>",

A few moments later it opened, revealing Undyne on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" she said, regarding him suspiciously, like anyone would to a complete stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice him at first, which was obvious seeing that she had never seen him personally at this young age, only joining the royal guard when Asgore was busy surpassing his prime and getting old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the more she studied him, the more she seemed to notice, finally exclaiming: \"Asgore? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange hearing his voice. It was still baritone, but it lost all the hoarseness that was creeping into it, sounding smooth and mesmerizing ones more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you!?\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore was starting to feel that bizarre feeling returning again, spreading from his bulging crotch to the rest of his body, his muscles aching again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can you please go get Alphys for me,\" he said, \"It's very urgent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was afraid that Undyne might argue further with him, but luckily she didn't, only saying, \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as she stepped out of the way, you saw that there was a mirror behind her. As the feeling git stronger and stronger, Asgore watched his body shift and change with fascinated horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sideburns disappeared along with his faint mustache, leaving him with a smooth face with golden yellow hair. He felt his vision shifting, and his clothing felt a little loose on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I just loose an inch in height?\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have time to answer that, for Alphys came running up to Asgore, Undyne in tow, exclaiming, \"O, my! Undyne said you look odd, but I wasn't expecting this. I knew injecting Determination into you would be bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Asgore could say anything, he was pulled roughly into the house.</span></div></div>",

As she led him in she was already beginning to measure everything she could about him. Height, weight, dimensions of his body, temperature, blood pressure, all done in a flurry of movement. All the while she jabbered on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"T-This shouldn't be happening,\" she muttered, her old stutter returning as her nervousness grew, \"T-The calculations I made...

Use those breathing exercises and calm down.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alphys did indeed try to do so using a paper back and some long slow breaths. But Asgore was getting antsy. The former king could see himself in the nearby mirror and while <i>probably</i> a trick of his mind, he was almost sure he was a millimeter or two shorter each time he looked. \"Alphys, I really hate to rush you,\" Asgore stated, surprised to find his voice had gone up again, broching on something close to a tenor level of speaking like the young adult he appeared to be, \"especially when you're so nervous. But please, any ideas about what's going on would be helpful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-Well,\" Alphys gulped trying to stifle her nerves, \"Back... 'before' we only ever tested raw Determination on Monsters who were dying. It wasn't injected until they were dead but before their bodies could dissipate. You know what that... resulted in. So after that Determination testing was halted. We only just started again after coming to the surface. We've only had a handful of subjects tested so far. You were the first to ask for such... *ahem* 'personal' uses for it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you have no idea why this is happening?\" Asgore replied looking deeply worried as he gripped his loose shorts... wait, not fully loose.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Asgore looked down and could feel the heat rising in his cheeks. The bulge between his legs had to be more than three times anything he'd ever had at <i>any</i> age in his life. It was like he'd stuffed a large melon down his pants, and yet he could tell it was all him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alphys blushed harder as she too noticed the changes, \"W-Well, there's no certainties yet, but if we could study what's going on for a while we might get some answers. At a glance though the changes do seem fairly straight forward.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You mean Asgore getting younger while his junk gets bigger?\" Undyne stated with some small mirth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I wouldn't have put it that way,\" Alphys muttered but yes, that seems to be the case. The good news is he seems to be retaining his adult mind regardless of age. So if the worst should happen and we can't undo it, he might grow back normally on his own.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, so how far back is this going to go?\" Asgore asked, \"Do you even have a guess Alphys?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I can't be sure until more tests, but judging by how much you've lose and how much Determination you were injected with.

Anxious, he watched the digital numbers increase, hoping against hope that he didn't gain weight this past month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was out of luck, though. The numbers surpassed his previous weight, landing on a sturdy 330 pounds. The former king groaned in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe that he allowed to let himself go like this. Though, it wasn't entirely his fault; life amongst the humans were good, perhaps a little too good: they had better food, comfortable and peaceful lifestyles, a far cry from the dark and gloomy world known as the Underground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore got caught up in all the luxury, and, due to him having few responsibilities, for the humans tended to the monsters' needs now, he let himself go, allowing his strong, healthy body to be replaced by a overweight, pudgy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a handful of his round, tight belly, lifting it up before dropping it. He watched how the ball of lard bounce, slosh, and jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really needed to get his old body back. So far, Asgore had tried everything: dieting, working-out, and taking weight-loss medication, but for some reason his fat didn't want to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Asgore, after numerous dates, finally got Toriel to warm up to him again. But she still refused to take him back. He guessed to was repulsed by his fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a quick fix,\" Asgore decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he knew just where to get one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of town, on the countryside, lived Undyne and Alphys in a farmhouse. The couple had seen some changes in their lives due to the money that was rolling in. The reason for this was that Alphys, being the genius that she was, sold some of her inventions to the market lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response was that major product companies wanted to make deals with her to manufacture more of her brilliant inventions. They said that it was nothing like they have ever seen before. Now the two lived on the plains outside of the city, where Alphys could build some of the ideas requested to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for Asgore to reach the farmhouse, and even longer to convince the scientist to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Asgore, but I can't help you,\" said Alphys, adjusting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were inside her home, in her room. She had just finished looking at some plans sent to her about a airplane that could run on water instead of gasoline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Alphys,\" Asgore begged, spreading his arms wide, \"Your a genius. There must be something you've invented that could help people lose weight quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys crossed one arm around her chest while the other rubbed her chin, her eyes staring at the ceiling, thinking. \"You know what,\" she said after a pause, \"I think I might have something for you. Follow me, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently Asgore did as she asked, following her outside. They walked across the lawn until they reached a large barn. But it was not animals that were in this wooden structure. Inside was half-finished inventions, their part scattered across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Asgore the place seemed rather untidy, but he didn't complain. They kept walking towards a dark spot in the corner of the barn. Reaching out, Alphys grabbed something something large, pulling it with a few grunts into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was covered with a brown blanket. Alphys pulled it off, and Asgore saw that underneath it was a machine that looked very similar to a weight lifter. What made it special was that it had a few fancy electronic devices attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\" Alphys chimed, \"I give you the Abb Builder 5000!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore eyed it skeptically. Alphys seemed to notice this, for she sighed, saying: \"I know, I know, it's a pretty silly invention, that's why I haven't sold it to the market yet. It used to be a giant robot that could destroy humans, much like Metaton. This is technically a prototype.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Asgore, \"You dismantled your old invention and used the old parts to build this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no,\" said Alphys, \"It's still the same robot, believe it or not. I modify it so that it could transform into a workout machine. It's an idea that I got when I watched a human TV show called Transformers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" said Asgore, \"But how does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you,\" said Alphys, \"But before I do that, you must wear some special clothing that comes with the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, hurrying towards a trunk. She flipped open the lid and began to search inside. A few moments later Alphys returned, holding a yellow suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, put this on,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore took it and studied it suspiciously. He shrugged and did as she asked. A while later, Asgore was sitting on the bench, wearing the special suit, his large gut bulging against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't see how this would help me,\" said Asgore, \"This looks like any other workout bench, just with a few more gadgets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see those light above you and on your sides,\" she said, pointing with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Asgore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are meant to stimulate muscle cells in your body,\" she explained. \"Undyne ones used this thing, did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphys nodded, saying: \"She did. Why do you think she's so muscular now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory appeared in Asgore's mind: only a few weeks ago Undyne had begun with a secret workout routine, and a few days later, much to everyone's surprise, she ended up with a body that could rival a professional bodybuilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's how she did it,\" said Asgore in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Alphys, \"Now, lay down that I can strap you in and fire up the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore did as he was told. But what happened when Alphys hit the on switch?</span></div></div>",

Making your way down the sidewalk, your backpack hanging heavily on your back, you saw the grey, three-story school come into view, blocking out the sun and casting a long shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, wait up!\" came a cry from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood still for a few moments, watching as the armless monster wearing a black stripped, yellow shirt came running up to you, panting, his bag bouncing against his waist. When he finally stopped, he tripped over his own feet and fell on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, shaking your head, apparently already used to the monster kid's clumsy behavior. Reaching out, you helped him back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said, \"Man, I wish I had arms. I'm already black and blue from falling down so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. It was indeed a blessing to have arms, the very first appendages to spread out to break your fall. You wished you could help your friend, but you didn't have enough Determination, nor even know how to do such an impossible feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you could do now is head inside the school, through the wide open double-door, for the bell had just ran, announcing that lessons for today were about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was rowdy at first when the two of you entered: there was a loud buzz as children talked, paper airplanes and erasers flew overhead, and a few children were playing what looked like tic-tac-toe on the blackboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you took your regular spot in class, you could not help but pause for a few moments, looking at the lively students. Monsters and human, all in one room, interacting with one another like there was no deference between them at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint, triumphant smile crawled onto your face. Who said a kid can't change the world? Your thoughts were suddenly interrupted when someone entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, children, settle down!\" Toriel's kind but stern voice carried across the room, having almost instant effect on the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone, including you and your friend, who sat next to you, took their seats and finally calmed down, Toriel addressed the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, students,\" she greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Miss Dreemurr!\" you, alongside the rest, said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's usually around this point that she would ask the class if they could remember about their lesson yesterday, but it would seem that things were going to be a little different today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, class, we have a new student amongst us today,\" she said, \"Tommy, why don't you step up and introduce yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the front row you someone, a human boy, stand up, from a specific seat you could have sworn was always empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you despised judging people, you had to admit he looked a little funny with that strange, red helmet he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe greeted the class with a wave, saying: \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's almost just as lifeless as you,\" your friend beside you whispered with a grin, joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded by rolling your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sure you'll have a wonderful time here, Tommy,\" Toriel said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy went back to his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention back to the class. \"Now, children, if you will take out your text books we can begin with today's lessons,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class did obediently what she asked, but for some reason you found it hard to concentrate on your lesson. For some unknown reason your gaze was drawn to the direction were the boy sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that Tommy's backpack was wide open, revealing his belongings inside. There wasn't much of interest, except a yellow notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know why this thing drew your attention. Perhaps you were just bored. For ones you wished that the need for writing something in it didn't fill you with Determination.</span></div></div>",

The ones quiet and lonely hallways suddenly came alive as both human and monsters left the classrooms, laughing, talking, shouting, their feet tapping audibly across the tiled flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students in your class were packing up their things too, taking their backpacks and quickly exiting the classroom, leaving it deserted...except for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to it being a free period, for one of your teachers were absent today, you decided to doze off without the fear of being apprehended for your act. The school bell didn't wake you up, so, you continued to sleep until your armless friend came to wake you, apparently wondering why you didn't follow him outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Frisk, wake up!\" he said, nudging you with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up with a snort and a confused \"huh?\", looking around you, your eyes falling onto your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fell asleep,\" he stated. \"I was half tempted to leave you here. Imagine how funny it would be if you woke up in the middle of the night and discover that your still at school! Though, that would be a little mean, I have to admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and jump off your stool, but just as you were about to leave, following your friend that had the ability to talk up a storm, you spotted something out of the corner of your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of the class, on the furthest desk to the left, close to the window, you saw a notebook on the table. Curious, you walked towards it, picking it up the yellow book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" your friend began to explain, \"It would seem that Tommy forgot his one belonging here, which is strange seeing that he's never parted with it today. Isn't it funny? He takes that notebook everywhere he goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement. You've been watching him the whole, first with mild interest because he was a new face in school, but it grew as he began to act a little bit funny. Everywhere he went, he carried that notebook, even in places where it's completely unnecessary, like the gym and the cafeteria, holding it under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was so special about this book, you wondered. You decided to place it in your bag, telling your friend that you would give it back to Tommy tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the school and headed down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does anything happen along the way?</span></div></div>",

So, you only waved at him as he went through the gate and into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued down the street until you reached your home, a large, two-story house. As usual, Toriel was there to welcome you home, who had arrived home earlier today, changing from her work clothes to her normal dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you entered the kitchen, you saw that she was busy searching the food cupboards, muttering, \"O, dear, o, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hears raised a little, meaning that she heard you, and Toriel turned around, greeting you: \"O, hello, my child. I apologize that I didn't notice you at first, but I'm searching for my ingredients to make some Snail Pie. It would seem that I'm all out of them, unfortunately. O, Asgore would be so disappointed! I guess we should make a list of what to buy. Would you mind doing that for me while I check the cupboards again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, placing your backpack on the ground, grabbing the first book that you could write, which happened to be the yellow notebook. When you realized this, you hesitated, but not for long, for Toriel already began naming what she needed, and you quickly began to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt guilty of using someone else's belongings, but you were sure that if you removed the page you were writing on Tommy would not noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you continued writing, both yours and Toriel's back facing the kitchen's table, completely unaware that everything you were listing - snails, butter, cinnamon, flour, milk, eggs - were appearing on the table behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, my!\" Toriel exclaimed, dumbfounded when she saw all the things she needed right in front of her. \"Now where did this all come from?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised as well. Looking at the page you just written on, you saw that the letters were slowly fading away, leaving the page clean ones more. Did you just summon something by just writing something in this notebook?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo test it, you left the kitchen where Toriel was scratching her head in bewilderment, heading towards the privacy of your room. Writing something random such as telephone, the device appeared on your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that was why the kid was so protective about the thing; he had a thing that could bend reality, perhaps almost as strong as your ability to reset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discovery of this item filled you with Determination, and you reached for the very telephone you just summoned, ready to call up your friend and tell him about your amazing find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you hesitated. Perhaps you should mess around with this thing more, just to know how much it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your choice?</span></div></div>",

The Temmie in question is none other than the shop keeper of the Temmies. She provided Temmies with natural goods and other things that the Temmies liked.

Sometimes they would chat and other times, they would help her donation towards collage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that all the monsters were on the surface, the shop Temmie set up a small store next to Grillby's.

They sometimes teased the Temmie, but that was as bad as it got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Temmie had a secret power that nobody knew of. When angry, she transforms into something very, VERY menacing beast.

To say it piqued Toriel's interest was an understatement. While yes she WAS 7 feet tall, Toriel couldn't stop wondering if she could get taller. While yes monsters have a limit to height, Toriel had heard from her parents and even her Ex. Husband Asgore, that some boss monsters had giant magic. Unfortunately for Toriel, she only knew healing and fire magic. Nothing more. As she walked down the sidewalk, an object in the grass. It looked old, but well maintained, it was golden with a little knob at either end of it. It wasn't any shape Toriel had seen before. Being the curious type of person, Toriel picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange..\" She muttered to herself. \"This object looks familiar, but I can't place where.\" She looked over it carefully.  \"I'm drawn to this..whatever it is,\" muttered Toriel again. She looked around She was alone. She knew she could've gone home much sooner. But this object seemed strange...As if a strange arura was calling out to her. \"I wish I could just be a bit taller.\" Muttered Toriel to herself. Toriel put the object in her pocket deciding to have Alphys look at it the next morning and she began to continue walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly Toriel began to feel all sorts of tingling all over her. She stopped walking. The feeling felt..off but good at the same time. Then she swore she heard creaking from her body...As if her entire skin is stretching and expanding. Her breasts swelled out a bit and her rear puff out a few inches. \"Oooh\" Moaned Toriel. Then as quick as it came, the feeling left. \"What happened..?\" Thought Toriel as she checked her new assets. She put her hands on her large breasts. This wasn't milk in them..no..they had expanded out by magic. As for her rear, well..She couldn't explain how either. But then she noticed the street light next to her had gone down a bit. Toriel looked around and then realized..She had grown a full foot. She was now 8 feet tall. This was strange maybe this item is more than it seems...</span></div></div>",

He was also growing a bit of an appetite and his voice was lowering a tiny bit. He lastly was growing very little blond on his \u201cgoatee\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting worried about the kingdom. He was next in line as King for all of monsters and he noticed that he was starting to get more royal work. All this made him think about his father, Asgore Dreemurr.

He always wanted to be like him, but he still had the motherly side (Toriel) of him.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Asriel whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when he remembered what his mother would always say.<br>\r\n\u201cEat up, and you\u2019ll grow big and strong.\u201d \u2018Maybe I need to have a bit more treats than normal,\u2019 He thought. \u201cYeah, I just need to eat an extra slices of food and I\u2019ll be as big as dad in no time.\u201d He finally fell into a magnificent slumber, dreaming of being like his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning my child.\u201d Toriel spoke cheerfully to her son.\u201d He just waved in yawn.

Toriel had recently gotten into a baking mood and was making pies throughout the day. After about the 5th pie Toriel made Asriel grabbed and scurried off to eat it. He ate the entire pie without taking a break. Asriel was very eager to be as big as his dad, so later in the night, Asriel snuck a pie into his room and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel ate like this on top of what he would normally eat every day. After about a week all of the eating started to show its effects on Asriel. He now had a small paunch instead of his normally flat stomach, but he was still able to hide it under his cloak that he wore. His entire body got a light layer of fat making all of his muscles less define. Asriel weighing at 134 still wasn't a quarter of the size his dad. fueled by the thought of being bigger than his dad he started eating more.</span></div></div>",

Ebbot started hosting its annual pie eating week that consisted of 7 days of competitions. 3 competitions were held every day until the week ended and anybody could join. The 2 people with the most pie eaten at the end of the week face off one more time to determined the champion. Asriel signed himself up for the competition about a month ago, before he wanted to got bigger, but now he was going to try and eat as much as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzzer goes off signaling the contestants to start eating, they now had 10 minutes to eat as much as they could. Asriel scarfs down a pie, then another, and another. The buzzer finally went off again and Asriel was stuffed, and was rubbing his firm gut as he waited for his score. Asriel was handed a slip of paper that had 21 boxes, one for each possible competition he could compete in. The first box had 37 in it, Asriel was surprised that he ate more than just 15. He was required to hand his slip back in to the \"judges\" and he carried off on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel walked around the city for a good 4 hours before the next competition was ready to start. After some encouraging words from his parents Asriel was ready. The clock struck 12 and a loud buzzer rang and Asriel dug into the pie. He ate at a decent pace until there was 2 minutes left and he got a terrible belly cramp. Asriel finished the last bit of pie and he stopped to rub his gut. The final 2 minutes passed without Asriel eating anything, and his final score for that round was a 32.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Final competition of the day was held 8 hours later giving Asriel enough time to digest all the food. Again a buzzer rang and Asriel started eating as much as he could, pushing himself to his limit. By the end, Asriel managed to eat 43 pies leaving him at a grand total of 102 for the first day. The announcer at the front table was calling out the top 10 people/monsters who ate the most pie and Asriel made 8th on the list, 103 pies behind the person in first. After hearing the results Asriel goes home and eagerly weighs himself. 182 was the final number on the scale and Asriel slumps into his bed and goes to sleep exited for the next day.</span></div></div>",

Confused Asriel got out of his bed, put on his almost ill fitting robe and went into the bathroom. He stepped onto the scale while rubbing his soft gut and was surprised to see that he now weighed 231 pounds. Asriel was told a few times about how monsters had adapted to eating food made of mostly, or completely out of magic, and how that eating food that was not made of magic usually had more of an effect on the body than it normally would. Before he could think about much else he looked at the clock and panicked, he only had 30 minutes to get to the morning competition or he couldn't compete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel had never run as fast as he did in that moment making it to the competition in 10 minutes even with the extra weight. In the 20 minutes Asriel had left, he just used to catch his breath. The time came for the morning competition to start and Asriel was more than ready. The Timer began to tick down and Asriel was stuffing himself with pie after pie, making quick work of anything that was put in front of him. He never seemed to slow his pace down and by the end of the time he still could of eaten more. Asriel got his score card and was amazed at what it said. Asriel managed to eat 93 pies in just 10 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel stared at his gut, giving it a few pats making it jiggle for a few second before stopping. Now he knew how his dad could pack away so much food, it was the extra room his large gut gave him. Asriel, like yesterday, walked around the town until the next competition was set to start. Asriel took a seat at a table and his stomach let out a loud growl. Not even 3 minutes later the timer starts and Asriel starts working on 2 pies at once finishing them in record time. His gluttony continues like this and this time he doesn't get a stomach cramp 3 minutes before it ends. An air horn this time tells the competitors to stop eating. Asriels score for this round came in at a large 122 eaten. looking at the number gets Asriel thinking about how could people make this many pies so fast, but these thoughts were thrown away as Asriel griped his stomach in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriels body, still not accustomed to the constant gluttony hes putting it through is having trouble processing all of the food he had just eaten. Asriel slumps down in a chair massaging his taut gut in hopes to relive some of the pain, and it worked reliving some of the pain. After a few more minutes of massaging Asriel gets up and starts walking around, but notices that his cloak no longer fully covers his gut leaving it visible to the entire world. He just stuck around and waited a few hours for the next competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time has come for the next competition and Asriel still felt full, but he tried his best. Asriels best wasn't enough, only getting him another 14 pies before giving up. Asriel got up to 5th for most pies eaten and was only 76 behind the person in first. leaving with a grand total of 229 pies eaten today. Like yesterday Asriel weighed himself before going to sleep, and he weighed 327 pounds. Morning comes and Asriel puts on his cloak, and it no longer serves its purpose for covering his body, and his pants didn't fit either. Asriel ended up getting a pair of his dads pants and opted to go shirtless just for today and get a new cloak in town. After putting on some pants Asriel goes to weigh himself coming out at 428 pounds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the clothes store Asriel ended up buying a cloak that was about a size too large. Asriel gets to the competition and is greeted by some random, slightly chubby person who held out his hand for a handshake. Asriel gives the stranger a hand shake, getting shocked in the process, and before he could ask for their name they have disappeared into the crowd. He actually eats pretty tamely, only getting 32 pies stuffed into his massive gut. Rubbing his fluffy gut in satisfaction he let out a giant burp. Something felt off but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second competition comes around and a bubbly feeling wouldn't go away. The competition starts and Asriel starts eating, and only 5 pies in he notices something off, he could see his gut slowly growing with each pie eaten. Asriel  plays this off as just bloating and continues gobbling down pie at a relatively slow pace. After about 5 minutes have passed Asriels pants started digging into his gut, Asriel ignored this and continued eating. After time was up Asriel received his score of 36 and he relaxed until the next competition started, and failing to notice that his cloak doesn't cover his entire gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time comes for the third event of the day and Asriel is pumped up. The Buzzer goes off and Asriel starts eating, and not even 5 pies in his button bursts off of his pants. Asriel payed no mind to the button burst and kept eating, his cloak no longer reaching the end of his gut leaving it exposed. when the competition ends Asriel is taken aback because of his massive gut. Asriel stays seated until he got his score back, which was 30. He didn't stay for the final scores of the day and he got out off there as quickly as he could. Waddling his way back to his home was no easy feat, with his gut hanging about 3 inches past his knees made it hard to walk. All the while he was thinking about how this could of happened and sure enough he comes up with that stranger he met this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to deal with anything this late Asriel went home and weighed himself coming in at a whopping 652 pounds, this scared Asriel, but it also made him exited. Thinking about how big he could become, he falls asleep. Asriel wakes up barely able to move, and he  waddles his way to the bathroom scale. Now weighing a massive 874 pounds, and most of the weight seemed to settle into his earth-shaking gut. The rest of Asriels body filled with a moderate amount of fat. There was a knock at the door and Asriel went to answer it only to be greeted by a rather large box with a note tied to a small bottle on top. The note read, \"Hope you are enjoying your new weight. This bottle contains something that will make it easier for you to move around. P.S I also included some bigger clothes\". Asriel takes the package inside and opens it up revealing some rather large clothes. He puts on the clothes that actually were just the right size. After a few minutes Asriel threw caution to the wind and drinks the liquid in the glass bottle. </span></div></div>",

The back layer of his back fat fused with the top of his rump fat so he could shake the holy hell out of his fat bottom. He twerked it up and down, sweat glistening and falling off of his blobby booty. He sunk his hands deep into his ass fat, seeing just how far his fat cake had protruded outwards. He felt so turnt on and powerful by his own ass. He would use it as a weapon, swinging it in people\u2019s face. He soon sat on the ground and felt how nice it was to let out huge farts on the ground. He slapped himself over and over, moaning louder as he did so.

From his translated notes Asriel reads what the belt does and how it works. The belt altered peoples bodies and clothes, but only the pants. The belt will lengthen or shorten to match exactly with the pants, and the body will grow to match. The belt grows 3 inches longer every hour, and grows everything else in the process. The belt returns to its normal size once it is taken off, but if another person takes off the belt, then the wearer is turned to normal like nothing ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel slips on the belt but he doesn't feel anything out of the ordinary, but he will keep track of his weight throughout the day, as well as his waist which is now 26 inches around. Time goes on and Asriel does what he usually did and walked around. After a few hours of walking and relaxing Asriel finally decides to measure his now larger gut. First Asriel took his weight and it came to 254 pounds. Before he did anything else he noticed the tag of his pants sticking out, so he grabbed it to stuff it back into his pants and to his surprise, the tag actually changed its number. Now with a 41 inch around waist Asriel sat on his bed and he fell asleep, even if it was only 3 in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel was out cold because he only woke up to his alarm at 9 in the morning. Greeted by a massive ball of fluffy gut. The belt kept working its magic in his sleep and now his gargantuan gut pined him to his bed. Asriel knew that the belt wasn't meant for long term use and thought he would just take it off, but it was too late for that. Asriel called for help and he desperately reached for the belt to no avail. Asriel, out of options just waited for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass and Asriels bed breaks, and there is still nobody to help him. It takes a total of 43 hours for someone to find a giant blob of Asriel. Toriel was the first to find Asriel and after a few minutes of convincing from Asriel, he gets her to take the belt off. Everything went black and Asriel gets his vision back and is currently digging the belt out of the box. Asriel blinks a few times not knowing what had just happened, but he remembers what happened. Not wanting to go through that again Asriel sets the belt back inside the box and thinks about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was on a slow and boring that Prince Asriel Dreemurr decided to visit his favorite spot in the whole house: the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the spiral staircase, the goat man, dressed in his flowing blue and white robes, bearing the royal family's emblem, descended down into the underground library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was a child Asriel was forbidden to enter the place, but now as a grown monster, who was taking up the craft of magic, like his mother, he visited the place frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fascinated him greatly to try out a new spell, no matter how trivial it was. He arrived at the library, It was a cozy place, with plush furniture, a shaggy carpet, and walls filled with old books. A few stairs led to upper levels of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, the room was dark. No problem. With a flick of his wrist dozens of candles sprang to life, and a few logs, conveniently placed in the hearth, caught fire. The library was alight with a warm orange glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel began to take down books, flicking through the pages, browsing through spells and hoping to find one that would spark his interest. So far he found none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, and no,\" Asriel muttered, stacking one book after another on a nearby table in his search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand grabbed one particular red book, and when he pulled it it revised to leave the shelf. Frowning, Asriel pulled harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you dame book,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra force didn't remove the book. However, it sled a little outwards. Suddenly, there was a rumble that sent dust sprinkling from the roof. Alarmed, Asriel took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very wall the bookcase was built in began to slide to the right, revealing a short flight of stairs leading to a door. After composing himself, and scraping some courage together, Asriel began to journey down the stairs to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lit a large fireball in his hand, telling himself that he was using it for light. In truth, Asriel was a little scared, and wanted something lethal to protect him just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he pushed open the door, which creaked on its hangs. Inside was a small room, and in the center was a bookstand, which had an unknown light source signing directly on it. On it was a scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking left and right first, he gingerly stepped into the room. Asriel was surprised that this library had a secret room. He had spent years studying magic with his mother and never uncovered it. He was going to have a talk with his parents about this. That's if they knew about it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on the bookstand and studied the scroll. It had words written on it, and Asriel, though he couldn't understand it, could feel magic radiating from it as he tried to mouth the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were pictures drawn on it, too. It wasn't done by a skilled hand, for the pictures were terribly drawn, but it gave an idea what was being shown. They were all placed next to a spell each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne picture was of a very muscular figure, in a flexing pose. Another was of a figure with a monstrously large manhood. Another depicted a grotesquely fat figure. Another a full-grown being reverting into a baby. And another of a very curvy figure, which Asriel on guessed was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he shouldn't play around with things that he knew little about, but Asriel was burning with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to try one. But which one should he try?</span></div></div>",

The goat man rubbed his chin, squinting his eyes. He wasn't exactly sure what it did, but he had the suspicion that it was a weight gain spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut judging from how peculiar the figure was drawn, with its rolls of flab and pear-like shape, it could do practically anything. Well, thought Asriel, there's only one way to find out. He began to chant the words, and his tongue felt surprisingly thick and his voice deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a warm, tingling sensation spread throughout his body. It felt rather nice, like a warm bath or a gentle hug that his mother always gave him. Asriel felt his robes grow snug, almost like it shrink a size or two, and a sudden weight suddenly press down on his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was finished, he took a step back and examined himself. What he found shocked but intrigued him. He had gained weight, and from the looks of it it was quite a lot. The goat man was padded all over, his arms, legs, thighs, and rump much thicker than previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had lost its sharp features, his chubby cheeks bulging outwards. His neck was much thicker, threatening to be consumed by his developing second chin. But none of these attributes were a much to his bulging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his soft pecs, his pot-belly stood out nearly a foot in front of him, spilling over his waist. Asriel knew that he should be horrified by his transformation, and most likely desperately trying to find a solution for it, but, strangely, found that he actually liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough his whole life, Asriel had always been a very thin goat monster, taking more to his mother's body structure. Though this wasn't a bad thing, the goat boy always wanted to be more like his father, who was muscular but fat at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was just plain fat now, Asriel saw this new size as a way to live up to his father's name. He smiled, grabbing his stomach and shaking it, unable to hold back a giggle. But his smile dropped when he realized something: what was his parents going to say about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were most likely going to freak out when they saw that their son had gained over a hundred pounds in a few minutes and try to change him back, but perhaps he could convince them otherwise. But whether his parents would except him or not, there was one thing that would never except him: his clothing that he was currently wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked absolutely ridiculous in it, his sleeves and collar digging painfully into his soft figure. He needed to buy bigger clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Readjusting his stance though proved to be his undoing as just adjusting where his paws took an effort to move them under his growing weight. And in doing so he lost his grip on the armfuls of chest fat he had. With a resounding <i>RRRRIIIIIPPP</i> his fat filed male breasts tore completely through the front of his robes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Asriel's face burned with an embarrassed blush as his male breasts rolled out on full display. Each was enormous, almost the size of his belly as they rolled against it, tipped by large black nipples as big as his fat firsts and hardening in the cool air of the room. Fortunately they seemed to have stopped growing at least but they were still massive slightly smushed looking spheres, distinguishable only from a females by their slightly deflated looking shape.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooh this is so embarrassing,\" Asriel muttered. Being fat felt nice, but having male breasts bigger than any females was not something he'd anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Spell <i>still</i> isn't done changing him somehow.<br>\r\nChoice 2: The spell is really a curse. The more he tries to cover up parts of his body the more they fatten and expand.<br>\r\nChoice 3: Asriel begins lactating a very delicious and <i>extremely</i> fattening milk.

He could cloak himself in invisibility, or perhaps he could spare his energy on such a complex spell and cause a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he reached the top of the stairway, finding himself out of breath and leaning against the wall to rest, he was struck my the delicious smell of his mother's cooking, which caused his bulging belly to growl loudly with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, Asriel, there you are!\" Toriel exclaimed, emerging from the kitchen, \"I was wondering where you went. Come, dinner is almost ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel felt his blood run cold when he heard his mother's voice, but when he looked at her his mouth fell open. No longer was she the thin goat woman from his memory. She was fat, a few pounds away from being obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer robes hugged her thick frame like a spandex suite, showing off her mountainous rump, several lovehandles, massive doughy belly, thunder thighs, and breasts, which were so large it could put any female monster's boobs to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel's face, like Asriel's, was round with two chubby cheeks, a second chin well in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw her son's astonished expression, she cocked her head and asked, \"What's wrong, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you...\" Asriel began, searching for words, \"How did you get so...well, so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel looked even more confused. \"What do you mean, my son? I was always so big...Well, to be honest, I did put on a few pounds lately,\" she said, squeezing one of her lovehandles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then clicked for Asriel. Not only did spell make him gain weight, but it seems to have made every monster gain weight, which also meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to shack as loud thumbing and creaking floorboards grew louder and louder. A massive belch, which made the windows rattle and the plates, pots, and pans shake in the kitchen, and Asriel turned to see his father approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hairy, sphere of a gut, several feet long, led the way. On top of it his flabby but firm pecs rested, forming a deep valley in between them. His arms and legs were much thicker than his mother's, indicating that he still had all of his muscle underneath his padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel couldn't see it due to Asgore's large beard, which had grown bigger, but his face was just as round as the rest, a third chin underneath his second. He still had his cape, but he lacked his armor. Instead he only wore ill-fitting shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Asriel thought his father looked imposing before, he was sadly mistaking. It only served to make the goat prince even more envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore's belly was rumbling just as loudly as Asriel's, and he ran his meaty hand over his ball of flesh, asking, \"Hey, honey, is the food ready? I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel gave a kind smile. \"Almost,\" she said, \"Just wait a few minutes longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsgore shrugged. \"Alright then,\" he said, sounding disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe father stomped off and his mother went back to the kitchen.

He was nervous about trying the spell, knowing little what would happen, but his curiosity was eating him up from the inside. With a sigh, he smoothed the delicate scroll and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words felt strange on his tongue, and his voice grew distorted. Asriel had heard from his mother that spells that contained dark magic did this. He was getting a little scared, but it was too late to back down now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the end of the spell, the air began sparkle around him. A sharp gust of wind appeared out of nowhere, tugging at Asriel's robes, and the room grew brighter with a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goat man immediately jumped back when the spell was complete. The wind died down and the light dimmed, but there was still sparkles in the air. Asriel looked nervously around him, searching for anything that has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was still the way they were. Asriel gulped, continuing with his final step of his investigation. He reached out and grabbed his robes. He lifted it to his chest, studying his privates that dangled between his legs. Nothing had happened to them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel frowned. He didn't understand it. Did he do it wrong? Or was the scroll a dud, a complete waste of his time? Asriel couldn't ponder this for long, for he heard a familiar voice calling his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asriel, are you down here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Asgore, his father. Asriel quickly left the secret room, pushing the book back into the shelf.

He pushed the food around in his plate, not feeling very hungry, completely silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents was talking up a storm, though, calling each other sickeningly sweet things and feeding one another from their plates.

Every hot curve, every soft figure. And at the top of the list was, embarrassingly, always his mom, looking as gentile and loving in his minds eye as he could want.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With every image that flashed through his head he could feel another small surge of growth in his privates. His member creaked large with a sound like a wet balloon being stroked. And his balls gurgled faintly with more potent seed filling them as they sagged over the lip of the toilet bowl. Already each of his balls was nearing the size of an orange and his member was as big around as a soda can and nearly twice as long, approaching a full foot in size. The head bobbed, still trying to rise as Asriel was only semi-hard at this point and the pre dripped from the sensitive mushroom tip.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Asriel wanted to resist, he wanted to find an answer to stop this magic he'd started, but his body seemed to be making decisions for him as he slowly reached out and brushed his member. Immediately a jolt of pleasure made him go ridged and the pre began to flow more strongly, dropping onto the tiled floor with a soft plopping sound. His member also jumped up in size by another two inches, though whether that was due to becoming erect or the magic Asriel was unable to guess.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young goat monster wanted to stop but every instinct told him to continue as his fingers traces around his now lime sized head, tucking into the pulled back foreskin to feel around his white member as it gave another surge under his fingers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-oh yesss...\" he found himself whispering, unable to believe his own words. The pleasure was something he'd never dreamed of and it felt so good he couldn't imagine it ever ending. And yet as he teased himself to the bring he had to bit his lips to keep from crying out as his member jerked and sprayed thick gobs of white seed. Fortunately most of it ended up in the bathtub, but there was still a splatting everywhere in front of him at present. And with every spurt his member expanded, bigger and thicker and heavier.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thankfully it did come to an end after a minute or two. Although the pleasure wasn't gone, Asriel's head did begin to clear a little as he took stock of the situation. He was now sporting a member almost four times anything he'd ever had before and it was still semi-erect as it hung to his knees. Fully erect he might have even been able to put it in his mouth. He tried to shake off that image but the thought refused to leave completely. Each of his balls were as large as softballs and sloshed faintly with his every movement. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Working to clean up the mess Asriel knew things were only going to get worse if this kept up. He needed to find an answer before the pleasure overwhelmed him again.

Azriel had never even gone twice in a row and now he felt all too eager to try for a third time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He didn't even have to bend as far this time, his hand caressed the developing abs under his fur as he brought his nearly foot and a half long member up to his mouth again. He tried to take his time and savor it, but his fangs had barely closed around the head of his member again before the sensations began to build. He tried to resist, draw it out, but in less than a minute the young adult monster came again. This time the flow of salty, slightly sweet seed was substantially bigger, he had to hold it in his mouth twice just to take a breath through his nose. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the time his climax finally ended and his now cantaloupe sized balls had deflated a little, he was sporing a rounded belly the size of a basketball sloshing with seed. Asriel groaned and poked it, feeling it slosh and wobble under his fur. It didn't last long though.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once more the gurgling began and a heat built in his body as his belly shrank away. Mostly. He did keep a small rounding over his abs, but it nearly all vanished as he felt his body ache and twitch.Only this time it wasn't just his muscles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It started with his feet, he watched in amazement as his paws swelled with a series of creeks and pops, both expanding several inches in size. Each of his toes popped out larger as well, growing as big as large limes. By the time his feet stopped they were twice their former size. His hands then began to ache as well, and he stared at both as they too groaned and popped, each digit expanding in thickness and length as his palms widened to something akin to a catchers mitt in size.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of Asriel grew as well, muscle forming on his arms and legs, and definite pecs forming on his chest. He also inched up almost half a foot in height, but his hands and feet still seemed disproportionately large to his now more athletic frame.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Asriel contemplated all this he was bopped in the nose by his member. Incredibly it was hardening again. The now soda bottle sized length refused to simply go down and couldn't wait for another round.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What should Asriel do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: This is getting out of hand, get help, or at least sneak out to find an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: One more round maybe to try and even out his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Before he can decide something else happens.</span></div></div>",

The words felt strange on his tongue, and his voice sounded distorted, which happen often to those dealing with dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, smoke began to creep out if the book, and Asriel soon found himself surrounded by sparkling white fog. He was a little afraid, but it was too late to back out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done reading, Asriel felt himself being lifted up in the air by a invisible force. At first he panicked, squirming in midair, but then a warm, pleasant feeling overwhelmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel relaxed, smiling, allowing the magic to do whatever it wanted. His body began to glow so bright that he was reduced to a yellow silhouette. While this happened, Asriel's body began to transform in strange ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow vanished, and Asriel was placed gently on his feet. She felt strange, almost like a new person, and when she opened her eyes, which had long lashes, she was greeted by a startling sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking a elegant hand, a mirror appeared out of nowhere, and Asriel studied herself with horror and fascination. No longer was she a goatman but a goatwomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong, white, curly hair cascaded down her head, reaching past her shoulder, and her lower lip had swelled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel ran her hands over her waist, feeling how slim it was, and her thick thighs. She reached up and squeezed her breasts, and Asriel could have sworn she heard milk sloshing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her clothes had changed. She was still dressed in her flowing, blue robes, but it was cut along her sides, exposing her slender legs and thighs. Growing curios, she lifted up one flap and peered between her legs. Yup, it was gone alright, replaced by a pair of pink and plump folds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel took a step back. She couldn't believe it. The spell changed his gender. She was...she was...attractive. Asriel smiled ten spite herself. She had a body that could draw the attention of any male monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just a few problems. One, her breasts were far too large. About the size of DD cups, Asriel could put her own mother to same. She tucked at her robes, trying to conceal the ample amount of cleavage she was revealing, which the dress, for some reason, was designed to do, the collar cut in a \"V\" fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second problem was what her parents were going to do when they found her like this. They were going to freak out! Yet again, Asriel's parents were expecting when it came to certain things. They probably wouldn't mind if she had a change in gender, wouldn't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel turned her attention to the scroll on the table. She bit her lower lip. Perhaps she should try and change herself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her sharp features softened, her face growing rounder, chubby cheeks and a second chin forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her growth spurt had ground to a halt, it seemed to Asriel that she gained more than 300 pounds in a few seconds. If she thought that her robes were skimpy before, her new clothes left nothing for the imagination. It had transformed just like the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was cut at the middle, allowing her belly to spill forth unhindered, and her flaps, which were ones able to conceal her legs somewhat, now acted as a loincloth, leaving her thick thighs, legs and fat rump greatly exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross her breasts were a piece of cloth, which looked like some sort of sports bra with, as expected, the royal emblem stretched across it, but it fitted Asriel's bosom so poorly that pink of her large areolas were not properly concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on!?\" Asriel exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA golden glow in the corner of her eye caught her attention, and when she looked she saw that it was coming from the scroll.

Even in this vast underground complex was filled with strange and frightening creatures, Toriel had never before seen a flower with a face on it, let alone one that could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what do or say, she decided to act casually to it, like any monster would to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bended her knees, trying to stoop down to its level, saying in her typical kind and motherly voice, \"Well, hello there. What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to give you this,\" said the plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly out of nowhere appeared a talisman in the small flower's leaves, handing it to Toriel. \"Here,\" it said, \"A gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Toriel slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, she had to admit, receiving something from a talking flower she barely knew, but she was polite, gingerly taking the object from the plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said, lifting it in the air and studying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't very pretty, Toriel had to admit. In fact, it was ugly, looking more like garbage than an actual gift: the iron chain was rusting, flakes falling off the brittle metal, and a piece of rotting wood, chipped and scratched terribly, the picture on it unrecognizable, hung from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing exactly?\" she asked, but there was no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked down she saw that the flower was gone. Shrugging, and deciding that she had enough of gardening for one day, Toriel went back inside her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the privacy of her property, she looked at the talisman and shook her head, thinking that this was some bad by a mischievous creature, she decided to...Hey! What are you doing!? No, please! Stop! Noooo!dhchrhd:#!;(/dghgfjjheejh;*!++jsndhdjdhhrfhggbg63321+/;\"\"!((Rgghfb hb45532fh355=-:!):;;)):\";*\u00b1|\u2022{\u00ab\u00bbggv.................................... .....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting.

Know this, I just saved this Interactive from another horrible story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO, what happened to the narrator you ask? Don't worry, he's fine, but I'll be taking over his job for a while. Won't that be awesome?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, let's get back to our story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foolish goatwomen was just about to throw the perfectly good talisman away, but she stopped, suddenly growing very fond of the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, placing it around her neck, marveling at its beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I'm going to keep you,\" she said, something she should have done in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talisman began to glow faintly, but what, dear readers, happens to the goatwomen?</span></div></div>",

Though he was royalty, the son of a strong and mighty king, he could be such a child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's safe!\" she snapped, \"Now get me those candles so that I can read this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel took a step back, biting his lower lip, before scurrying off to do as Chara commanded. Under the goat family's home was a library. It looked quite welcoming, with its soft chairs, beautifully patterned carpet, and books stacked on shelves in the wall, ranging from many topics. It was just too bad that it was so dame dark in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a few of them had spell books, and Chara, being the little mischievous one, wanted to try one out. She was currently standing on a stand, a large leather book opened before her. When Asriel brought the candle, the words became clear on the pages, and Chara found that she could pronounce them with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom says that we shouldn't play around with magic,\" Asriel cautioned, no doubt another futile attempt to change the human's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she ignored him, as expected. Instead, she began to read the words out loud, and purple wisps if smoke began to pour out between the folds of the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Chara,\" Asriel said, growing nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke was filling the room and even drifting up the stairway that led to the upper part of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chara!\" Asriel exclaimed, afraid, but the human seemed to ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple smoke had filled the entire room this time, and the goat boy was coughing. Suddenly, as if the smoke seemed to ignite, there was a bright flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara rubbed her eyes and looked around herself. The room still looked the same, but a few books had fallen from the shelf and papers laid scattered over the floor. She searched for Asriel and spotted him laying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did anything happen to him?</span></div></div>",

He noted that as parts of his body started to expand, the pain reduced, and he was left with a very tight feeling on his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do I do?\" The fear seems to have subsided, but his voice was raised in pitch. Chara chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know.\" She giggled a little bit at how silly Azzy sounded. \"You sound like a helium balloon, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzzy blushed, and yelled in the same helium-imbued voice. \"Go find out what you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I did, silly.\" Chara smiled. \"I made you a balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child's body creaked, his elbows and knees being forced straight as they too filled with the magical gas. \"What??

And you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel exhaled through his snout, his attempts at pouting foiled by his swollen chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara bounced over to her brother, planting a kiss on his nose.

Every part of his body had expanded aside from his chest down, his torso a single airship-shaped balloon, his arms and legs spread out and swollen. His clothes no longer fit, his pants snug on his legs like sausage casings and his shirt hanging underneath his armpits, fully displaying Asriel's expanded, hapless body. Any more pressure, and they'd both tear right off, not like there was any getting him out of them without deflating him. She really did like him like this; big, round, and completely at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided...</span></div></div>",

I'm making you bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel's eyes widened. He was helpless to prevent Chara from doing this. Puff by puff, His belly swelled and groaned. He was inflating faster yes, but Chara often stopped to take another deep breath before blowing more air into Asriel. His clothes soon ripped right off, leaving some shreds on his inflating body. Asriel felt his body fill up more and more with air. He saw his belly getting bigger and bigger and felt a bit lightheaded. Asriel, although worried, was secretly enjoying this. Chara could tell but didn't call him out on it. As Asriel was still inflating, he began to feel a bit full and realized something. He was nearing his limit. \"Um-\" Puff. \"Chara-\" Puff! \"Are-\" PuFf! \"You-\" PUFF! \"Going to-\" PUUFF!! \"Stop?\" Asked Asriel in between puffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara smiled. \"Don't worry Azzy, I will after one more puff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara inhaled deeply one more time, but she kept inhaling. Asriel saw her belly swelling for a few seconds before she got her mouth to Asriel's and blew air into Asriel. PUUUUUUUUUUUFFFFFFFFF!!!!! Asriel's body creaked and groaned loudly, he didn't want to pop, but Chara kept going. The feeling of tightness got stronger and stronger.

It was a hose, but not just any hose...It was attached to the main source of a very large water tank. It was huge and very heavy. \"If any time to use this water.\" Said Toriel. \"It's now, I hate for this to go to waste, but first...\" Toriel then muttered something under her breath before sighing. \"There we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What did you do mom?\" asked Chara. \"I made my body very elasticity Since it's a lot of water in there and I don't want to burst feeling so tight.

Chara didn't need telling twice and immediately turned the knob on the tank and watched in awe as Toriel began to gulp down water. The water wasn't cold but Toriel couldn't help but shiver a bit as she drank the water from the tank. Her belly began to swell out slowly, not as quickly as when Asriel was filled, but it was more satisfying to watch. Chara also noted that Toriel's breasts began to swell out along with her belly. Toriel moaned and groaned as she patted her now beachball sized belly, knowing the tank wasn't even half empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, Toriel's rear suddenly swelled back hard causing her thighs to thicken and her legs to give out from under Toriel, her entire body jiggling and sloshing with water as she sat down. Asriel blushed deeply, as Toriel soon overtook his ballooned form. Chara put her hand against Toriel's belly, felling it swell larger and larger, her hands were soon touching her expanding breasts. Chara giggled, she liked her mother getting bigger like this. Chara laid on Toriel's expanding belly hearing the water slightly slosh and her head against Toriel's breast's like pillows. This caused Asriel to be even more jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  By the time the tank was half empty, Toriel was soon reaching the roof. Chara had rolled off her large belly, to avoid getting crushed by the roof. Toriel managed to crack the ceiling before her large belly and breasts burst through the ceiling and into their house. Toriel didn't mind this, after all, it will repair by itself after a few days. It didn't take long until the tank was empty. To say that Toriel was huge was an understatement. Her massive belly and breasts had burst through the ceiling and a bit through her house. Chara lay atop of Toriel's massive breasts with eyes closed. She was just resting for a few minutes, Toriel giggled. \"Well, Asriel. Do you want to join me of being this size?\" asked Toriel. Asriel thought for a bit</span></div></div>",

You narrowed your eyes, trying to see in the gloom, and spotted the outline of a archway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that sitting around would get you nowhere, you stood up and walked towards the archway.

Well, that's something I haven't seen before, though a change of cargo ones and a while is good.\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you arrived at a frozen wonderland, where Asriel introduced you to many friends of his and residence of Snowden. Though, you struggled to concentrate, for it was freezing, but the goat boy didn't seem to mind the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the place Asriel took you next made you long for the low temperatures. After riding an elevator, you arrived at a place called the Hotlands, where it was very hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Asriel was kind enough to buy you some ice cream called Nice cream from a nearby stand, which you ate, and it was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling around in Hotlands for a while, you asked the goat boy where he was going, and he said, \"To Alphys' house. She's one of my aunts and my family's royal scientist. She's a little bit of an introvert, but she's pretty sweet ones you get to know her. Alphys has this crazy obsession with these cartoons, but when I call them a cartoon she gets upset and insists that it's called Anime. To me, they'te still a bunch of cartoon. Anyway, she also likes humans, so I think she would really like to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Asriel told you about Alphys sounded very good, and you did want to meet her, but, unfortunately, when you arrived at her home, you saw that there was a notice on the door, which read, \"Off to a Anime convention. Will be back later. P.S. there not cartoons! :(\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this sucks,\" said Asriel after he read the note, \"I guess we have to come back later, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were disappointed, but you and Asriel pressed onwards. You arrived at a place where it rained a lot, and the goat boy pulled out an umbrella from a conveniently placed umbrella stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There free,\" he said, \"but, unfortunately, we can only use one, so we have to share. My dad really needs to change these rules. They're kinda outdated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing through the rain, you and Asriel arrived at a landscape where many rivers were running. Some had bridges you could used to cross them, but others you had to swim through, but luckily the waters were only waist deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked, you noticed a few well-concealed pathways branches from the main path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you asked Asriel about them, he said, \"The Temmies live town there in Temmie Town. They have very deep history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you asked about the history, Asriel shrugged and said, \"Dunno. In fact, no one does. We should ask them some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrived at another elevator, and it took you and Asriel to your destination. The monsters' city lay before you, and you followed the goat boy, walking down a long road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you asked what the city's name was, Asriel said, \"It's called New Home. Great name, I know, but my dad isn't very creative when it comes to naming things. If you asked me, I would've called it Happy monster town or Pixel city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no sarcasm in his voice, so you concluded that the goat boy, like his father, wasn't very creative when it came to naming things either. You arrived at a large house, and you and Asriel went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my home,\" said the goat boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the sweet scent of something baking reached him, he continued, \"And I think my mom's cooking up some of that wonderful pies I told you about. Let's go introduce you to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned left and went to the kitchen, where Toriel, indeed, was busy baking several pies, and another burly monster, which you guessed was Asriel's father, was sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom and dad, I made a new friend that I'd like you to meet,\" announced Asriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere reaction wasn't like you expected, which made you glad. They were surprised, as if their son had brought home a surreal but beautiful piece of art, but they calmed down and Toriel was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's nice, my child,\" she said to Asriel, and to you she said, \"Please, tell us your name and how on earth did you get down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel's kind attitude and the motherly tone she used to speak to you made you trust her quickly, and you told her your name and how you accidentally fell down a hole into the Underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dreadful,\" said Toriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked them if there perhaps was a way out, and Asgore answered by saying, \"I'm sorry, but the magical barrier keeps us all down here, at least until the prophecy is fulfilled. I'm afraid you're stuck here like the rest of us, but don't fret, we will take you in a raise you like our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dismayed at what Asgore told you, but you still believed that there had to be a way out. There must be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pushing that bleak note aside,\" said Toriel, \"Who wants some freshly baked cinnamon and butterscotch pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Asriel's belly began to rumble, and he cried, \"I do! I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little hungry too, and you agreed to have slice as well. After eating two slices, you were full, but Asriel, to your surprise, managed to eat two whole pies and still wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, it was off to bed in a cozy room that you shared with Asriel. But long after everyone went to sleep, you lay awake for very long in bed, thinking of way out the Underground, for you didn't belong there...and neither did any of these monsters. They were so kind and friendly. Why seal them down here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat plan did you come up with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: you remembered what Asgore said about a prophecy and ask Asriel about it the following morning. You discovered that it involves someone growing to a ridiculous size through some means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: you remembered Alphys and how Asriel said that she was the royal scientist. If she was as smart as he said, perhaps she could find a way out of the Underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little magic versus science could have been all what the monsters needed to break the barrier.</span></div></div>",

After two whole days of sleeping until noon and not holding a pencil, getting up at 7:00 sharp to be ready by the first bell at 8:00 felt worse than jet lag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool had just opened, and one by one students were arriving, stopping by their lockers and talking in the halls, some of them more groggy than others as they slowly filed their way into the classrooms to get ready for the day. However, as the front doors once again swung open as another student entered, the sound of a fairly loud burp ringing through the hallways nearest to the door cut through the morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dinosaur like monster trudged through the halls, conversations hushed around her as she passed. Once the other students were absolutely certain she was out of earshot, they'd resume their talks, this time in the form of conspiratorial whispers and low voiced gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She looked bigger than she did Friday, right? Like, five or ten whole pounds bigger, at least.\"</i> said Monster Kid, leaning in so their companions could hear, without them having to talk too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I mean, that wouldn't be too surprising, considering she eats like a hundred pigs put together.\"</i> Snowy responded. <i>\"How long do you think it'll be before she gets new clothes?\"</i> he then asked. Snowy had a point- Susie's belly had just started to lift up her shirt, exposing a bit of purple flesh, just a few weeks ago- and already it'd grown enough to lift her white shirt (which she'd probably been re-wearing for a few days) up so far it couldn't cover her belly button. Where the cloth used to end past the waistline of her torn jeans, it now didn't touch them at all, and if it weren't for her jacket then her entire midriff would've been exposed. Not to mention, because of the large orb of her stomach getting in the way, she had been walking around with the fly of her jeans unbuttoned and zipped all the way down, and still they were tight enough for a bit of her rotund rump to be peeking out from over the waistband in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susie stomped through the hallways, her shaggy hair casting a shadow over her eyes, she spotted three particular students who were interesting to her. Catti- who she knew worked at QC's diner and had a dad who liked to cook, Jockington- who wasn't usually super interesting but might've had something good on him, and the sole human resident of her hometown, Kris- who was only standing there because apparently Jockington had roped him into a conversation. That is, before she showed up. As she went over to the trio, her large mostly exposed stomach sloshing with her steps, Kris just stood there staring with that stupid blank expression he always had- Catti looked a little offput, and Jockington looked incredibly nervous, even trying to covertly slither away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where ya goin'?\" Susie asked sarcastically, sidestepping so she blocked the snake's path. He gulped nervously, backing up a little as he looked up at the much larger monster, looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh- uh- y'know, just....getting something, out of my locker- here-\" he said, quickly reaching up with his tail, and pulling open his locker, nervously grinning and trying to keep up a cool demeanor. Susie grinned back, her sharp yellow teeth glinting as his smile faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Why's that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I was getting stuff for class, of course!\" Jockington said, but as he saw Susie's nasty grin turn into a sneer, he quickly added \"A-a-a-and I saw ya comin'! And since we're- I mean- since you- ahem- uh- S'cuse me- What I'm tryin' to say is I got something for you! I mean- It's a-\" Susie cut off his rambling, taking another step closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got something for me, huh? What a <b>nice</b> thing to do.\" She snarled, her stomach sloshing out to hang down as she leaned in threateningly. \"Well let's see it then. I sure hope it's good, if ya went through all the trouble of gettin' it special for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJockington gulped, opening his mouth to respond- but faltering. Thankfully, he had a friend nearby. \"I've got it.\" Catti's voice said, causing both Jockington and Susie to look up at her in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Whaddya mean \"you've got it\"?\" Susie asked, straightening up to look at Catti, Jockington quickly slipping to hide behind his feline savior now that her attention was diverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing. He gave it to me.\" Catti explained, reaching over and opening her own locker. \"I put it here.\" She said, rifling around, before- to everyone's surprise, pulling out three bags of food. One of them was a normal brown bag, clearly packed full of someone's lunch. There was also a quite large QC's Diner doggie bag, the kind people use to bring home leftovers or something like that. It too looked full- that one at least made sense, because Catti worked there. The last one was a bit more out of place, it being a massive plastic bag, near big enough to be a bin liner- Susie and Jockington could see through the transparent plastic and tell that it was packed entirely with food. Several dozen burgers, sandwiches, candy bars, soda cans, little snack cakes and other store bought processed snacks wrapped up neatly in foil. For a moment, no one said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...uh.\" Susie said after a moment, the whole menacing act she was doing dropping in favor of confusion, \"...Why do you have that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jockington gave me it.\" Catti said. \"For you.\" Jockington looked as confused as Susie did, but when she glanced down at him, he quickly grinned and frantically nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....No but seriously- What's the real reason?\" Susie reiterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it.\" Catti affirmed. Susie glanced over her shoulder at Kris, who had been silently standing there the whole time- as he tended to be. He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well- I get the feeling you're bullshitting me,\" Susie said, turning back to Catti with a frown. But then, a smirk crept across her face, \"but honestly, this much free food is gonna be plenty to cover your ass for now.\" Susie said, stepping forwards and snatching the bags, slinging the bin liner over her shoulder like Santa, and holding the two other bags in her free hand. \"You're lucky you had this-\" She said, looking down to Catti's heels at the cowering Jockington. \"And you're even <i>luckier</i> she had it. Just remember this is a one time thing- Giving me free shit isn't some get-outta-jail-free card, it's just what you do.\" She said, turning and walking back down another hallway, calling over her shoulder \"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them watched her walk away with all the food, her oversized ass bouncing in time with her steps. Once she'd turned a corner, and they couldn't hear her stomps anymore, Jockington looked up at Catti. \"Holy crap- Thank you so much Catti! You just like- totally saved my life! I swore she was gonna try and use me as a jumprope or somethin'!\" This prompted a slight, very slight- smile from Catti, who responded with \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJockington smiled, before asking \"But...seriously- why did you have all that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For when she came by.\" Catti simply said. \"Just meant to give her the big one.\" She shrugged, looking back down at her phone and saying in her same deadpan voice, \"But I panicked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the first class bell rang. All the students who were still in the hallways began to move into their rooms, all of them parting and clearing an especially wide path for Susie- afraid to bump into her. She usually spent her mornings before class pushing students around, collecting lunch and lunch money and stuff. But today, with the unexpected windfall Catti'd given her- She didn't even bother doing that. Of course, there were people like Berdly, Temmie, and Noelle- who had by this point learned and accepted simply handing over their lunch willingly to her if she so much as looked at them. That meant by the time the bell rang, she was carrying seven bags of food- Six normal ones, from Berdly, Temmie, Noelle, two from Catti, and the one she'd actually brought in herself to school, plus the one massive bin liner packed with junk food and snacks, apparently intended special for her. The bin liner alone was as big as her belly, and all six other bags put together were almost equal in size when put together- Which meant she was trying to hold onto three whole bellies worth of food, only one of which was her own actual stomach. As one might imagine, this was a bit difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( Here's a little reference, not taken from anyone else- created specifically for this chapter, to illustrate Susie's current size <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Tu62ldw.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/Tu62ldw.png</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone other student, aside from her, had cleared out from the hallway, Susie decided to...</span></div></div>",

Her heavy footsteps gave everyone in the halls the warning that she was coming, and so they all got to their classes quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie, lagging behind, realized that it felt a bit less noisy all of a sudden. She glanced around- sure enough, the school's halls were all vacant aside from her. It was a welcome change, less annoying nerds to get in her way and so obviously try not to stare at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked ahead again, the direction she was going. She was headed to her locker, to shove all seven bags of food in there, so she could continue the path and end up in Alphys' dumb class. What was even the lesson today? Some kinda biology? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at all the beautiful food in her arms. Especially appreciating the bin liner the size of her gut- just filled with the stuff. She sure didn't want to try and cram all this into her locker like it was a nerd who pissed her off, probably crushing and ruining it. But then that meant she'd have to carry it all into Alphys' classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless...man she didn't wanna go to Alphys' class anyway. With a smug grin, Susie pivoted on her heel, stomping off- the renewed vigor in her gait causing her oversized and overstuffed belly to bounce around, sloshing side to side in time with the movement of her legs as she headed off to find a place to gorge herself in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she settled on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Susie walked away from the classroom, not wanting to be too close in case someone came out for some reason, to bug her while she was trying to eat. She almost went to the School Cafeteria which exists now, but she realized that there'd probably be someone in there too. And so, she figured hey- the hallway's empty except for her, and class won't be over for a while. What if she just took a seat right there to eat? Who'd be around to interrupt her then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping over to a wall, Susie dropped the bags she was lugging- She could feel her large mostly bare purple stomach coming in contact with the floor as she bent her knees and got in a sort of squat, her butt struggling to rip the backside of her jeans, to put down the six normal lunch bags- just so that whatever was inside of them wouldn't break, just in case. She grunted with effort as she got back up, before simply dropping the full bin liner next to them. It was so filled up with junk that it had plenty of padding to break its fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of 'plenty of padding to break its fall', Susie herself then sat down next to the bags. Instead of easing herself into a seated position, she just started to before letting herself fall with a huff of relief, her rear end slamming into the linoleum with a resounding THOOM, causing a shockwave of jiggling flab to spread across her body- the impact causing her to let out another belch. She wasn't sure whether or not anyone was able to hear that through the walls- it seemed pretty loud to her. But then again, what were they gonna do about it even if they did hear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, Susie began to dig into her early lunch. She went for the large brown bag she'd brought from home herself first, as it was always the least interesting to her. First was a grilled cheese and roast beef sandwich, which she found to actually still be warm- Probably because she was eating it so relatively early in the day, instead of waiting for lunch period. Once as she was biting into it, she felt a glob of melty orange cheese drip out from between the pieces of bread- Swearing under her breath, she went to wipe it off- Before realizing it hadn't fallen onto her shirt and left a stain, like she thought it would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling past her lower lip like that allowed it to land directly on her puffy second chin, which hung off her neck fat enough to have its own jiggle by now when she turned her head, being about as thick as a bike tire. She smirked, pleased to find that her shirt hadn't been messed up- And more importantly, with a swipe of her finger across her smooth purple face fat, she was able to get all the cheese off- None of it being wasted or lost, and lick it off her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually- the way that her own double chin acted as a sort of guard, catching the warm cheese before it could hit her shirt, gave her an idea. Susie reached into her bag and pulled out a large tupperware container, accidentally tearing the brown paper of the bag due to the awkward angle which she took the 8-cup capacity plastic tub out at. Popping off the lid, the smell of the full container of lo-mein hit her. Still warm due to the tupperware keeping the heat in, it was a leftover from the last time her family just ordered some takeout, not feeling up to cooking. She knew that there was a disposable plastic fork in the bag, meant for her to use as she ate it- But she just lifted the tupperware to her lips, opening wide and tilting it upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a mass of oil soaked, sodium rich noodles spill into her maw, accompanied by tumbling bits of cooked broccoli, shrimp, and beef. She didn't even chew as she upended the tupperware more and more, allowing the entirety of its contents to gradually slide down her throat. Once it was empty, she carelessly dropped it next to her, letting out a sloppy belch, breath smelling like oil and salt. As she tentatively touched her fat-thickened chest, feeling her bust carefully- She grinned upon finding it was completely dry. Sure enough, any errant noodles or beef or drops of oil that fell out of her mouth as she poured the lo-mein simply landed on her double chin. She lazily wiped her face with her hand, caring less about cleanliness than simply trying to salvage any specks of food she could, licking some of the oil off of her hand and chin before moving on to the next items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe polished off a thermos full of some nice thick, creamy chowder- simply guzzling the whole thing like a drunk at a party, before washing the whole thing down with a big packet of crisps and a bottle of soda, belching once again after chugging it all without a break. She'd finally finished her first bag, the one from home. Her belly was already showing signs of still further bloating, as she sat with it resting on the linoleum floor, creeping outwards just a bit further than it had when she started. Still, if one bag of food was enough to satiate Susie's gluttonous urges she wouldn't take so much extra from everyone. With her lips and chin still faintly messy with crisp crumbs and oil, she went for another bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she went on, eating her way through the stolen meals of the other students one by one in a fairly impressive binge, no one but her in the hallways to witness her ceaseless gorging, pausing only to grab the next thing or belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerdley's had three ham sandwiches- he'd probably overpacked to compensate for how boring it was, Susie effortlessly downed each one in a single bite. There was also a little container of some kind of fancy ass salad with beans and apple slices in it, along with a container of macaroni and cheese, the best thing in there. Susie poured them into her maw like she did the lo-mein, letting her face fat itself catch spills, before guzzling a bottle of some kinda juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemmie's was filled almost to the brim with tem flakes. Which was to be expected, but whatever- they weren't bad or anything. As Susie was pouring them into her maw- she almost gagged for a moment, realizing there was a hard boiled egg for some reason buried in the flakes. She'd swallowed it before she could've gone back and peeled it. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Noelle's, which was always a good one in her experience. There was a lot of candy in there, little chocolates and stuff which she'd pop into her mouth without unwrapping. Didn't make much difference to her. There was also a whole bunch of Christmas cookies, which even had their own bottle of milk. Contrasting all the sweet stuff, there was a whole bunch of roasted chicken, presumedly leftovers from a nice holiday style dinner, which Susie put down eagerly, before finishing off with a nice big thermos- Even bigger than her own thermos- of hot chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she got to the two normal sized bags Catti had given her. The first appeared to just be Catti's regular lunch, since it was in a brown bag like the others- A massive chicken, roast beef, cheese, salami, bacon, and glitter sub sandwich- Susie could barely hold it together. It didn't look like it was store bought, mostly. Susie opened wide and crammed the whole thing down her gullet like a sword swallower, her yellow teeth grinding against both sides as it went down, herself barely chewing. There was also a big rack of ribs, which Susie plucked off one by one and ate, including the bone. They'd presumedly been grilled. There were also like, five or six hamburgers that'd been painted pink and covered in sequins. Whatever, she ate those too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other bag from Catti, which was white and branded with the QC's Diner logo, making it distinct from the others, Susie found ten whole burgers, the really hearty diner burgers- dripping with sauce and cheese and more than two thick patties each, all that. There were so many french fries it looked like they were being used as packing peanuts, along with a large ziplock bag of so many buffalo wings she couldn't count them all. The rate of Susie's eating had slowed down by this point, as her gut had expanded considerably- only growing fuller and fuller as she gripped burger after burger in her pudgy sausage fingers, ripping into them with massive bites, filling her mouth as much as she could before swallowing, going through the burgers in only three or four bites each, her trusty double chin accumulating a mosaic of stains and crumbs, as the juices and sauces from all the burgers leaked out and onto it when she'd bite into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was panting and breathing heavily as she shoved handful after handful of fries into her maw, sweat dripped down her forehead as she popped whole chicken wings down between her lips, eating them- bones and all- as she became fatter and fatter. Her buttocks blimped wider and further out, pouring over the rear waistband of her pants more and more, as her thighs thickened enough to add a few new tears on her jeans, purple flab bubbling through them. Her belly had spread out further and further, covering tiles of the linoleum floor as her shirt rode up, until it only covered her breasts, which themselves strained against it. Even her boots felt tight, the rubber soles having a length and width less than her chubby heel to her squished in toes. Finally, Susie guzzled a large plastic liter bottle of chocolate milkshake to wash it all down, letting out a belch which made every roll on her body bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie panted heavily, rubbing her belly with an idle hand. She was stuffed- her face was a mess, and her belly had almost doubled in size from that, rising up off the ground like a purple dome. That's when she realized- she hadn't finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over a the intimidatingly large bin liner, packed with junk food. Susie gulped- she was so stuffed she almost felt sick...but....food- Her mouth watered at the thought of even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Here's another drawing, unique for the chapter, not lifted, Susie before and after eating the contents of all 6 bags, but not the bin liner. Y'know, not yet. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/z025Uhw.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/z025Uhw.png</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a bit of consideration...</span></div></div>",

Granted, it was rather small, a box that fitted in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was still very excited, and she opened it the first chance she got when she arrived home. What she found inside was a golden ring with a red ruby set into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel was very flattered. \"So thoughtful,\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped it on her ring finger and smiled, admiring it. It was then that the ruby emanated a bright flash of light, blinding Toriel for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the growth began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was subtle. At first Toriel wasn't sure she felt anything. Arms crossed over her chest, it was a bit of a shocker to feel the pressure of her own breasts pushing against them. And more so than usual. And as she watched with awe, the mounds rose like bread in an oven, first once, then again, lifting her robe a tiny big higher as it slid through her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from below came another sensation, as Toriel felt herself briefly thrown off balance to one side and then the other. Turning to look down she saw her rear end had expanded, first on one side and then the other trying to catch up. Then it happened again, her left rump cheek plumped up by a solid inch in diameter followed a moment later by her right one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the front, Toriel watched in amazement as her breasts bounced and bumped a bit bigger, rising up to press her chin into a small valley of cleavage as she let out a soft moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth stopped, and so did the blissful feeling of growth. Toriel could only stare in shock at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was very voluptuous now. Many would call her the sexiest monster in town, but they would also think, \"How on earth did she become so curvy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions will be asked, and Toriel wasn't sure if she liked that. There has to be a way to fix this, she thought and tried to pull of the ring, but it wouldn't budge. She tried will all her might, but it stayed there as if it was glued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the ring flashed again...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The motherly goat monster found her breath start to come in short pants as her form rippled like a jello mold in an earthquake or like a sea in a hurricane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with each ripple another small layer of size was deposited across her assets, building bigger and bigger as her hands tentatively pressed against her billowing chest which had begun to lift the hem of her robe, while her rear end had already raised it above her tail as her bountiful butt cheeks became more like a twin pair of white furred pillows with every rippling wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth stopped and Toriel was frightened now.

Slowly the hem of her robes rose above her large pert nipples, the cloth ill-fitting in every sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel it, she was close to something.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to a world of Monsters Friendly Monsters.<br>\r\nFor those of you who haven't played or experienced the game Undertale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDO SO NOW!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Have you done so? Good, then we can continue without fear of <span class=\"cred\">Spoilers</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, as you may have guessed is a interactive for expanding the characters of Undertale in various ways. And in order to keep the story nice and neat, I have some rules to lay down. First, the usual ones I have in most of my interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) No death. Unless it's essential to the plot I don't want to see characters bumped off for whatever reason. So no 'Genocide runs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) No Gore (see above) or gross depictions. I won't tolerate depictions of characters 'wallowing in their own filth' or anything similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Hyper pregnancies are allowed but keep number of children born to a minimum. This one takes being a bit creative. For example, if a character get's pregnant with a hundred eggs they CAN be unfertilized and therefore will never hatch on their own. The eggs CAN hatch if they produce copies or clones of the original. They CAN hatch into a hundred new beings that age rapidly into adults with full knowledge needed to live. But they CANNOT be hatched as a hundred crying infants that need to be taken care of by the parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Don't just stop a story to start another one. Whichever character you pick is the one the story follows. Others can expand as well, but the story stays focused on the main character. So for example if you follow the path with Toriel don't just switch to Undyne for several chapters for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) Short posts will not be tolerated. Single sentence posts will be deleted unless there is no way to expand them for multiple choices. Each post should be at least a couple paragraphs long, anybody can do that with a little effort so just <i>try</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the story specific rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Keep all characters in character to a degree. They don't have to adhere strictly but try to keep things they would do within the realm of possibility. Don't just have a serious warrior like Undyne decide to be lazy all of a sudden without reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Stick to timeline possibilities. As you'll see in the first decision, the story will fall into multiple timelines. What's established in one cannot just 'appear' in another. Try to keep them separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Characters like Sans and papyrus are to be kept as is. I know I've seen creative works of Sans being expanded in some places, but both are skeletons and that's how they're depicted in the game. Don't just 'give them bodies' so they can be expanded as well or work out a way for them to grow as is. They and some other monsters are exempt from such changes though they may interact as 'NPCs' for the main characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) The human character of Frisk in some story-lines may become a monster like Asriels brother or something, but he's exempt from expansion in human form. Only the monsters are expanding in this story.</td>",
