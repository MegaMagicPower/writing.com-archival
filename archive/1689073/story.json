Today it seemed all of his friends didn't have time for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some he expected to snub him. Cordelia was his ex, of course she was going to snub him, if she acknowledged him at all today it would be to verbally abuse him.  That one was a given.  Faith he now knew would treat him like dirt because they'd had sex last week.  Apparently his thinking they'd had something was him just being missinformed.  He'd scratched Faith's itch and that was that.  Faith wasn't one to back track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles was a pseudo father figure, not his actual father and as usual the Britt seemed to have several hundred things up in the air at the moment.  And with no way of telling which of those were life or death Xander wasn't going to begrudge him any lack of birthday well wishing.  The same could be said of Joyce his pseudo mother figure, she also had several other things to deal with each probably more important than his wounded ego.  Oz wasn't exactly his buddy, he was his best friend's boyfriend, at best their relationship was cordial.  Wesley was an annoyance that Xander would be glad to see gone.  The same could be said for Angel, he was a particular pain in the ass that Xander wouldn't mind loosing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Willow and Buffy were different stories altogether.  His bossom budies had deserted him.  He knew his birthday wasn't going to be the leading news item today.  Buffy being the Vampire Slayer would naturally be more focussed on whatever supernatural freak of the week they were facing this week, however a kind word should still have been said, a simple, 'hey happy birthday Xan-Man'.  She'd managed last year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow forgetting was like a dagger to his heart.  Willow his boon companion, the peanut butter to his jelly, the  laurel to his hardy, had forgotten his birthday.  That damn near took his breath away.  It was a betrayal at the fundamental level.  Xander knew that their friendship wasn't on solid ground like it had been since they'd been caught kissing each other by their significant others but he had no idea their little affair had cracked their freiendship this badly.  For this was the first time in thirteen years that Willow had forgotten his birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Xander this was akin to saying grass was now red, water was now dry, up was down, cats and dogs were now living together, to quote the great Bill Muarry 'mass hysteria!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands fisting in his hair Xander Harris gave in to frustraton and forgot that wishing was a bad thing.  You never knew who could be listening and grant that wish, twisting it and perverting it to their own nefarious purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could go somewhere where people wanted someone like me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted!\" A voice far deeper than any human's came from some place out of the blue and in an instant Xander Harris dissappeared from sight.</span></div></div>",

He squeezed his eyes shut and rubbed the heels of his palms against his eyes.  Because he could not be seeing what he was seeing.  It was not possible that he was somehow, some way looking down on Earth.  He was looking down on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down on it like he was no longer on it.  Like he was in space.  Slowly, afraid to even breathe, Xander tilted his head left and then right  looking around himself.  It seemed like he was in a building, metal floor, walls and ceiling, doorway far off to the left, doorway far off to the right, apparently he was in a hallway.  Xander tried to reassure himself that that was it.  That was the only thing wrong.  He'd just... some how gone from sitting in his bedroom to being in a office building hallway without noticing he was walking... somewhere.  Xander didn't exactly believe that one himself, and frankly, he was pretty good at lying to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem?\" a voice asked from behind Xander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Xander turned and felt his eyes widen and the blood drain from his face. He whispered,  \"Oh, mother puss bucket!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lost consciousness Xander's eyes remained locked on the being before him.  He couldn't believe he was looking at-</span></div></div>",

In all her better looking than Linda Carter glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman raised an eyebrow in surprise as the boy before her looked shocked to see her before his eyes rolled up into his head.  With a curious groan he then collapsed face first towards her.  Wonder Woman was so surprised by the act that she didn't get her hands up in time to catch the young man thereby allowing him to face plant smack dab in her cleavage before gravity took hold and he slid down her body.  The shock of it caused her to freeze, her body locking up as the boy's open mouth landed on the slope of her left breast only to drag down her flesh as he slide off her to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping back to float in the air away from the slumbering teen Wonder Woman was both angered and aroused.  Angered that any man would touch her in such a manner.  And aroused in that it had felt so good.

He was not as handsome as Batman either.  Still there was something compelling about the young man, Wonder Woman had to admit. It was an undeniable quality that seemed to radiate joy, loyalty and something else... something menacing.  Something reminding her of her dealings with Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer senses picked up on the presence before she could even turn her head.  The presence of a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and slowly turned to face the god behind her.  Her eyes widened when she saw not one but many.  Apollo, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Artemis, Dionysus, Ares and his daughter Armonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo stepped forward, \"Hello Diana, I see you have found our avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...\" her voice gave out on her as she cast her eyes from the group to the boy at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoseidon spoke, \"Yes, ours, even though he is not of our world we have claimed him now that his own has no use for him.\" The sea gods eyes burned bright for a second, \"His living well here will be the best revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman gave Poseidon a wide birth, he was a god that lived for revenge.  \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In his own home, in his own universe young Xander lived and died for his friends.  He would fight to the death, into hell and back at the merest hint of trouble.  He would lay down his life nobly so that those he called kin would go home at night to their loved ones.  And in recompense for such service his friends spat on his loyalty and on his courage, undercut his determination and self worth.  In a fit of peek our avatar called out to be taken somewhere where he would be of use...\"  Athena came to a stop not a foot from Wonder Woman, \"We have decided that we have a use for the youth, Diana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here he can exult in his war with 'evil'.\"  Ares said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana glared at the god, \"What do you mean his war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much like the Bat you favor our avatar has pledged himself to an eternal war against evil.\"  Hephaestus said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis nodded her head, \"And unlike the Batman you consort with, the boy has done so without the benefits of years of preparations or a vast wealth to draw upon.  When presented with an evil at his tender age he dove into the Hunt, determined to see his work done without delay relying upon his wits and the strength in his limbs to see him through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman didn't exactly like her relationship being termed consorting, that had a slightly uncomfortable connotation to it, however she was not about to start arguing with a pack of gods about their word choice.  Or about her love life, or lack of love life since coming to man's world.  Not that she was lacking in offers, it was just that she had found those offers lacking, the quality of those offering themselves as lovers was scanty at best.  Unlike the offers from back home on Themiscara where taking a fellow Amazon as a lover was never a burden to her as she knew the character of the woman making the offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrodite and her daughter Armonia stepped forward, their beauty both excited and pacified Diana.  She had to admit that it was hard not to be turned on by the Goddess of love.  Especially when you've spent most of your immortal life living on an island of all women, with all that that would entail for her love life and the dry spell she was enduring here in the 'real' world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite the fact that he has chosen his war, our avatar is ruled by his heart.  He is a man of great love.  His capacity to give love is beyond your imaging, Diana.\"  Aphrodite spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would bring peace to those that he loves, ease their pains and fears.\"  Armonia said with a smile.  \"If breaking himself would ease the burdens of those he loved he would gladly throw himself into danger's path without a thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do it with a smile on his face and a joke rolling off his tongue.\"  Dionysus grinned.  \"Give the man his due, he knows funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he knows that prophecy is only set in stone if you allow it.  That young man knows more than he shows.\"  Apollo said with a nod of his head to the boy, \"Have care with the avatar, Diana, for he will never show you his true face.  Only his enemies will know his true measure.  For his hurts he will shield himself from others.  The hurt done to him by his kin will leave deep scars, scars that will need healing if he is to be effective in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemeter stepped to Diana and took her hands in her own, making sure she had Wonder Woman's eyes on her the goddess spoke.  \"Be patient with our avatar Diana.  We have brought him to you so that you may help him be what he is needed to be. The animal inside of him rages and needs taming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I late?\" Hermes asked, materializing out of thin air.  He looked around, \"Oh good, just in time.  Hey, Diana, see you met our wonder boy.  Keep an eye on him.  he's good but we're gonna make him great.  Shoot, gotta go!\"  And with that Hermes disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmonia and Aphrodite both came to Wonder Woman and each laid a hand upon her shoulder, Armonia spoke, \"Our Avatar is out of balance, we've brought him to you to see him well.  It is your charge to see our Avatar returned to his full vigor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrodite gave a wink and a grin, \"And it wouldn't kill you to sample what the boy's selling.  He's talented.  Very, very talented.\"  Aphrodite gave a knowing nod of her head, \"Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHephaestus limped forward moving his wife and step daughter away, \"The boy has a deft hand when it comes to shaping things.  Encourage this talent and you and yours will reap the rewards of the boys forge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo leaned in, \"Remind the boy that music is a good thing and can be a healing experience.  He forswore his instrument when his blood brother died. Help him see his error. I may be biased in this but it is truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena and Artemis chimed in, \"The boy will swear he's dull and dim.  Shake him from this perception. If he persists that he is dumb then you hone his cunning.  While he may not think himself book smart he knows he's sneaky. Remind him of cunnings importance in the hunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDionysus giggled, \"Don't let him brood.  In fact if he does, call him on it.  He'll stop.  Remind him helping people is a good thing and to always to do it with a laugh and a smile.  I speak for me and speedy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres waved a hand, the other gods fell silent and stepped back. \"Our avatar is in your hands, Diana, do not fail us.  The consequences would be dire for you if the boy turned out not as we expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't threaten me Ares.\"  Wonder Woman growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't dream of doing so.\"  Ares smiled grimly. \"The threat comes not from us, but from the boy and the danger he poses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took but the blink of an eye but when Wonder Woman next looked upon the corridor she was alone with the boy.  She hung her head, \"Batman's not going to like this.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His war remains.  Different place but the job remains the same.  He may dally with your heroics, but he must still hunt the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana frowned, \"The dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vampires.  The boy is a vampire hunter.  And other associated demons of course as well.\"  Hades clasped his hands behind his back.  \"From time to time I may have work for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman shivered.  The occupants of hell chilled her blood.  That this boy had taken the fight to them without aid of super powers was astonishing.  \"I'll tell him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades smiled, \"Excellent.  Now about the topic the ditz alluded to earlier.\"  Hades sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What topic?\"  Wonder woman boggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking the boy as a lover.\"  Hades explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana recoiled, \"I would never-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades shrugged, \"Pity.\"  he turned away from her and walked away.  \"He would have brought you great joy, daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana's mind raged, why was everyone talking about her love life?  What business of it was theirs?  \"Stay out of my affairs Hades!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back over his shoulder at her, \"You may not enjoy the fact that I am your Father, Diana, but it does not change the fact that I am.  And like any father I want you to enjoy your life.  I see the trouble you have with the detective and I found you an alternative.  A man of like mind without the emotional baggage to bar the way of your happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was struck mute by that statement.  Slowly she found she could speak, \"Yo-you brought him here for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I searched high and low, daughter, for the right man for you.  I found several candidates.  Alexander was the only real choice when all was said and done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman let out a strangled whine as she tried to imagine that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell your mother to expect a visit.  And if you do not come to her I will arrange for her to come to you.\"  Hades smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hera.\"  Wonder Woman whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannot help you.\"  Hades answered as he faded away to nothing in a burst of flame.</span></div></div>",
