Now that she was free, she could get back to her goal of finding Yuma, but she had to find a way out. She looked around, and found a corridor leading out from the room. She began to make her way down it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when it happened. She stumbled as he body being to swell outwards with flab, knocking her off balance. 'AH!\" she yelled in shock, as her breasts and stomach surged out in front of her, and her hips and butt swelled out behind her, rounding out her frame. She stumbled for a bit more, groping at herself in shock, before the growing stopped. She was much large, plushier and fatter now, with a belly like a tire, boobs as big as basketballs, upper arms as thick as as a drainpipe, and was could only be described as a couch-crushing rear, with an ass like over-blown exercise balls which tapered down into meaty upper thighs and swollen lower thighs. \"What...was in those USBs?\" she wondered, still groping at her new body. She started off again soon after she stopped groping herself. Yuma wasn't here, and if she was in danger, it would be no good to hang around here...besides, that might not be the only surprise this place, or whoever had stunned her, had in store for her...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Reference Picture: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/view/21746866/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.furaffinity.net/view/2174686...</a> )</span></div></div>",
