After creating a stand for yourself on the side of the marine ship, you use an incomplete alchemy circle to punch a hole in the side of the marine ship you`re on. You jump on top of the ship and the marines on board point their guns at you. Slyly, you then create another alchemy circle at your feet and shoot yourself to the next marine ship as the Marines you just left behind are yelling, \"S/He`s a fruit user, get the sea-stone cuffs!\" After a little while of repeating this process, you decide this will take too long as more marine ships are coming. So to stop them all in one swift blow, you create the biggest alchemy circle you can and separate the sea around them into it`s base elements and cause it to dissipate, running the ships aground. As the water you didn`t touch flows back in, you catapult yourself again onto the Thousand Sunny. After the marines surface and curse at you, you realize you`ll probably be labeled a pirate for this, but then again, you never really cared in the first place. As you turn around to the crew, they all look at you in astonishment. Now what?</span></div></div>",

You wake up one minute later with Luffy at your right trying to get his head unstuck from a hole on the ground. You look up and see a beautiful ship, adorned with a tremendous head figure.<br>\r\n\" It trully is a beautiful sunflower \" you remarked, only to be hit in the head by a flying hammer, followed by the words \"IT'S NOT A SUNFLOWER, BAKA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, again, in the Thousand's Sunny infarmary. You look to your side and see the figures of Chopper's back, apparently making something on his desk and Nami, scolding Franky for the incident,<br>\r\n\" You know I hate when people do that \" replied the cyborg.<br>\r\n\" But it has no excuse concerning people who have never seen it \" scolded Nami<br>\r\n\" Hemm.... hello? \" you said while getting up.<br>\r\nThe sudden salute made Chopper jump from his chair and hide himself (the wrong way, again) behind Nami's legs.<br>\r\n\" I'm sorry for the trouble, are you feeling alright now? \" asked Nami walking towards you, while at the same time, stepping on Franky's foot.<br>\r\n\" OWW! \" yelled Franky, holding his foot, until he took the hint \" Oh, ya. Sorry about the hammer thingy. I kinda snapped back there\".<br>\r\n\" No really, it's my fault. I should have realized that it was really a sun \" you replied<br>\r\n\" WHAT? \" yelled Franky towards you in an angry mood.<br>\r\n\" Kidding, it is a marvelous ... lion \" you concluded, putting an end to Franky's rage.<br>\r\n\" Of course it is. It was made in the most SUPER way I could \" said Franky, proud of himself.<br>\r\n\" Yeah, yeah! \" replied Nami, sick of the cyborg's talking about himself \" come now. You should meet the rest of the crew, they're outside waiting for you to recover \" stated Nami while pushing the shipwright outside.<br>\r\n\" Yeah, you should meet the crew \" said Chopper near your legs.<br>\r\n\" Tanuki ?\" you joked<br>\r\n\" Reindeer, you asshole! See ? Antlers !!! \" answered Chopper furious<br>\r\n\" Heh! I know, just kidding. And thanks for patching me up. You're an awesome doctor. \"<br>\r\n\" You bastard, that doesn't make me happy at all \" said Chopper doing his happy dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walked outside, all Straw Hat Pirates are present in the lawn.<br>\r\nYou jump the rail and land in front of them, bowing with one knee on the floor.<br>\r\n\" My dear pirate comrades.  It's polite for the guest to be the one to introduce himself. I'm .... \"<br>\r\n\" Yes, we already know who you are. We read the wanted picture the Marines posted around town \" said Robin, shocking you with surprise, loose your balance, and falling face first on the ground.<br>\r\n\" It's also polite to let a person finish his own introduction \" you said, still face in the ground. \" I also know of you all. You're quite famous around Water 7 \" you said, remembering a stroll you had made in that place \" but I don't recal the existence of such a character \" you said, standing up, pointing at Brook. <br>\r\nAfter being introduced to Brook, which you find hilarious and interesting about being a swordsmen also, you and Nami sit down on a table on the lawn, discussing the terms about your staying on their ship.</span></div></div>",

Lisana was thrown backward into a tree the wind knocked out of her the two men who were holding onto her were thrown back further into the trees.  Lisana stood up and surveyed the furrow in the soil that the thing had created upon impact and followed it.  At the end of the furrow she saw someone sprawled out.  \"Hey are you alright?\",Lisana called out. They didn't respond.  As she got closer she saw it was a young man maybe eighteen or twenty years old.  She hopped down into the furrow.  \" I hope he's all right.\", she thought.  She placed her fingers on his neck and felt a faint but steady pulse.  she breathed a sigh of relief.  \"Well well well what have we here.\" said the boss.  \"Dunno boss but I bet he will fetch a good price.\" said the lackey.  Lisana turned and stood in front of the comatose boy.  \"You are not taking him, he's just a kid.\" she said.  \"Shut it you self righteous bitch!\" the boss said as he struck Lisana, she cried out in pain.</span></div></div>",
