From your angle, you can easily view the pink insides of the maw, the sharp canines and the gullet.

However, it also seems to awake interest of the other dogs in the room. Still pinned down, you watch in dread as multiple dogs start to approach you. Some of them panting, some of them cocking their heads, but all of them immensely curious about you. They tower above you, their eyes locked on your tiny body. You stare back in horror at most of the dogs you had seen before, like the Rottweiler, the Malamute, Labrador, and it seems like even more have entered the room, like a Samoyed and a Bernese Mountain Dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Great Dane lowers its snout again, more dogs join in, and quickly, you're surrounded by muzzles all around you. You gasp at the dozen enormous dog noses, most of them sniffing you intently. The warm breath of all the canines quickly heats you up.
