These were dark and sinister, leading me to the shadowy corridors of my mind where a bitter winter's cold froze my soul and left me with a cold sensation every time when I was violently awakened from my slumber once I heard that whisper. And tonight was no different as I woke up drenched in sweat, my heart beating pounding fast enough to the point where I am half expecting to see it pop out of my chest. Even though that I was covered in sweat, I felt like I was resting in snow as my body began to slightly shiver. However, the soft gleam of a nearby night light brought me a slight amount of comfort before I finally got up and entered the corridor, trying his best to be as silent as he could be so he didn't wake up his grandparents and walking to the bedroom that was across my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Jacob's bedroom. This slowly became a nightly routine of mine after I woke up from my nightmares and wander into his bedroom to either find some solace or comfort of hope. It made me feel somewhat better as if he was watching me. I could feel my heart slowly sink deeper into my chest as I knelt at the edge of my brother's untouched bed, folding both hands into a fist before praying and hoping that wherever his brother was, he was safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" my grandmother's voice startled me. She was standing by the doorway, looking at me with some concern, \"What are you doing in here?\" It took me a second to finally respond to her with a half-truth, \"I couldn't sleep...\" The truth was that I could sleep but it would take me to places to where I would wish not to visit. \"I know,\" she answered back before walking over to me and wrapping me in her arms before adding, \"Tomorrow is a very important day for you, you must be anxious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then responded back quickly wanting to change the subject, Yeah, let's just say that's the reason. My grandmother then slowly helped me up before guiding me out of Jacob's bedroom, \"There's no need to be in here, dearie\", she tells me, adding, \"Let's get you back to bed and try to get some sleep.\" I got one last glance of Jacob's bedroom before returning to my own. Grandma sat next to me in bed, comforting me into sleep by running her fingers through my brown hair. I didn't want to tell her about my nightmares as she was probably hurting more than I was so adding more to her plate seemed selfish of me. I noticed the clock that hung above my desk read five minutes past midnight. Today was the day where I will finally go to Diagon Alley to get all of my supplies for my first year of Hogwarts. I knew I should be more excited about it, but I was actually terrified as I knew what reputation Jacob had at Hogwarts would make people assume that we will be the same. The last thought that came to my mind before feeling the calmness of slumber was the fear of walking through all seven school years with no friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't feel like the slumber lasted long but once I woke up; there were strong sunbeams flooding my bedroom, warming the chills that lay bare inside my heart from the nightmares. My grandparents seem to be more excited than I am and I'm not sure why. I always thought that it was sweet of them to have volunteered to look after me while my parents are looking for Jacob. There was a big pile of waffles on the table and a bubbling cup of tea waiting for me as I made my way out of my room and towards the kitchen, quickly seeing my grandfather at the table, hearing him ask before he took a sip of tea, \"Are you excited for our trip to London?\" I answered halfheartedly, trying my best to portray any amount of excitement to cover the fear, \"I sure am, grandpa.\" I sat down at the table, seeing my grandfather's sweet smile as he put his cup of tea down and opening up the newspaper. The scent of tobacco that my grandpa was known was strangely calming this morning as I slowly began to eat breakfast. A trip like that would take hours, from Lancaster to London, is much faster when using Floo Powder. I traveled like this before but the dust was still bothersome to me; I guess I still prefer trains...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Leaky Cauldron was just as I remember it five years ago when I came with my parents to get Jake's supplies. It was just as gloomy and dusty as before along with the smell remained just as funny. Grandpa rushed over to the counter to give a warm greeting to the bartender while I stood next to Grandma as she cleared her throat so that Grandpa would know that he doesn't have all day to sit and chat with old friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, we finally walked to the small alley behind the bar where Grandpa touched the bricks with his wand in a well-known pattern before the bricks move and twist to form a glorious archway that we could walk under. \"Agatha.\" someone yelled from the crowd as they made their way down the alley before hearing, \"Long time no see! And Sebastian! Roger, come here! Agatha and Sebastian are here!\" An old woman appeared from the crowd followed by an old gentleman and walked up to my grandparents, looking very happy with bright red cheeks. The old gentleman looked more serene as he stopped by her side, nodding at grandma and grandpa.\"Roger, Amelia. It's so nice to see you.\" Grandma said politely before adding, \"Have you met Alexander? He just got his letter last week.\" \"Oh, hello dear,\" Amelia said with a smile as she looked at me before watching her turn her focus to Grandma, \"Agatha, we have so much to talk about! Have you heard that Tristan and Madeline Snyde were sent to Azkaban? It's said that they were helping You-Know-Who!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa looked at me with a noticeable smile before he slowly passed me the bag that contained everything that he needed to cover the cost of supplies with a wink. I flash him back a smile before taking it, glad that he knew that I would much rather be alone. Diagon Alley was always a very confusing place to me, full of people rushing by, a lot of odd stores and even odder people. I walked around looking from side to side, trying to remember where all of the stores that I had to go into in order to get my supplies when I suddenly crashed against someone causing both of us to fall onto the cobbled street. \"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" I say as I get up noticing who I ran into was actually an interesting boy that seemed to be around his own age before offering his hand to help them up.\"It's okay,\" he said, \" I wasn't looking to where I was going\" I answered back with a smile, \"Well, neither was I.\"The boy in front of him then introduced himself, \"I'm Rowan Khanna.\" I could already guess that they were of Indian descent before hearing Rowan's surname. I then introduced myself,\"Alexander Prescott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowan then asked with a hint of excitement, \"First year at Hogwarts too?\" \"Yea,\" I simply replied before watching Rowan's eye brighten with excitement, \"Me too! Did you get all your supplies already?\" \"Well, no, I just started and honestly, I'm not quite sure where to start...\" I admitted with a slight amount of embarrassment before hearing Rowan respond, \"I can help you with that if you'd like.\" I couldn't help but smile at Rowan's offer as he seems to be a very nice boy and a possible future friend. I was not in any position to deny a possible friend since everyone would probably avoid me when they know who my brother is and answered him, \"I'd love to Rowan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe go to Flourish &amp; Blotts, showing me by heart all the books that I'm going to need and pointing a lot of very strange books that he would like me to read. Being a book lover, I was honestly happy to be around someone like Rowan that loves books and learning as I do. Rowan then mentioned that her family was tree farmers, providing wood for wand and broom makers as I was paying for my books. He then mentioned, \"Speaking of wood, you must go to Olivanders right now.\"Before I could respond, he began to pull me out the door by the hand. Arriving in front of the very dusty and old looking wand shop, a couple yells Rowan's name and by the look of them; they were clearly his parents. Rowan then said, \"Go get your wand, I'll be right there.\" I slowly entered the store, feeling a slight chill in my palms from the nervousness. There was an old man standing behind the counter along with thousands of thousands of boxes stacked into the walls. He looked at me with curiosity and gave me a warm welcoming smile, \"Here to get your first wand? I simply nod, feeling out of place and anxious. He then began to take my measurements of my wrist to elbow, elbow to shoulder, shoulder to foot, and even the distance between my eyes before walking to the back of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hands me a gorgeous wand, explaining, \"Cherry wood with dragon heartstring, 11 inches, very flexible.\" I hold it in my hand for a moment before testing it. Immediately, the papers on the counter began to fly around, falling messily onto the floor.\"I'm so sorry,\" I said before putting the wand back into the box and onto the counter. \"It's okay. Your brother broke my favorite ink pot when he came to buy his first wand.\" I was shocked by the fact that he remembered my brother and asked, \"You remember my brother?\" \"Oh yes...I remember every wand I ever sold. Your brother's wand was a maple wood with dragon heartstring, 10 inches. It was a shame they broke it when he was expelled. It was an excellent wand. I then let out my feeling about the situation, \"He ran away from home after that. He's been missing ever since. I wasn't sure why I was telling him this but I just couldn't stop. He then asked, \"That must have deeply impacted you, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I feel bad for him,\" I say. \"He loved Hogwarts very much. There would have to be a strong reason for Jacob to do such a thing. I just\u2026 I just hope he's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" he says, scratching his chin. \"Sensitivity might be your greatest strength, then,\" and he offers me a different wand that had a very noticeable spiral of wood around the wand. \"A pliable 12-inch wand made of Acacia and a unicorn core.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and wave the wand lightly. A gentle breeze flows around me, making my hair float graciously, and I feel a nice warmth deep inside my heart. It feel absurdly nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" he says with a satisfied smile. \"Acacia wands are very underrated but very loyal to their wizards and add the unicorn hair and you have the perfect combination. This wand shall be your best friend, Mister Prescott. Take good care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" I smiled. \"Thank you so much, sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outside of the store was much lighter and warmer and I don't feel anxious or weird anymore. I'm not sure if it was the soothing sensation of my wand choosing me or being able to talk about Jacob without feeling judgmental eyes all over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" Rowan calls me from the other side of the pathway. \"Did you get your wand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. An Acacia wood and a unicorn core.,\" I tell him and he just smiled back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine is mahogany, directly from Khanna's farm!\" she says, excitedly. \"I'm so happy I could burst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't. Who'd clean all the bits of brain and guts from the floor?\" I giggle and that was able to get a smile out of Rowan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I met you, Athena. People usually think I'm very\u2026 strange. Do you think I'm strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People say the same about me, Rowan,\" I say with a comforting smile, the warm feeling guiding my words rather than hiding behind the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would say such a thing? You seem like a nice person\" Rowan asks, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a quick flashback where Alexander was called a freak by one of his cousins after Jacob got expelled from Hogwarts saying that I would suffer the same fate. Alex then sighed slightly before saying to Rowan, \"My brother is Jacob Prescott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob Prescott?\" he said surprised. \"The same Jacob Prescott who was expelled from Hogwarts by breaking all the rules in search of the myth of the Cursed Vaults?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same,\" I sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His story came out on the Daily Prophet,\" Rowan told me. \"All school will know you're his brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. People will think I'm weird too,\" I stare at my shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel his warm hand landing softly on my shoulder and I raise my head to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Athena,\" he says. \"We can be weird together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Rowan. That's very sweet of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what should I do if people start disturbing you about your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I guess,\" I shrug. \"I don't want you to get in trouble because of me. It will only draw more attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right. We'll have a lot to occupy our heads, with all the exciting classes we'll have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" I say. \"I'm truly happy I met you, Rowan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashes me a very kind smile and I have the sensation that, by his side, everything will be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day is peaceful and fun. Rowan takes me to the rest of the stores, explains me a bit about his family's farm, we eat ice cream and get our school robes and our cauldrons, and when we realize, it's time to go home and meet up with my grandparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma and Grandpa are still talking to the strange couple from before, but now they're coming from Eeyelops Owl Emporium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" Grandma says. \"Who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Rowan Khanna,\" I say. \"Rowan, these are my grandparents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice to meet you,\" Rowan says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khanna? From the wand farm?\" Grandpa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the pleasure of knowing your grandfather. Mohan. He was an extremely intelligent man. We went to Ravenclaw together,\" Grandpa says with a nostalgic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was indeed very intelligent. One of my role models, actually,\" Rowan explains, which leads me to believe that her grandfather has already passed away but then segway to the cage in Alex's grandfather's hand. \"Wow, a Great Horned Owl!\" she exclaims, looking at the huge owl inside the cage Grandpa is holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" he says, lifting the cage. \"Alex, we got this for you. An early Christmas gift, if I may say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owl is immense, with big yellow eyes and brown/white/black spotted soft looking feathers. It looks at me with sunshine eyes and blinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He\u2026 She\u2026 is gorgeous. Thank you so much!\" I say, hugging them both. Alex always had a love for pets and getting his own owl was a great thing for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She,\" Grandma tells me. \"I'm sure you'll be best friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile that grows on my face is one impossible to fake. I look at my grandparents, thanking the skies for still having them in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, I finally sleep with no nightmares. My new friend Twilight watches over me from the top of the canopy, with her bright yellow eyes reassuring me and making me feel that even though I'm haunted by my brother's mistakes, at least I'll go to Hogwarts with two new friends and the promise of a bright future.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I've missed trains. They're so much nicer and comfortable than Floo Powder. You can rest, enjoy the landscapes, eat and not worry about getting dust all over your clothes. The Hogwarts Express is different from all the other trains I've been to. To start, it has a glossy scarlet color and you don't access it from a regular platform. I have crossed the Platform 9\u00be before, but doing it now, when it's my time to go to Hogwarts, gives me a totally different feeling. Rowan sits with me in one of the first wagons. He talks nonstop about his favorite book so far: Hogwarts, A History. Apparently, he's even nerdier than me and that was very reassuring. We spend all eight hours of our lovely trip from London to Scotland talking about everything, eating cauldron cakes and discussing what we think will be our favorite subjects. \"I reckon I'll love History of Magic,\" he says, pushing his glasses back. \"It's said that the professor is a ghost. Isn't that exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'm going to love Potions,\" I say. \"I've watched Grandma making amazing potions and I think it's pretty fantastic.\" \"But I've heard that the Potions professor is very\u2026 cranky. He's been teaching for a few years now, but already holds a reputation. There are rumors that he's a Death Eater,\" Rowan says, darkly. \"I heard he was a Slytherin and that he only favors Slytherins. I don't know how we'll manage to get House Points with him.\" \"Jeez, Rowan. Thanks for the bustle,\" I laugh, rolling my eyes. \"I'm sure I'll survive our dreadful Potions master.\" The journey ends with laughter and serenity. When the night falls upon the train, we put our robes and wait for the train to finally stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were awaited at the station by the biggest man I've ever seen. He seems to be more than eight feet tall, with tangled black hair and a bushy beard, and small black eyes that resemble little sparkling beetles. \"Welcome, students. Please, all the first-year students follow me \u2018ter the boats,\" he says with a deep yet sweet voice. Rowan hooks his arm in mine, looking super excited and hopping like a bunny. We arrive at a set of wooden boats, beautifully floating over the crystalline surface of a huge lake. The water is so dark it reflects the moon and the stars above us. \"This is the Black Lake. Please, don't fall in it. The Giant Squid won't like it,\" he giggles and his laughter is like a rumble of thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe cross the mirrored surface of the lake and a bunch of gasps is released when a pair of tentacles rise above the water and quickly submerges again. By the time we get to the other side, I can't feel my hand, because Rowan held it all the way through, squishing it like a marshmallow. The boats stop at a little pier with a staircase that leads to the most incredible castle I've ever seen. In the top of the staircase is a forty-something woman with jet black hair in a tight bun on her nape. She's wearing night blue robes and a pointy hat and looks austere and intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, students,\" she says with a serene expression. \"I am Professor McGonagall. The start of the term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points and any rule-breaking will lose you points. At the end of the school year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup. The Sorting Ceremony will begin in a few moments, so please, wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What house do you think you'll be selected to?\" Rowan asks when Professor McGonagall disappears behind a heavy wooden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I confess. \"I think it'd be nice to be in Ravenclaw. You know, like our grandfathers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And like your bro-\" Rowan is interrupted by Professor McGonagall's noble figure, that bears a subtle smile on her thin lips. \"We are ready for you. Follow me, please.\" Rowan hooked his arm in mine again, so hard I can almost feel his excited heartbeat. I clenched my jaw, taking a deep breath in, and follow Professor McGonagall along with the other students. I notice they're all looking at each other with wide scared eyes, with no idea what's waiting for us across the door. I've heard stories about Hogwarts before. My grandparents told me a bunch of them and Mum and Dad also described the castle and its mysteries and magic. Jacob would come home for the holidays and tell me about secret passages and paintings that talked, but all the stories still aren't able to suppress my astonishment when I enter the Great Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are flags with Hogwarts' coat of arms. There's a magical starry sky just above our heads. There are floating candles hovering above hour long tables full of students divided according to their houses. Professor McGonagall leads us as we walk between the tables of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, where lots of eyes look at us with curiosity. There's a long table, perpendicular to the other four, where all the teachers are waiting for us. I can already spot Professor Dumbledore, with his long white hair and even longer white beard, wearing a pointy hat and velvety burgundy robes. The spot on his right side is empty and I assume it is Professor McGonagall's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings a small wooden stool and places it in front of the teacher's table. Rowan looks at me with apprehension. Over the stool, Professor McGonagall puts a very old looking hat. It seems much older and shredded than the one from Grandpa's stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I call your name,\" she says, unfolding a long scroll of parchment. \"you will put the Sorting Hat on your head, sit on the stool and wait to be sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowan's arm hooked in mine gets tighter. If he doesn't let go, I'll begin the school term with an amputated arm. And it's my right arm. How will I manage the wand with my clumsy left hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adaline Allen,\" Professor McGonagall calls and I watch a short girl with ebony skin and curly voluminous hair walk to the stool. She puts on the hat and we all wait in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes less than a minute for the hat to announce, in a very excited voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RAVENCLAW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden standing ovation makes my heart beat like crazy. Ravenclaw's table is pure hysteria when the girl called Adaline Allen rushes to join them. I swallow hard, wondering if they'll welcome me in happy applause too, given the fact that probably everyone knows who my brother is. The thought of hundreds of judgmental eyes makes my guts twist and I feel that I'm going to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of names are called. Addison Butler\u2026 Ben Copper\u2026 Penny Haywood\u2026 Logan Johnson\u2026 Rowan Khanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowan looks at me, completely terrified. He walks to the stool with wide eyes, obviously scared, but when the hat touches his raven hair it is already sure of where to place her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RAVENCLAW!\" the hat yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowan's smile looks like a half moon, bright and big, and flashes me glowing eyes while he rushes to join Adaline Allen and his fellow Ravenclaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more names are sorted and then the hat finally pronounces the two names I've been dreading to hear. \"Alexander Prescott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart seems to stop. I don't have the courage to look around, but I can definitely hear the murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob's brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026 crazy as his brother\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably another troublemaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI choose not to acknowledge the judgmental eyes. I just want to study, become a wise wizard and run away from trouble, but the whispers continue all the way to the stool, where I sit with the raggedy hair on my head. Professor McGonagall looks at me with a frown and I wonder if she's thinking if I'll be a troublemaker like Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Jacob. Why did you have to go looking for the Cursed Vaults?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden deep voice comes from inside my head, making my whole body feel cold and unease. I grapple at the edge of the stool, feeling the hard wood against my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see your conflicts, Alexander Prescott,\" the hat says in a smooth voice. \"Afraid people will judge you for your brother's mistakes\u2026 desperate for true loyal friends\u2026 helplessly looking for knowledge and wisdom. Your inner demons remind me of an outstanding witch I had the pleasure of knowing, yet you are pure complexity,\" it continues. \"You have the bravery of a true Gryffindor and the sensibility of a Hufflepuff and the ambition of true Slytherins. However, I think you're better at RAVENCLAW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh in relief, happy to be in the same house and my brother and Grandpa, but a lonely applause makes me lift my face at Ravenclaw's table. My housemates who were also just sorted start to applaud, but when they see the looks on everyone else's face, they stop. Only Rowan continues standing, clapping like crazy, ignoring the silence coming from my fellow Ravenclaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI confess I'm not surprised at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI joined Rowan, looking at him with a sad smile, but his hand on my shoulder is reassuring along with his smile is enough to make me feel better. I have Rowan and Twilight after all. I don't need people to like me or judgmental colleagues who aren't even bothering to know who I really am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ten students are sorted before the ceremony ends. Ravenclaw alone got fourteen new members: eight girls and six boys. The boys are desperately staring at each other, probably wondering how they'll function with so many girls around them. I was used to being around girls so I felt more comfortable than the others but wondered how I was going to survive being in this new environment as the murmurs from earlier kept replaying in my head...</span></div></div>",

I notice a short man sitting next to her, apparently sitting over a bunch of books. He has a very messy brown hair and a beard, but extremely kind eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Filius Flitwick,\" Rowan tells me. \"He's the head of our house and Charms teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile, but deep inside I wish that he won't judge me by Jacob's wrongs. I'll do my best to succeed at Charms and at all the other subjects. Professor Dumbledore stands up and opens his arms like he's calling us all for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, welcome,\" he says and his voice is much like Grandpa's. \"Another year of witchcraft and wizardry lies ahead. It's my obligation to inform the new students and remember the old ones that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students.\" He glances at the Slytherin table. It's too soon to tell, but I assume that they're not very fond of following the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our world is now at peace now that Lord Voldemort is gone,\" a bunch of students frown at the sound of You-Know-Who's name. \"The cause of his defeat was young Harry Potter, the son of the famous Aurors, James and Lily Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spot a young man at the teacher's table, looking completely distressed after hearing those names. He's tall and pale and has a hooked nose and very black eyes. His smooth jet black hair frames his severe looking face, barely touching his shoulders. Through the veil of anger, he's actually a good-looking gentleman, probably in his early twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the professor I was telling you about,\" Rowan murmurs. \"The Potions one. The Death Eater one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking carefully at him, he actually looks like he could be a Death Eater. He seems to hold a lot of darkness inside, even in such young age. I wonder if I'll be able to succeed in Potions if I manage to trespass that curtain of shadows surrounding him. When his black eyes meet mine, an indistinct frown upon his face, I try my best to sustain his stare, but have the feeling that he's reading my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a few years, young Harry is sure to join us,\" Professor Dumbledore says and my Potions professor rolls his eyes. \"Until then, I hope we enjoy ourselves in these times of peace. Now, let's delight ourselves in this incredible feast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened when I see a bunch of food magically appear right before my eyes. Jacob had always told me about the wonderful feasts, but nothing can truly prepare you for the amazing smells invading your nostrils. I see golden potatoes, buttered vegetables, pork and many other delicious foods that make my mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumpkin juice, Alex?\" Rowan offers me a sweaty jar of cold juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thanks, Rowan,\" I say. \"I'm not very fond of pumpkin juice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay. I believe there are about ten different options of juice for you to choose from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavenclaw table is noisy with conversations, but all first year students seem to be really quiet. Rowan, of course, has the cure for their shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents own a tree farm that provides the wood for wand makers. Mine is mahogany. What's yours made of?\" he asks a girl with long straight red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks at Rowan with wide brown eyes. I think it's not every day you meet a chatty Indian boy who can't seem to shut up. Deep inside, I'm thankful for Rowan and her chattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" the girl says, washing down her food with some juice. \"Mine is made out of mulberry tree. It has a funny smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too,\" I say, understanding why Rowan chose the wand topic to this conversation. \"Mine is Acacia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard Acacia wands are very loyal to their owners,\" a young Asian Boy says. \"I'm James by the way. James Lee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex,\" I say and he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Rowan. What's your name?\" Rowan asks the red-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tulip Karasu,\" the girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karasu,\" Rowan repeats. \"That's a very interesting surname.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Turkish,\" the girl explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile, drinking a sip of my lemonade. In a couple of seconds Rowan got to introduce us to our new colleagues and also break the barrier of weirdness between us. Though the older students aren't addressing me the word, I still feel happy, because Rowan, James, Tulip, Addison, Piper and a lot of other Ravenclaws whose names I'm still to memorize seem to be happy to be talking to me. I feel grateful for the broken barrier and hope they won't continue to judge me because of my brother Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give one last glance at my dark Potions professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How am I supposed to break your barrier?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, my mind began to drift and think back to a time that was still very fresh to me. I've been living with Grandpa and Grandma for the past months while Mum and Dad are wandering around the world, helplessly trying to find Jake and bring him back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember when he ran away. He came by my room in the middle of the night, no wand and no backpack, and just kissed me on my forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Munchkin,\" he whispered and before I could even say a word, he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchkin\u2026 he had all these nicknames for me and I feel my heart heavy just by thinking that I might never hear his voice again. However I was pulled out of that moment of solace by hearing an older boy's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ravenclaws, this way, please,\" our Prefect, a fifth-year named Chester Davies, leads us through corridors and stairwells, but my thoughts about my brother prevent me from memorizing the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally stop in front of what apparently is our common room's door. It's made out of solid wood and has a majestic bronze eagle head right in the middle that severely stares at us. My heart skips a beat when the eagle opens its beak and talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only those of quick wit and mind are permitted to enter Ravenclaw Tower,\" the eagle says, smoothly. \"If you wish to join your peers, you must prove yourself by answering the following riddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown. My mind is suddenly flooded with memories of the past months, with Grandpa holding plates full of pancakes and asking me funny riddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you get it wrong, no pancakes for you,\" he'd say and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember ever getting one wrong, because every time he would flash me a big proud smile and hand me the plate. It was our private joke, but I had never understood, until this very moment, why he ever started with the riddled to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was preparing me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a room no one can enter?\" the eagle asks, serenely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowan looks at me with a grown, but I simply chuckle. My mind floats back to Grandpa and I automatically start putting words together and thinking about all possibilities that can lead me to the answer. From what I've learned from Grandpa's riddles, the answer probably contains the word room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mushroom,\" I answer, slightly anxious, but fairly certain of my decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" the eagle says and the door instantly opens, revealing our breathtaking common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, Alexander!\" Rowan says, looking at me with a big smile. Ravenclaw common room is gorgeous, wide and airy, with an outstanding view of the mountains. The domed ceiling is painted with thousands of flickering stars. My eyes fly from side to side, trying to absorb everything, and then rest over an amazing marble statue of a beautiful woman that is probably fair Rowena Ravenclaw. I walk to the statue in clear astonishment and the sculpture is so realistic that it seems to be staring back at me. \"See that tiara on her head?\" Rowan says, standing next to me. \"It's her lost diadem. It's said that it would bring great knowledge to whoever wore it. That's why her daughter Helena stole it. She wanted to be more intelligent than her mother.\" I look at my friend with a smile. He's like a walking encyclopedia. \"Helena's ghost is Ravenclaw's ghost now,\" he continues. \"But most people call her 'the Grey Lady'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexander Prescott,\" the mention of my name makes me turn around. There's an older boy, tall and blonde, with sun-kissed skin, standing right behind me. \"I can't believe you were accepted after your retarded brother was expelled and ruined Ravenclaw's reputation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't choose to be in Ravenclaw,\" I say, trying not to show fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We certainly didn't want you here,\" he hisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out, Levi,\" Chester interrupts, putting a solemn hand over Levi's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got the riddle correctly. He belongs in Ravenclaw.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because he got one riddle correctly doesn't mean he's suited for this house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just because you're able to walk and speak at the same time, doesn't make you suited for this house too,\" Chester says in a firm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi flashes me a disgusted stare and walks away, leaving me with a racing heart and the feeling that people aren't interested at all in getting to know me before judging me by what happened to Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Alexander,\" Rowan says, sadly. \"I wanted to do something about it, but you asked me not to do anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Rowan. I guess if I just ignore it, eventually people will stop bothering me about my brother,\" I say with a sad smile. \"And thank you, Chester.\" \"Don't worry,\" he tells me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay away from trouble.\" I sigh as he walks away, but the fear that trouble might eventually find me doesn't leave my heavy heart. \"Well, well, well,\" Rowan says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this common room.\" I look around. There are a lot of desks, sofas and bookcases around the room. Right in the middle there's a spiral staircase that leads to the dormitories downstairs. I walk there with Rowan and we notice there are only two doors. \"It's a spell,\" Rowan explains. \"You can only enter the bedroom destined to your gender and your school year.\" I take a breath and grip the boy's dormitories doorknob and open it slowly.</span></div></div>",
