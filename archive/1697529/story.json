Not a middle aged one, as he was barely in his mid twenties. He sat on his couch, watching a his DVD copy of \"Afro Samurai\". He was going through issues of malaise. He didn't fit in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes to work. It's seven in the morning when he gets there. Luke Skywalker. Holden Caulfield. Huey Freeman. Peter Petrelli. No, scratch Peter Petrelli. He's a walking idiot ball. These were a few of Mitchell's fictional avatars. People who were utterly bored with their lives. Antoine Doinel. Everything else was a copy of a copy...and so on. Don't want to get sued from copying \"Fight Club\". But would it matter, really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat 2:30 feeling Mitchell felt throughout the entire day. He had a brief discussion with his predominantly white co-workers during lunch why black males usually looked better bald. Mitchell was considered the resident expert, as he was both of african descent, and shaved his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dreadlocks are only good on Jamaican's and girls\" said Diana, a twenty year old temp that Mitchell liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean I don't know. I've never really thought about it. I personally don't like to think about how other males look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No homo, am I right?\" asked a guy that Mitch didn't like that well, with that motherfucking cocky grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all\" sighed Mitch. \"But I don't mean it that way. I just have never thought about it. Samuel L Jackson and Billy Dee Williams I'm assuming are the only people that might be the Gen X exception's to the rule, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mitch got up from the semi circle desk where everyone was chatting, and decided to take an early day. He had enough idle pop culture musings as it was at home, where he could converse in privacy to his internet message board friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dude cut me off\", replied Daniel, the man with the shit eating grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitch isn't that athletic anyway\" said another woman named Alexis. \"You can only pull off the bald and black look if you're properly jacked, or properly bulky like Ving Rhames. Hey remember when he gave his award to Jack Lemmon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" said someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mitchell got home. He collected the mail from his mailbox situated right near the door, when he saw a DVD in a transparent slip cover that had his name on it and was marked as \"important\".</span></div></div>",

Truth be told, Clarence didn't really find his life interesting enough to talk about. The only things he had going for him was that he used to be an orphan who was lovingly adopted at age one and a half by a caring family, and that he was relatively bright. He was able to get into university a year ahead of time at age sixteen to study chemical engineering. He was good looking too, nothing to sneeze at, but sadly not a head turner, especially considering that his school work took up most of his time. Clarence's adopted parents tried the best they could to avoid being too helicopter-y and clingy, but their best efforts turned into bad intentions early in Clarence's life, and he was somewhat socially awkward. Not a dork, but he had been accused of being autistic by his fellow school-mates right  to his face on at least two occasions. He was taking the metro home today. He could have lifted a ride from one of his engineering pals, or better yet, convince his parents to spring for a car or least an advance until he finds a comfortable job, but for some reason Clarence felt that he was comfortable with this type of transport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got home slightly late, around 4:30 PM, and his parents weren't home. His cell phone showed a message from his dad that both him and Clarence's mother would be home around 7:00, family emergency. The memo did not state what member of the family was in danger, or how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarence was bemused though, most of all, to find the mail just laying about near the telephone in the hallway. He picked them up to analyze the letters. Mostly stuff for his parents. Clarence didn't have any credit card soliciters, his mom and dad threw all of those out sight unseen, and he didn't know anyone, even among his family, who would contact him via \"snail mail\". The very last item in the pile was a DVD with Clarence's full name on the cover of the disc jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TO: CLARENCE ELROY BACCAY-OPEN ASAP\"</span></div></div>",

After sorting through the other mail, you let curiousity get the best of you, and you decide to put it in and watch it, especially when you saw that the disc was marked with your name on it and that it was important to watch. When the film appears, a god like being from \"another reality entirely\" tells you that you have been randomly selected to become the first superhuman being in your dimension. You'll be given all the powers of the comic book character Superman, with none of his weaknesses to boot, and everlasting immortality. You somehow know that he isn't lying. But there is a twist. You will instantly upon getting these powers  become a beautiful young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the Comic Book Rumbles forum on Comic Book Resources for the thread that inspired this story.</td>",
