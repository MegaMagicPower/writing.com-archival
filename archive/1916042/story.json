She wiped the sweat from her brow and reached for one of the water bottles they\u2019d provided for her; she drained the bottle in a few seconds and tossed it into the can behind her without looking over her shoulder. Chloe checked her phone and saw that there was still a little time before she\u2019d grab a late lunch break from the table. \u201cUuuugh, I\u2019m gonna starve before 3 o\u2019clock!\u201d she groaned, rubbing her growling stomach as she placed the phone on the table and looked around. There was a pretty popular panel at this time which had taken most people\u2019s attention\u2026a new trailer for a new Marvel movie. If she wasn\u2019t forced to stay here, Chloe might have gone too. Buuut\u2026if no one was around\u2026 Pushing away from the table, Chloe crossed her right foot over her knee and slowly slid off her sandal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Chloe-Bennet-Feet-2956322.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Chloe-Bennet-F...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, gasping for air as the pressure at you back disappeared and you could lift your head off of the soft, wet surface you\u2019d been ground against for the last two hours. The air around you was still uncomfortably warm, and tasted stale\u2026though almost anything was better than the salty flavor that stayed on your tongue. \u201cT-This is fucking insane\u201d you wheezed, still trying to make sense of what happened when the thunder clapped overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO? HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR QUALITY TIME? WAS IT WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING? I KNOW IT\u2019S NOT THE SAME AS WAITING IN MY TRAILER\u2026BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU\u2019LL HAVE A VEEERY UNIQUE STORY WHEN THIS IS DONE,\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice boomed. \u201cYOU\u2019RE ENJOYING YOURSELF, RIGHT? I MEAN\u2026I JUST DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH I WOULD DO IF I FOUND OUT YOU WEREN\u2019T HAVING FUN!\u201d Your cheeks burned bright red as you looked up and saw Chloe chuckling at you\u2026stuck to the sole of her foot like a piece of pre-chewed gum (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Chloe_Bennet_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/800px-Chloe_Bennet_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a>). \u201cAWWWWW\u2026WHAT\u2019S WRONG? LIL BUGGY GONNA CRY?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks burned bright red as you tried your best to keep from giving into her taunting\u2026not that she needed it, but any excuse to hurt you more was more than welcome to your giant captor. A hundred thoughts were flying through your head as your mouth struggled to find the words to reply with. From the bottom of your heart, all you wanted to do was to curse out the smug-looking giantess who had you at her mercy\u2026but you held your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHMMMM?\u201d Chloe cooed, leaning a little closer as she teased, \u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG? YOU LOOK LIKE YOU\u2019VE GOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA SAY, BUG. GO AHEAD\u2026I DARE YOU.\u201d The giantess smirked and licked her lips, giggling as she reached down and pressed the pad of her finger to your back! \u201cI\u2019M TRYING MY BEST HERE TO GIVE YOU WANT YOU WANTED\u2026SOMETHIN\u2019 NOT TO YOUR LIKING LITTLE GUY?\u201d She obviously wasn\u2019t going to let you speak. The moment your mouth opened, her finger\u2019s pad rolled up and began to grind your face into the bottom of her sole as her toes wiggled and the sandal fell off. \u201cIF YOU DON\u2019T SAY ANYTHING, I\u2019M JUST GOING TO ASSUME THAT YOU\u2019RE HAPPY THERE\u2026\u201d Giggling, Chloe shifted and flexed her toes as she dragged you along the bottom of your sole, taking extra care to grind your face into the bottom of the ball of her foot in the process (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Chloe-Bennet-Feet-1683126.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Chloe-Bennet-F...</a>). She leaned down and whispered teasingly, \u201cWHY NOT GIVE ME A LIL KISS? I MIGHT GIVE YOU A BREAK IF YOU ASK LIKE A GOOD LITTLE BUGGY-BITCH~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering, you could feel your skin burning as you were dragged across the rough surface of the ball of her foot\u2026every bit of dirt and dry skin that might be stuck to the bottom of her foot dug into your skin, scraping and scratching at you in the process\u2026 You were basically a pumice stone to your giggling goddess. And now, she wanted you to debase yourself by kissing the very skin that was ripping into you\u2026. Still, you slowly opened your mouth and pressed it to the bottom of Chloe\u2019s foot\u2026the giantess gasped\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing the coast was clear, Chloe peeled you off the bottom of her foot and dropped you into the palm of her free hand before looking down at you, amused. \u201cOK\u2026SO I GUESS YOU ARE MY LITTLE BITCH NOW, RIGHT?\u201d she asked, addressing you with waning interest (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.listal.com/viewimage/9501845h\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.listal.com/viewimage/9501845h...</a>). \u201cSHIT, I THOUGHT YOU\u2019D PUT UP A LITTLE MORE OF A FIGHT~ BOOOOOOORING~\u201d She began to lift you to the tabletop and tilted her hand so you rolled off onto the hard surface while she continued to chide, \u201cOK BUG\u2026SINCE YOU GAVE UP ON THAT GAME TOO EARLY, HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME WHY I SHOULDN\u2019T CRUSH YOU RIGHT NOW?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to your feet, you looked up at her, slack-jawed.

I-I did what you said, you can\u2019t just crush me, dammit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk curled across Chloe\u2019s lips as she slowly raised one hand, \u201cOH?

Slowly, you looked up to see her smiling down at you excitedly. \u201cYOU\u2019RE BETWEEN MY MIDDLE AND INDEX FINGER BY THE WAY, LIL BUGGY~ IN CASE YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW\u2026\u201d The giantess slowly began to lift her hand and a chill ran down your spine as the sound of her skin peeling off the polished surface of the table rang in your ears. She slowly spread her fingers overhead and balled them into a fist\u2026then repeated. Her hand alone seemed to be the size of a small hill when she held it in a fist; when she spread her fingers, it took up about as much room as a baseball diamond, if not more\u2026. \u201cI THINK THE WORDS YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR ARE, \u2018I\u2019M SORRY FOR BEING A BAD LITTLE BUGGY\u2019\u201d she cooed, delighting as she saw the small puddle forming at your feet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://gifimage.net/chloe-bennet-gif-image-download-2/\" target=\"_blank\">http://gifimage.net/chloe-bennet-gif-ima...</a>). \u201cOH\u2026MY\u2026GOD!

AWWWWWW~ IS MY WIDDLE BUGGY A SCAWDY-CAT~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks were a pure crimson as the giantess continued giggling at you from high above. Scuttling backwards, you attempted to make some distance when Chloe clicked her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO, NO, NO~\u201d Chloe said as she quickly reached out and pinched you by your right leg. \u201cYOU DON\u2019T GET TO LEAVE A MESS ON MY TABLE,\u201d she said, dragging you back toward the warm puddle. With a flick of her wrist, Chloe flopped you onto your front before pinning you to the table-top with the pad of her finger which held down your entire body\u2026. Slowly, you began getting dragged back toward your puddle of shame. High above, Chloe heard a tiny, terrified squeak as she pushed her bug back into the small drop of piss and began using your body as a rag\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I COULD SQUISH YOU RIGHT NOW, LITTLE BUG~\u201d she purred. She let her finger up and gave you a small flick so you rolled away a bit before giggling. \u201cWELL\u2026\u201d Chloe cooed, \u201cIF YOU END UP SUCKING AS A PET, YOU MAKE A GOOD RAG~\u201d Straightening up in her seat, the actress checked around again to make sure no one was watching before she leaned forward and giggled. \u201cSO\u2026BEG ME NOT TO CRUSH YOUR ASS\u2026 I DON\u2019T NORMALLY NEED TO CLEAN UP BUG PISS, SO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN A RAG~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2019re sick!\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs, shaking from a mix of rage and humiliation. \u201cFuck you and fuck this sick game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH?\u201d Chloe asked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cYOU MEAN, YOU WANT TO QUIT?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!

It was your chance to run, but thanks to all the \u201cplaying\u201d Chloe had done with you, all you could manage was a pitiful, slow, and\u2026frankly, bug-like, crawl across the floor. Any chance you had at escape was slipping away with each passing second as the giantess\u2019s bare toes blindly dragged across the ground in search for the sandal. Crawling toward the far, front leg of Chloe\u2019s chair, you just prayed that you could make it there before the giant woman turned her attention back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething shook behind you and your heart began to sink as you realized that Chloe\u2019s toes must have found their way back to her Birkenstocks (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Chloe-Bennet-Feet-2956322.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Chloe-Bennet-F...</a>). A rush of adrenaline filled you veins as a giggle from overhead and the fading light from Chloe\u2019s lifting foot told you that the giantess\u2019 attention was once again on you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you couldn\u2019t see her from your position under her foot, you could practically feel the grin on Chloe\u2019s face as she cooed overhead, \u201cSorry little bug~ You were\u2026almost fun to play with~ Don\u2019t worry though, not everyone can keep it up while playing with me\u201d (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.redd.it/7et0h28wjaa21.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.redd.it/7et0h28wjaa21.jpg</a>). The light began to fade as Chloe peeked down and made sure her foot was aimed properly this time to reduce you to paste like she wanted\u2026.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the black ceiling of rubber hanging overhead, the desperate hope you\u2019d been holding out for was dashed. Humiliating as it would have been, some small part of you had been hoping that your tiny size might offer some chance at survival if you could get wedged into the treads of Chloe\u2019s sandal. You\u2019d swallowed your pride and pinned more hope on that plan than you cared to admit\u2026but looking at the sole of her sandal, the crushing weight of reality crushed that escape plan the same way Chloe was planning to crush you. If this had happened to you even a few months before, there might have been some hope of surviving what the giantess had planned for you. Unfortunately for you, it looked like Chloe REALLY liked this pair of Birkenstocks; the sole had been worn down with use to the point that there was barely a remainder of the treads left on her sandal. Slowly, the sandal began to descend as every cell in your body screamed at you to do anything to survive with no options in sight\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Chloe! Chloe, please don\u2019t do this! I-I\u2019ll be a pet! I\u2019ll do anything you want, just please don\u2019t kill me!\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs as Chloe\u2019s sole took up more and more of your sky! For a moment, you thought the cries hadn\u2019t reached her ears\u2026but the rubber cloud stopped just a few inches short of slamming into your back. To your delight, the sandal slowly moved to the side as Chloe looked down with amusement\u2026at least your offer had been heard (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/PJmvgS6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/PJmvgS6.jpg</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY PET?\u201d her voice rang out, punctuated by a poorly-suppressed giggle. You nodded vigorously, praying she took the bait as she seemed to mull the idea over for a moment or two. Nibbling on her bottom lip, the smile on Chloe\u2019s face just grew bigger\u2026maybe she was seriously going to conside- \u201cNAH~ YOU\u2019RE JUST A SILLY LITTLE BUG BITCH; BYE-BYE~\u201d she said, winking and sticking out her tongue as the rubber ceiling came down on your back\u2026hard\u2026( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CpHdfHbWYAA_cnx.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CpHdfHbWYAA_...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOOM!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing down on the little thing she\u2019d been tormenting all day, Chloe pressed just hard enough to keep the tiny thing pinned, but not hard enough to crush it\u2026not yet anyway. For a moment, she mulled over your offer while you screamed, cried, and soiled yourself under her Birkenstocks; a tiny pet might not have been the worst idea\u2026and she definitely would have had you whipped well enough. Just as she was about to lift her foot off of the little thing though, she felt something through the thin layer of rubber that remained of her sandal\u2026a tiny crunch. Her cheeks flushed red as Chloe realized she might have applied a little too much force onto your tiny body. Sighing, she shrugged, \u201cOh well\u2026can\u2019t keep it now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d have screamed out in pain when Chloe\u2019s foot pressed down and crushed your legs, but the pressure on your back had forced all the air from your lungs! Half-suffocated, half-crushed, you prayed that Chloe would lift her foot off at any moment and declare it was all just a joke! You wouldn\u2019t press charges or anything\u2026fuck, you might lick her toes for the rest of your life as long as she just spar-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her foot a sharp twist to the right while pressing down, Chloe felt a small tickle run up her leg as the bug she\u2019d been playing with popped like a tiny grape! Smirking, Chloe began to grind her foot back and forth like she was putting out a cigarette (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/85/49/17854920b59b523d8338eaebd5bdc6a3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/85/49/...</a>).... Pressing the ball of her foot down with all her might, Chloe gave one last little twist before dragging her foot back to examine her work. As small as your body was, the giant actress couldn\u2019t help but giggle when she saw a tiny red splotch on the floor\u2026but that wasn\u2019t enough for the full body, was it? Pulling the sandal off, Chloe examined the sole and found the rest of her bug; she really had thought there weren\u2019t any treads left on this thing, but a nice collection of red mush appeared to be stuck to the sole of her sandal. Scraping it off with a fingernail, Chloe rolled her eyes and flicked you away wordlessly\u2026. Later that night, the janitors would mop up your gooey remains, mixed with dirt, dust, and whatever other crap had been stuck to the sole of Chloe\u2019s Birkenstocks\u2026.</span></div></div>",

The good mood she had fostered dulled slightly when she noticed something was off, that you'd moved since she first put you in her shoe, he was between the arch and her heel but now he was much closer to the back of her shoe.

You also knew her threat (even if it was a bluff) was a good deterrent: you don't want to be anywhere near her toes, especially not in the cramped conditions of the tip of her shoe, you also don't want to get any smaller as you already feel practically worthless with the exception of the amusement and possible pleasure Chloe is clearly getting out of tormenting you, so to be inflicted both, probably until you get buried in toe jam, drown in sweat or are crushed between clenching/twitching toes, was something you'd have nightmares about if this hadn't only been a couple hours (has it really been only that long? Shit) since you were shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into Starbucks Chloe got her coffee, took a seat in the corner and found herself smiling as an idea forms in her head. As subtly as she could Chloe reaches under the table as she lifts her heel, grabbing you before you were even aware of her intentions \"Hey bug, I noticed you were getting a little sluggish and tired back at the convention, so I decided to be a benevolent goddess to you and let you share my drink to help perk you up\" Chloe whispers with a small smile {<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRWpKfkgisY9iKwe-FxKg2haEZ75Z8QHDHJjgDfrKE9yHdmQbh5iA\" target=\"_blank\">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/image...</a>}, just before dropping you into her drink, luckily she asked for a cold coffee, needing the buzz more than the warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) She lets you squirm in her drink for her amusement, wondering when she should fish you out if at all<br>\r\n2) A fan recognises her and wants to chat and get her autograph, when the girl leaves Chloe takes a drink of her coffee, forgetting you were even there until after she swallowed.</span></div></div>",

Just as Florence was about to say something else, one of the crew waved her over from the front door, causing the blue-skinned woman to sigh. \u201cLooks like they need \u2018Sinara\u2019 for something\u2026I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she said as she got up from her seat and started making her way to the front door where the next round of fans would be gathering any minute. Chloe waved as she walked away\u2026and then quickly peeked under the table again\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little dark under the table, but Chloe could see well enough to find the speck if it moved on her again\u2026first things first though. Lifting the heel of her right boot, Chloe checked the tile for a sign of splatter but saw nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she whispered under her breath, \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna run away you lil shit\u2026 You know I can\u2019t have you getting found by anyone after this\u2026\u201d With the little time she had left till Florence came back, Chloe\u2019s eyes checked the tiles around her boot for some sign of her target when she thought something moved across one tile just a few inches in front of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were drenched in a cold sweat as you continued running for your life, still trying to wake yourself up from what wished desperately was a nightmare! If you\u2019d known things were going to turn out like this, you never would have waited outside Chloe\u2019s dressing room to get her autograph before the signing. Your mind was racing about all the things you might be able to do to get out of this situation when the already dark sky began to darken once again. Looking up, you nearly shit yourself as you saw just a colossal black mass heading right for you! For a split-second your body locked up before some primal part of your brain dug your heels into the ground and threw yourself backwards with all your might as the roaring wind that whipped around the falling sky roared in your ears\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUH, UH, UH,\u201d a familiar voice boomed, echoing around you like it had come over the main speakers in a baseball stadium. \u201cI TOLD YOU IT WAS STUPID TO RUN, YOU\u2019RE JUST MAKING THIS HARDER THAN IT HAS TO BE,\u201d Chloe cooed from above. As you crawled backwards on your ass, away from the wall of black rubber that had dropped in front of you, Chloe\u2019s slight giggle shook you down to your bones. \u201cI MEAN,\u201d she teased, \u201cI\u2019M OK WITH CONTINUING TAG LIKE THIS, BUT I THINK YOU MIGHT BE JUST A LIIIIITTLE SMALL TO BE PLAYING WITH ME~ IT\u2019LL SUCK IF YOU HAD AN\u2026ACCIDENT,\u201d Chloe said as the black wall in front of you groaned and slowly began to lift off the ground again. You still couldn\u2019t wrap your head around the fact that the heel of Chloe\u2019s boot alone had nearly killed you several timed today\u2026and it looked like the actress was going to give it another go as the treads began to move back in your direction once more (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/97fff244af4c454679b255db48ca304e/tumblr_o8vet2oHA31uughpxo1_500.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/97fff244af4c...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the heel of Chloe\u2019s right boot moved in your direction\u2026suffice to say, you weren\u2019t exactly cool under pressure\u2026 \u201cH-Hey! Hey! T-This isn\u2019t funny anymore!\u201d you shouted, crawling backwards on your ass while unable to tear your eyes away from the imposing mass of black rubber that continued its slow advance toward you. Your ears rang and bones shook with the slow, ceaseless grating of rubber against the hard tile floor! Looking back at Chloe, you shouted again, \u201cCome on! T-This isn\u2019t what you wanna do! R-Really! Please?! Just let me go! I-I won\u2019t tell anyone anything!\u201d Chloe just smiled and continued dragging her foot backwards\u2026though the pace started to increase\u2026. The distance separating you from the ball of her foot was closing quickly as the treads now were swallowing up inches of tile that you\u2019d been on just 30 seconds ago! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

SOME VIP ACCESS? WELL YOU\u2019RE GETTING IT! I CAN PROMISE YOU\u2019RE GONNA BE THE VERY FIRST PERSON TO FIND OUT WHAT IT\u2019S LIKE GETTING CRUSHED UNDER THIS BOOT\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou felt sick as the heel began to descend slowly\u2026she was savoring this! \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I wanted at all! P-Please, you\u2019re right! You were right, I shouldn\u2019t have tried to get into your dressing room! I\u2019m sorry, ok?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAWWWWWW~ YOU\u2019RE SORRY, HUH?\u201d Chloe said, her heel halting for a moment as you thought you might have found the magic words. \u201cYOU REALLY MEAN THAT YOU\u2019RE SORRY?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes! I swear!\u201d you shouted up, grasping hold of the first bit of hope you\u2019d found since this insane ordeal started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChloe smirked, \u201cOK\u2026IF YOU MEAN IT, THEN I WANT YOU TO KISS MY BOOT.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-What?\u201d you asked, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYOU HEARD ME\u2026\u201d Chloe teased, \u201cIF YOU WANT ME TO FORGIVE YOU, THEN KISS THE BOTTOM OF MY BOOT\u2026OR\u2026WERE YOU JUST TRYING TO TRICK ME?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNononononono! I-I\u2019ll do it!\u201d you screamed, pushing yourself to your feet and forcing yourself to walk toward the wall of black rubber that had been chasing you down. The closer you got, the harder you found it to take another step\u2026your head was screaming at you that this was insane! This was like going into the lion\u2019s den and sack-tapping the lion! But, it was hard to say no to Chloe in this situation\u2026. As you finally reached the black wall, you hesitated for a moment before you closed your eyes\u2026stuck your lips out\u2026and pressed them to the rough, dry, dirty wall. You looked back after the first small peck and saw Chloe still smirking at you; you faced the wall and started kissing it a second time\u2026then a third\u2026a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and so on until you were full-on making out with the bottom of Chloe\u2019s boot like it was your long-lost lover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChloe just laughed as she said, \u201cHOW\u2019S THAT TASTE? YOU LOOK LIKE YOU\u2019RE ENJOYING YOURSELF\u2026LITTLE PERV~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning around, your cheeks bright red, you asked nervously, \u201cL-Look\u2026I did what you said\u2026p-please change me bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHAT? WHEN DID I SAY I WAS GOING TO CHANGE YOU BACK?\u201d Chloe said, a wicked smile growing over her lips. \u201cI SAID I\u2019D FORGIVE YOU\u2026I\u2019M STILL GOING TO SQUISH YOUR ASS! BUT THANKS FOR CLEANING MY SHOE A LITTLE\u2026MAKES UP FOR ME HAVING TO WIPE WHAT\u2019S LEFT OF YOU OFF IT IN A COUPLE SECONDS,\u201d Chloe cooed, laughing as she lowered her heel, knocking you to the ground! She was slowly shifting her weight backwards when there was a commotion at the front of the room. Looking up, Chloe saw \u2018Sinara\u2019 coming back in with the cheer of fans closely following; her gaze shifted from the front of the room back to under the table...and back to the little bug that was definitely shitting itself under her heel (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/S8OzULfZ4naI8/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://media.giphy.com/media/S8OzULfZ4n...</a>). Giggling, Chloe stopped just short of crushing you as she shifted her heel to the side and said, \u201cACTUALLY\u2026I THINK YOU SAID YOU LOVES SINARA TOO, RIGHT?

No such luck. After taking maybe four steps, you were knocked to the ground by an unseen blow to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChloe clicked her tongue disapprovingly from above as she taunted, \u201cNOW, DON\u2019T BE RUDE\u2026IF YOU TURN THIS DOWN WHAT\u2019S SHE GONNA THINK? YOU DON\u2019T WANNA HURT HER FEELINGS, RIGHT LITTLE BUG?\u201d For the first time since you\u2019d shrunken down, Chloe wasn\u2019t leaning down to mess with your little body\u2026she had one of her slender fingers extended as she shot out another shockwave and sent your body tumbling and rolling along the filthy tile floor. A devious smile spread across Chloe\u2019s lips as she focused her finger on your small body and sent another small shockwave toward you! As you went rolling along the tile, Chloe taunted from above, \u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG? YOU WERE SOOOO HAPPY EARLIER WHEN YOU FOUND OUT I CAN DO THIS\u2026. YOU KNOW, IF YOU\u2019D JUST KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT LIKE I TOLD YOU TO, THEN I WOULDN\u2019T HAVE HAD TO SHRINK YOU.\u201d Just when you were about to respond, the ground beneath you began to shake\u2026and not because of Chloe\u2019s powers\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUNK! THUNK! THUNK! THUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour heart jumped into your throat as the sound of \u201cSinara\u2019s\u201d heels clicking against the tile floor became all you could hear. If you could get her attention, then maybe you c-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHAVE FUN LIL BUG,\u201d Chloe cooed. With a flick of her finger, the young woman who\u2019d plunged your life into this hell sent a new shockwave your way that sent you flying across the ground toward Sinara\u2019s chair! You smashed against the ground, bouncing across it like a ground-ball as the blue-skinned giantess stood next to the table and stretched for a moment while she spoke to Chloe (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/d/dc/Orientation_Part_Two_BTS5.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171202105646\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marv...</a>). As you struggled to your feet, you thought for a split-second that if you just got a little closer to her, Sinara might see you when she got into her seat! You managed to take about three steps before the blue giantess\u2019 chair was pulled out\u2026and a second later, the bottom of her high-heeled shoe was coming down on your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was pure luck that saved you this time\u2026the tapered toe of her shoe had landed just a few centimeters to your side; if she\u2019d been wearing shoes like Chloe, you\u2019d already be paste. You began cursing at yourself as you crawled away, \u201cThat was a stupid idea! A really fucking stupid idea!\u201d The very tip of Sinara\u2019s shoe lifted slightly for a second and shifted to the side, catching you with a slight hit that sent you to the floor like you\u2019d just been side-swiped by a car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on your back, clutching your side, you looked up at the blue giantess and suddenly went very still. She was looking down\u2026at you\u2026or at least it looked that way. Her gold eyes seemed to be locked on you anyway (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4g1jnSxbDo4/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4g1jnSxbDo4/maxre...</a>). Summoning what strength you had left, you leaned up and raised an arm to wave\u2026 there was a small bit of motion out of the corner of your eye. Turning your head slightly to the right, you watched Chloe\u2019s finger twitch\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour body was shivering under the force of Chloe\u2019s seismic powers as she pressed your body against the black leather wall that was Sinara\u2019s foot! You tried desperately to push yourself free, but it did no good; Chloe had you pinned tight to the side of the heel and it looked like nothing was going to get you peeled off of Sinara till Chloe decided to let it happen. Opening your mouth to call out to the blue-skinned giantess, you realized too slowly that it just made your tongue available to drag against the leather wall as you found yourself licking your second shoe of the day\u2026 Chloe was having fun though. You could hear her giggle right before the force on your body changed directions and began to drag you roughly toward the heel of Sinara\u2019s foot! Your hands clawed at the black leather for some hand-hold while your tongue continued its involuntary taste-test of the giant heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHEY\u2026UH\u2026SINARA?\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice rang out, getting a giggle from Florence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYES?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChloe paused, \u201cWELL\u2026CAN YOU MOVE YOUR RIGHT HEEL TOWARD ME? I THINK YOU\u2019VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR SHOE\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe giant Sinara laughed, \u201cYOU SERIOUS?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYEAH!\u201d Chloe said, \u201cIT LOOKS LIKE\u2026I DON\u2019T KNOW, SOMETHING PLASTIC? OR A BUG OR SOMETHING? JUST\u2026HERE,\u201d she said as light again shined under the table. Your eyes went wide as the giantess\u2019 hand approached, her massive fingers honing in on you while her other hand kept you pinned right against the arch of Sinara\u2019s foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://source.superherostuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/daisy-fight.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://source.superherostuff.com/wp-con...</a>). The nails of Chloe\u2019s fingers slipped under you as the pads pressed down\u2026and the seismic force vanished. <br>\r\nAs Chloe pulled back, Sinara asked, \u201cSO? FIND ANYTHING?\u201d<br>\r\nChloe just rolled her eyes as she said\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Such as being trapped between those perky butt cheeks of yours perhaps, make a bit of extra padding for these shitty seats' she suggests with a smirk and you start panicking again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True, or maybe in my shoe perhaps?' Sinara suggests, removing the boot and revealing the makeup people went all out as she exposed a pale blue foot dripping with sweat, which caused Chloe to laugh and you to turn ghostly pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which option will Sinara be going with?</span></div></div>",

Each breath you sucked in felt like it was filled with razor-blades. Each step you took threatened to make your legs give out as your muscles screamed in pain. Each agonizing second dragged on as the most primal parts of your brain tried to get your body out of the way o-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t tell which way was up or down as you flipped and flew through the air. Crashing into the ground, your body limply skid and rolled across the ground before coming to rest in an exhausted heap. Panting, you felt tears beginning to well in your eyes from sheer relief. You were convinced that there was no good reason you should alive right now, and yet here you were in one piece. Slowly, you forced yourself to look at the source of the shadow and explosion\u2026 a white wall. The adrenaline running through your body was making it impossible to calm down as your gaze slowly drifted up: the white wall gave way to an expanse of black fabric\u2026the black fabric was decorated with white accents\u2026it then gave way to a brief glimpse of tan that quickly got covered by blue denim. Your head felt like it was on fire as you struggled to accept that you were looking at a sneaker. A colossal sneaker that had almost crushed you like a bug. And whose sneaker was it? Your gaze slowly moved higher until you saw what you\u2019d been afraid of; towering over you like something from mythology, Dafne Keen happily continued reaching into the kitchen cabinet of the tour bus she\u2019d been assigned to for the latest round of promotional interviews (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e2c85dd7b331f64f6f6c0f66aa54e5fe/5E114A77/t51.2885-15/e35/46174615_132377861114154_8193335053400386765_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com...</a>). You didn\u2019t have the luxury of waiting to see what Dafne was searching for. If you continued staying down on the floor like this, then next time her sneaker hovered over you, there was no guarantee you\u2019d be able to escape a bug\u2019s fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink, think, think,\u201d you muttered, trying to think of how to get off the ground; making the plan was easy, actually figuring out how to escape from Dafne\u2019s titanic feet was something else entirely. The white wall of rubber seemed to stretch out in front of you for a hundred feet in each direction as you placed yourself at the instep of her right foot. Just trying to compare yourself to the 4\u201911\u201d titaness who continued rummaging for something in the cabinet overhead, you figured you couldn\u2019t be much more than 1/8 of an inch tall\u2026if you were generous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to rub it in, Dafne grunted overhead and slowly began to lift onto her tip-toes, her size 4 Vans lifting to look more like skyscrapers than sneakers. The idea of her being too short to reach something just felt humiliating as you found yourself staring at patterns on her sole that could have easily fit dozens of you within their boundaries. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d you whimpered, trying not to run despite every cell in your body begging you to get away. You wanted to run, but something had caught your attention when Dafne raised herself up: her shoelaces. If you could hold your ground, you thought there might be a chance you cou-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDafne growled and dropped back down, the slight curve of her right sneaker just barely sparing you from a grisly end as gunk stuck to her sole. Not only did her landing knock you flat on your ass, but it also did what you were hoping for. Looking up, you felt your spirits lift for a moment as Dafne\u2019s lace began falling\u2026toward you? Joy was replaced with terror as you struggled to avoid the shoelace to no avail. The woven walkway slammed down, knocking you flat on the ground under the grimy lace and pinning you like the tiny mite you were compared to Dafne (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/554576141615650065/visual-search/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pinterest.com/pin/5545761416...</a>).

Thinking was impossible with the thick fog that clouded your senses and made your ability to perceive the world around you almost non-existent. What had she hit you with? Had she tazed you!? \u201cF-Fucking cunt!\u201d you hissed, too dizzy to stand up and only able to blindly grope at the ground. Whatever she\u2019d hit you with, it seriously messed with your head; parking lot asphalt wasn\u2019t comfortable by any means, but you knew the lot didn\u2019t have this many jagged bumps and edges along the floor. If it did then no car would ever have made it out of there without losing every tire! Slowly the fog began to lift and the tunnel vision you\u2019d been stuck with began to expand\u2026 and the world around you just grew stranger by the moment\u2026.  \u201cW-What the? What is this shit?\u201d you whispered, mind racing. Apparently, your sense of touch hadn\u2019t been far off; the ground really had become a sea of sharp edges and jagged, black ridges! Christian wasn\u2019t in front of you and neither was her ca-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEHEHE\u2026DAMN, I DIDN\u2019T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO WORK THAT WELL~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRRRRRRN\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead snapping up, you couldn\u2019t make sense of the scene playing out in front of your eyes! The alien landscape gave way to a wall of black material that appeared to be raising up like a castle wall with five tan boulders sitting across the parapets; each one was decorated with wavy lines that ran across their fronts and were topped with a thick white-ish material. No. Not totally white anyway; there appeared to be a hot-pink color that ran along the top of the objects. You could feel your head splitting as every neuron fired off trying to make sense of the scene before you\u2026because there was no way those could be what you thought they were\u2026.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG? YOU SHOCKED? I WAS JUST MAKING SURE YOUR OUTSIDE MATCHED YOUR INSIDE,\u201d the voice rang out again, threatening to burst your eardrums. Caught halfway between having a heart-attack and shitting yourself, you had no choice but to recognize that the god-like thunder was a very familiar voice. It belonged to the woman you\u2019d just gotten into an argument with\u2026but the 5\u20197\u201d woman\u2019s voice definitely hadn\u2019t been that loud before. Craning your neck up, past the strange wall of black, tan, white, and hot pink, you tried to confirm the dreadful thoughts running through your head; your eyes gazed up past seemingly endless pillars of black fabric before finally seeing the soft orbs of flesh\u2026and Christian\u2019s smirking face\u2026seemingly hundreds of feet overhead\u2026. \u201cTHERE SOMETHING ON MY FACE, BUGGY?\u201d Christian said, her jaw continuing to work on a piece of gum she\u2019d popped into her mouth when she first got out of her car\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lizard-brain kicked in, telling you to make a 180-turn and run for your god-damned life! Taking off across the rugged landscape of asphalt at your new size, you just kept praying that you\u2019d wake up from this nightmare. People didn\u2019t shrink like this\u2026she must have drugged you or something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Christian could only roll her eyes as the ant-sized asshole who\u2019d met her in the parking lot now ran from her\u2026if you could call it running. \u201cMhm~ Keep running, little one. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out for you~\u201d she said, standing up to her full height\u2026and lifting her right foot. \u201cLook out below,\u201d she teased before stomping down with all the force she could put into her perfectly pedicured, pink toes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/Christian-Serratos-Feet-441851.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/Christian-Serr...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHOOOOOOLY SHIT, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE~ ALMOST GOT YOU THERE, BUGGY,\u201d  Christian laughed overhead as you were laid out by her stomp. The vast landscape in front of you had been replaced by the foam sole of her flip-flop\u2026a mere millimeter away from you. This time you didn\u2019t escape death without pissing yourself. Too scared to move a muscle, you could only look at the foam wall, and listen to the groan of rubber and plastic against the tiniest wiggles of Christian\u2019s toes as the giantess seemed to delight in your despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShivering, you tried to crane your neck up at the sky-scraper-sized woman who was playing with your life. Swallowing what little scrap of pride you\u2019d held onto, you choked, \u201cP-Please! I\u2019m s-s-sorry! I shouldn\u2019t have said anything to you! I-I promise I learned my lesson! Please turn me back! I-I w-wanna be big again!\u201d You waited for the colossal woman to reply\u2026and waited\u2026and waited\u2026and waited\u2026. Nothing. Christian just continued smirking down at you while the groan of her flip-flop constantly reminded you just how vulnerable you were to her whims. \u201cC-Christian?! This\u2026t-this isn\u2019t funny anymore! You made your point! Please turn me back now! P-Please?! I won\u2019t bother you again! I-I promise!\u201d Still nothing. \u201cW-What do you want me to say?! I-I\u2019m begging you! There! Are you happy now?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChristian finally replied\u2026with a small giggle that all at once turned your stomach and re-sparked the rage that had gotten you into this mess! The foam wall that had almost flattened you began to groan once again as Christian slowly squatted down. Your mind couldn\u2019t even comprehend something that big coming down so gracefully\u2026the closest thing you could compare it to would be a meteor trying to make a soft landing. Under her shifting weight, Christian\u2019s flip-flop slowly began to drag away as she re-adjusted so you were squarely under her hips and isolated in the middle of the jagged field of asphalt. \u201cSORRY, COULDN\u2019T HEAR YOU ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE~ WERE YOU TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING, BUG?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou couldn\u2019t help it\u2026after getting shrunken and nearly crushed, Christian\u2019s comment was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Inhaling deeply, your vision went red as you screamed, \u201cF-Fuck you! This isn\u2019t a fucking game you selfish fucking bitch! Turn me back! Now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat smirk didn\u2019t leave her face\u2026but Christian was clearly done playing with you as she slowly began to stand up. Without raising her voice, the giantess purred, \u201cYOU MIGHT BE RIGHT\u2026THIS WAS FUN FOR A LITTLE BUT I GUESS YOU\u2019RE DONE PLAYING. I\u2019M NOT TURNING YOU BACK, BUT DON\u2019T WORRY. I WON\u2019T BE SELFISH ANYMORE~ IN FACT, HERE\u2019S A GIFT FOR YOU\u2026YOU LITTLE SHIT.\u201d Your eyes went wide as Christian flipped you off before brushing her hair back\u2026and spitting the wad of gum she\u2019d been chewing on directly at your tiny form (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3017a6a398e9009a014e53e3b89265b7/tumblr_p133eaRoas1tc5gvpo6_250.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/3017a6a398e9...</a>)\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each motion of her jaw worked a lump of gum bigger than a house compared to you\u2026and Kish seemed intent on letting you know just how weak and pathetic she\u2019d made you. \u201cIT\u2019S A PRETTY BIG GIFT\u2026PROBABLLY MORE THAN YOU DESERVE, SO BE SURE TO THANK ME, BUG\u201d she said, opening her mouth for a second as she reached in and pinched the wad of pink gum. Instead of yanking it out though, she began to twist it around her pointer-finger and slowly dragged it out, chomping down on one end so that a single strand of pink bridged the tip of her finger to the purse of her full lips (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dandeutschopticaloutlook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bello-Magazine-Editorial-Christian-Serratos-March-2017-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://dandeutschopticaloutlook.com/wp-...</a>). With a quick flick of her wrist, the strand swung from her lips and wrapped around her finger in a tight ball. Pressing her thumb against the base of the bubble-gum, Christian looked down at you and winked.<br>\r\n\u201cCATCH,\u201d she said, flicking the wad of gum at the ground and waiting to see your tiny body swallowed in the elastic ball\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm spray of liquid came off the wad of gum that slammed down just in front of you\u2026no doubt some of Kish\u2019s spit that had soaked the messy, pliable, pink piece of gum into this mushy mound. Looking up, you expected to see the same sarcastic, mocking smirk across Serratos\u2019 face; instead, you just saw the giant woman frowning down at you with a look of absolutely disgust. \u201cI. SAID. CATCH.\u201d She growled, slowly grinding her right foot against the ground like she was putting out a cig or crushing a bug\u2026if she was this pissed at you, then you feared the second option was imminent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your throat go dry and your limbs shake as you struggled to find your voice. With your words struggling out of your mouth, you croaked, \u201cB-But\u2026i-it could h-have k-k-killed me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKish raised an eyebrow and crossed her arms, slowly lifting her right flip-flop-clad foot so its shadow swallowed you and the wad of gum. Pebbles and other bits of dirt rained around you like a horrific hail storm, the stones pelting you and peppering the pink wad of gum until it looked like someone had sprinkled it in spices. \u201cYOU HAVE UNTIL I COUNT TO FIVE TO CRAWL INTO THAT PIECE OF GUM LIKE THE PIECE OF DIRT YOU ARE. IF YOU DON\u2019T\u2026WELL, I\u2019LL MAKE YOU WISH I JUST STOMPED YOUR ASS RIGHT NOW,\u201d the giantess\u2019 voice thundered menacingly. For a moment, you didn\u2019t know if she was serious\u2026then her foot began to lower. \u201cONE\u2026TWO\u2026THREE\u2026BETTER GET GOING BUG\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had nearly shit yourself when the massive foam wall of Kish\u2019s flip-flop slammed down just an inch to your right, kicking up a gust of wind and shooting bits of gravel and dirt at you that cut at your skin like a horrendous sandstorm. Small cuts stung all across any exposed skin you had. Slowly, you looked up and saw the smirking face of the giantess grinning down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHAT? YOU THINK I WON\u2019T DO IT FOR REAL?\u201d Kish asked. Brushing her dark hair behind her ear, the giantess leaned her weight forward onto the ball of her foot and began grinding it back and forth. You could hear the crunch of the asphalt under her foot and saw the skin nearest the ground begin to grow paler as her weight pressed down and forced the blood from her flesh. \u201cYOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I STEPPED JUST A LIIIIIIIITTLE BIT CLOSER TO YOU? THINK YOU\u2019D HAVE SOME FUN DOWN THERE, BUG? WANT ME TO LET YOU EXPERIENCE IT?\u201d she asked, chuckling as she saw you imagining the mangled mess of blood, guts, bone fragments, and sinew you\u2019d have been reduced to with just a small twist of her slim ankle (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/bg/Christian+Serratos+Christian+Serratos+Family+krzrIKG47Mfl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/bg/Chris...</a>). In fact, you imagine you\u2019d have looked a lot like the piece of gum Christian had nearly spat on you\u2026though a bit more red than pink perhaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t need to say another word, feeling gross in gum was better than being turned into a messy slurry under the bottom of her flip-flops. You sprinted for the pink glob of gum and threw yourself forward, plopping into it like a gooey beanbag chair that was as interested in swallowing you up as Kish\u2019s mouth had been in reducing the single stick of gum into this pink prison. Instantly, you could feel the pink material clinging to your skin, pulling and smothering you while the giantess who\u2019d put you into this situation broke out into laughter overhead. You could feel the blood rushing to your cheeks and a deep shame burrowing through your stomach as you realized just how wrapped around Christian\u2019s finger you were. With just a twist of her foot, she\u2019d made you throw yourself into the equivalent of a stick mouse trap. As your struggles quickly informed you that escaping this bite of gum wasn\u2019t going to happen, you dearly wished you\u2019d tried running away instead\u2026at least if she had stomped on you, this would have been over fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOLY SHIT\u2026I DIDN\u2019T THINK YOU WERE THAT DESPERATE, BUG~ BUUUUUT\u2026YOU TOOK SO LONG TO LISTEN TO ME\u2026SO I\u2019M GONNA HAVE TO PUNISH YOU AGAIN. BLAME YOURSELF,\u201d Kish said, squatting lower. As you turned your head to look up at the giantess, you saw her stick out her tongue and flip you off before grabbing her cell-phone with an evil giggle that told you your struggles were just beginning (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3017a6a398e9009a014e53e3b89265b7/tumblr_p133eaRoas1tc5gvpo6_250.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/3017a6a398e9...</a>). \u201cSMILE!\u201d she said, a small flash of light engulfing you yet again as Kish\u2019s laughter just seemed to grow exponentially louder\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cOH. MY. FUCKING. GOD. HEHE, MIGHT HAVE GONE A LITTLE FAR THERE\u2026ALMOST LOST TRACK OF YOU, BUG,\u201d </font></b>Kish cooed, her voice now threatening to burst your eardrums as it roared like a plane was just barely buzzing your head. Still stuck in the wad of gum, you weren\u2019t sure just how small Kish had made you until you tried to crane your neck up, thinking you\u2019d be able to see her face. Instead, all you could see was the massive black foam wall of Kish\u2019s flip-flop that had more than doubled in height since Kish nearly crushed you underneath it. You struggled against the warm wad of gum, pulling away to try and meet the giantess\u2019 gaze, but it quickly became clear to you that Kish had become something beyond comprehension\u2026the tips of her toes just barely came into view with their tan walls, carved with thick ravines that you realized made up the print of the giantess\u2019 toe pads. Her nail came out like a massive canopy, several feet thick from your new point-of-view. <b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cLIKE THE VIEW FROM DOWN THERE? DON\u2019T TELL ME YOU\u2019RE REGRETTING IT NOW~ WE STILL HAVE A FULL DAY OF SHOPPING LEFT,\u201d</font></b> Kish said, slowly reaching down with her pointer-finger that looked larger than a god-damned cruise ship dropping from the sky\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything turned dark and shuddered as Christian\u2019s pointer-finger\u2019s nail crashed down somewhere behind you. Struggling against the gun like a fly in fly-paper, you knew your struggled were pointless but still you couldn\u2019t help it. Every cell in your body was telling you to run, but the thick pink glob had you stuck. A moment later, your ears began to ring and your bones shuddered as Kish dragged her finger back in your direction, trying to scrape the shrunken wad of gum off the ground\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScraping her finger against the ground of the parking lot, Christian felt the gravel getting under her nail and sighed, regretting for a moment just how small she\u2019d made her little bug. Finally, something wet and warm pressed against the pad of her finger and Kish knew she\u2019d caught her prize. Slowly lifting her finger, the giantess looked down at her digit, giggling, \u201cPerfect~ That\u2019s a good look for you\u2026even if I have to squint to see your ass.\u201d There was a single, small pink blob stuck to the pad of her finger with two or three pebbles stuck and embedded in it\u2026though each one looked to be struggling to hang onto since the \u2018wad\u2019 of gum was more of a speck of pre-chewed pink at this point. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got the perfect place for your little ass,\u201d Kish cooed, moving her finger toward her right foot and scraping it off on the black foam instep of her flip-flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRRRRN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the plastic straps of Christian\u2019s flip-flop thong screaming against the flexing toes while the goddess-sized actress seemed pleased with her actions. The simple act of Kish rising up to her full height and causing the foam base to bend, groan, and scream under the shifting weight of the living mountain you\u2019d somehow managed to offend (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/bg/Christian+Serratos+Christian+Serratos+Family+1elqvdf0z3el.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/bg/Chris...</a>). \u201cOh god\u2026p-please be gentle,\u201d you whimpered, knowing the uncaring goddess overhead would neither hear your prayers, nor answer them even if she could. Instead, the air just shuddered with her light giggle, rolling like thunder that made your eyes vibrate in your skull. The heat pouring off of Kish\u2019s arch was already starting to make you sweat as you realized your new size meant Kish\u2019s body had its own independent climate around it. You were hers\u2026and the giantess was going to make sure that your every cell knew it by the time she grew tired of you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From Kish\u2019s perspective though, she wasn\u2019t some colossal diety passing judgment on you\u2026she was just taking a step forward without the slightest bit of care for the tiny insect that got between her foot and the ground (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wikifeet.com/Christian_Serratos#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=410275\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wikifeet.com/Christian_Serra...</a>). You, however, got to see as the entire sky was replaced with the filthy rubber sole of Christian\u2019s sandal blotting out the sky like some kind of biblical nightmare! Turning on the ball of your own foot, you began running for your life, knowing that staying anywhere under the darkness of her foot was a one-way ticket to whatever afterlife you\u2019d lined yourself up for. Arms pumping, lungs burning, skin tingling, and vision darkening, you focused whatever energy you had left and threw yourself at the sharp divide of light and dark that would decide whether you lived or became grime on Christian\u2019s sandal sole\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian slowly ground the toe of her sandal back and forth like she was putting out a cigarette. Glancing down, the giantess expected to lift her foot and find some gummy mess of guts and sinew sticking to the bottom of her foot. Instead, she saw your tiny ass in a panting mess less than an inch from the tip of her sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom high above, Kish\u2019s voice thundered, \u201cGUESS YOU STILL WANT TO PLAY, IS THAT RIGHT BUGGY?

THINK FAST~\u201d Christian smirked as her sandal-clad foot quickly lifted into the air again and aimed to take you out for good with this next stomp! Her foot began to crash down and you could see that she was going for a slight squish; it seemed like she was hoping to crush the right half of your body alone\u2026but that was fine by you. Rolling to your left, you braced yourself as the foam platform of her sandal slammed down and sent you rolling from the massive gust of wind its impact created! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALRIGHT\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see some time ago in your past, you were fired from your paparazzi job and with photography being your only real skill you dived into freelancing. But you found that the money you got from taking photos of celebrities wasn't to good. And since it was such a popular way to make money, the only way to make real money off of it was to get certain photo's at certain angles and/or at close proximity. That led you to meet a man named S, at a bar who over heard your situation one night and offered to help you with a partnership. Being curious you played along and later that night when he brought you to S-lab. He presented you with a huge experimental device that could shrink and grow thing's. So, since he has had none of human test subject's, he explained an idea to you on how to make both of your goal's a reality by shrinking you and taking you to the spot's where certain celebrities were. Which would give you a way to take photo's and then make it back to him for result's on how you feel and stuff. It made for you to say an easy \"Why not, what do you have to lose...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the perfect arrangement that has lasted a month now, you and S had a system down to start with shrink down at the lab, drive to the location, S would give you a certain time length that would last up to 10 hour's that would be how long that he would wait for you and if you didn't make it back, you were considered dead. But this wasn't to big of a deal for you, since all the place's you went to were small place's that made it easy for you to get in and out with a good amount of time still left over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today is your chance to snag some good photo's of Christian Serratos at a con. Which would be your biggest location to date, but you weren't worried about it at all. So, your routine started as normal and when you arrive at the location, S had decided to bring you to her himself or at least as far as he could bring you. And when he arrived he told you 10 hour's and to meet at a specific location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then left to your own devices and easily made it over to Christian in 20 min's. Making it under a black clothed table that she was sitting at. You saw her feet resting in a pair of black sandal's. Also noticing the specks of dust on the sandal's and the strand's of carpet around you. It's still a lot for you to take in even doing this for the past month. But knowing that you need to get the job done fast. You bust out your camera, begin setting up, and taking photo's of her feet that for your \"none brand customer's\". Then moving on you know that you need to get some photo's of Christian's face for your brand customer's. So walking out slightly from under the table you look around and above you. Seeing to your right Christian's gigantic tan bag/purse that was wide open. Above you f course see Christian sitting above you in her chair. And then to your left you see a wire that is connected to something at the top of the table and reaches down to the floor. Seeing that you knew that is going to be your ticket up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you climb your way upward, being thankful of the rope climbing you had to do back in your high school years. Then making it to the top of the table you run behind a blue giant water bottle. And looking around you see crowd's of giant's walking around the con, enjoying there time, and pretty much just minding there own business. Turning your attention back toward's Christian booth, you notice about an average sized line for her booth and then there is Christian who was in the middle of a conversation with a female fan who was dressed in a good Sakura cosplay with the pink hair and the whole 9 yards. You notice that this Sakura girl seem's to have just started talking with Christian and you think that this is the perfect distraction for you to take your photo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting yourself ready, you begin with speed. Taking photo's all around the side of the table that your at of Christian. Knowing that just one side isn't going to be enough. You make your way towards the other side of the table. Hiding behind things like Christian's wallet and stacks of paper. All while taking photo's in till you were in the most vulnerable spot that you could be in. Seeing Christian's full face listening and looking up at the Sakura girl, who when you turn to see her towering over you and not really sure if she is tall or if it's just your perspective. But seeing that doesn't matter you turn back around and also see just how close you really are with Christian's giant arm just laying itself right by you. Any photographer or person would probably kill to be in this position. But you can't focus on stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you pull out an adjustable/break down-able tripod that you had and placed your camera on it to get some of the best angles. While taking a few photo's, Christian and the Sakura girl have stop there full length discussion. And Christian is starting to fill out a special autograph for the Sakura girl, while she is just standing, towering behind you. Thinking that this could make for a great picture of Christian filling out an autograph. You ready your camera to take a set of photo's in a certain amount of time. And you are at this moment faced with your first problem in a while as...</font></span></div></div>",

No Vamp, no familiar Stormtrooper, nothing. At least, not till the air was thick with the smells of food, plastic, glue, sweat\u2026the unique mix that you got when you crammed several hundred people into the same space. The con was in full swing when your eyes finally fell on a familiar stormtrooper outfit. TK-6683 was looking in your direction and seemed to be talking to someone behind her: she was in her classic stormtrooper armor and you could feel your heart begin to race as she pointed in your direction (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/LeeAnna_Vamp_3-530x530.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploa...</a>). She was walking your way! Straightening up, you started looking for another set of white armor, hoping Vamp was with her as a pair like in all of their pictures!  <br>\r\n\t\u201cHoly shit, this looks so cute!\u201d a familiar voice called over the din of the crowd. TK was right in front of you and you knew that the voice speaking to you belonged to Vamp! Your eyes darted to the side, looking for the second stormtrooper when you finally saw her\u2026only\u2026<br>\r\n\tYou couldn\u2019t help but show a little disappointment as you said, \u201cOh\u2026no Star Wars outfit this con?\u201d TK shot daggers at you with her glare as Vamp smiled awkwardly and bounced on her bare feet; this con, she\u2019d gone with her Apu costume it seemed (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/b7/ba/d2b7baf76eb55fbf1b47fa263567718e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/b7/ba/...</a>).<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was feeling a change of pace,\u201d she said, trying her best to be polite to you as you quickly grew bright red and began stumbling for words. Before you could fix things though, she looked away and chirped, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go check out that booth for a bit! Nice to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n\tYou tried to call out, but Vamp was gone in a flash\u2026leaving only TK in front of you. The stormtrooper frowned and hissed, \u201cIt broke when we traveled here! Her costume. I told her that Apu would be fine and she was self-conscious about it all day\u2026so thanks for that.\u201d She paused and seemed to size you up for a moment, her icy glare offering you no kindness as you attempted to save some face. Before you could get a full sentence out though, TK checked over her shoulder to see if Vamp was nearby and smirked when she saw her friend was preoccupied\u2026as her gaze shifted back to you, your blood ran cold. \u201cNo one fucks with my friend\u2019s day,\u201d TK said as she lifted the blaster and leveled it at your face (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BvVWGHxCQAAgF6A.jpg:large\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BvVWGHxCQAAg...</a>). There was a small flash of light that dazzled your eyes; your stomach began to twist painfully as you winced and curled into a near fetal position. Although you didn\u2019t know it yet, your day just became a lot more complicated\u2026.<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n\tYour eyes shot up as the explosion and tremor almost threw you off of the chair. You saw\u2026strangely\u2026only a wall of shimmering white in front of you. Slowly, your gaze began to rise and your stomach began to fall. Towering over you, TK smirked down as her voice thundered, \u201cHUH\u2026WEIRD, WHERE DID THAT GIRL RUN OFF TO?\u201d (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtubKhWCMAEPYYP.jpg:large\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtubKhWCMAEP...</a>) The wall of white that had suddenly appeared before you as the situation came sharply into focus for you. That wall? TK\u2019s foot. You? Less than an inch tall. A dark shadow enveloped you and sprinkled dust down on you and your table as the stormtrooper\u2019s boot began to rise over you. You almost fell out of your chair as you began trying to scramble out from the false sky hanging overhead\u2026if you didn\u2019t get out of the way then y-<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n\tTK smirked as she began to slowly grind her foot into the floor, feeling the crunch of your booth beneath her boot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-UVzquCIAEvoyD.jpg:large\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-UVzquCIAEv...</a>). Served that bitch right, TK thought, giving her white boot a sharp twist so she could enjoy a few more crisp crunches. She never looked down at the carnage when she finished with these jobs\u2026afterall, who took the time to examine every bug they smashed? No. Instead, at the end of the day, TK would enjoy seeing the mashed remains of your body dirtying her tread along with the rest of the crap she\u2019d pick up walking through the con\u2026or that was what she thought. Although the young woman was right that your booth had been reduced to splinters under the toe of her boot\u2026you had avoided becoming paste by a fraction of a hair. You didn\u2019t have long to think; staying here was just asking to get crushed! If TK was the one who shrank you, then TK was maybe the only person who\u2019d know how to turn you back to normal. Jumping for the rubber edge of her stormtrooper boot, you just barely managed to latch onto TK before the giantess spun around on the toe of her white, high-heeled boot, and began walking to her own table to join back up with Vamp. <br>\r\n\tBABOOOM~\u2026.BABOOOOOOOM~\u2026\u2026BABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM~\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n\tFortunately for you, the walking monolith you\u2019d pissed off had really believed that you were nothing more than a greasy red smear under the toe of her boot. Instead, you were clinging to the rubber rim of her flawless white stormtrooper boot\u2019s sole\u2026like the bug she\u2019d reduced you to.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cLEEANNA!\u201d TK shouted, waving her friend down who\u2019d just finished taking a selfie with another fan. <br>\r\n\tThe Apu cosplayer said a quick thanks to the young woman who bounced away happily before turning to her friend with a smirk. \u201cYou weren\u2019t too hard on them, were you? Seriously, I\u2019m ok,\u201d LeeAnna said. The pair of them had been very close\u2026LeeAnna knew that TK always did something to people that pissed her off. She didn\u2019t know what, but whatever it was, there had never been a repeat offender. <br>\r\n\tTK roll her eyes, \u201cThey got what they deserved, don\u2019t worry about it~\u201d<br>\r\n\tAs the pair joked overhead, you were more focused on the situation below their notice. It was nothing short of a miracle that you\u2019d managed to keep your grip on TK\u2019s boot as she strolled across the con. The woman had almost bumped into people so many times that you\u2019d watched flashbacks of your life at least seven times by now. The booming voices overhead helped you realize one thing though\u2026Vamp didn\u2019t know what TK was doing and seemed more than forgiving of your little slip-up earlier. If that really was true, then getting her attention might be your only chance to get big again! You swallowed nervously and stole a glance at your destination, Vamp\u2019s flexing, bare, and VERY large toes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pics.wikifeet.com/LeeAnna-Vamp-Feet-962477.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pics.wikifeet.com/LeeAnna-Vamp-F...</a>). Taking a deep breath, you relaxed your death-grip on the edge of TK\u2019s boot and plummeted to the tile floor below\u2026.<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n\tIt was a less forgiving fall than you\u2019d expected; had you landed a little more awkwardly, you wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if you broke an ankle. Instead, you just sprained it going by the small jolt of pain running up your leg. You could still put weight on it, but you\u2019d be slower\u2026not the best thing to be in a world where you could be crushed underfoot. Shaking the negative images from your mind, you began running toward the tan wall of flesh in front of you. It felt like things were starting to look up for you! High above though, TK had just started to look down\u2026<br>\r\n\t\u201cStacey? Everything ok?\u201d LeeAnna asked, seeing her friend glare at something on the ground. \u201cStacey?\u201d <br>\r\n\tWithout uttering a word, TK grunted and slowly lifted her right foot, aiming it at the tiny speck trying to scuttle across the tile floor (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fc/e0/4f/fce04fe436d4bc9a6e8a62fb557e8f33--female-cosplay-storm-troopers.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fc/e0/4f/fce04...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOM!<br>\r\n\tYou fell flat on your ass as the white monolithic boot you\u2019d just jumped from suddenly shifted and slammed down in front of you! With your face just mere inches away from the rubber wall, you realized that if you\u2019d been a bit faster, then you\u2019d have been crushed under the heel of TK\u2019s massive boot. The impact made your whole-body shudder down to the bone and knocked you flat on your ass! You struggled to move as the tremors continued all around you. Flipping onto your stomach, you tried your best to crawl away just as the monolithic wall of white rubber began to grind back and froth as TK once again thought she\u2019d caught you underfoot.  <br>\r\n\tSuddenly aware of Vamp\u2019s gaze on her, TK smiled awkwardly and tried to cover her ass as she said, \u201cIt was a bug\u2026big-ass bug going right for you. Didn\u2019t want it nipping you or something, sorry! You know those things gross me out\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\t\u201cSince when?\u201d Vamp giggled\u2026it wasn\u2019t like TK had ever been especially squeamish.<br>\r\n\t\u201cSince the little shits were in my costume one time,\u201d she replied, slowly lifting her heel to see the bloody mess she hoped decorated her boot. Nothing again! Her eyes narrowed and scanned the ground until they finally fell on the small, ant-sized creature just a few inches from where she stomped down. Biting her bottom lip, TK tried to cover for herself as she sighed, \u201cGross\u2026that\u2019s gonna stain the treads.\u201d Slowly, the began moving her right hand toward her boot\u2026and toward your tiny body that once again fell down in the presence of her massive, grasping fingers\u2026.<br>\r\n\t\u201cN-No! Nononono!\u201d you screamed as you began running with all your might back in the direction of TK\u2019s boot. Each step you took sent another wave of pain up your leg, but you couldn\u2019t afford to stop. The ground shook as TK\u2019s armored finger smashed into the ground and began to drag along the tiles. There was an ear-shattering CRACK as the plastic-covered fingers hit the edges of each tile and clipped the stone\u2026the grating sound of their approach growing stronger with each passing second. Your ears were pounding with your heartbeat! Each footfall felt like your shoes were filled with lead. Your body was drenched in a cold sweat. Your brain had thrown all complex thoughts out of the window and only screamed at you to keep running\u2026.<br>\r\n\tBAM!<br>\r\n\tTK grinned as she quickly swiped her fingers along the ground and felt the dull smack of something tiny against her middle finger. The tiny form of your body rolled in front of her, landing just out of the reach of her boot\u2019s massive, white heel.</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t worry\u2026it won\u2019t hurt for long,\u201d she whispered, knowing that her tiny target would be able to hear her. Squatting, she looked down between her feet and couldn\u2019t help but crack a smile as she finally saw you. \u201cHeh, I didn\u2019t know the gun would work that well, you\u2019re fucking pathetic down there~\u201d she teased, slowly standing back to her full height as she sneered down at the insect between her boots. She thought of just stepping on you and ending your life beneath her boot, but that would be too easy. After all the trouble you\u2019d given her by not just getting crushed right at the start, TK wanted to make this special. Tapping her foot, the giantess smirked as your tiny form fell down and wriggled like the bug you were\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You struggled to get up, exhausted after getting flicked by her fingers, nearly smashed underfoot, and the sheer stress of finding yourself Lego-sized on the floor in one of the most highly trafficked areas of this convention. For a moment, you thought that begging in front of her might make TK relent. Maybe if you let her just humiliate you, she\u2019d let you live. This was all just part of her act anyway\u2026right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cHMMMMMMM~ NO, I THINK YOU\u2019RE STILL TOO BIG,\u201d TK\u2019s voice thundered overhead, threatening to burst your eardrums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You could feel your heart leap into your throat as the giantess\u2019 words registered in your ears. There was no way you heard her right\u2026right? Looking up, you waited for the punch-line to TK\u2019s cruel joke, but all that you could see was the unamused face of the brunette beauty as she slowly began to point her gun at you once more (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instazu.com/media/1871124755432648915\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instazu.com/media/1871124755...</a>). Terrified, you flipped onto your stomach and tried to take off running to avoid getting caught in that horrific light once again. You maybe took one step though before the dirty ground around you was subjected to the searchlight-like blast from the tip of TK\u2019s gun. \u201cNononononononono!\u201d you screamed, feeling sick at TK\u2019s already massive frame started doubling in size as you were reduced from a Lego-man to an ant\u2026.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n      \u201cSTACEY!\u201d a familiar voice boomed, sounding even louder as the ground started shaking even more violently. Looking in the direction of the quakes, you felt your blood turn to ice as an absolutely colossal LeeAnna walked toward her friend, now dressed in her matching stormtrooper armor (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplaygirls/comments/3tzyno/stormtrooper_cosplay_by_leanna_vamp/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplaygirls/co...</a>). You were struggling to make sense of how something as big as LeeAnna could move at such a blinding speed! Each step she took seemed to cross more than a football field in length before a massive white boot slammed down with the force of a collapsing building. In a matter of seconds, LeeAnna seemed to have crossed several miles of distance as yet another wall of white boot slammed down just in front of your body. \u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK? I MADE SOME CHANGES AND UPPED THE POLISH A LITTLE~ IT WAS LOOKING DULL IN THE LAST SET OF PHOTOS,\u201d she chirped overhead, happily twisting a bit as the white rubber treads of her stormtrooper boot inches closer and closer like a stalking predator\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n      TK took a moment to look LeeAnna over, making sure to step a little closer so her tiny toy was effectively trapped in a small triangle made up of their white boots. \u201cIt definitely looks cleaner\u2026but isn\u2019t it going to get dirty walking through here? Like what about the boots?\u201d TK asked, noticing a small smirk on LeeAnna\u2019s face.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n      \u201cCome ON, Stacey, do you seriously think I overlooked that? Watch\u201d she said, slowly dragging her foot forward so the rubber front scraped along the less-than-clean floor\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n      GRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN\u2026.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n      \u201cY-You\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me!\u201d you screamed at the sky as the LeeAnna glacier continued its unrelenting charge at you. The rubber wall overran everything in its way: dust, dirt, pebbles, and grime. The growing roar in your ears was a horrific reminder that the rubber wall was gaining, ready to plow you over like it had trampled everything else! Putting on one more burst of speed, you sprinted with all your might as the shadow of LeeAnna\u2019s tilting boot finally overtook you. Just as you were about to be steamrolled, LeeAnna lifted her foot up, the tip springing forward and slamming into your back. If the wall had been made of anything slightly harder than rubber, then you would have doubtlessly been scattered across the front in a red splotch\u2026instead, LeeAnna unknowingly kicked you at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      TK just barely noticed something bounce off the toe of her boot and couldn\u2019t help but smirk as she realized you were officially too small to feel! She looked up at LeeAnna to see her friend\u2019s proud grin, declaring triumphantly, \u201cSee? No mess, no dirt!\u201d The tip of her startrooper boot really was immaculate, but TK was more interested in finding your tiny ass for the moment. \u201cStacey?\u201d LeeAnna asked, frowning since her friend clearly wasn\u2019t as excited about her new achievement as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \u201cSorry, there\u2019s a weird shadow,\u201d TK said quickly, stepping around so she was right next to LeeAnna. If she didn\u2019t know you were down there, then she would have absolutely lost track of your form\u2026but there you were, less than a half-inch tall and struggling to stand as TK shifted position (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/2904/14578135477_647eff3418_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://live.staticflickr.com/2904/14578...</a>). The cosplayer couldn\u2019t help but giggle as she realized that she had definitely stepped on bigger ants in her kitchen\u2026. Looking at LeeAnna, TK flashed a smile and teased, \u201cOk, ok, ok\u2026you\u2019re going to have to show me how you did that~ There was someone here earlier who stepped on something and it RUINED her boot. I\u2019ve been paranoid about what I\u2019m stepping on for the last couple of minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least you have shoes!\u201d another voice shot back, grabbing LeeAnna\u2019s and TK\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cVampy!\u201d LeeAnna said, holding out her arms as a mass of black, white, and red spandex charged forward and embraced the stormtrooper. The two collided and broke into a fit of laughter as Vamp and Vampy attempted to untangle themselves. Stepping back, LeeAnna couldn\u2019t help but show the look of amazement on her face as she exclaimed, \u201cHoly shit! The Silk outfit looks perfect! I didn\u2019t think it was going to be ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tVampy couldn\u2019t help but giggle, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would either, but it all came together in the end\u201d As Vampy took another step back, TK could barely contain her excitement\u2026. It seemed almost poetic really, the bug was going to be done in by a spider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou thought that you were doomed when you bounced off of TK\u2019s boot. Then, you thought your heart was going to stop when Vampy had charged the pair and jumped at LeeAnna. Both times you\u2019d gotten lucky\u2026but this time it seemed that you weren\u2019t going to make it as the sky overhead became the dusty sole of Vampy\u2019s spandex or latex-clad foot! \u201cHey! Wait, I\u2019m down here! P-Please! Shit, shit, shit!\u201d you screamed, turning to run as the sound of the approaching ped roared in your ear like a plane was crashing out of the sky. You stole one glance back and immediately regretted it; there wasn\u2019t anything in front of your eyes besides the outline of five toes pressed against the skin-tight fabric. \u201cN-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou couldn\u2019t move an inch as the spandex pressed down on your body. Somehow, you had avoided an immediate death for a third time\u2026or at least postponed it. While you were currently between Vampy\u2019s second and big toes, all the giantess would have to do was twist her foot or scrunch her digits to turn you into a grimy splotch on the foot of her outfit. Through the material, you could hear your unwitting goddess brag, \u201cIT EVEN LETS ME MOVE REALLY EASILY! I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE THE PATTERNS LOOK STUPID, BUT SEE? EVEN IF I BEND A LITTLE\u2026\u201d You could hear the sound of millions of synthetic threads screaming as Vampy shifted to strike a pose. For a moment her toes lifted up, but only long enough for you to see the shit-eating grin on TK\u2019s face before Vampy\u2019s digits slammed down, pressing you into the ground with a crushing amount of force (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BqtahZ8Ag8n/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BqtahZ8Ag8n/...</a>)\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The spandex costume slowly pressed down, holding you down as the massive digits settled on either side of your body. High overhead, Vampy didn\u2019t know about the tiny person she had trapped under her toes\u2026LeeAnna was clueless that encouraging her friend to pose was leading to your untimely end\u2026and TK was struggling not to bust a gut as she wondered how long it would take for Vampy\u2019s toes to crush you into a gory paste. Posing like Silk, Vampy\u2019s toes slowly came closer together and pointed while her leg moved out, dragging you along the ground as you were brought along for the ride (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BqtahZ8Ag8n/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BqtahZ8Ag8n/...</a>). Her big toe pressed down to help the woman keep her balance, unaware that her digit was pressing the air from your lungs like the contents of a toothpaste tube. Struggling like mad against the impossible mass of Vampy\u2019s toe, darkness slowly began to creep in\u2026this was it\u2026dead under a woman\u2019s toes without her ever knowing\u2026a bug\u2019s death, just like TK said\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOM\u2026THOOM\u2026THOOM\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor a split-second, Vampy\u2019s toes lifted enough for you to suck in a new breath and catch a glimpse of the world beyond the giant woman\u2019s spandex-clad toes. All you could see though was another giant woman\u2019s white stormtrooper boots drawing closer and covering dozens of yards with each careful, \u201csmall\u201d step. You couldn\u2019t tell which of the two Star Wars women were walking toward you, but you prayed that either one could get Vampy\u2019s toes off of you before a twitch burst you like a balloon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOOOM!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe giantess stopped, leaving a football field\u2019s worth of distance between her boot and Vampy\u2019s toes\u2026so less than a single step of distance. So close, but so far! You attempted to claw your way out, but the pressure on your back was still too intense! Frustrated, you began growing more frustrated by the second, swinging your fists pathetically against the spandex ceiling crushing you with no effect. Or, at least, that was what you thought. Slamming your fist into the fleshy pad of her digit\u2026it suddenly lifted! Your body acted on its own, scuttling forward across the grimy ground in a last-ditch effort to escape from your fate as a smudge under Vampy\u2019s toe. \u201cPERFECT!\u201d LeeAnna\u2019s voice boomed as a new shadow engulfed your body. Looking up, you saw that TK wasn\u2019t the owner of the white boot before you\u2026but that didn\u2019t mean you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou\u2019d managed to avoid pissing yourself, but now that the butt of LeeAnna\u2019s gun had come within a fraction of an inch of crushing you, there was no way to control yourself (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/84/7a/92/847a9268934e4c76aaa9c73af23a04ee.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/84/7a/92/...</a>). Looking up, you saw that TK\u2019s friend wasn\u2019t looking anywhere near you. Somehow, that made it all the more terrifying. Trapped between Vampy\u2019s foot and LeeAnna\u2019s gunstock, you turned and began sprinting back toward the newly-arrived giantess. At least if you made it to Vampy, you could try climbing her outfit\u2026you already knew there was no way for a bug like you to scale the white wall of the stormtrooper boots\u2026. You slowed down before reaching the digits, keenly aware that one wrong move and you'd almost certainly be crushed this time. Vampy or Vamp?

The towering white walls of her stormtrooper boots loomed in the distance like a sanctuary in the middle of the dessert. You knew this was possibly your last chance at getting saved; if the girls decided to walk anywhere else, then the ground around you would go back to no-man\u2019s land in the middle of the convention\u2026dooming you to die under some weeb\u2019s shoe before the day was out. With an existential clock ticking in the back of your mind, a final flood of adrenaline surged through your v-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fuck!\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs as a very different wall of white rubber slammed down in front of you. Your head snapped up to reveal TK was the foot\u2019s owner\u2026if you\u2019d actually been a little faster, then there was no doubt that she would have successfully splattered you across the floor. It looked like she was posing next to LeeAnna for Vampy\u2019s benefit; at the very least, it was a blessing that she hadn\u2019t noticed you down at her feet (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/2904/14578135477_647eff3418_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://live.staticflickr.com/2904/14578...</a>). Unfortunately, the near-miss had knocked you on your ass and had you so shaken that you weren\u2019t able to get back off the floor. Whimpering, you started trying to crawl around the tip of TK\u2019s boot, praying that you could make it to LeeAnna before anything else went wrong. You could feel the odds of your survival dropping with each passing second as the three goddesses stood as unknowing executioners all around you\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging yourself around the tip of TK\u2019s boot, you could feel the exhaustion creeping in after so many close calls. Every move you made hurt, your muscles were screaming, your bones ached, your head felt like it was on fire. The mere shifting of TK\u2019s boot sent small tremors through the ground. You could hear the horrendous grating sound of the giant boots grinding against tile as the two stormtroopers shifted positions for each pose they struck. \u201cJust keep going\u2026a-almost there,\u201d you whispered, trying to push yourself forward. As long as you could escape TK, you figured there would be a chance at escaping a bug\u2019s fate. Looking up, you thanked God that the giantess hadn\u2019t noticed\u2026you? Your heart stopped for a moment as your gaze met the deep brown eyes of your tormenter for a fraction of a second. With a wink, TK\u2019s gaze shifted from your tiny body back to her friends. You thought for a moment that it might have been a mistake, but as TK\u2019s boot slowly lifted and blotted out the sky with the dirty underside of her boot, you knew the giantess planned to finish you off. \u201cN-No! TK! Please! S-Someone! Anyone! Save m-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick rubber tread pressed down your back and legs with a terrifying amount of force as the giantess settled her weight and finally had you right where she wanted you\u2026pinned under her boots like the little bug you were (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBYXVBIIFDj/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BBYXVBIIFDj/...</a>). For a moment, you thought that you might have survived the worst of it. If she was just going to step on you like this, then you\u2019d survive. You\u2019d be bruised, but you\u2019d survive. That hope quickly vanished, however, when you felt a tugging on your back\u2026a horrified scream left your lips as TK slowly began to shift her foot, grinding you between the cold tile and rough rubber. This time she was serious. If you couldn\u2019t get free from the tread, then TK was going to snuff you out like a cigarette butt\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019m starving,\u201d Vamp whined, leaning a little more heavily against TK as the stormtrooper continued to grind the ball of her right foot into the tile. This time the bug would be dead, she thought. \u201cHeeeey!\u201d Vamp said, waving her hand in front of TK\u2019s face, pouting, \u201cHello? Anyone in there? I said I\u2019m starving over here; are we going to take a lunch break?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her foot a final, rough twist, TK smirked, \u201cFine\u2026but don\u2019t overdo it or else you might not fit in the outfit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAss\u201d LeeAnna said with a giggle as she hip-bumped TK and knocked her friend over a few steps.
