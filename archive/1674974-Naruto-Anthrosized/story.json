What the hell had his idiot host gone and gotten himself into now? Pushing it's chakra through the bars, the fox was pleased to see some of substance burn away. The Kyubbi pushed more and had it's chakra analyze the gunk. The results caused the tailed beast's eyes to bolt open in shock. This was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

Whatever it was, he knew already that the fox was trying to do what it could to fix it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling woozy, Naruto fained.

She found it embaressing really, she could face down just about any rouge ninja and loook death in the face without flinching, yet her she was, panicing over a small yellow spider with eight blue eyes, and whisker marks next to it's mandibles. She raised her foot over the eight-legged pest. Time to squash the spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up only to see Kurenai's foot beginning to descend. She was going to kill him. As soon as that registered with the transformed ninja's brain, he turned and bolted as fast as he possably could on his many legs, the inital stomp missed him as a result, but the woman wasn't going to let him off that easy and chased the spider. The ground shook, jarring Naruto, and a foot the size of a bus slammed into the ground about ten feet to the right. Another one slammed into the ground about thirty feet in front of him a split-second later, the heel facing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slid to a halt as the nearer foot was lifted and the farther one spun around as the woman pivoted. Not a second later, Kurenai had lowered to her knees and picked Naruto up by his new body's abdomen, then hastily dropped him into a jar, shuttering at touching the spider as Naruto hit the glass bottom with a painful thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Itsy Bitsy Spider, I know <b>JUST</b> what to do with <b>YOU</b>!\" The red-eyed tease said, carrying the jar through her house. While Kurenai's apartment wasn't necessarily big, it had a homey feel to it. White carpet, white walls, a cream colored couch against the wall with a table in front, TV in the corner. The kitchen was connected to the living room, making it one big room and seemingly bigger than what it really was. The tiles in the kitchen was an olive green and relatively new. Naruto watched as she went through the home and into her bathroom. Naruto's eyes widened in horror as he realized what the Genjutsu Queen was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to flush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! PLEASE NO! NOT THAT! KURENAI-SENSEI PLEASE DON'T! I'M NOT A SPIDER! I'M BEGGING YOU! PLEASE DON'T FLUSH ME DOWN THE TOILET!\"</b> Naruto screamed, but it was useless, Kurenai could neather hear nor understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Enjoy your dip.\" Kurenai said as she held the jar over the liquid-filled porcelain  seat that lead to the sewer system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt his heart stop from sheer panic in the face of doom and his life flashed before his eyes. As it did, he remembered something from his first day at the academy that Iruka had beaten into his head. Morase code! The shinobi-turned-spider quickly scurried to the glass wall and rappidly began a series of taps and pauses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai stopped and looked at the spider as it tapped on the glass of its jar.

Just please don't try killing me again and if you could, would you help me get back to normal?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Y\u016bhi woman grinned \"Sweet little spider, arn't you?

Kurenai thought to herself and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, why couldn't something SHE wanted to happen, actually happen for a change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurenai had an idea, since Naruto was now a spider, what if she had a bit of fun with him, now she knew Naruto was already scared out of his mind with her, but she wouldn't kill him or anything like that, but she would just mess with him a bit to make sure he fully knows of his situation and that she was now the Hokage to him and whatever she says goes and he must do as she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that in mind Kurenai picked up the jar and said, \"I know I promised to help you get back to normal ASAP Naruto, but what's the rush? How about we have ourselves a bit of \"Fun\" huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand not waiting for the spider Uzumaki to reply in morase code, Kurenai suddenly began to shake the jar and watch Naruto bounce around inside it while making sure her hand covered the top of the jar while holding the bottom tightly so not to slip and break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two LONG hours Kurenai has been shaking the jar and watched Naruto banging against the glass and she didn't stop until FINALLY her arms felt tired did she stop and looked at Naruto who coded, [That really hurt, Kurenai-sensei.... Why did you do that!?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai then said, \"Oh suck it up Naruto, you now have an exoskeleton, you're fine. But I have another idea that we can do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai the placed the jar on the coffee table and covered the lid with a book and went to her room for a moment but then came back holding a cd and walked towards a nearby stereo player inserted the cd in the player then walked back to the jar and removed the book and let Naruto out of  the jar and just as the music began to play Kurenai began to dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song playing was samba based and almost immediately Kurenai began to dace to the beat of the song and making sure to move her feet towards Naruto, which caused him to now scurry for his life but just before Naruto could find sanctuary, Kurenai's bare feet slammed in front of him making him bounce back into the open, and this went on for the next 30 songs after this one, but with different songs and different dances from Kurenai and a lot of moving around just to survive for Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be an eternity of dodging dancing bare feet of the gigantic Kurenai Yuhi, Naruto was now on his stomach all eight legs stretched out in exhaustion as he was now gasping for air after the final song finished at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then felt the floor shake as he then looked up to Kurenai who then said, \"That was fun, and Naruto, I gotta say, who knew spiders would be good dance partners, despite the height difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could only reply by barely tapping the floor with his front leg, [I'm so tired, Kurenai-sensei....]</span></div></div>",

He was a minted shinobi, genin level of the leaf village, and had a love of wearing bright colors namely orange. Naruto was currently in the land of blue waters, one of the most popular vacation spots in all the elemental nations. Kakashi had decided that team seven deserved a break, both for what they had done, and to celebrate their new hokage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto smiled as he walked through one of the quieter parts of the shopping district. Everyone he passed greeted him with kindness, and no one had looked at him with disdain, ah if only the leaf where more like this. Naruto continued walking, admiring the town not noticing that someone was coming down the same way, their vision obscured.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto felt something bump into his head and some panicking, and as he turned, a shadow over came him before he found himself buried under a mountain of books, and boxes. Ah no, not again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the person cried as he began picking up his items. Just as he reached for an old looking tome, bound in peeling leather, Naruto managed to rise from his burial mound.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOw and they say that books never hurt anyone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto mumbled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAck, are you okay, ah I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry, I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the person cried catching Naruto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOw sorry, ah don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apologize since I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watch where I was going,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto said, and began gathering books and scrolls. Soon e everything had been collected, and by some miracle no book had been damaged, and no scroll lost.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you young man, in this day that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t many people willing to leaned a helping hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the stranger said. Naruto turned and finally was able to get a good look at the bookworm. He was tall and lanky, like Kakashi, his reddish orange hair messy and falling in front of his full rimmed glasses. He wore a shirt that clung loosely from him, accentuating his thin body.  His pants where worn and thin,  a few patches on the side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo problem, names Naruto Uzumaki future Hokage, believe it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the said smiling. The man looked at Naruto strangely before sticking out his hand.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me H, everyone dose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man said, as Naruto took his hand in a firm shake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Naruto do you mind helping me take these to my house and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you something for your trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d H asked hopefully.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite what everyone in the leaf thought Naruto was rather smart but preferred to keep quiet to avoid an negative attention, however h didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem the kind of person with an  underhanded plan or motive, so he agreed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The trip was short and soon they arrived to a rather nice looking two story building. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust set the books down anywhere you can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d h said as he opened the door and entered. When Naruto walked in the first thing he thought was of how much this place was like his room. Books where all over the place and there was hardly any room to move. Not seeing an option Naruto placed the books he had help carry and placed them down on a small pile of books that already existed.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNaruto, come here a moment please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d h called from farther in. Naruto began walking being careful to not disturb any of the books on the floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn here Naruto,\u00e2\u0080\u009d H called as Naruto approached one of the doorways in the hall. Naruto turned and their was H looking in a books.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to give you something for helping me, and as a gift, cause I think you could get more from it than I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d H said as he pulled out two scrolls and handed them to Naruto.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto gingerly took the scrolls, and examined them. One was covered by an orange with black stripe pattern; the other was sealed with a familiar mark. The mark was a red swirl outlined in black, the mark seen on the back of a leaf shinobie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI figured an Uzumaki would have more use of one of their sealing scrolls than I, the other was given to me by a customer as payment. It is a rare scroll containing the jutsu called Beast Becoming. With it a person can take on the characteristics of a certain animal, the one you hold is for tiger. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know all the details other than a person can switch between full tiger, half human half tiger form, and full humen form with some kind of tiger characteristic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d H explained as Naruto looked over the scroll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, namely the sealing scroll.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Uzumaki\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a sealing scroll by an Uzumaki. That meant that he had a family, and maybe their where others out there, somewhere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cH, please tell me, what do you know about the family Uzumaki,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto said looking up at H begging.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0H was slightly taken back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell I know the Uzumaki family founded the nation of Uzu which fell during the last shinobi war, and help found Konoha, which eliminated the Uzumakis history for some reason, maybe to not look weak for losing an ally, or possibly to try and claim the land of Uzu for themselves, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I also know the Uzumakis had a strange and powerful chakra, long life spans, and an powerful capability for the sealing arts. Other than that, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d H said.<br>\r\nNaruto was a little disappointed, but glad he had been able to learn something about his family.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks H it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much but at least I know something now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto said smiling sadly. H remained silent and nodded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto gathered himself and stood.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for the scrolls, but I got to get going, maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll meet again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto said. H nodded.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs do I hope we will meet again Naruto, I wish you well. And a piece of advice; be yourself. Do that and you can accomplish more than you could dream,\u00e2\u0080\u009d H said as he held his hand out. Naruto took it and shook it one last time then \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 left.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto saw that It was only just past four if the clock in town was correct, and he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to meet up with his team till six, so he decided to go and look over his scrolls some more. The sealing scroll would take longer to learn since it was more theory and how a seal was done, Naruto decide to focus on the tiger scroll. Not wanting to cause a panic or destroy anything if something went wrong, Naruto decided it would be best to find a reclusive place to practice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The place Naruto had decided to practice was a small sheltered cove several miles away from the town and was surrounded by a rocky out crop, a perfect place to practice. Naruto opened his scroll to read the instructions and hand signs, noting how a part had been worn away with age. He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it out but assumed it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too important. The hand signs were simple, and went Tiger, monkey, tiger, bird, tiger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto breathe deeply trying to relax and gather his Chakra, then began the weaving the signs. At first nothing happened but then Naruto felt a surge nerve wracking pain. His bones seemed to break apart then come back together simultaneously.  His muscles tore then knitted back together, his organs seemed to liquefy before reforming stronger than ever. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Naruto gasped after what felt like an eternity in fire, gasping to fill his lungs with air. Naruto slowly began standing up his body aching in protest. Naruto brought his hand up to rub his temple when he noticed something. His nails where longer sharper, like when he use the Kyuubi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chakra, and along his hands where dark stripes that stopped as they reached his knuckles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pulling the sleeve of his jacket Naruto saw the stripes went up his arm. Going to a stagnate pond Naruto was able to see his reflection, though not quite clearly. In what could be seen stripe adorned his neck and went up his face, his whiskers thicker than before,  unfortunate the water didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reveal anything past his mouth so Naruto couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quiet see what his face looked like.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto smiled and without thinking took off to his team wanting to show them the new Naruto.</span></div></div>",

MY BODY! MY FACE AND MY BODY! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?! WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?! I CAN'T BE SEEN AS A FLITHY FUZZY SQUIRREL!!!!\" Naruto then suddenly punched himself in the face, attempting to calm himself down and try to figure out what could've gone wrong with the jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Use my power for something as insignificant as defending a squirrel, will you? See how it goes with you locked in the shape of one, you whelp!\"</b> The Kyubbi's voice rang through Naruto's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he heard that, the former human paled and started run around in a panic before he realized someone had noticed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Naruto saw...</span></div></div>",

Guess I'll just take you with me, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paled. The Fire Daimyo?! But he couldn't go there like this! What if the Daimyo's wife saw him?! Madam Shijimi was know to be so overly affectionate with her pets, it blurred the line between affection and borderline abuse! If she saw him while he was stuck as a squirrel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Please, no! Not that! Anything but that!' Naruto attempted to say but it only came out as squeaks and clicks, as he struggled frantically as Tsunade went into a petshop, bought a gilded cage, then stuffed him into it and locked it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of the many duties of being a Kage, guess you could call being taken along as practice!\" Tsunade smirked, holding the cage up to her face, laughing at the terrified squirrel within it before beginning her treck to the Daimyo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...using his dream to taunt him? That was low!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsunade was heading towards the Daimyo's palace, Naruto was still trying to reason with her in his cage, begging, pleading, trying to finger a way out of the cage, until Tsunade had enough and pulled the cage near her face saying, \"ENOUGH!!! IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS RIGHT NOW NARUTO UZUMAKI, I WILL GIVE YOU TO MADAM SHIJIMI AND JUST LEAVE YOU AS A SQUIRREL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her threat work as Naruto was absolutely frozen in fear of being given to Shijimi was enough, she then just continued her trip, though if she had to be honest, she really couldn't blame Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Shijimi was known to show soo much love for her pets, that it was borderline abusive, so she could understand why Naruto was horrified at the idea of going to the Daimyo's palace in his state, though she was willing to milk this for all it's worth, and she was going to have her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally arrived at the Daimyo's palace, Tsunade took another look at Naruto and frowned at his form not facing her or the palace, and sighed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, maybe I went too far with that threat, but it's too late to turn back now and apparently Naruto offically hates me for all this, what to do? what to do?' Tsunade thought to herself as she didn't want Naruto to pray to every diety for her death, until she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto, I know you can hear me so just listen: if you are on you're very best behavior until I'm done here, then I'll get you a bowl of Ichiraku ramen as you're reward, what do you say?\" Tsunade said to the sulking blonde squirrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Naruto was now happily squeaking and clicking after hearing that and Tsunade could swear that Naruto's eyes were sparkling as they entered the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they entered, Tsunade headed to the Daimyo's office to talk, that is until Tsunade and Naruto saw Madam Shijimi approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto trembled in his cage as Shijimi neared. She looked the same as always: a corpulent woman with dark brown hair that she kept in three separate poofs. She wore pink lipstick, pink nail-polish and purple eyeshadow. She also was wearing many different coloured rings and a highly fancy kimono to flaunt her wealth and status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw Naruto in his cage somehow both Tsunade and Naruto thought the must've done the shunshin, cause before either knew it she was upon Naruto's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so adorable Lady Tsunade, wherever did you find this beautiful creature?\" Shijimi asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm, his name is Menma. I just found him around the village's park and he was so cute, I had to just have him.\" Tsunade lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShijimi nodded in understanding as she remembered when she saw Tora for the very first time and she just had to have her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked for a bit, Naruto was trying to stay by Tsunade's side whenever he could, just so he could stay out of Shijimi's eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until they heard the door open and a samurai said, \"Lady Tsunade, the Daimyo wishes to see you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then looked down at Naruto in his cage in worry at the thought of leaving him alone, until Shijimi joyfully said, \"Oh, don't worry about your pet squirrel Tsunade, I'll watch over him and give him as much love as you give him in your absence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked like she didn't want to, but she had to go see the Daimyo and lifted Naruto's cage as she saw Naruto give her pleading eyes while his front paws looked as if he was now praying for her to just take him with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Tsunade decided to give Naruto's cage to Shijimi and she said that she'll pick him up after her meeting was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched Tsunade enter the Daimyo's office in shock, she left him here, with Shijimi holding his cage, which she had just opened and grabbed the stunned blonde Uzumaki squirrel and it only took him now being in agonizing pain to realize the situation he now found himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Squirrely! Squirrely! Squirrely! Squirrely! Oh Squirrely!!!<br>\r\nSuch a sweet squirrely. Yes you are, Menma! Yes you are! I can't take it! Come to mommy, I demand snuggles!\" Shijimi said as she was now shoving Naruto's small body against her's as if she was trying to absorb him into her flesh, while Naruto attempted to get away from the Daimyo's wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as this was going on, Tora walked towards them to see if maybe she could use this opportunity to escape again, now that Shijimi found something else to smother to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto squirmed, he wriggled out of the woman's arms and dove for the ground only to be ensnared again, this time held upside down. Out of sheer despiration, Naruto brushed the tip of his tail under Shijimi's nose and kept at it, until Shijimi released Naruto from her grip as she sneezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that, all Tora could think of was 'HOW THE HELL DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT!?!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto landed back on the ground after he made Shijimi sneeze, he quickly began to run back to Tsunade as fast as his paws could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back here, Menma! Your owner still wants to love you, my little bushy-tailed baby!\" Shijimi called.</span></div></div>",

The strange and amazing things ninjas could do made logical sense in every way. Anything a ninja did could be explained through hard science. So you could imagine Sakura's reaction to their latest mission. A protection mission for a magician was the last thing Sakura wanted to do. She being an avid bookworm, especially for the scientific, made her feel that anything anyone claimed to be \"magic\" was nothing more than lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto on the other hand was excited to see a magic show, claiming to have stayed up all night learning how to do simple tricks to impress the magician. The magician apparently was very popular in other countries and had come to the Land of Fire to 'entertain the masses'. He sounded like an arrogant jerk to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, oh man!\" yelled Naruto, \"Where is he? I can't wait to meet him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to sound like Sakura, you idiot...\" muttered Sasuke. Sakura blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto retorted. \"Oh shut up bastard! I've been waiting all week for this! Sanja the Great is supposed to be one of the coolest magicians ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the most popular.\" spoke Kakashi, \"Which is why you should remember why it is we're needed Naruto. There's no telling how a celebrity will fare in a new crowd of people, there may very well be a riot for all we know. Our job is to protect Sanja and make sure no harm comes to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rolled his eyes and began to think of a way to get the magician's autograph without Kakashi noticing. The sensei sighed and they continued down the road. When they finally reached the meeting place for the magician there was no one to be seen. Naruto began to look around frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys see him anywhere!? Maybe we're in the wrong spot! Are you sure this is where we were supposed to meet Kakashi-sensei?! I don't see anyone anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me young man...\" said an old lady who had come up to the four ninjas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it, granny?\" replied Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you happen to have a coin I can borrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea sure, here you go.\" he flicked a coin into the woman's hand. \"By the way have you seen a magician around here? He's called Sanja the Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I have...you see he...\" the old lady torn her cloak off, revealing a handsome looking man with a Spanish accent beneath, \"...is me! Sanja the Great at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed while Naruto's mouth gaped open before clapping like an idiot. Sanja held the coin out in front of the team before clapping his hands together. He showed both of his hands, the coin seemed to have vanished. He then reached over to Naruto's ear and pulled out the very same coin. Naruto applauded, Sakura rolled her eyes, Sasuke just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do Mr. Sanja.\" said Kakashi, \"We are Team Seven and we'll be your bodyguards for your trip here in Konoha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance Kakashi.\" said Sanja, taking Kakashi by surprise considering he had not told the magician his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you must be...\" said Sanja, tossing the coin back to Naruto, \"Naruto, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! How did you know that?\" screamed Naruto as he caught the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanja laughed and turned to Sasuke. \"That one with the scowl is Sasuke, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke grunted. Sanja moved over to Sakura and grabbed her hand before kissing it. \"And this lovely lady is Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura quickly pulled her hand away from him before wiping it on his dress in disgust. Sanja frowned and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not like me, Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense Mister Sanja, I'm sure you're a nice person and all. I just don't believe in magic is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanja shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk. It pains my heart when young folk say that. But just watch one of my performances my dear Sakura. You'll believe in time...Now then, shall I show you where you'll be staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lead them to the concert hall where his shows would be held and gave each of them their own personal room backstage. \"Perhaps this won't be such a bad week after all.\" said Sakura to herself as she relaxed in her large queen sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This left Sakura alone and bored in her room, with absolutely nothing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the worst mission ever...\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive the point home.

Instead, one of the managers greeted Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be Sanja's new assistant he was talking about. He seems to go through so many it seems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I\"ll bet.' she said to herself while rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway.\" the man continued, pulling out a particularly small one piece red suit, \"Here is your costume to wear while on stage. Also I'll ask that you please give me any weapons or ninja equipment so we don't cause a full blown panic up there. Sanja is quite nervous considering this is his first time performing in Konoha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the suit to Sakura, it looked like it was meant for a child but it was rather stretchy and soft. Sakura in turn took off her ninja belt and kunai to give to the manager, who fondled with them inexpertly. He led her to a changing booth and she donned the glittery one piece. She also let her hair down as well. She looked pretty good considering she was in a small gaudy outfit. After exiting the booth Sakura handed the manager her old clothing for safe keeping and he lead her backstage again. Sanja was about to go on stage. The announcer blared his introduction to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now ladies and gentlemen of Konoha...I bring to you the master of disguise! The sorcerer of the south! The incredible illusionist! Here he is! Sanja the Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an explosion in the middle of the stage of green smoke. When it cleared, there stood Sanja in a black suit with a top hat. He bowed to the cheering audience, stopping to lift open his arm cuffs which released a flock of pigeons that flew around the audience. He took his hat off, and the birds dived into it one by one, until they had all vanished and he returned the black hat to his head. The audience was thundering with approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my dear Konoha! It is a pleasure to be here at last!\" spoke the magician, \"I will grant you a show beyond your wildest imagination! But let me not take all the credit...Let me introduce you to my lovely assistant, a ninja of Konoha. The beautiful maiden...Sakura Haruno!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed at his flattery, the manager gave her a slight push onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break a leg!\" smiled the manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly everyone from the village was in attendance, from Hy\u016bgas to the Naras. She was able to notice a mass of bright yellow hair in the audience cheering madly. Looks like Naruto got his wish to watch the show. Sasuke was sitting next to him with his arms crossed. He had a look on his face that said \"How the hell did I get talked into this one?\" Kakashi was no where to be seen, probably outside guarding the entrance. Sakura was blushing madly as she stepped onto stage with her arms behind her back. She had never been in front of a crowd of people this huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my dear audience...\" said Sanja, \"Open your minds....and let the magic begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show was full of what a naive person would call mystical tricks. Sawing people in half, making people disappear, and even preforming levitation were all parts of the show. Sakura's job through this was to help volunteers from the audience up the stage and move props from place to place. Thankfully Sanja had her do nothing embarrassing yet. At least not until after intermission...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now ladies and gentlemen! I will now begin my greatest act! I shall pull a full grown rabbit from my hat! And my wonderful assistant, Sakura, will provide us with the rabbit!\"</span></div></div>",

She stepped up the stage to Sanja, who with a flick of his hand made a table appear in a puff of smoke. He then took off his top hat, showing the audience that nothing was inside before dropping it to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to stand in my hat Sakura.\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obeyed him and placed both of her feet uncomfortably inside his top hat. Sanja took out a wand from his pockets, whispering to Sakura \"This will make you believe.\" He lifted his wand up over Sakura's head before saying to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we say the magic words...Lepus mutatio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura didn't feel any different as he lowered his wand. Sanja put his hand to the top of her head and pushed down slightly. At first Sakura thought he was just measuring her height or something strange like that, but she began to notice that he was looking taller by the second. He was pushing her into the hat! She looked down, expecting there to be an elevator or a trap door. There was nothing but her ever growing closer feet! He was actually scrunching her INTO his hat! She opened her mouth to try to say something but nothing came out, she was in utter shock. By now she was at his waist in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom of the hat was beginning to feel quite cramped as Sakura shrunk past the 2 foot marker and keep on going. The magician had to bend over to reach her head now she was becoming so small. The brim of the hat was slowing approaching from below. The last thing she saw was Sanja smile before she was stuck inside the darkness of the hat. It felt like her entire body had been compressed inside a soup can. Her only comfort was the sounds from outside of the audience madly applauding. She felt herself being lifted into the air and onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.\" spoke Sanja, \"I shall pull my now long eared assistant out completely unharmed! Watch and be amazed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on Sakura what exactly Sanja had meant by pulling a rabbit out of his hat. She felt a slight tugging on her ears before being hoisted out in front of the audience. She was covered in pink fur from head to toe. Her hands and feet were no small paws that were kicking in the air. A fluffy tail had sprouted from her back. Her ears in the hands of Sanja were long and floppy and her nose had flattened and became a snout. She felt her front teeth protruding out of her mouth and long whiskers coming out of her cheeks. And she was still wearing that stupid one piece suit. Worst of all, the world seemed much, much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hear it for Sakura!\" cheered Sanja. The crowd went nuts.</span></div></div>",

Sanja couldn't have transformed me for real!' Sakura thought. She was going to try a genjutsu release technique, just in case, but Sanja interrupted her concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then ladies and gentlemen, my lovely assistant will now show us her physical prowess by balancing this ball on her nose!\" Sanja announced, pulling a large beachball out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Sakura struggled and shook her head no vehemently, which made Sanja smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, for this trick, and every other performance she does properly, our beautiful bunny will recieve...\" The mage then pointed his wand at the ball, which became a carrot. \"A carrot, which will help her return to her original form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then weighed her options. If she did the tricks, she risked public humiliation, but might regain her form. Most importantly to her, Sasuke would see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn't, she'd possibly stay a rabbit forever, and who knows what'd happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kunoichi pondered, Sanja turned the carrot back into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we begin?\" he asked Sakura.</span></div></div>",

Let's hear it for her!\" he yelled to the crowd, meeting a thunderous applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed the ball in the air. Sakura's body reacted on it's own, like it had done this routine hundreds of times before. She titled her head up making her bunny nose parallel to the ground. Which a \"WHUMP\" the ball landed on the tip of her twitching nose and stood balanced. Sanja laughed, he and the audience clapped madly. Sakura aimed at Sanja and jumped, knocking the ball in the air back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, excellent!\" he said catching it. He tapped it again with his wand, it rounded out and formed a giant ring. He then took a deep breathe and breathed fire on it, lighting it ablaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how about another trick? Jump through this hoop of fire my assistant! And I promise you will get your first carrot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura glared at him, feeling she had been humiliated enough already. But she no choice and her body was moving on it's own again. Sanja held the ring at shoulder height, making it quite a jump. Sakura made it though, the fires brushed so close against her fur however she felt it almost catch fire. Sanja bowed to the audience, which was going nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talented isn't she? Yes, yes Sakura. I promised you a carrot. And Sanja is nothing if not a man of his word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked the ring once more, the fires disappeared and the hoop's form shrunk into a small carrot. Sanja reached down and handed it to Sakura who began to scarf it down greedily. She had had just about enough of this. As she eat, she began to notice that her eyesight was becoming higher. She was being tall again. \"Good.\" she thought, \"At least he's not a lying bastard...\" Her hind legs were becoming human like again. Even her arms were becoming more human like. The carrot was almost done, but she still had all her fur, her nose, her ears, and her tail of her rabbit form. The last bite knocked her up back to her normal height. She looked at her human/rabbit form with a face of utter disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" yelled Sanja, \"As you can see, she is not quite back to normal! She will have to preform one final trick to earn that carrot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith arms crossed she glared at him probably for the hundredth time that night. She took it back. He wasn't a lying bastard. Just an exploitative one.</span></div></div>",

Much too high for any normal person to reach. Sakura turned to the magician and simply stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my dear Sakura. If you cannot reach it...you will be stuck like this for an eternity. T'is your choice.\" He said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stared back up at the cage.

At least Sanja had kept his word and would reward her with a way to return to normal for her degrading stunts. She landed with two firm feet on the stage again before shooting back up to the cage. She grabbed onto the bottom and pulled it back down with her. The cable holding it snapped and both she and cage went into free fall. She did a flip and stuck the landing with her massive rabbit feet. The audience went completely wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo!\" said Sanja, \"Thank you for coming to our first show here everyone! I hope to see you all again the whole week! We'll have more exciting tricks next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motioned for Sakura to move offstage, to which she happily obliged. The manager smiled at the the two, applauding them on their performance. But Sakura didn't care, she just wanted this horrible nightmare of an evening to end. She grabbed her clothing and weapons from the bald man and continued to the dressing room. She slammed the door shut and began to eat her hard earned carrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly she felt extremely cooler. Clumps of pink fur fell to the floor. She felt her long ears being sucked back into her head as well. She ate the whole thing in two bites and turned to watch her changes in the mirror, making sure there were no more stupid tricks involved. Her feet were shriveling back to normal size while she felt her nose become her old nose again. She never thought she would be so relieved to see her huge forehead again as the hair on her face began to disappear. The last thing to go was the tail which jolted back into her spine. Sakura surveyed herself in the mirror, making sure every single thing was back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you believe in magic now my dear Sakura?\" came an all too coy and familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura immediately tore a kunai knife from her returned side pocket and lunged at the man in the doorway. She pinned Sanja to the ground, with her knife pressed sharply into his neck. She was about ready to tear that smug smile right off the magic man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do to me, you bastard?!\" she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You volunteered to be my assistant Sakura.\" he put simply, \"That's why I'm always searching for a new one.

Have you been doing this to other people as well!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was coughing in pain, but he answered. \"O-of course. But none of them ever stay after experiencing the transformation. I figured it would be best to find a helper who wouldn't know anything about the trick. And when you said you didn't believe in magic I thought I could do both things at once and prove you wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! You made me make a fool of myself in front of all my friend!\" Her face was turning red from yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they think they saw...was a very elaborate and very impressive magic trick. To them...you were under the stage the whole time, the rabbit was in my hat the whole time, and human rabbit was someone in a costume. The audience thinks...they ALWAYS think that the whole display is just smoke and mirrors. And that my Sakura, is the true genius of my magic. To make the audience second guess themselves. That is the goal of any master illusionist. Now, would you kindly remove your kunai knife from my throat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura hesitated, but slowly returned the knife back to her pack. She got off of Sanja and he dusted himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You placed your trust in me Sakura as an assistant.\" said Sanja, \"I would not harm or cause havoc for someone who put as much trust in me as you did tonight. Besides...you make a very charming rabbit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sounded almost like Naruto.

Like she was unleashing a pent up beast within her. She would never admit it, but it was fun being a rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? I'm not sure I can find someone else who'd be interested...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Alright, alright.

It will be the most fun you've ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left shortly after that, Sakura headed for the lounging room Team Seven was given. Her teammates were waiting for her. Naruto was hopping around the room like he had eaten a dozen 'pixie sticks'. Sasuke, on the other hand, was staring up at the ceiling from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto noticed Sakura and yelled. \"Sakura! You're not a rabbit anymore! That show was awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot,\" Said Sasuke. \"It was an illusion. Every thing in the show was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Sasuke!

It was all a very elaborate illusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sulked around the room the rest of the night before going to bed, Sasuke was not far behind him. Sakura on the other hand stayed awake for a little bit longer. She took off the leotard Sanja had given her before the show and neatly folded it into a pile. Deep inside, she was excited. It was like waiting for Christmas the next day. She didn't want to fall asleep ever. Eventually though, she grew too sleepy to stay up, and passed out on her makeup table with her pajamas on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura!

Said something about practice before tonight's show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura quickly jumped up and grabbed her leotard without even thanking Naruto. She didn't even ask where Sanja was, though she had a hunch. Bursting through the curtain to the main stage, she found Sanja juggling several chainsaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry *huff* I'm late *puff*\" She said through deep breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanja tipped his hand, every single chainsaw in the air landed and disappeared within the black void. He then turned to Sakura and gave a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis no trouble my dear Sakura. Though I must say, you were in quite the hurry to get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed and he chuckled. \"But let's move to the task at hand.

She performed trick after trick for the carrot to change her back but no matter what she did, every carrot she earned did nothing. The audience mocked her, throwing tomatoes and banana peels at her. She could do nothing but sit and cry, wishing it was over. Then she awoke with a pounding headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what a horrible dream...\" she said to herself, holding her giant forehead in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rainy day and she had greatly overslept. She was supposed to be at the show an hour ago. She got to her feet and walked over to her vanity mirror to quickly put on her makeup and leave for the mission. Her appearance was shocking though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the..? What the hell is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer front teeth were now extremely long, like it they had been when she was a rabbit the other night. Her ears had also lengthened again several inches, while her nose had pushed out into a snout again. There was also a slight appear of small whiskers protruding from her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That magician! I'll kill him!\", she took off as fast as she could for the concert hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long ears she was now sporting flopped in the wind as she dashed down the crowded Konoha street. She had not stopped to put on shoes so she had a clear view of her bare feet. To her dismay it looked like they were growing out again with each step. Worst of all, the crowd was becoming taller and taller. She was losing inches of height every minute wasted. She had to have lost 6 inches by the time she busted through the theater's doors.

It felt like entering a rabbit hole (no pun intended). Stars and planets zoomed by her face. She felt herself become compressed as she fell further into the darkness. She looked down and swore she could see another door approaching fast. She closed her eyes before she collided with it. There was a giant crash and she feel face first on a hard checkered marble floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked several times and slowly got up. \"Wha...W-where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in the middle of a small room. Giant granite pillars surrounded her, protecting blank gray walls. Yet, there was a small wooden door at the bottom of the wall. It could not have been larger than a foot high. Sakura hopped over to it and reached for the knob. Suddenly the keyhole itself gave a huge yawn. Two sleepy yellow eyes appeared above it. It looked like a face was in the door itself! It spoke in a tired voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever it is...you are much too large to enter me. Why don't you try to get smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um pardon me,\" Answered Sakura. \"But I can fit through. I'm a tiny rabbit. See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door blinked several times. \"Why so you are! My apologizes, I was expecting someone else. Go on through then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened up to reveal a sprawling green land of colorful houses. All of which were oddly shaped like top hats and a card houses. There were plenty of people, cloaked in garbs not unlike Sanja, conversing with each other. Sakura caught a glimpse of brooms that were sweeping by themselves, and horse drawn carriages with no horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to go through or not?\" Asked the door impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skipped out into the great city. The air smelled of roses and cotton candy.

Sakura reached up and scratched behind his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just a poor big guy locked in a cage with no one to visit you huh? I don't blame you for getting lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumbo seemed more occupied with Sakura's face as he felt around it with his trunk.

Cut it Out.)\" said Sakura as she took the elephant's exhaled air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly it didn't smell that bad. Almost like a mixture of peanuts and grass. Maybe it was just a way of the elephant saying hello to her or something. But she knew something was happening when it didn't stop. She felt heavier almost, all around her body. She looked down and saw pudgy belly begin to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But's Bowing Bon?( What's going on?)\", she asked the elephant, who had taken another deep breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore air surged into her. She felt something poke out of her hair. Grabbing it she felt it was her ears! They were becoming over sized and flapply like-like...an elephants! Sakura mumbled and tried to pull the elephant's trunk off her face. But it was no good. Jumbo was too firmly attached.

Another blow came, and Sakura felt something poke out of her pants. It was an elephants tail. Another deep breathe from Jumbo caused it to jump out to full elephant size. Sakura felt more and more powerful from each breathe Jumbo blew into her, but she could still not remove his trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bum Bon! Bop Bis Blease! (Come on! Stop this please!)\" cried Sakura, with tries down her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge surge expanded her body out even further. Loud rips were heard as her torn clothing lay all over the ground. She was completely naked and pink now. But she also noticed that Jumbo had to turn his head up to blow air into her. She had gotten gigantic! Her stomach now covered most of her mid section, giving the impression her torso had a barrel shape to it. Her hands were no more as only pink elephant feet took their place. As far as Sakura could tell, the only thing human left about her was her hair, which resembled more of a mane now, and her face which was drenched in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Bont Bant Bo Be Ban Blebant!(I don't want to be an elephant!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could now see completely over Jumbo, her legs wobbled and she lost her balance. With a giant rumble, she landed on her hands(feet). But still Jumbo refused to let go. Her entire body was that of a pink elephant, just a little smaller than Jumbo. Sakura knew what was coming next. With a giant blow, Sakura felt her head enlarge itself, all that remained was the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumbo began sucking. It felt like he was trying to pull Sakura's face off. But as moved his trunk back, Sakura's nose followed it. He was lengthening her nose by sheer force! Eventually, after stretching it a good two feet Jumbo released her new trunk.

Whatever, I'll take her home, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Naruto ten whole seconds to determine that Sasuke was referring to him. The Ringleader tied a noose around Sakura's neck and handed the end of the rope to Sasuke. As he pulled her out of the cage, Sakura turned to Jumbo who reached out in vain at her. She couldn't help but feel bad for the poor creature again, all he wanted was company. Even if it was in the form of a transformed human girl to pose as a mate. But her thoughts drifted to spending the rest of her life with Sasuke. Even if it was as a giant elephant, maybe they'd have a chance to become closer by the time this was over. After all, they would be bound to notice that she had gone completely missing. Hopefully it wouldn't take long for them to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" spoke Sasuke, breaking the silence,\"you can understand me right? I really...\"</span></div></div>",

And don't move until I come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded and Sasuke smiled. As he walked across the street, swiftly avoiding a pair of clouds juggling chainsaws, Sakura watched the parade go by. She spotted a mass of pink balancing a stack of acrobats on it's trunk. Jumbo the elephant was walking by looking as melancholy as ever. Thankfully he didn't seem to notice Sakura, heaven forbid he go on a rampage through the crowd of people in front of her. As he drifted away out of sight, Sakura sensed someone approaching her. It was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come now girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey unlocked the door, Sasuke stood up weakly and yelled at the ninjas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the ninjas laughed and kicked Sasuke right in the mouth. He slammed down to the floor, coughing up a handful of scarlet blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're taking her to her mate, the other circus elephant we captured. The boss wants to create more elephants so we can make a bigger profit. Don't worry though, you'll get your \"girlfriend\" back just as soon as Jumbo's had a little fun with her. And don't try to escape, those handcuffs drain all the chakra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura tried to resist but the ninja were able to put a noose around her neck. As they turned to lead her out of the prison, Sakura though to herself, \"I have to do something or else I'll lose my virginity to an elephant! Think Sakura! Think! Wait a minute...can I still use jutsu like this?\" She made hand seals with her trunk. \"Fire Ball Jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast caught everyone in the room by surprise. Both her captors were thrown back and slammed into the wall. Sasuke just started in amazement at the fiery spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An elephant that uses jutsu...No way! Unless...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura trotted over to Sasuke and felt her handcuffs with her trunk. He got the message and held them out against the ground. With all her massive body weight, Sakura pounded the middle of the cuffs with her feet, causing them to scatter instantly.

It appeared to be one of the old underground bunkers from the Great Ninja Wars, it was filled with dank dark prisons and rusty metal doors. Thankfully most of the cells were empty with the lights knocked out. All they had to do was stay in the section in the bunker that was operational and they would find the team idiot, Naruto. There were several guards but they were no match for an Uchiha and a jutsu using elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reached the last row of cells to find Naruto wearing the same hand cuffs Sasuke was in moments ago. Sasuke took the guard out with a swift kick and grabbed the keys on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god Sasuke! How the hell did you get out of your cell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank...her\" Sasuke pointed at Sakura, she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some questions I need to ask you when we get back. For now let's concentrate on getting out of here.\" said Sasuke to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Team Seven reunited again, the hired ninjas stood no chance against them. Even when the alarm sounded, Sasuke was able to tear through them with Chidori while Naruto blew them away with Rasengan. Sakura was able to flail the ninjas away with her massive trunk. In the middle of the action, Naruto yelled to Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Jumbo? They kidnapped him too right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tore through this entire place trying to find you Naruto. They probably took him to another base of theirs. We need to report back to Kakashi-sensei and the village and let them know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they found an entrance and broke out into the sunlight. They were in the middle of the forest somewhere, not far from the village though. Sasuke could see Konoha just over the mountain. They all made a mental note of the bunker's location and returned to the village. When they were well out of harms way, Naruto brought up a question to Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Sasuke, what do you mean she helped you escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke looked at Sakura and grabbed Naruto on the shoulder and took him out of ear shot. \"Had me using jutsu caused Sasuke to catch on to me?\", thought Sakura. Naruto had a confused look on his face, but was nodding along to whatever Sasuke was telling him. At last they both smiled at each other and nodded, walking over to Sakura while still talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so that's it. By the way, have you heard from Sakura recently?\" asked Naruto, \"Maybe we'll have to replace her at this rate. Who do you think we should get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke said with a completely straight face, \"I always wanted to have Ino on our team. I sort of thought she was always better looking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething primitive and reflexive snapped in Sakura's inner ego, which still oddly resembled her former self. \"NO WAY! ABSOLUTELY NO FREAKING WAY!\" Unfortunately, Sakura couldn't control herself and reared her front legs up in anger, trumpeting all sorts of curse words at them. Sasuke and Naruto were both in utter shock at her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I didn't want to believe it...\" said Sasuke, \"It's you Sakura, isn't it? Our teammate? Only Sakura would react in a way like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in a dark office, a man in a fancy business suit stared at the ninja, Genjira. He took a long puff on his lighted cigar and asked in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Mr. Genjira...you're telling me the ninja escaped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir! It is only a shame I, the Night Ninja's greatest ninja wasn't there to stop them! They also took the female elephant we had captured, apparently she was able to use jutsu and caught our men off guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the suit drummed his fingers on his desk. He took another drag of his cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elephants don't just...use jutsu, Mr. Genjira. There is something...off about that female, I want your best man to find out what. It might have something to do with why those circus freaks suddenly were able to get their hands on another pink elephant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look no further sir! I, Genjira of the Night, will hunt them down without fail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that Mr. Genjira...off you go now.\"</span></div></div>",

Sasuke on the other hand was quiet the whole way. Every time Sakura tried to reach over and grab him with her trunk, he'd push her away. It was almost like he was trying to ignore her, like she had betrayed him in some way. At least Naruto was distracting her from his icy cold shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, they were back in Tsunade's office reporting what had happened to the Hokage. How Sakura had been able to free them. How they fought there way out.

She got up and walked over to Sakura, gently placing her hand on Sakura's forehead. Tsunade closed her eyes, Sakura could feel her chakra gently fill her body and vibrate with her own. Tsunade opened her eyes and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two know your teammate well, this is indeed Sakura's chakra. Why she has become a giant elephant I cannot say.

Sasuke looked like he had just received a shotgun blast to the groin but regained his normal cool composure. Tsunade dismissed them and they sent out home for the second time in one day. Naruto kept the atmosphere ablaze with conversation but when it was time for him to go down the street to his house, Sakura was left with the cold dread like silence from Sasuke. Sakura, again, tried to reach out to him with her trunk but Sasuke turned and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you playing at? Knock it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaindrops starting dropping from the heavens, the clear day had turned into a stormy night. Rain poured like a sprinkler from the sky as thunder rumbled like a drum in the distance. The rain left Sakura completely soaked by the time they reached Sasuke's house. It was very empty and dark but filled with creaks and sounds. Sakura had an uneasy feeling that something terrible had happened here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke grabbed a towel from a nearby rack and dried himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will stay here. Don't bother me unless it's important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he slammed the sliding door to his room shut. The living area, which was where Sakura was asked to sleep, was dusty and filled with leftover boxes of food. Old family photos aligned the wall, but in each shot there was someone standing next to Sasuke whose face had been ripped out. The entire house seemed depressing, tainted with a dark history of hatred. This made it a little troubling to sleep but Sakura found a soft spot on the floor and curled up to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning brought some much needed light to the dank house. There was a knock on the door that woke Sakura up. Sasuke, who had been up for hours already, was speaking to a messenger from the Hokage. The conversation was short and the ninja took off with his task complete, Sasuke said only three words without even looking at Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade wants you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura excused herself from the house while Sasuke left to go train. After a short trip to the Hokage's office, Sakura found herself sitting down in a large in door gymnasium with Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sakura, I don't know why it is you changed the way you did. But perhaps you can explain that to me once we've finished here. You see I did some research and may have found the way to return to you normal. This is going to require immense focus and chakra control though. Are you prepared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded, she had always been an expert on chakra control so this would be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what you must do is focus your chakra and reshape in yourself. You must think of your original form and shape your chakra to meet it. If it works you should be able to return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura concentrated her chakra just as the Hokage asked. She had a vivid image of what she looked like before this mess and molded her inner energies to meet that form. She could feel chakra weave around in side of her. She opened her eyes to see that she was reducing in size! It was working, she was returning to normal!</span></div></div>",

Sakura and sasuke tried to sneak over to save him, but it was very hard for an elephant to sneak around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see that the two of you have escaped, eh?\" Genjira's voice asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Not you again!\" Sasuke said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is I, the Night village's greatest ninja, Gen-GACK!!!\"He yelled as he was punched in the face by Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for earlier.\" The uchiha boy said, when he and Sakura were ambushed by guards who were attracted by their leader's pompous intro.

It took awhile, but sakura and Sasuke were knocked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sakura awoke, she felt something weird on her forehead. she looked around and found herself in a large circus tent, with Jumbo but it was all faked.

Being an elephant she couldn't talk in human talk, but she let out a worried bellow out of her trunk, in hopes that the stupid Genjira would understand her and not hurt Sasuke. She gulped and looked at Jumbo, if they didn't mate then both, her and Sasuke, would be killed because of the curse seal placed on them. She let out a sigh looked at Jumbo, who was getting closer and closer toward the female pink elephant. <i>''I-I don't want to lose my virginity, but I don't want Sasuke to get hurt because of myself.''</i> Sakura thought to herself and took a step back from Jumbo when he stepped closer toward herself. She was still thinking of a way to get out of this situation, and there were only really two options in her mind, mate or die. Jumbo came up to Sakura while she was thinking to herself, as if he could sense that she was in deep fear in the moment. Jumbo raised his trunk and ran it along Sakura\u2019s head and ears as if trying to calm her down and tell her that he was there as a friend. Sakura looked at Jumbo\u2019s eyes and noticed the look of friendship, but a slight ting of lust in them as well. \u2018\u2019Hurry up and choose, or I will kill you now!\u2019\u2019 Genjira said getting closer toward Sasuke as if he was going to kill the exposed Uchiha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura whimpered and let out another sound that she would go along with it. She looked at Jumbo and ran her trunk over Jumbo\u2019s trunk, them both rubbing their trunks together to show \u2018elephant love\u2019. Jumbo walked around Sakura a few times, looking her over, and Sakura just watched, wondering what would happen next. If she wasn\u2019t an elephant and wasn\u2019t already pink, she would be blushing. Jumbo was giving off such a toxic aroma from his body and it was causing her mind to go crazy. Her body let off its own concoction in responds to Jumbo\u2019s scent, a way of telling him that she was ready and wanting to mate with him. \u2018\u2019W-what is going on with my body?\u2019\u2019 Sakura said to herself, and then Jumbo stopped right behind her. His penis was fully erect and he was ready to mount this female pink elephant. He was an animal so he was just following his animal instincts and had no idea what was he was exactly doing. Sakura, on the other hand, had to go along with the plan or would die if she didn\u2019t. Jumbo ran his trunk, one more time, over Sakura\u2019s back as he pushed himself against her backside to force his front end on to his back for easy entry to her genitals. Sakura felt the male elephant bull, mount her back, and just waited for the connection to be made. Jumbo slowly slid his cock into Sakura\u2019s pink vagina and caused her to become a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gasped when the cock entered her body as he pushed it all the way into her body, slowly pushing it in and out. Good thing Sakura was an elephant or the huge penis would have ripped her open upon contact. Jumbo increased his speed, as Sakura\u2019s body made its own lubricant, making it easy for the male\u2019s penis to enter the tight body of his mate. Jumbo moved his front legs to hug Sakura\u2019s back end as he began to go faster inside the warm body of Sakura, while the pink female elephant clinched her eyes closed and her body being filled with pleasure. With her human thoughts and memories in the mind of an elephant, she was reactive and alert to all that happened to her. \u2018\u2019A-Ah..\u2019\u2019 Sakura moaned, coming out as a trumpet from her trunk as Jumbo mated with her body. It hurt at first, but as the male was going, it was getting better and better. </span></div></div>",

So when Tsunade offered Sakura a break from training with the simple task of collecting kelp while on vacation, she instantly jumped at the chance. A well earned rest from the constant beatings of the Hokage was well worth collecting a bunch of plants. However, Tsunade had neglected to tell her student where exactly her \"vacation\" was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A swamp?!\" She yelled, standing in front of a large that read 'Baku Bog'. \"I'm supposed to relax in a muddy swamp!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Sakura was not happy with her location of relaxation. There was nothing she could do though. Faced with living in a bog for a week or facing her master's wrath, Sakura regrettably had to chose the first option.

For awhile, she couldn't see anything with cattails and tall grass but at least she spotted a clearing in the water. A small wooden house with a deck was at the end of the bridge.

He spotted Sakura and gave a hearty chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be! If it ain't one of them ninjas! Hello there pretty lady, what are you doing here in the ol' Bog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sent here by my mistress? Lady Tsunade? And please tell me this isn't where we stay for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. That fetchin' lady. And don't you worry. This place is much bigger then it looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned and dropped her traveling bags to the ground. The man kindly picked them up for her and led her inside. Indeed, the house was much larger on the inside. Mostly because there was only one room. Aside from a few chairs, a table, a bed, and a couch, the only things inside were animal heads. Fearsome Alligator and Crocodile skulls lined the walls, there were even huge fish presented on plaques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Billy, by the way. I own the only house out here on the Bog. Most people are too scared to live out here. Especially city folk like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura poked one of the heads of the giant lizards. \"Let me guess, crocodile problems?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly gave a snort. \"They have something to do with it yes. But what really keeps them away is one in particular. Now pay attention here, we have rules down in the bog little lady. Rule one is you don't go traveling alone out there on the bayou. Crocs and gators are one thing, but ol' Bloodeye is a completely different story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloodeye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly unbuttoned his shirt and pulled the collar down to expose his left shoulder. Near his neck, a large portion of his flesh was missing. Bite marks covered the giant scar. It even made Sakura, a trained medical ninja, a bit sick just looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've lived in this swamp for all my life. I've been bitten by crocs and mauled by gators. But let me tell you this. Bloodeye is a monster. He's a big black gator that lurks in the deepest waters of the marsh. Some folks say he's called Bloodeye because when he makes his kill, blood fills the water so much that he goes blind for a bit. That's a load of hooey. His eyes are blood red. Not a hint of mercy in em. I would know. I've met him twice. And if you think my shoulder is bad, you should see what he gave me the last time I met him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gulped. So much for a restful vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly put his shirt back on and became cheerful again. \"Down let's settle down and have us some dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of saws and tree falling filled the early morning air like the thundering of a hurricane. In a clearing which had once been a beautiful forest of Konoha's massive trees, a steel monstrosity crunched over the fallen giants as if they were mere twigs. Biting, slashing, chopping a path through the entanglement of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Take her nice and slow!\" Shouted a foreman in a yellow hard hat. He was shouting to the machine's operator perched a good twenty feet above him in a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine he was driving was an impressive display of Konoha ingenuity. It's massive black treads proved their power to climb over even the most daunting obstacles while a spinning array of saw blades butchered anything in front of the vehicle. The mammoth was unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll along the side of the machine, dozens of workers were gathering up the less bulky remains of the giant trees while two squads of elite Konoha ninja covered them, eying the dark of the forest intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine continued to lurch forward. Bits of wood and splinters blew in the wind caused by the onslaught. Several animals, panic driven and terrified, dove further into the woods to escape the massacre of the forest. The foreman smiled a dirty brown grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up boys! We'll be finished by lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to taunt his words, an explosion on the right side of the machine caused the metal monster to come to a screeching halt. While the workers immediately scrambled for cover or to point out the flames, the ninja jumped high in the air towards the source of the attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious saboteur stood high in the shadows of a neighboring tree. The squad leader of the first ninja squad pointed in the shadow's general direction as his teammates charged forward under his barking orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowy person held what appeared to be a large silver staff. He raised it in the air slightly before slamming it hard into the tree. As if coming to life, the tree twisted and turned in the manner that a human would. It's strong limbs reached out and grabbed the approaching ninja, subduing them into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast approaching behind them, however, was the second squad climbing up over their fallen comrades. The shadow responded accordingly, swing his staff around and assuming a fighting position. Several thrown kunai clanged off the metal rod as the first of the ninja landed to enrage him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ninja was an expert in hand to hand combat and made a chakra filled swing at the shadow. Nimbly, the shadow ducked from the blow and landed his own square in his attacker's chest. The impact sent the ninja flying backwards off the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second ninja hovered just out of range of the shadow. Making some hand signs, he took a deep breathe and released a gust of burning bright fire on top of the tree, apparently consuming the shadow before he could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flames died down, the treetop had been reduced to a smoldering bushel of firewood. However, at the center of the attack was a large blackened leaf where the shadow had been standing mere moments ago. A brief gust of movement under the leaf was all the second ninja had time to notice before feeling a powerful wave of pain in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last ninja, by now realizing the odds weren't in his favor, stood mouth agape at the one who had already caused so much trouble in the few brief seconds that had transpired. Closing his left eye, the ninja touched his right eye with his index finger focusing directly at the identity of the revealed shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow was a boy, no older then seventeen. His hair was black and wild, covered with bits of leaf and twigs. His eyes were green and sharp like the forest's light. His clothes, were ragged yet stylized. It was if there was a distinct pattern to the red and blue lines on the ripped white clothe that covered him like a robe. Two earrings were clearly visible on the ears that jutted out from his mess of hair. But most noticeable was the painful looking scar that took the form of three slashing lines across the bridge of his nose and in front of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we know the name of the attacker?\" Asked Tsunade, as she sat arms folded at her desk, looking at the image of the boy produced on the table. The last ninja to fight against the boy stood ashamed in front of the Hokage and next to his two teammates, battered but alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my lady. We've searched all records, but nothings matches. He's a complete mystery. We apologize for our lack of skill to take down this perpetrator.\" Replied the ninja in a deep bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, none of that. Don't blame yourselves, this little brat's been the one giving us trouble with our resource gathering for weeks now. I'm glad you at least got us an image to go by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stood up and paced the floor slightly before turning out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three weeks...And we still we don't even have a quarter of the planned lumber we need to defend ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There's no sense denying it. We will not be ready when the war does comes...All because of this boy...And now we don't even know who he is. He could very well be a spy for the Land of War.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set outside the window, Tsunade clenched her fists hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not see countless numbers of my people die because of a single saboteur. Fetch Shizune for me. We must spread the word. Any information on this kid...this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade paused and turned to the still image of the boy. The red slash marks caught her eye first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...This Scar. Any intelligence on him will result in a great reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets of Konoha had seen cheerier days, Sakura hadn't seen its people this depressed since the Third Hokage died. The weather seemed to reflect the mood, it was midday and rainy. Soggy puddles and the peeling wanted posters of some boy Sakura didn't recognize were more colorful then the faces of anyone around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was kicking her feet in chair of a restaurant, watching the moody people go about their daily business. She sighed, for she knew very well the reason behind the sadness. War was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Kakashi, Konoha had not been in a war since before Sakura and her teammates were born. He also mentioned to them that they should prepare themselves mentally, as well as physically. They should say good bye to any of their friends, because they might not know if that would be the last that they would see them alive. They should play with the knowledge that they might have to kill for the first time. As an added effect, Kakashi gave her team the day off to reflect and mediate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed. Now the mood of the people around her was starting to affect her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemy, the Land of War, was a nation Konoha knew next to nothing about. All anyone knew was that their army had been rampaging across the globe, destroying anything or anyone in their path. It just so happened that if their determined path was to be believed, Konoha lay directly in their line of war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there were whispers that Konoha wasn't prepared for battle. A lone figure, a boy in the woods that surrounded the city, had been preventing the gathering of valuable resources necessary to reinforce the city with. Without them, they were leaving everything to chance. At least, that's what the hearsay mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, Sakura took a sip of her water. She tried to push out the thoughts of war and depression from her head. Her friends had been through worse. They'd all come out of this alright. No sense in getting herself worked up over the prattle of gossip tellers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive home the point, a familiar obnoxious voice yelled over to her. \"Hey Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time all day, Sakura smirked slightly and turned to Naruto who had been rushing over to her. Perhaps it wouldn't be so terrible a day after all. He seemed in good enough spirits to share his unending energy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ironically, Naruto's sudden appearance only brought more bad news. Despite giving them the day off, Kakashi wanted them. However, instead of cursing at her sensei Sakura merely took it out on Naruto with a solid punch across the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them began their trip to Kakashi's desired meeting place, Naruto rubbed the painful bump on his head. He was used to Sakura's violent tendencies towards him at this point; he never bothered to complain about them and took them with gusto. Though not a word was spoken, they both knew well enough that they were friends no matter what happened, even if Naruto longed for something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was no secret that Naruto had a crush on Sakura for the longest time. Ever since the academy Naruto had done just about everything to get her attention, he was willing to do anything for her. But both of them knew it but it never really meant anything. After all, Sakura's heart belonged to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Said Naruto, interrupting the long silence. \"How are things with you and Sasuke going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura fidgeted around uncomfortably. She had a feeling she knew where this conversation was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Things are going just fine...The date on Saturday was fun.\" She tried to end the topic then and there with a definitive positive remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, where did you guys go again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichimaru's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started to sense the awkwardness of the moment he had created and replied with a simple. \"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful for an end to his probing of information, Sakura tried to change the subject to relieve the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...What does Kakashi need us for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't say. Mentioned something about a mission though, it sucks. Here I thought we had the day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura laughed slightly, she was picturing Naruto spending his day off slurping down ramen at the bar. The look on his face suggested that it was probably exactly what he had in mind for today, only to be rudely cut off by their teacher's urgent request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...Listen to Kakashi at all?\" Asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...He said some stuff about saying good bye to people. You know...The war...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look in Naruto's eyes changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Naruto. I'm sure this is all just a scare. Rumors from other countries to shake up the village. I've never even heard of a Land of War. And they're going around rampaging the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...Look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people around them all had a depressed look in their eyes. It was as if someone had told each of them that it was their last day on earth. Not a cheery person in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever see so many sad faces in your life? What if this is real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we're taking precautions with the reinforcing and training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that's my point. Kakashi's never been so serious about something before in his life. Everyone's taking this seriously. But look my point is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stopped walking at the corner of one of the busier streets of Konoha. Naruto looked at Sakura dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As corny as it sounds...I don't want to lose anyone. I've never dealt with actual lose before. I've never had someone to lose before. It...It scares me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura tried to smile and reassure the blond ninja. \"No one's going to die Naruto. We're all going to get through this, whatever it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I hope you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued walking then, Naruto somewhat relieved but still confused. It felt like he had a brick weight in his chest. The thought of never seeing one of his long sought friends again was...horrifying. Sakura looked back briefly at the city streets behind him and blinked for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...\" She thought to herself. \"Why do I get the feeling that this is the last time I'll see Konoha again...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their brief talk, the two barely said a word again until they reached the roof of a building near the Hokage Monument. There Sasuke and, to everyone's surprise, Kakashi were waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakashi-sensei?\" Asked Naruto, partially dumbfounded at his teacher's early arrival. \"What the heck are you doing here before us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarecrow ninja just sighed. \"I can be early if I desire to Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura picked the spot next to Sasuke's side. The raven haired boy nodded a hello, which was probably the friendliest greeting he could muster. Naruto sat pouting on the railings of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his throat, Kakashi spoke. \"Now then. I must apologize to all you all immediately. I know I gave you the day of to prepare yourselves for the possible battle on the horizon, but this mission was by a direct request of the Lady Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe produced a golden scroll from his pouch and summarized its contents. \"In short. Lady Tsunade is summoning several of the younger squads to track down a mysterious saboteur who's been wrecking havoc on our lumber machines. As a result to his continued assaults, the amount of resources we have is painfully limited for the war. We believe he has connections to the Land of War.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The culprit's a male?\" Asked Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, here's a picture of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi turned the scroll around so the picture was in plain sight to the ninjas. It was the same boy on all the wanted posters around the city. Sakura immediately took notice to the three large scars going across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been given the codename Scar, as his true identity is a mystery to us. Lady Tsunade believes that by scouting through the woods surround the city, we can flush him out for the more elite ninjas to take care of him. And that's where we come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it...\" Mumbled Naruto with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Kakashi-sensei.\" Said Sakura. \"Is there anything else we can go on? I mean just a name and a face won't be enough if we actually DO find him. Are there any details we should be wary of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, most details concerning his identity, including jutsu he uses, are a complete mystery to us. All we know is that his weapon of choice is a long silver staff and he tends to use nature-based attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a tree-hugging forest hippie.\" Said Naruto, smacking his fist together. \"We can take him easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky bonehead.\" Replied Sasuke. \"Remember he's been able to avoid capture of the entire village for days now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Said Kakashi, folding up the scroll. \"Which is why I want you three to be extra careful when we head into the woods. Remember, if he is a member of the Land of War we will no next to nothing on how to confront him. If you run into him alone, don't fight him. Find the rest of us. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" All three of them replied at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We set off for the forest in one hour. Pack any necessities and meet me at the gates.\"</span></div></div>",

More importantly, it was big. No, big was an understatement. The forest of Konoha was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spanned a good several hundred miles in any given direction from the gates of Konoha, making it one of the largest woodlands on the entire continent. There had to be virtually millions of hiding places for this boy of the woods to lurking in. He could be anywhere, watching their every move or miles away. That first thought unnerved Sakura slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The forests are huuuuge though.\"</i> Whined an image of Naruto from ten minutes ago. <i>\"How the heck are we even supposed to find this guy?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kakashi image in her head sighed. <i>\"I never said the Hokage expected us to be successful. In fact, I hope none of us find this boy, he sounds out of your league. Just keep your eyes peeled. The forests are difficult to navigate and there was an attack the other day. He probably hasn't strayed too far from the village yet...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed herself slightly. \"I really hope Kakashi was wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke had tried his best to create a significant distance between him and his teammates. After splitting up from the others at the gates, he promised to himself that he'd be the one to find this kid. There was a thirst to prove himself, a feeling he hadn't had since the Chunin Exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If you run into him alone, don't fight him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah.\" Said Sasuke to himself. \"He probably just wants all the glory to himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke hopped tree to tree, he sensed someone else tailing him from behind though he pretended not to notice. Instead, he casually made his way into his kunai pouch to grab a handful of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaa!\" He yelled, tossing the kunai with all his might at the person behind him in the overhead of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several loud thunks followed by a loud \"Gah!\" The person tailing him screamed and feel through the leaves, Sasuke caught a glimpse of an orange jacket before the person disappeared under the tree trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, the raven haired ninja bounced down to the ground to make sure his teammate was alright. Naruto had fallen roughly twenty feet and landed right on his head. A large bump was comically standing him up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives Sasuke!? Why the knives!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could ask the same question, you idiot. Why are you following me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh, isn't it obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it were obvious I wouldn't be asking the question...What kind of teammates sneaks up his own teammate anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're after the guy in the woods, aren't you!?\" Naruto changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're supposed to be after him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you want to fight him, right!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's of no concern to you.\" Sasuke turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakashi said no to fight him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you have the same thing on your mind anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's...That's not the point! Shouldn't you be careful!? Sakura's probably worried sick about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're so worried about her, Naruto, then why don't you go follow her around instead of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you two dating!? Huh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke paused slightly. \"...It's of no concern to you. Get lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke jumped back up to the tree branches and started continuing further into the forest but Naruto had the chance to get up and follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...I like that one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's a cute one. I haven't seen a real woman in months...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young too. Talk about luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh. I'm getting excited just thinking about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we make our entrance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the longest time now, Sakura had the sinking feeling that she was indeed being watched. It didn't help with the fact that forest seemed to get only darker and darker the further she traveled into it. As before, the rain continued to fall contributing to the creepy feeling that was building up in her gut like the feeling of vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing danger, Sakura tried to move faster. Someone was definitely out there. Out of the corner of her eye she noticed a large dark shadow moving from tree to tree. Then there was another one to her left. Then behind her. She was surrounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH! CLANG! CLANG! Two kunai knife that had been throw at Sakura gracefully bounced off her own knife. But the defensive position meant she had to stop moving, if only for a brief second. That was all the large shadow on her right needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mountain of a man, wearing a black suit and dark sunglasses came charging out of the trees, directly over Sakura. She didn't see his shadow until it was far too late. Her body slammed into her, taking her on a long trip down to the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura counted the time it took for both of them to land on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree sec-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! She felt herself landing harder then she expected. The sharp pain in the side of her body suggested that she at least had broken a rib, she was also coughing up a lot of blood meaning slight internal bleeding. However, if they really wanted to kill her there, they would have done so. Meaning they wanted something from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lookie her! This girl's a tough one.\" Said the giant man, holding Sakura up with one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had reached for another kunai knife and stabbed the man hard in his overly muscular arm. It amounted to little more then a paper cut for the giant as he giggled slightly and tightened his grip. Sakura couldn't breathe now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No use struggling now girlie. You're outnumbered and over powered now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried mouthing words like \"You'll get nothing out of me.\" The giant laughed, as did his comrades who had gathered around her. He slammed her hard into a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there's some misunderstanding. It's not information we want...\" All three of the men started laughing sinisterly. One of them even started to undo his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sakura really started to panic. If she could breathe she'd be yelling as loud as she could for help. It was her these men wanted. After they used her they'd probably just kill her and toss her aside. They were barbarians. Tears started rolling down her cheeks as she kicked and squirmed with all her might, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, too bad.\" Said the giant as Sakura slowly started to lose consciousness. \"I was hoping for something a bit more lively while we had our fun. She's gone and worn herself out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last thoughts turned to Sasuke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk. And here I had hoped we'd have some real fun. It's like doing it with a corpse while they're like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No different then when you do it with your wife, right Sizuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the men gave a rowdy laugh, except Sizuke of course. The giant placed the girl down on the ground and prepared to tear her clothes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who gets the first go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around. Both of his comrades were lying on the ground motionless. There was some strange web like material covering their bodies, coming out from their mouths. It appeared to look like tree roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween them and facing the giant was a small boy with wild black hair and a silver staff. A three line scar covered most of his face as he stared the giant down with his eyes under his mat of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyger Tyger. Burning bright, In the forests of the night...\" Chanted he boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant roared and charged at the boy, fists prepared to pummel him into dirt. The boy jabbed his staff into the ground once, three blades suddenly jutted out from tip of the staff. With deadly precision and quick reflexes, the boy slashed three times across the giants chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant gargled on his own blood for a brief second before collapsing on the forest floor next to his fallen comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What immortal hand or eye. Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy jabbed his staff once more into the dirt and the blades retracted. He surveyed the bodies of the three ninja and then turned his attention to Sakura's battered unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he smile His work to see? Did he who made the lamb make thee?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A million and one things were going through Sakura's head. Was she dreaming? No, if she was things would be making even less sense, and the sky would be raining rice balls or something strange like that. She hadn't been exactly unconscious when she felt the boy pick her up and carry her through the trees. But that all had to be a dream, right? He was the one they were after, the one they were out to hunt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when Sakura finally did wake up, she found herself in an unfamiliar world. She pinched herself on the cheek to make sure she hadn't strayed into some sort of dream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room she was in was more like a cave made of wood. Solid and sturdy wood, it was like someone had hollowed out a gigantic tree and created an over sized bedroom. Of course, seeing that Sakura expected that furniture would be primal looking or roughly made but such was not the case. Everything was delicately and expertly crafted, from the single stain glass window to her left to the smooth oak bed she had been sleeping in. Even the bed sheets were soft like sheep's wool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura slowly sat up and looked down at what she was wearing, a single long white shirt which appeared to made of cotton...she was wearing nothing else. Blushing, she covered herself up and looked around for her clothes; they were no where to be seen, not even on the chair across from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gritted her teeth and cursed to herself. \"Where am I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to get up, she flinched in pain. She suddenly came to the realization that there was something binding her rib cage to a splint. Had she broken her ribs? Still sitting in bed, she paused to think and remember what had happened before she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in the forest. Then there were people following her. They attacked her. They defeated her and tried to violate her. Then nothing, save for being carried through the forest by...The boy they had been after. Scar. But what had happened to the attackers? And more importantly what happened to Scar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura continued to grumble insults to herself as she pulled herself out of bed. Easier said then done with a few broken ribs, it felt like her insides were rubbing against each other. Eventually though, with a bit of time and patience, she managed to pull herself to the edge of the bed. It was there she discovered another surprise, two soft pink slippers waiting at the floor of the bed. Everything was just almost too perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's all this about?\" She muttered as she kicked the slippers slightly, expecting a rabid animal to jump out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing happened, she just sighed and diligently obeyed the strange presence of the footwear by slipping them on. Standing up proven to be an even greater challenging then sitting up. But after cracking her bones slightly, Sakura was able to stand on her wobbly two feet and hobbled her way to the door which was cracked open slightly. It seemed like someone had set everything up just so, knowing exactly how she would react when she woke up. Worse, she felt like she was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she put such ominous thoughts to the back of head and continued limping to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened with an ear shattering creak, Sakura expected that anyone around would hear it. But when she looked out into the next room, she was greeted with a rather discouraging sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stairs...\" Her shoulders drooped slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a ring of stairs, in fact, long and winding going all the way up at least three stories. Sakura groaned and braced herself for the long climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax...\" She told herself. \"Just take this nice and easy...Right foot...Left foot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile talking comforted herself, she still winced in agony after every step was made. At least the sights around her were beautiful, if she would pause from her ordeal and looked up from her feet. Following the stairs up was an array of wooden statues, each carved as a powerful looking animal like a bear or a tiger. The statues were also expertly done and ranged in age as Sakura ascended the stairs. Eventually when she finally did reach the top, there were several empty pedestals left. At the top of the stairs was a large hickory door with the only piece of metal in the entire place so far severing as it's handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura breathed in and out with a mixture of relief and exhaustion. Her ribs felt smashed to bits and her body ached. How wounded was she exactly? She didn't have a mirror to take a look at herself nor did she have time to look down and inspect her body. Sweat dripped down her arms as she reached out and pulled the old door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Sakura expected something grand like a large dining hall or a magnificent throne room. Instead, the view was a thousand times more beautiful. The Konoha forest lay out in front of, more open and pristine then she could ever imagine in. Bits of dew made the millions of trees sparkle like dimaonds as the sun rose in the distance, it was morning of the next day already. The door had lead to a balcony looking over the grand woods. And standing on that balcony front of her was the boy on the wanted poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" Began Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turned, his eyes invisible under his mat of hair. \"I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence between the two as the morning wind spoke for them with its usual whistling tune. Sakura was unsure of what to say to this boy, had he rescued her? She wasn't sure, but he did not appear to be hostile. Her eyes turned to her feet and then to the boy's scar, which had to serve as his eyes considering she couldn't see them to look into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled warmly. \"I don't know. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blinked in confusion. \"You...You don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the boy pretended not to hear her second question and didn't answer, he seemed far more eager for a reply to his own question. Sakura sighed and gave him her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura. Sakura Haruno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it is nice to have a name to your face Sakura. Well done on getting up with your injuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura winched in pain slightly at the word. \"Was...I hurt that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much so, though nothing life threatening. Two broken ribs, a few dozen bruises around your neck, and plenty of minor scratches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you...Rescue me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then thank you....Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at her with confusion. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I...Uh...Don't know what to call you...You don't have a name?\" She returned to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I don't know who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...You said it yourself, it's nice to have a name to a face...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, it must be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura huffed. He was being difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me whatever you wish. It doesn't matter who am I, it's what I am that defines me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And...What are you, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A protector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...You aren't from the Land of War?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Land of War?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you know...I think...Those guys who attacked me...They were from the Land of War...The ones you saved me from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blinked in surprise. \"You...You didn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy took a step forward towards her. \"No, I recruited you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That was the last time Sakura had any sort of vocal communication with the boy for a few days. Mostly, they just kept to themselves as Sakura's wounds slowly recovered. Though that may have seemed difficult, it was rather easy for Sakura to go for hours without even seeing the boy, the tree-building they were in was so large you could walk around for what felt like miles and not come across the same room twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in her condition Sakura had little time or energy to be walking around. Her ribs were still greatly injured, so much so that it hurt just to sit up at times. The boy seemed to understand this, though Sakura never complained about it, and left herbal medicine packets and some crutches at her bedside. Aside from that, he showed no interest in Sakura at all. She'd often ponder why he even brought her to his hideout to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, I recruited you.\"</i> That last words he said to her. What did he mean that he recruited her? Why would someone deliberately take in someone who had been actively hunting them? He seemed fully aware that Sakura had been looking for him, she found a crumpled wanted poster of him at the base of the stairs after all. And yet, he had rescued her from certain death and even treated her wounds. Nothing made sense with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fourth day, Sakura woke up once again probably at around midday. She noticed that the door in the corner of the room was opened slightly, had the boy been visiting? Rubbing the sand out of her eyes, she looked around the room for signs of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she saw it, in the corner of the room gnawing on a pillow roughly the size of her was a striped tiger easily twice the size as a normal one. It was glaring her at right with a look of death in its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was still hurt and bedridden, with no way to defend herself. What choice did she have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could stir a hornet's nest a mile away with a scream like that.\" Said the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that thing doing in my room! I almost had a freaking heart attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was safe and sound back at the balcony of the tree again. After she had screamed, the boy had burst into the room and carried her to safety. Of course, Sakura was still just a little freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had lured him in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...What!? Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see how you would react.\" The boy had a completely straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see how- I could have been mauled to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't have harmed you until you started shouting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I get it okay! I can tell just by looking around here that you're close to nature and everything but you put a giant tiger in the same room I was sleeping in! I'm lucky I didn't wake up dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stared at her blankly. He then closed his eyes for a bit longer then a standard blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not like you, okay!? I'm thankful that you saved me from those guys, but I must return home! There are people who are probably worried about me and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...\" Said the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be listening for something, like someone was whispering in his ears. Sakura couldn't hear anything though, she gave him a puzzled and angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty miles, north east...\" Muttered the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're back. Come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning or responding, the boy grabbed her by the wrist. He pulled her off the balcony as both of them descended into the thicket of the forest below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had long ago lost where she was. All the forest began to look the same at some point, she could have sworn they had passed the same trees tens times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the look in the boy's eye suggested that he knew exactly where he was going. Like an animal obeying a distance call, he honed in on some invisible noise in the air, dragging Sakura along with him. He was carrying her piggyback styled, to avoid further injuring her. And Sakura could tell that he was being extra careful with each jump from branch to branch he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only ten minutes into their journey when Sakura finally ask. \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To watch what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he didn't respond after ten jumps from the tree branches, Sakura became impatient and shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you please stop being such a mystery!? Where are we going!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see the sins of our labors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't exactly answer her question, but she kept quiet out of frustration. Talking to this guy was like talking to a water wheel, it seemed to always go around in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to a sudden halt, Sakura snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold, on the dull earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked over his shoulder. Instead of miles of forest as there would normally be, she saw a virtual wasteland of fallen timber and ripped up stumps. Every area she laid her eyes on had the feel of loss and destruction. What was worse, a large steel machine was still hard at work tearing up the rest of the forest. Sakura could make out several people from Konoha walking along the sides of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are they...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the boy didn't answer and instead gently let her down on the tree branch. He watched with a solemn look on his face but otherwise did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took a closer look at the forests the machine was cutting into. Animals who had long made their homes in the grand trees were scrambling like mad to escape the butchering. Sakura tugged the boy on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to do something!? They're destroying the homes of those animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I care! Can't you stop them!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but that's not the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura watched in horror as one young lion got separated from its mother, the large grinding wheels of the machines violently snapped the trees closer and closer to the poor animal. She turned away, the lion didn't get away in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a serious look in the boy's eyes. \"What are YOU going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gritted her teeth and looked at the machine. Maybe if she ran up to them, maybe if she explained what kind of damage they were doing to the woods they'd stop. Without thinking rationally, she jumped from the tree and landed hard on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain in her ribs was excoriating, but she ran out into the fields of fallen lumber. She didn't stop until she reached the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP IT! YOU'RE KILLING THOSE ANIMALS! STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever was operating the machine didn't hear her, and the others walking next to it just ignored her and continued with gathering up the bits of leftover wood. She had to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another example of irrational thinking, she started climbing up the wheels. If she could just jam something into the gears, it might be enough to halt the machine so that Sakura could explain what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she had probably undone the healing a few days of rest had done for her ribs but she didn't care. She was too focused with reaching the top of the wheel. So focused that she didn't see that the fabric of her skirt had gotten caught in the spokes of the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she felt herself get yanked right off the wheel. She was getting pulled into the grinders! There was no safe place for her to grab, no way to pull herself free! The grinders were inches away from her head. She closed her eyes and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the ripping of fabric, Sakura felt herself getting carried away to safety. She opened her eyes... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How did I get talked into this one again...?\" Muttered Sakura as she stepped out into the freezing cold winter day. It was so cold out in Konoha today that the frost felt like it was biting her uncovered nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's weather wasn't helping with her bad mood either. Most teams got their missions canceled today, on account of terrible and dangerous weather. Seriously, in some areas of the Land of Fire the snow was said to be up as high as seven feet. But Lady Tsunade apparently had a special mission for her, JUST her. And it being the Hokage, how could Sakura refuse? Naruto, Sasuke, and Kakashi all got the day off and were probably spending it enjoying hot springs or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no one out on the streets today, save for the occasional shop keeper desperately trying to shovel the snow off their sidewalk. It wasn't long before Sakura stood in front of the Hokage's tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, Sakura was greeted with a blast of heat which caused her to sweat under her massive coat and winter gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an angry voice on the other side of the Hokage office door. \"Lady Tsunade, are all these heaters necessary? I mean we're wasting power! What will the villagers think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Shizune. It's nearly thirty below out there! Everyone is trying to do whatever they can to keep warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura knocked on the door. \"End of discussion Shizune, come in whoever that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeekly, the pink haired ninja stepped into the office. \"Ah, Sakura! Just the person I was expecting! Come in, come in! Have a seat! Shizune, get us some hot cocoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune mumbled something about \"wasting the villager's money\" but did as she was told. Tsunade was wrapped in a giant green blanket covering her pajamas, apparently Shizune had to drag her out of bed today. She must hated the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to bother you on a day like today Sakura. Actually yours and Team Guy's missions are the only ones I have assigned today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Guy? Why? What are they doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they're off to some tropical island helping a rich elderly woman babysit her pet cat for a week. Normally I would only give that sort of job to some wet-behind-the-ears Genin, but Guy insisted that his team needed the time on the island for some training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training my butt...\" Thought Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway!\" Said Tsunade, sipping a cup of hot chocolate. \"Onto your mission. Are you aware what the temperature is outside, Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Minus Thirty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! There hasn't been a day colder than today in years. Konoha has seen the arrival of some new wildlife over the last few days; animals that probably haven't been around these parts for centuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stood up and looked out her office window at the winter wonderland. \"One group of rare polar bears, the Momoiro Polar Bears, have made their first appearance in the Land of Fire in probably two hundred years. These bears are extremely gifted. Their rare pink hides are worth a fortune on the black market. And they're actually extremely intelligent. In fact they have created natural cures for diseases that outclass some of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was beginning to dread where this mission was going. \"So...You want me to observe these bears?\" Sitting on her butt in the freezing cold watching a bunch of overweight bear was not something she was looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smiled. \"Not...exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these bears are extremely cautious and territorial. Getting near them through normal methods has proved fruitless. But we believe we may have found a solution. And since you're my apprentice and all, I thought there would be no better person I could trust with this than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting near the bears without the usual spying methods? \"What do you mean, a solution?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

When one wears the suit and activates the transformation jutsu, their body takes the exact physiology of a Momoiro bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lady Tsunade, why not get Jonin to do this mission, if you don't mind my asking.\" Tsunade's youngest apprentice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During the testing period, we found that the wearer's natural hair color will become their fur color in bear form. Initially Shizune tried, but was rejected due to her coloration. That's why we need you, your hair color matches the bear's exactly.\" Tsunade said, looking at a somewhat embarrassed Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could see that this was important to Tsunade, and even though she wanted to stay warm, she knew duty came first to a shinobi. \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smirked \"Good, your mission begins....\"</span></div></div>",

I mean I'm completely prepared now...I think...\" Actually becoming a bear wasn't something Sakura felt she was up to. But she knew her duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade rubbed her head and blushed. \"Well...The thing is this suit isn't exactly easy to get in and out of. It's not dangerous, but the process takes time to prepare for the next wearer and allow the current one to leave the suit. In fact Shizune just spent all of yesterday as a bear, we just got her out of it this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding...\" Come to think of it, Sakura seemed to recall seeing Tsunade walking around talking to a bear in her office yesterday. But she just assumed it was something she summoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Shizune looked somewhat annoyed. \"Not my finest moment, but yes I did spend yesterday as a bear. You don't have to worry about being cold Sakura. It's like wearing a fur coat for every part of your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade laughed and put her hand on Sakura's shoulder. \"You see! Nothing to be worried about, right Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not nervous.\" That was a complete lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good. Here's the plan then. Be here by sunrise tomorrow morning and we'll fit you into the suit. We have plenty of time, this blizzard isn't expected to leave Konoha for another two weeks. But still, the more time you can spend with those bears the more you help the village. Okay Sakura? We're counting on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the wind howled outside as the snow continued to fall. Bits of frost clung to the windows as Sakura, still wide awake, watched from the covers of her bed. She had spent the entirety of her day doing stuff she wouldn't be able to do for at least half a month. This wasn't like the normal week a way missions she used to go on. She was actually going to become an animal and live out in the wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what she said earlier to Lady Tsunade, she was nervous. Very nervous. Maybe it would be one thing if the animals she was observing were squirrels or something harmless. But these were giant bears, that could probably eat her feet off if they really wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the matter of the suit and if it would really work or not. Lady Shizune tested it and said it worked fine, but what if there was the slim chance something went wrong? What if she was stuck as a bear for the rest of her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook it off and closed her eyes. \"Don't be a coward. What would Sasuke or Naruto do? You gotta be brave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade yawned, she looked terrible. \"Morning Sakura...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, good morning Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune! Is the suit ready yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Shizune was in the corner looking over what appeared to be a giant brown rug. \"Lady Tsunade, please. I know it's early but show some patience. It will be ready in just a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed and asked Sakura again. \"Nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura couldn't lie, her heart was pounding. \"A little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grinned. \"Don't worry, it's just for a couple of weeks. We've tested this thing dozens of times and have yet to get any errors. Smile a little and make the best of it.\"</span></div></div>",

Her transforming body still remained a bipedal form, as the suit began to fuse with her human body. The fur color changed from a dirty brown to a  bright pink. Her legs began to thicken up with a lot of muscle &amp; blubber, as her feet changed into that of a Momoiro Bear's hind paws. The transformation progressed further on her body, as her waist, hips, &amp; butt gained blubber on then, as a Momoiro bear's tail grew  above her large furry rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her upper body, she began to change up there as well. Her organs expanded to accommodate for her new body structure. However, Sakura's suit began to delevop a large set of breasts, which were in the Double J-cup range, bigger than Tsunade's own rack due to Sakura's new body. But as for her belly, Sakura began to develop a blubbery pot belly that stuck out 2 to 3 feet from her bear body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms and hands were bear-like, as her hands were like the paws of a Momoiro Bear, since bears have 5 fingers instead of 4 like a dog or wolf. But the 5th finger on each hand still remained as bear-like thumbs. Her arms were thick with both muscles &amp; fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as for her head, Sakura's head grew to fit on her new frame, but her face elongated about 4 inches to accommodate with her new body. Luckily, Sakura's human hair grew in, as it grew longer in the back , but still had the same hairstyle she always had as a human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the transformation was done, Sakura was no longer human, as she looked at herself to see her new body. While standing upright, Sakura was only 9 feet &amp; 7 inches all in height, weighing in around 1300 pounds in muscle &amp; blubber. However, despite her new height, Sakura now had to lower her head to see her mentor, since her body now towered over Tsunade &amp; the others.</span></div></div>",

Then yes, I'm fine.\" But as the other technicians got up from the massive blast of chairs, Tsunade noticed Sakura's new form &amp; became both intrigued &amp; worried for Sakura, as she said, \"Interesting. Very interesting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do mean 'interesting'?\" Sakura asked, as she question her mentor's intrigue on her transformation. Then, Tsunade slowly circled the Ursine Sakura, as she answered, \"Your transformation, Sakura. Momoiro Bears are known to be fully bipedal like humans. However, the suit was designed to be more like that of a regular animal walking on four legs &amp; all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then circled toward the front of Sakura &amp; continued speaking, as she said, \"...And yet for some miraculous reason, the suit fused with your body &amp; made you a Momoiro Bear, without making you a feral bear yourself.\" Tsunade was right about one thing; Sakura was still herself, even though she now had the body of a Momoiro Bear. However, for some odd reason, Sakura somewhat liked being a Momoiro Bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then had a chakra technician head up to a mobile lift, as he drove it toward Sakura. The Ursina Sakura turned her head &amp; saw the chakra technician on the mobile lift approach her, then she looked back at Tsunade as she said, \"Um, Lady Tsunade..What is he doing?\" \"Don't worry about him, Sakura.

The zipper was still there, fully zipped up, as Tsunade yelled, \"Is the suit's zipper still on her?\" Kyono only spread his right arm out with a thumbs up, as he then stopped doing the thumbs up and focused on trying to pull down the zipper handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was where he hits a wall; the zipper handle was stuck, so Kyono started pulling harder on the zipper handle, hoping to getting it working again. However, as Kyono was tugging on the jammed zipper handle, Sakura could feel it, as if the technician was pulling on her spine, each tug on the zipper handle becoming more painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing patience, Tsunade then yelled, \"What's taking so long, Kyono? I thought unzipping these suits are easy!\" \"They are, Lady Tsunade. It's just that somehow this zipper handle is jammed up!\" Kyono answered, as he pulled harder on the zipper handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Kyono pulled harder on the zipper handle, Sakura felt the skin &amp; fur on her upper back being heavily tugged on by Kyono trying to get the zipper open. That was from the tugging that Sakura the Momoiro Bear quickly realized something was very wrong, as she thought, \"Wait a sec..The zipper? Something's gone wrong!\" But then, out of nowhere.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRIIIIIPP!!!!! Kyono managed to get the zipper &amp; zipper handle to come off, but not without taking a large bit of flesh from Sakura's Ursine body. \"OOOWWRRROOOAAAARRR!!!\" Sakura shrieked, as her own scream of pain sounded like a mix between her human scream &amp; a Momoiro Bear's roar. Then, Kyono quickly looked at Sakua's wound &amp; realized that the zipper fused with her new body, as he saw what appeared to be Sakura's Ursine spine seen visibly in between her muscles. In slight anger, she grabbed Kyono by his right leg &amp; threw him right through a wall, as he landed on the snow outside.</span></div></div>",

Lady Shizune was right, this thing WAS warm. Tsunade had a perplexed look on her face though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. It's taking longer than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura began to panic. \"What? This that bad!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's probably just because we...hadn't tested it on a smaller subject. I don't think it matters though, look the first step is done. It will start to take in your chakra now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud click as the suit warmed up. Sakura felt her chakra flow gently out from her body and into the furry suit. It was empowering it; making it almost a living entity. Her hands were beginning to feel like she was holding onto a hot coal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? It's moving onto step two.\" Said Tsunade. \"Look at your arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown bear fur looked almost like it was lighting up on fire. But really it was changing its color from dirt brown to bubblegum pink, the color of her hair. In a mere matter of moments the entire suit had recolored itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade and Shizune took a few steps back to give her some room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sakura.\" Said Shizune, using the most calming voice she had. \"This part is going to feel really weird. The suit is going to use your chakra to reshape your entire body. Everything from your bones to your body fat is going to be molded into a polar bear's form. Try not to freak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said than done. Almost instantly, Sakura felt a tingling feeling work its way all through her body. She was beginning to feel bloated while at the same time more powerful. Inside her body, the chakra was supercharging her muscles as well as increasing her fat. The changes were hardly noticeable at first. But eventually a slight potbelly began to appear under the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sakura was distracted with her increasing waistline, another subtle change was occurring with her bones. They were lengthening and becoming stronger. Bit by bit Sakura's height and width were expanding. Before she even knew it, she was taller than Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on two legs was getting strange, Sakura tried taking a step but would have fell on the ground were it not for Shizune and Tsunade catching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Sakura.\" Said Tsunade. \"You'd best not try to walk, polar bears aren't exactly balanced on two feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura understood why that had given her room earlier, balancing was getting really difficult. As she grew and grew, new changes made an appearance on her body. She felt a little nub jut out from her backbone, which she presumed was her new tail. Her jaw felt a little further away from her face than before as well. She was a good head taller than both of the woman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she just couldn't balance anymore and landed on all fours with a rumbling thud. It was strange because she didn't feel heavy enough to shake the entire building, it must have been all her new muscles relieving the weight of the fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling began to fade as the finishing touches of the transformation turned her completely into a polar bear. It didn't feel like she was wearing a suit at all. And the new strength as size was...oddly invigorating. Lady Tsunade walked up to her massive pink form and examined something on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything seems to check out...Anatomy perfect. Muscle strength adequate. Suit lock-up...Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat \"Uh oh\" made Sakura feel like she was standing outside in the freezing cold, naked. Uh oh was not good. And what did suit lock-up mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsuande...\" Sakura was surprised she could still speak. \"W-what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...It looks like your small size was a factor in the process. I guess the suit used up so much energy shaping you into a bear at your child-like size that it seized up. Don't worry though, it should be reversible when we get the hardware team to look at it. Hopefully, it's nothing to severe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully!?\" Thought Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But maybe it would be best if we canceled the mission. Your safety as a village ninja is more important than research. It's up to you if you want to go through with this, I'll talk to some of the elders and explain what happened.\" Tsunade sighed. She and the village elders never did see eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Sakura was screaming to cancel the mission and get this thing off of her as soon as possible. But at the same time she would have felt extremely guilty at not only letting her village down but giving Lady Tsunade further problems with the elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. What should she do?</span></div></div>",

This polar bear was just gigantic, she heard of some bears reaching heights of over fifteen feet tall when standing on both legs in the north. But she had never expected to actually see one. For once, she was thankful that she too was a large bear; that thing would tower over her if she was in human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura wasn't quite sure how to approach this monster. Lady Tsunade had apparently left out that tiny detail. Chances are if she just ran over to it and said \"Hello! Nice to meet you!\" she'd end up mauled to death. But if she didn't act quickly, she'd miss her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I just calmly walk over to it, it will notice me...\" She thought to herself. Taking a deep breath, she tried to encourage herself. \"Come on...Don't chicken out now. The village is counting on you to do this. You gave Tsuande your word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she still had human knees, they're be shaking. She approached the beast as quietly as she could, hopefully it would go away and not notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck. When Sakura was a good few yards away from the bear, it seemed to sense her and spun around. There was blood-thirst in its eyes. Every nerve in her body was telling Sakura \"Get the hell out of there!\", but she couldn't move. Her legs were frozen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Sakura's horror, the bear was moving closer to her. It's two foot long head was directly in front of her face, she could feel the hot steam funneling out of its nose. It was sniffing her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me...Please don't eat me...Please don't eat me...\" Sakura chanted in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression changed on the bear's face. It took a few steps back and stood up on it's hind legs. Oh no! Bears only did that when they were really, REALLY angry. There was no way to outrun it, Sakura closed her eyes and waited to feel a stinging swipe of its paw. But then the polar bear did the last thing she would have expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started laughing. Not like grunting or growling, but actual laughter! It raised a paw to wipe the tears out of its eyes. That's when it said it a loud male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harharharhar! Hello there girlie! You're not here after my hide, are you!? And stuck like that...What did you lose a bet!? Harharharhar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever before had Sakura felt such a mixture of shock and relief. A bear, that had moments ago been walking on four legs like a beast, was actually talking to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...You can speak...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harhar! Of course I can! What, is this your first day being a bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry girl! Just by looking at you I can tell what happened. You're human, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cover was blown already. \"H-how did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great bear shook his head. \"Mannerisms, smell, lack of knowledge...You don't make a very good spy my dear. But don't worry, I'm not going to do anything barbaric like kill you. If anything I'm perplexed as to why the humans are so keen on getting information by having one of their own disguise themselves as one of us. Explain, if you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was starting to get more comfortable around the bear. He wasn't trying to kill her earlier, it was just self defense. Clearly these bears harbored no love for humans, Sakura recalled Tsunade saying that their hides fetched a high price on the black market...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'matter?\" Asked the bear. \"Come now, I already told you I won't bite. Oh right, you humans tend to be more civil in your introductions. Very well then. Name's Ichikuma, I'm the leader of a local sloth of my brethren. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura Haruno...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, eh? That's a fitting name for one of our kind. Shame you aren't a true Momoiro! Harharhar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation warmed up a bit after that, as Sakura began her tale of how she got in this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, both of them had sat down in the snow as Sakura finished her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so they've sent you out here to learn you say? If you weren't standing in front of my own two eyes now I wouldn't believe it. You humans have never tried to learn from us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you can't have met many decent humans than?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say I have.\" Ichikuma lifted one claw and pointed at a jagged scar going down his face. \"That was from the last time I let my guard down around a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gulped. \"W-why do you trust me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, firstly from you story you got yourself stuck like this just to learn from us. I'd be dishonoring the Momoiro if I just turned you away after you endured so much. And second...\" He stared deep into her emerald eyes. \"...You remind me of someone I knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant polar bear stood and motioned for her to do the same. \"Come. I'll introduce you to the 'clan'.\"</span></div></div>",

She was on her eight cup of hot chocolate already, and just by looking outside you'd never know this was the the Land of Fire. More like the Land of Sleet and Ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not the chilly weather that put her in the sudden chocolate beverage craze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade.\" Spoke Shizune, as she sat down next to her mistress. \"Please relax. Sakura is a trained ninja of Konoha, she'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not nervous.\" Answered Tsunade, absentmindedly tossing the clay cup over her shoulder. \"Have you spoken to the tech team in charge of fixing the suit when Sakura returns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune sighed. \"Of course, but they won't be able to find out what's wrong with it until they can physically take a look at it. If you're so nervous about Sakura's well-being why did you even let her go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again. I'm not nervous. Though you say it like I had a choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune blinked several times. \"You gave the option to choose otherwise didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty Hokage closed her eyes and smirked. \"Those were just words. You saw her eyes. She has the thrust to prove herself. Even if she mentally didn't want to do it, her heart had already made up its mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind howled harder as the snow slanted sideways in its fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, Sasuke, and even Sakura...They're all like us when we were their age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whacha got there boy?\" Grunted A tall dark man. He was covered in fur and pelts of different animals. Judging by his beard and smell, he hadn't shaved or bathed in weeks. A long silver rifle muzzle peaked over his shoulders as he leaned over to his giant hunting dog, which was sniffing tracks in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blim'me. Two of 'em. So far away from 'er safe 'ome too.\" The massive man put his hand on his chin, making a crude thinking gesture. \"Doubt we'll catch 'em today though. Ah well. Good job, boy. E'll rest er for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, come Sakura! See here?\" Ichikuma pointed a single white oak tree with pink petals still resisting the winter frost. \"This is the entrance to a world you've probably never known existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not yet accustomed to walking on all fours, Sakura finally caught up to the massive polar bear. \"It's a tree...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tree,\" Chuckled the great bear. \"Quite. But open your eyes, girl. See clearly as one of us would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura squinted at the oak and tried focusing on it. After a few seconds of nothing, she was about to give up. Then suddenly, the tree changed. It was like it evaporated almost, it danced in the snow before becoming something else entirely. A cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't understand. Was that just an illusion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harhar! No, nothing so complex. You merely weren't looking hard enough and didn't notice it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...\" Stammered Sakura. \"That doesn't make any sense! There had to be an illusion or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did there have to be? Or is that just what you humans feel is the natural thing to presume?\" The cave entrance appeared to have stairs leading down, which Ichikuma started walking down. \"This is what we've never understood about you humans. You're so quick to judge the world and define it by your own clauses. Then when something extraordinary comes along, you discredit it. You call it impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took that as a que to continue following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sad that you people are so closed minded. I suppose that's the biggest difference between you and us. But hopefully,\" He turned back to face her. \"You'll learn something during your stay with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled slightly. \"That's what I intend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned her grin. \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'stairs' down into the cave seemed almost man made, the way they were crafted. Sakura was beginning to feel this wasn't so much as a bear cave as it was a bear's home. It was what was at the bottom of the stairs that really amazed Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like a city, only caveman style. The stairs opened up into an underground cavern with separate bear caves lined in the walls. At the center was a grand pit with a massive bonfire and bones of animals. There had to be a hundred of the polar bears, communicating with each other and going about what appeared to be normal day business. Sakura noticed there were several other stairways in the sides of the walls, there had to be an entire network of these caves underground! No wonder no one had ever been able to find these bears before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchikuma stepped into the crowd. \"Shall we, Sakura?\"</span></div></div>",

'if he can get over what humans did to him, then why can't the other bears?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura?\" her host asked. \"You've been quiet for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing, I'd be glad to come and stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarred bear smiled. \"Well come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them entered to find a stony floor with intricate, tile like carvings. Nearby was a smooth, spiral stair case that presumably lead upstairs. To the right, there was a threshold that led to the dining room, a small pool of water within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cubs! We have a guest.\" Ichikuma cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really uncle Ichi?\" a young boyish voice asked. Shortly after hearing it, Sakura saw it's owner, and two other bear cubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one that spoke was small, probably the bear equivalent of a 9 year old. He was rather thin, but his eyes sparkled mischeviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a bear about Sakura's size. The fur on it's head was long and well maintained, and styled into two small buns. Her eyes shined with sincere kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally there was a bear so dark pink he was nearly red. Everything about him reminded Sakura of a certain avenger she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this girl?\" The deep pink one asked, even his voice was like Sasuke's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sakura, she'll be staying with us for awhile.\" Ichikuma explained. \"Sakura, these are my sister's cubs, Koji, Chira, and Kusase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you all.\" Sakura said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked to Ichikuma for some sort of reaction, but alas he gave an expressionless face. Did she offend them? Was a bow considered taboo or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of waiting, the smallest cub walked up to her and sniffed up at her face. He gave her what could only be described as a smile and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell nice...Like flowers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed slightly, she'd never gotten compliment like that before, even as a human. \"U-um...Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Koji!\" Said the female bear, as she batted him over the head with her massive paw. \"You'd say that to a complete stranger but not your own sister!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller bear was being pressed down to the ground by his sister's strength. He peaked his snout out from her paw and mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cause you smell like poo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently she heard him. \"Poo!? Why you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had to hold a laugh as the two of them tumbled over each, playfully biting and clawing at each other. Ichikuma didn't seem too phased by their squabble, and was instead interested with the darker haired male who turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi. Kusase. Don't be rude, introduce yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not interested.\" Came a muttered reply, he continued up the stairs with his back to both of them. Sakura shivered, he had a terrible cold shoulder. A lot like a teammate she was in love with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchikuma sighed. \"I'll never understand that boy...My apologizes Sakura. As you can see, like humans, we too have our unfriendly types.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" Sakura said under her breath. \"He reminds me of someone I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing. You have a nice family Ichikuma-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he turned his attention to other cubs, fighting with each other still on the floor. \"Thank you, now. Children! Enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, they both got off of each other and snapped to attention. Then they stood in a line like a bunch of well trained soldiers, while Ichikuma paced around them like the strict drill sergeant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Introduce yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smallest bear was the first to speak. \"I'm Koji!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl. \"I'm Chira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now that that's settled. Sakura will need a place to stay for a month or so. Considering Kusase still has an attitude problem, one of you are going to have to give up a portion of their room. Which of you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, me!\" Said Chira before her uncle could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair Chira! You answered before Uncle Ichi could say anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now Koji.\" Answered Ichikuma. \"Maybe it's for the best for the two girls to share a room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira stuck her tongue out at the cub as he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never get to do anything fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not sleep over in Kusase's room tonight then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he's always such a grouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sensed they were about to get into an argument, so did Chira. The bear nudged Sakura in the side and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst. They're going to be at this for awhile. Let's go up to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira's room continued to amaze Sakura at the feats these mere polar bears had accomplished. The bedroom was like something out of an ice palace, filled with crystals and beautiful. Everything appeared to be made out of ice, including the furniture. But when she gently touched it, it gave off a warm sensation. Chira jumped up on a low rise bed, perplexed at her new roommate's interest in what were commonplace items to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Never seen furniture before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-err...\" Sakura tried to think of a convincing cover story. \"No...I was raised in the outside wilds. This is my first time here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're feral?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A feral. You know. From the outside? There are two classes of bears. Ferals, who chose to live on the outside like normal bears. And us, Momoiro that have advanced enough to live down here in the Safe Home. Didn't you learn that while up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...No I didn't. Ichikuma-san just found me in the forests and decided to take me here.\" She decided to be as truthful as possible. \"I had no idea this place even existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's weird. Why do you keep calling uncle Ichikuma, san? That's a human term isn't it? You're really strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh...\" Was all Sakura could answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you!\" Smiled the bear, not even letting Sakura reply. \"You can sleep over there, sorry I don't have another bed for you to stay in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at a large couch in the corner of the room, it seemed to have more than enough room for Sakura to sleep on. But because she was not yet used to her new size, perhaps not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira used her two front paws to hold up her face. \"So what do you want to do before dinner, Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd prefer to try and stay on good terms with everyone, the best I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira rolled her eyes. \"Ohhhh. I get it. You <i>like</i> him don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what!? Absolutely not! I mean, sure, he's just like-\" Sakura caught herself before spilling the beans about her human life, but Chira eyed her curiously. She continued stuttering \"That is...Uhh...I-I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liiiiike him.\" Said Chira in a sing song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"No I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira continued her taunts. \"Prove it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl bear was clearly winning this little argument. With no other choice, Sakura groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er. Are you sure being up here is safe?\" Asked Sakura, as she tiptoed on the two story ledges outside the windows of the 'cave'. No small task considering both her and Chira's size. The real polar bear didn't seem too nervous though, aside from Sakura making a lot of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, be quiet! You want Kusase to hear us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed. This must have what circus preforming bears felt like. Walking along the narrow edge on two legs was an even more daunting task when you weighed nearly a ton. As they neared a large window, Sakura heard voices in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-For the last time, Koji. You're not sleeping in my room. Now get off of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could picture the younger cub grabbing on the legs of his darker brothers, being dragged along the floor. But Chira had the entire view of the room, Sakura could only imagine what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pppppplease big brother! Chira gets to have Sakura sleep over in her room! Uncle Ichi said you'd have to let me stay in your room to make it fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't say that. Now, again, get off me. I find it disturbing that I need to ask you twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira snickered under her breath. This sort of thing had to be typical in the household. Sakura was stuck in a corner of the cave/building, and was finding a hard time seeing the humor of the situation with her holding on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! You and Chira are the biggest jerks! I'm telling Uncle Ichi on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira seemed to be having fits of laughter and whispered to Sakura. \"They're always doing that, don't look so nervous. He hasn't caught me yet doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window swung open. \"I know you're out there Chira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl bear yelped and fell off the ledge down onto the street below. Somehow, Kusase didn't seem to notice Sakura hiding in the corner. She looked down to make sure Chira was alright as Kusase huffed and slammed the window shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you okay Chira?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww...Yeah, I just landed on my butt. He didn't see you though. You can spy on him for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! I'm getting down from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\" She called back. Then the polar bear girl crept under the house, probably going back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chira...\" Sighed Sakura. This was the exact sort of thing Naruto would want to do to Sasuke. She gave a short laugh to herself and quietly moved closer to the window, trying to get a peak into Kusase's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little less nicer than Chira's. While hers seemed more fit for a princess, Kusase's was more darker and practical. There were hundreds of books and scrolls all over the place, suggesting he was a good student. Kusase was sitting on a short chair and desk, looking at something on the table. That's when Sakura heard strange noises followed by a single word, \"Mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought to herself. \"Is he...crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she couldn't get a good look at his face, she seemed to understand what was going on. She quietly turned to leave for Chira's bedroom window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whatcha see up there Sakura!?\" Asked Chira, later at dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh.\" She looked across the table at Kusase. If he had been crying, he sure didn't show it. He seemed to notice the stares he was getting and shot a quick glare at Sakura. \"I didn't see anything...He just kicked Kuji out and started reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat answer satisfied Chira's curiosity enough. \"Huh. That's so boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Ichi! Tell Kusase he's gotta let me sleep over in his room! It's not fair that Chira gets to have Sakura over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchikamu grunted as he chewed on a fish bone. \"It's up to Kusase who he wants in his room Koji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. You're welcome to stay with us Koji. If Chira let's you...\" Said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChira looked horror-struck. \"Yeah! Come on Chira! Can I! Please!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Sakura, then at Ichikuma who gave a stern look. Finally, she sighed. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Sakura was the only one awake in the room. Koji had eaten half his body weight in sugary treats and worn himself out about an hour in, he currently was snuggled up on top of Sakura's massive bear form. Chira and her had spent most of the night just talking about things. Chira was very curious about the outside world, having never been there herself. While Sakura asked questions about the culture of the Safe Home and the Momoiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been an enlightening and entertaining night, but Sakura felt at least a little bit at home at last. She played with the necklace Lady Tsunade had given her. She remembered her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just use this to call us. You should probably report in tomorrow, for now just adapt to their culture. Try to enjoy yourselves Sakura.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled to herself. Mission accomplished so far. Closing her eyes, she couldn't wait to explore around the Momoiro city after hearing so much about it from Chira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

Sakura thought, her body had returned to normal and she was wearing the fur suit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The suit must still have some bugs in it...' the pink haired teenager concluded.

It will look like a large bear's maw.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were Sakura's orders, and she was left to wander through the violent blizzard with only an over-sized bear suit and a thin layer of clothing. Navigating through the blinding snow was somewhat difficult, she could hardly see ten feet in front of her. The wind ripped at the brown fur of the suit but it was still able to make her completely warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, after wandering for what seemed like hours, a large white mountain took up the entirety of Sakura's limited field of vision. She peaked through the bear suit's eye holes to try to find the bear shaped entrance Lady Tsunade spoke of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jutting gray snout with icicles for teeth caught her eye. \"Bingo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging through the waist deep snow mounds, Sakura finally made it to the mouth of the cave. Unfortunately, there was no sign of Lady Tsunade, or anyone for that matter. The cave seemed completely abandoned though once occupied. Piles of ruffed straw and feathers were in the corner, most likely makeshift beds. There were also bones scattered all around the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down with a floppy bear hand, Sakura picked up a nearby skull to examine it. She gulped, it was a human skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura!\" Shouted a voice from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAH!\" Shrieked the genin, dropping the skull and falling to the floor. The speaker was a humanoid figure wrapped in layers of coats, scarfs, blankets, and all manner and assortments of warm clothing. It tore off the scarfs and goggles surrounding its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Tsunade! You scared me half to death!\" The pink haired ninja took several deep breathes as the Hokage chuckled and continued to remove several layers of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologizes Sakura, I thought you'd be more on guard considering where you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where I am...What do you mean my Lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed and shook her head, she was having trouble with a zipper on one of her coats. \"Oh, it doesn't matter. So tell me, the bear suit is giving you trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura lifted her heads to show the sagging material of the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...Well turn around, I'll have a look at the data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura obliged and waited patiently as Tsunade took off her gloves with her teeth. With two free hands, Tsunade poked a cold metal panel embedded in the suit directly at the center of Sakura's back. She heard several beeps followed by a confused huff from the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Lady Tsunade? Has something malfunctioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it. According to the data, absolutely nothing is wrong with the suit. Everything is running perfectly...Here, let me see what happens when I try to eject you from it. Normally it will take twenty four hours but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother beep sound was heard and the suit sprung to life, opening up like a bag down the center of the stomach. It plopped to the floor around Sakura's ankles, while she shivered in place. Standing in her usual regiment in a freezing cold cave made her wish the suit hadn't been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's odd...Something is definitely wrong with the suit Sakura.\" Said Tsunade as she gathered up its remains. \"Looks like we should have gone to the tech guys to begin with. Oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith teeth chattering, Sakura nodded. \"C-c-can I b-b-borrow a c-c-c-coat Lady Tsu-u-u-unade? I'm f-f-f-freezing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the memory of being in a warm bear body entered her head was the moment something clicked in her body. The little panel on the bear suit lit up in Tsunade's hands and Sakura suddenly began to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura! You're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sakura had already noticed. Her pink hair had begun to spread all over her body, covering her plumping form. The familiar sensation of bones realigning themselves and snapping into place made her wince in pain. For some reason she was become a polar bear with the suit on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Tsunade...\" Whimpered Sakura as her mouth pushed out into a snout. \"What's happening!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura' entire form had grown from a petite young woman into a nearly full grown bear in a matter of seconds, much faster than the rate of transformation when she had the suit on. Claws and teeth had already taken their place in their respective areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Wish I knew, did you do something Sakura? Anything! Think of something? Touch something!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just remembering how warm it was as a bear and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Try to think of being a human again! Think of the shape of your old body, picture it in your head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura obeyed and closed her eyes thinking about being a human again. The form of it...How weak it felt in comparison of being a massive bear but how comfortable it was at the same time. She felt a sinking feeling run over her. She opened her eyes and saw that she was shrinking, it worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she transformed into a bear, she returned to her human self. The fur simply was absorbed back into her body and her structure returned to a human's anatomy. Afterward, she felt dizzy and cold again. But at least she was normal. Stepping forward, she slipped and feel into Tsunade's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy does it...This is quite remarkable, you seemed to have completely absorbed the suit's power! Your body must have reacted to the amount of chakra that was lost and took in the suit's power as compensation. The suit's ability has basically been added to your will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grinned. \"It means you get to go back on your mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned. \"Oh...boy...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blizzard hadn't exactly died down by the time Tsunade sent Sakura packing back to the Safe Home. The snow was higher than ever and showed no signs of stopping, flecks of the quarter sized pellets clung to Sakura's pink fur. At least when she was the size of a bear, walking through the ocean of snow was considerably less difficult. Still, this mission was already growing tiresome. Thoughts of returning home to her nice warm bed continually taunted the poor girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Sakura remembered Chira and Koji, even Kusase. Ichikuma had been gracious enough to welcome her into their home, even if humans weren't exactly welcomed. She had to go back, if at least for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura squinted to see through the waves of snowflakes that clouded her vision. \"Now...Which way was the tree again...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding ones way around a familiar yet distorted environment was proving quite difficult. And yet there was an almost entire sense of drawing, like Sakura knew exactly where she was going. A sort of beacon in the distance was calling her, guiding her through the blizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed to herself. \"I guess I just have to trust it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in a cave not too far from where Sakura was. The hunter loomed over a roaring fire, cooking a large piece meat while his hunting dog continued to bark loudly at the cave entrance. He had to block it off with snow, it would be impossible to hunt out in that blizzard meaning he and his companion were forced indoors...For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning two gold teeth under a giant beard, the man turned to his dog. \"Easy boy, eh? She's 'ut there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog almost seemed to understand him and barked once in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, the hunter took a big bite out of his lunch. \"'On't worry...She can't 'utrun us forev'r. It 'nly takes 'ne to lead us to 'he nest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Sakura had found the tree and was descending the stairs down into the Safe Home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of a city were echoing off the stairway walls as Sakura's stomach growled. She hadn't eaten anything all day so far, it had to be lunchtime by now. That would explain the bustling sounds resonating below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, her theory was proven correct. Just like yesterday, the main hall was packed with hundreds of the pink polar bears wandering around and chatting with each other. The smells of fresh fish and beef filled Sakura's nostrils making her drool slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few younger bears bumped into her and apologized, but she was too busy trying to remember where Ichikuma's home was to notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Now where did they live again-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Sakura!\" Bellowed a booming voice from behind her. She jumped slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichikuma-san! S-sorry, you scared me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned to face the great bear, who was grinning. That was a good sign at least, he wasn't angry about her disappearance this morning. Sakura also noticed that the others were nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchikuma noticed her stares. \"Wondering where Chira, Kuji, and Kusase are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, yes...But Ichikuma-san, I'm sorry for leaving like that this morning there was some difficulty with...\" She paused and lowered her voice slightly. \"...The suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"It's no trouble, I figured something must have happened and just told Chira and Kuji you had urgent business on the surface. Both of them missed you terribly this morning though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I feel awful leaving all of a sudden like that. Where are they now anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School, where you should be now as a matter of fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stuttered slightly. \"S-school? But-but I graduated already and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction.\" Interrupted Ichikuma. \"You graduated from a human school. We keep our young in schools until they're old enough to mate. I can take you there if you wish, but I'll leave it up to you. You're here to learn from us, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, showing his large sharp teeth. \"Well, wouldn't you think a school is the best place to start? As I said I won't force you to go, you can learn much about us by just walking through the city. What do you say though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thought for a brief minute.</span></div></div>",

Kusase says it\u2019s the only time he can get peace of mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, Sasuke always seemed so indifferent in the Ninja Academy despite his inherited talent. \u201cReally? He likes going to school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. As a matter of fact, not even Chira or Kuji complain about it.\u201d Just then, Ichikuma stopped before a large rock formation. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura looked up to find herself before an imposing cave exit, which looked like a roaring bear. The mouth was the opening, with stalagmites and stalactites serving as teeth. The stony figures were  so huge, they dwarfed Ichikuma. At the top of the natural, but realistic figure were the ears, and below them, in just the right place were the eyes, where two windows were. Sakura only stood there in awe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid yo-er, I mean our people make this?\u201d She asked curiously, entranced by the enigmatic school\u2019s exterior. She had corrected herself to keep any listeners from growing suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older bear shook his head no. \u201cNo, interestingly enough this formation has been here for ages, predating the arrival of our kind in Safe Home. Our ancestors decided that it was sacred, and should only be used for important purposes. No human has ever set foot within, including the rare few who had managed to stumble into Safe Home.\u201d He then turned to Sakura, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s okay? I mean you said it was considered to be sacred.\u201d The kunoichi in bear form asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe moment you came into our household I considered you to be a member of my family, that as well as your current form would make you eligible to enter.\u201d As the rose furred polar bear finished his last syllables, a bell rang out. \u201cOh, classes have begun! Come on in Sakura and I\u2019ll get you registered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Ichikuma!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wind that blew out of the cave made it sound like she was really stepping into a giant bear's mouth, it roared and howled along the cave walls shaking her very core. Speaking of the walls, they were heavily decorated with cave paintings and skins of various animals. Small torches aligned the wall, giving a deep orange glow that lit the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the sounds of children echoed in the distance, they must have been approaching a classroom. Sure enough, the hall widened and the ceiling grew higher until at last Sakura and Ichikuma stood in what appeared to be a auditorium. It was a bowl-like room that collapsed into a massive bear statue made of hard rock in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung bears of various shades of pink and sizes sat around on the seats that traversed down the bowl floor. Several of them stopped from their prattle and looked at the newcomer with bits of food in their mouths. It was apparently cafeteria time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong looking purple shaded male bear that had a fur pattern that made it appear he was almost wearing glasses walked up the steps to greet the two. He spoke in an educated and quirky voice, taking care to pronounce every word spoken properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Lord Ichikuma. What do we owe the great pleasure of your presence gracing our fine establishment? There's nothing wrong, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the contrary Speaker Atama, I come bringing you a new student. She was a little...lost this morning and couldn't arrive during the start of your sessions. Sakura, this is Speaker Atama. He will be your teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura did a slight bow. \"How do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtama gawked slightly. \"My word. Such odd mannerisms, what part of the Safe Home do you come from my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchikuma butted in. \"Sorry, I should have mentioned. She's from the surface and knows little of the...'mannerisms' of the Momoiro. However, I have taken her in as one of my family. I'd wish you treat as one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, of course Lord Ichikuma! I was merely curious, the last surfacer I taught nearly got into a brawl with me over study habits. We had to expel him unfortunately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surfacer? You had to expel him?\" Asked Sakura, detecting a hint of annoyance in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtama quickly correctly. \"Oh, no no! Please dear girl, don't take me as prejudice! He was one of my favorite students, he just didn't have a knack for the way of the Momoiro and returned to the surface...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, learning is taken really seriously then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Now Lord Ichikuma, I can take you to my office and we can sort out the proper paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtama then turned to Sakura. \"Your name was Sakura, correct? I believe I saw Kusase sitting around here somewhere if you wish to sit with someone familiar...Ahh! There he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to a bench not that far from where they were standing. Kusase had apparently noticed they spotted him and groaned, slumping down low to discourage her. Sakura frowned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead Sakura.\" Nudged Ichikuma. \"I need to go with Speaker Atama and register you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Thank you, Ichikuma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowds of young bears made Sakura feel a little out of her element. She was used to quiet study lessons with an occasional prank done by Naruto. This group was large and loud, there had to be easily a thousand bears in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura pushed her way through a particularly rowdy group of bears, she found a place next to Kusase. He just huffed at her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled and tried to introduce a conversation. \"This place is a mad house! And your uncle says this is the only place you get some peace of mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted. Sakura tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't talk much, do you? Don't like conversation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just don't like you.\" He replied, giving her a suspicious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura made a disappointed face. \"Where have I heard that one before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Kusase could give his own witty retort, an almost unbearable shrilly voice cried out in the distance. \"Kusaseeeeeeeeeeeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appeared to be a big yellow boulder slammed into Kusase's back, though he was surprisingly able to hold his ground against the weight of whatever landed on him. Sakura was surprised to discover it was a blond female bear with a long yellow ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The last person I wanted to see right now.\" Muttered Kusase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond bear giggled. \"Don't say that! I know you're crazy for me Kusase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like I'd have to be crazy to like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear huffed. \"Fine! Play hard to get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" Interrupted Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear looked up, apparently not even noticing Sakura had been sitting there the entire time. \"Oh, hi! You're the newcomer right! Sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation! I just haven't seen my dear Kusase since yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your dear Kus-\" Kusase tried to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway!\" The bear released Kusase and turned her attention to Sakura. \"Pleased to meet you! I'm Noi! Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noi, huh? Small world...Sorry, my name's Sakura. Nice to meet you too.\" Sakura smirked. She was just like Ino in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, huh? Sounds a little familiar somehow...Whatever, though. What part of the city are you from Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's from the surface.\" Said Kusase, in an uncaring tone. He was trying to get Noi to get into conversation with Sakura so he could slip away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The surface, huh? No wonder you're a newcomer! What's it like up there? I hear it's hard to live up there.\" Kusase slowly inched away from Noi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not too bad. Still this city is amazing. I never thought something like this would exist down here.\" Kusase got real low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me! Know what we should go shopping together after classes! I can show you around.\" Kusase climbed under the bench without getting noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that. How long are classes supposed to go away?\" Kusase was now home free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well it's lunch now so only for another three hours and...Hey! Where did Kusase go?\"</span></div></div>",

The truth was universal peace was always hard to achieve, though there was at least no outright hostility between the nations. Still, there was at least some progress. For example, a year ago Hinata would have never been on a patrol around Konoha borders with a Sand and Mist ninja as her allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there she was, jumping from tree to tree with a broody-looking Mist kunoichi named Spades and a tall dark fellow from the Sands with a massive hammer by the name of Raz. Both were genin under her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaz stopped suddenly, being the one on point. Hinata and Spades also came to a halt at the tree he was perched on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore tilled forests,\u201d Raz observed. \u201cThey seem to be coming from the south.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Good eye,\u201d replied Hinata as she took a moment to use her Byakugan to survey the land. As before, there was nothing but giant tracks along the path of fallen trees. \u201cStill nothing, n-no sign of the cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t do anything if we did find them,\u201d sighed Spades as she leaned on her trademark shovel. \u201cWe\u2019re just genin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Raz slapped Spades on the shoulder in an attempt to lighten her mood. \u201cThe Commander was in the final battle of the war. Between you, me, and her, we can handle anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m right here, you know,\u201d muttered Hinata. Since the Great War and while acting squad leader, she had been tried to be more vocal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Raz. \u201cYou were there when everything went down with Naruto and Sasuke. In the final push.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were a lot of people there\u2026,\u201d the idea of being some sort of war hero didn\u2019t exactly sit well with the Hyuga heiress. \u201cWhat matters is the mission. S-Stay focused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a patrol mission,\u201d Spades gloomily stated. \u201cNothing exciting ever happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I can hope. Can\u2019t I?\u201d Raz smiled widely. Hinata could tell the large ninja was eager to prove himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Hinata was losing control over her troops this early on in the mission. That was a bad sign. It was time for a new tactic to keep them focused on the task at hand. \u201cL-Let\u2019s split up. Follow the tracks and report back on a-any sign of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genin respectfully bowed and took off in separate directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed a breath of relief, still not used to the idea of commanding soldiers. So far, in comparison to her last few missions, this one had gone relatively smoothly. But she couldn\u2019t rejoice yet. Everyone in the village was doing their part to rebuild and grow stronger after so many resources had been spent in the war. Hinata would do her part as well. She would grow stronger, both in the self and as a community with Konoha. Even if it meant doing what some might consider a trivial task as investigate the strange deforestation in the south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter collecting herself for a moment, Hinata immediately sprung into actions and followed the path of broken timber down to a large lake next to the mountains. Most of the outback was unsettled by anyone, with only empty highways as the single means of civilization. This meant her travel through the woods was pleasantly quiet as she approached the lakeside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at another group of large tracks, each the size of a small house. This was the first time she had gotten to look at them up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a wolf or a tiger,\u201d as she might have initially thought. \u201cThere are large p-pads. More like bobcat. O-Or a\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLASH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sprung into a defensive stance, as something rippled in the water right in front of her. The echo was loud enough that the cause had to be something large, which only disturbed her; something as big as a small car had gotten the jump on her. When she looked up, she saw exactly what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A bear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA full-grown bear would be too generous to label this creature. Judging by its proportions, it was a simple cub. However, this \u201ccub\u201d was easily three times as large as she was. Worse, it looked to be in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata\u2019s motherly instincts took over as the animal limped towards her, fur soaked from the lake. \u201cO-Oh, my. Hold still! Don\u2019t move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature must have interpreted her peaceful intent for it quietly slumped up to the beach and collapsed on its side. As Hinata approached the mammoth sized baby bear she saw exactly what was troubling it. A pike-sized wooden splinter had impaled it through its hind leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had limited medical training, Hinata sprung into actions. She first attempted to soothe the cub with gentle coos as she firmly grasped the handle of the spear. Using chakra infused fingertips, she gently pressed on various pressure points along the wound that would numb the pain of the removal process. When all preparations were made, she thrust the splint out in one quick pull before closing the injury as best as she could with tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-There,\u201d she whispered, patting the bandaged leg of her handiwork. \u201cThat should s-stabilize you long enough to heal naturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the cub had not made a single peep through Hinata\u2019s work. Yet, when there was the caw of a flock of birds in the air, it turned and let out a loud cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had a bad feeling in her stomach as the earth began to shake. Something larger than the cub was approaching and she didn\u2019t have time to run from it. Crashing through the brook came the largest bear she had ever seen. It was the size of a summoned beast, like Naruto\u2019s toads or Lady Tsunade\u2019s slugs. Worst of all, it look very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great brown bear came to a halt right at its kin and let out a roar that sent a flurry of winds nearly knocking her off her feet. But she stood her ground, hoping that the help she had granted the cub would be a peace offering. It didn\u2019t take a genius to realize that this was clearly the mother bear and she was not happy to see her child in such a state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommander Hinata!\u201d called out a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata\u2019s eyes shot over to Raz and Spades, who were coming in to aid her. They were going to get themselves killed if the big bear focused on them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTAY THERE!\u201d she ordered, surprisingly them both by the volume of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the giant bear paid her squad no mind. It sniffed the cub, checking to see if it was alright. When the smaller bear licked the gigantic snout of the mother, the big bear gave Hinata her full attention. It appeared to be sizing her up with its bowling ball sized pupils. It drew in closer and wrapped its blanket-like tongue around Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh!\u201d Hinata cried, trying not to breath in the bear\u2019s horrible breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Hinata was a wet, dripping mess, the bear snatched the cub up with its teeth by the collar and took off in the direction it had come from. Hinata\u2019s teammates cautiously approached their commander, who was covered head to toe with saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice one, commander,\u201d said Raz as he punched Hinata in the shoulder, only to wipe his hands off on his sleeve from the bear spittle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose were very large bears,\u201d observed Spades, still in shock at what she had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes,\u201d muttered Hinata as she attempted to clean herself off. \u201cW-Well, at least we know what caused the damage to the local forest.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Hinata shifted uncomfortably in place, not expecting her report on the discovered cause of the forest destruction to be so muddled in ninja politics. A few high ranking representations were in the office with her, not including Naruto and his frog friend. There were a few officials Hinata did not recognize from the neighboring villages, no doubt here to petition Konoha to act on the bear problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me again,\u201d said Kakashi after giving the matter a long thought. \u201cHinata, the bears took off after simply\u2026Licking you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Once I had healed the cub, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have let the beast die,\u201d said one lord from a trading village along the south river. \u201cThose mongrels have been terrible for business, scaring away our merchants, our livelihood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI reckon the bears have as much right to exist as you or me,\u201d said Fukasaku from Naruto\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you were the one just complaining about the damage they were causing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only meant they needed to be stopped, you dang whipper snapper!\u201d croaked the old toad. \u201cButchering them would be sacrilege given the history of these noble beasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of bear summons before,\u201d said Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because they haven\u2019t revealed themselves for centuries,\u201d continued his frog companion. \u201cThey disappeared long ago before I can even remember. They were mere stories of legend in my youth, if you can believe it. Their return is a rare occurrence and should be welcomed\u2026Provided they don\u2019t destroy half of Konoha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem is the delicate peace they\u2019d be compromising if they\u2019re allowed to continue,\u201d continued Kakashi. \u201cLord Fukasaku, you wanted me to have Hinata join us. What was your reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the frog as he motioned for Naruto to bring him closer to the Hyuga. Hinata gulped slightly as the old toad jumped onto her shoulder and surveyed her at an uncomfortably close angle. \u201cYoung lady, you said the bear licked you, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that solves our problem. You\u2019ve been marked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cW-What does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of this,\u201d said Kakashi as he put his hand to his masked chin. \u201cIn the days before man were respected as masters of jutsu, the beasts would not simply bow to them under contract. They chose their pupils through their own trials. Your kind heart must have impressed one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d nodded Fukasaku. \u201cI suspect they\u2019ll speak to no one but this girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. Hinata, you will gather up your team and speak with these mythical bears as an ambassador, if they truly have accepted you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if they haven\u2019t?\u201d asked Naruto. \u201cMaster Kakashi, it\u2019s dangerous to send them in alone like that. I mean, I saw those tracks. Those bears are huuuuge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen go with them if you\u2019re so worried,\u201d Kakashi shrugged, putting his hands behind his head. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you have free reign, Naruto, given that any mission we\u2019d send you on would be overkill at this point. You\u2019re more famous than I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted and rubbed his nose. Since the end of the War, there was not a person alive who didn\u2019t know his name. Hinata was glad he\u2019d be coming along, given that they hadn\u2019t had much time to talk since after the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so we\u2019re clear, Naruto.\u201d Kakashi sat up straight and stopped using his carefree tone. \u201cThis is a diplomatic mission and Hinata is your squad leader. You will obey her commands and not do ANYTHING to compromise our chance at a peaceful resolution. Am I clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lord Hokage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon was busy with a slight chill in the air suggesting the coming autumn. Hinata bundled up with her usual lavender hoodie as she walked with Naruto outside the Hokage tower. A peaceful pass through the park with her boyfriend was exactly what she needed after a long day in the forest. Well, that and a shower after being licked by a mountain sized bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thanks for coming along, Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I know a thing or two about being the only one to calm a bunch of giant monsters,\u201d chuckled the blond troublemaker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you get hurt out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled and clasped her crush\u2019s hand. It had taken a long time to work up her courage, but it was completely worth the embarrassment of admitting her feelings. Naruto felt the same way giving her fingers a slight squeeze as they moved along. It was ironic that their budding romance had begun in a season of decay. But at least they would have this mission to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommander!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoke too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata quickly released Naruto\u2019s hand and looked up to see her subordinates Raz and Spades jumping down from the nearby building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Naruto! Wow,\u201d said Raz, somewhat star struck. \u201cCan I get your autograph?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Naruto sheepishly grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hinata wasn\u2019t about to let them be distracted.

Hinata was glad to spend the time with Naruto and getting to know her charges better. While Raz and Spades were talented genin, they were also quite new to being a ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was glad to spend a few moments of peace with them and Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the dense forest area of the Land of Bears, passing Hoshigakure. The foursome made camp deep within the woods, with them sitting in front of a campfire. Naruto was busily slurping down as much ramen as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith admiration, Raz started to quiz the hero of the Great Ninja War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, is it true you fought alongside lord Gaara?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, I even beat him once before he was Kazekage. He\u2019s one of my best friends, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty awesome. I knew he spoke highly of you, but I never knew you two were personally acquainted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, well, awesome ninja gotta stick together.\u201d Naruto smiled pridefully, not noticing Spades\u2019s annoyed expression. \u201cMaybe one day you guys will be able to surpass me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo do that all we have to do is pass the Chunin exam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was silenced after that. Even after the Great Ninja War he STILL hadn\u2019t passed the Chunin exam. He decided it would be best not to broach the subject further, while Hinata found more merit in trying to change the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe may as well rest now. We\u2019ll be near our destination tomorrow and we need to be ready to talk with the bears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you sure it\u2019ll be safe, Master Hinata?\u201d Raz asked. \u201cI mean, they might try to eat us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBears don\u2019t eat people,\u201d Spade said. \u201cThey attack if their territory is invaded or their cubs are in danger, but not to eat humans. Since we are invading their area, we might be in for some danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready to face it after a good night\u2019s sleep. I\u2019ll keep watch, you two rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, Master Hinata.\u201d Spades went into her tent after that, while Raz did the same with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill outside, Hinata saw Naruto fidgeting with his new arm. Apparently, it was still troubling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna be fine. I can still do jutsu and all, it\u2019s just harder to use than my old one. Just makes me think of everything we lost in the war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou sacrificed a lot for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot as much as others,\u201d Naruto said wistfully. Hinata recalled the lost ninja, many from various villages and others close to her heart. Neji in particular came to her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cousin, the genius of the Hyuga clan and one of the reasons Hinata desired to be stronger, was lost forever. Hinata only had her memory of him and a desire to be worthy to someday lead the Hyuga clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, but those sacrifices have just made us stronger. We have to look at the future so those sacrifices mean something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Anyway, do you want me to keep you company on your watch Hinata?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure. I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting side by side, the two kept watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and Hinata was certain the group was fine. Naruto took over and the shifts went by until morning. As the group began to move ahead, they noticed that there was a malevolent presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEveryone, we have company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe do?\u201d Raz asked as he came from his tent, reaching for his hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. I think it might be one of our bears.\u201d Hinata had briefly activated her Byakugan in order to look at the source of the disturbance. True enough, it was a bear that was lumbering nearby. It was smaller than even the cubs that she had encountered before. Still, she didn\u2019t want to take any risks. \u201cNaruto, can you send out a shadow clone to investigate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOn it!\u201d Naruto performed the necessary hand signs and summoned a shadow clone. His duplicate advanced slowly to check out the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took a few moments and by then Hinata noticed he seemed to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNaruto, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh, the bear isn\u2019t from the sloth we\u2019re looking for. In fact, I think its just a wild bear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why\u2019re you acting so worried?\u201d Spades asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, my shadow clone tried talking to it, but it wasn\u2019t paying attention. I kinda tried to poke it and it attacked my clone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean you provoked it?\u201d Spades asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then the bear came running out from the woods after them. The four picked up their things and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose!\u201d Naruto yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, can\u2019t we just take the bear down? We\u2019re ninja for crying out loud!\u201d Raz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, we can\u2019t risk offending the sloth we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Hinata explained. \u201cIf they look over the wild bears then this might be seen as an act of aggression.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut what if we just trap it? No harming involved.\u201d Spades looked at the bear. It couldn\u2019t keep up, but they likely couldn\u2019t outrun it if they stayed in a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata considered the options and came up with a solution.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Hyuga would have kicked herself for loitering around if she had the time, but it was all she could do to jump out of the bear\u2019s may. She narrowly missed being mauled by its claws as she climbed up the branch of a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me to smack Naruto later\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear continued to follow her around as she leapt through the forest, bashing into the trees in an attempt to bring her down. Naruto must have really made it angry. Yet, for all its rage, it never once damaged the forest. Every tree it hit remained intact as Hinata led it deeper into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes of this dangerous game of whack-a-mole passed until Hinata found that there were no more trees to hide atop on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the forest had come to a stop right in front of a mountain, and at the foot of that mountain was a large cave. Hinata wasted no time scrambling inside before the bear came charging inside behind her. Thankfully, with her eyes, Hinata could see perfectly in the dark while the bear relied solely on its sense of smell to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGRRRORRRR!\u201d it snarled in the blackness, pawing its way through the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata quietly crept through the cave, heading deeper in with the plan to lure the bear inside and escape while it got lost looking for her. As she wandered into the darkness, she realized that the cavern was actually getting wider. Eventually she came to what she thought was the very back of the cave. It was a dead end in an almost circular room. At the center was an unusual pool of water, bubbling like it was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow odd,\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cA-An underground hot spot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was given little time to ponder it as the bear\u2019s roars echoed along the walls. Hinata swiftly dove behind one of the many nearby stalagmites just as the beast came stumbling into the central chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear grumbled confusedly as it pawed at the rocks along the ground, trying to catch Hinata\u2019s scent. The ninja was suddenly very grateful she had found the strange bubbling pool of water. The sound prevented the bear from hearing her and it distracted the creature entirely. In fact, the bear seemed to lose all interest in even chasing Hinata, instead it waddled up to the edge of the underground pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata peaked her head out from the rocks and quietly watched as the bear stared deep into the pool, despite it being too dark to see. It began to yammer to itself before dipping its head into the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my\u2026\u201d Hinata whispered to herself as she watched the bear begin to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water appeared to have a bizarre effect on the bear as it started to swell to gigantic proportions. It wasn\u2019t long before the bear was nearly as large as the chamber itself. Only then did it stop drinking, looking far more content and peaceful. It seemed to have forgotten about Hinata entirely, and for good reason. It was now bigger than that cub she had encountered previously in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata continued to observe the bear with a strange fit of curiosity. Now that it had grown this large, how was it going to get out of the cave? Her answer came when the animal shuffled over to the far wall of the cave. It lifted its now table-sized paw and pressed it against the rocks. Hinata jolted as she heard the cave shifting and a beam of light illuminated the chamber. She quickly hid away as the bear stepped through the now exposed opening and disappeared into the blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as quickly as the doorway appeared, it vanished with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata waited a full minute before stepping out from her hiding place, and inspecting the wall which the bear had disappeared into. The only thing unusual about the rocks was a strange crevice that looked suspiciously like a large bear\u2019s paw. It didn\u2019t take long for Hinata to put the clues together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s a secret passageway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this was the entry into wherever lands the sloth was hiding. Maybe it led to more caves where the bears camped out underground. Hinata tried pressing her own hand up to the keyhole, and as expected nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt needs a b-bear to open it\u2026\u201d she deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome scurrying behind her made the Hyuga spin around to the relief that it was merely a cave rat. It squeaked at her and waddled over to the magical pool as it bubbled. Like the bear it dipped its head in and took a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata watched in amazement as the mouse began to swell to the size of a dog. Its long pale tail got sucked up into its butt and formed into a cute stubby tail, like a bear\u2019s. Its ears also took on a smaller cub-like appearance. Lastly, its long front teeth disappeared and its snout shrink down slightly. In a matter of seconds, the rat now looked like a very, very small bear. Judging by the look on its face, it was just as surprised by this transformation as Hinata was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGroar!\u201d it squeaked it her, before it stumbled back to the nearby walls, where it attempted to fit into the much-too-small mouse holes in the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata watched the former rat\u2019s pathetic attempts to escape, she had begun to wonder what exactly it was that she had just discovered. A pool that could make you grow and turn into a bear? Those things were supposed to be mere legend. One thing was for sure, though, there was something on the other side of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn\u2019t simply break down the cave wall. If her hunch was correct, this was where the sloth had been hiding out. If she broke in violently, they would probably see it as an invasion and all peace talks would be off. She had to hide another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s when her thoughts turned to the pool. It appeared to be some sort of ritual to enter, if observing the previous bear was any clue. And drinking this water would turn anything into a bear. Hinata gingerly lingered closer to the pool and\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata thought it would be best to bide her time and think on what to do rather than jump right in. She knew very little about the water or the full range of its effects. All she knew was that it would turn those who drank from it into bears, though she had no idea how long it might last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018Maybe Sage Fukasaku might know something about this water,\u2019 Hinata thought as she reached into her bag and took out a bottle. She had one on hand as part of her limited medical training in order to take any poison or dangerous materials for analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she took the vial out and uncorked it before bringing it back towards the water. As she dipped the vial in to gather water, her left hand made contact with the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt a tingle at first before she noticed her hand was changing. Her nails grew sharper and thinner, growing more beast-like before her eyes. At first Hinata thought she was imagining it before the pads on her palm and fingers. She started to worry as her fingers and thumb became shorter. Gradually it started to become a paw, covered in light brown fur. Hinata gasped, but was careful to take a cloth and wipe off the remaining water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grabbed the vial in her other hand and looked at the paw she possessed in place of her usual one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could move the fingers on it well enough, but it would in no way serve to create handsigns. At her wrist, her transformed paw stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, dear\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Hinata found her teammates and allies reunited close outside the caves. The group was in high spirits, although they seemed to still be miffed at Naruto. Said blond was the first to notice her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, Hinata. You\u2019re okay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, and I made a discovery. A rather strange one, really\u2026\u201d Hinata then showed her transformed hand to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" Raz immediately took interest in his commander's disfigured hand. \"Is it real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's real, you dunderhead.\" Spades smacked the giant across the back of the head. \"And its creepy, Commander. Can you fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata flexed her left hand. \"I-I haven't the slightest idea. There's no way I can do any jutsu like this though. O-Or, at least it will be difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can relate,\" chuckled Naruto as he squeezed together his own replacement hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping Fukasaku might have some information on this...Curse,\" Hinata produced a small vial. \"T-This caused it. I found it after I escaped the bear in a nearby cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo save her from explaining her story twice, Naruto got to work summoning Fukasaku to the group. After an exchange of greetings, the old frog listened intently as Hinata conveyed all that she had observed just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now. This is interesting, Naruto-boy,\" croaked the sage. \"I haven't heard of anything like this since the olden days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it some sort of curse?\" asked Raz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now that I think about it,\" replied Hinata. \u201cIt looked like some sort of ritual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both half-right. Naruto-boy, you remember your training on Mount Myoboku with the special oil few months back, yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s face brightened up. \u201cOh, yeah! That stuff was weird and would have turned me into a frog statue if I wasn\u2019t perfectly still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. I suspect whatever this water is it\u2019s in the same vein as the oil on Mount Myoboku. Like how the oil advanced your training, perhaps this is a way for the bears to test the commitment of potential sages. It\u2019s very in line with the old way of thinking amongst the summonable beasts. Prove your worth by becoming one of them and forsaking your old life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gulped. She was not looking forward to having a bear claw for a hand for the rest of her life. \u201cD-Does that mean it is permanent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily, but I have no way of knowing. If you want those kinds of answers, you\u2019re going to need to find the ones who created the water, the bears. Sounds like your mission just got a little more personal, my girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it had. As interesting as a sensation the transform had been, this was no longer funny. This was serious. Hinata absentmindedly played with the pads on her palm and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018W-What are our options for how to proceed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d croaked Fukasaku. \u201cConsidering your condition, I\u2019d recommend going straight back to the bear\u2019s lair. You can use your hand to your advantage and open whatever locking mechanism they have in place, from the sounds of things. The problem is your appearance. I\u2019d wager they won\u2019t be happy to see a bunch of humans have cheated their security system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what you\u2019re s-saying is\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrink the vial if you want them to treat you like one of their sloth,\u201d the sage politely finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d cried out Naruto. \u201cIt sounds like we may not even get to change her back! It\u2019s way too risky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all knew the risks when you signed up for this mission. Are you ninja or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukasaku was right. All of them were aware of the code of ninja. They had a duty to complete their mission with utmost efficiency, no matter the cost. If her mission required that she sacrifice her own humanity and become a bear, Hinata would follow through. However, Naruto could be right. There might be a better alternative than having the commander of their squad transformed into an animal, perhaps indefinitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how Hinata detested the pains of leadership.</span></div></div>",

W-We have a way in, we should use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d said Naruto. \u201cIt\u2019s way too risky to go off with this on a hunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hinata was grateful Naruto would support her decision, it undermined her authority somewhat to have her boyfriend attempt to take her side in a tough decision as the team leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d croaked Fukasaku. \u201cThe bears weren\u2019t exactly known for their understanding.

This was largely due in part to Hinata, who hadn\u2019t said a word to anyone after they went over their plan of attack once they reached the caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be simple. Hinata would lead the way by opening the entrance like she had seen the bear do while Raz would stand guard at the entrance, making sure no one or nothing followed them in behind. With Naruto and Spades as her escort, Hinata would continue to lead on into whatever awaited them inside the lair. They promised to let her do all the talking and she had to force Naruto into vowing to leave her behind in case things got back. She was the one who was \u201cmarked\u201d after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half an hour of traveling, they at last reached their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could feel the familiar din of the cave, wind howling as it passed over the opening. \u201cA-Alright, this is the place. Guys, you know what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, Commander.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting behind her near the cave, Raz sat outside of the cave entrance while Hinata entered with Naruto and Spades. On the way in, she saw the cave was empty. The former rat had disappeared, leaving the cavern pool the only thing within aside from the stalagmites, stalactites and the secret wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata approached the spot she had seen before and then her transformed hand. She felt nervous, but knew she had a job to do. Walking up to it and steeling herself, she placed her paw there and watched as the cavern\u2019s back opened and led to a path. It was vast and great, and far off Hinata could see a light. She walked ahead, followed by Naruto a just as the cavern wall closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked ahead and went on for a fair distance until she came to the exit. Once she did she saw her surroundings and gasped. She was in awe of the beauty. It was a large clearing, nearby were a number of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like an idyllic forest, so different from the rest of the Land of Bears. Hinata couldn\u2019t imagine how they would ever want to leave such a place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to search for trails that would lead to the sloth she sought when she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn attempt by humans to draw near? Something we haven\u2019t seen in some time,\u201d a deep, masculine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata turned to look, but found no one in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, who\u2019s-\u201c Naruto began when he realized he was supposed to let Hinata do the talking. He fell silent and let her take over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe don\u2019t mean to intrude on your territory. I just wanted to talk to you about your sloth being out and loose. They\u2019ve been causing a lot of disturbances for others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat can be expected when they wake from centuries long hibernation,\u201d another voice, this one female, stated. \u201cThe younger ones need a chance to explore and see the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand, it\u2019s just that I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou needn\u2019t explain. We\u2019ve expected you for a time. Ursala told us you might arrive soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUrsala? Who is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ll reveal it soon. For now walk through the path to the right. All will be explained when you reach the end. You must send the others back, though. They are unwelcome\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata started to worry about the situation. She thought it was the sloth of bears who were talking to her, but she wasn\u2019t quite fond of having to send her team away. She thought on what would be the best course of action before she made her decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you crazy, Hinata?\u201d asked Naruto, clearly not thrilled with the thought of his girlfriend heading in alone. \u201cYou can\u2019t do jutsu! What if this is a trap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt this is a t-trap, Naruto.\u201d Hinata held her ground. \u201cThey sounded like they merely wanted to talk, else they could have f-forced me to comply. We came here on our own will as diplomats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-The commander is right,\u201d Spades spoke up, looking around the forest with worried glances. \u201cWe should go and leave this to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, Naruto. Y-You should go. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d added Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, the cavern wall opened up again as if on Hinata\u2019s command. The cave almost beckoned them and Spades quickly stepped through. She turned to Naruto, expecting him to follow a superior officer\u2019s orders, even if she was his significant other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted angrily, not wanting to obey but knowing that a probable fight in his future would be waiting for him back in Konoha if he didn\u2019t comply. Hinata had had a long talk with him before about what being under her command meant. Even if her orders went against her self-preservation, he was to follow them to the letter. Begrudgingly, Naruto stepped through the entrance and gave Hinata one last worried look before the rock slammed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata jumped slightly as the familiar female voice echoed across the trees around her. \u201cSuch a fortunate potential sage. She has a suitable mate, and the binder of the Nine Tails, no less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You knew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, we could sense his foul chakra miles away. Though I must admit, it had a far less sinister feeling since I last basked in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata struggled to maintain her composure as the nearby Cliffside moved. The bear\u2019s sanctuary had been in a small valley tucked away between the mountains where no one could find it unless they flew overhead. Only now did Hinata realize that the large looming shapes overhead hadn\u2019t all been the mountains themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at her, big as any summons from a ninja master, was a massive bear, it was like she had encountered in the forest days earlier. It certainly wasn\u2019t the same creature, Hinata could tell by its presence, but it was just as intimidating with its great size. It was everything Hinata could do to not flinch as it brought it nose right up to her face. This thing could swallow her whole if it wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are afraid,\u201d it spoke after sniffing her. The bear\u2019s inhalation had almost pulled her completely forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Hinata. She wasn\u2019t about to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd honest. I can see why Ursala liked you. And after you helped her cub, it\u2019s clear why she trusts you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You mean that bear in the forest earlier was this Ursala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the bear in front of her ignored her question and continued her inspection of Hinata, prodding her gently with its nose. \u201cYes, yes. You will do nicely. Clever too. Not many would think to use only part of the holy waters to purify only their hand for entrance into the sacred grove. What do you think, Yanmir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumble filled the valley as an even larger shadow was cast over Hinata. The scarred face of a bigger bear loomed over her, making Hinata feel even smaller by comparison. This one, however, had the distinctive male voice she had heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems very timid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because she has to see your ugly face, you old coot,\" said the female bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger bear growled. \"You're older than I am, Medve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um,\" Hinata interrupted. \"Excuse me, but what do you mean by 'I'll do?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know?\" asked the female bear. \"You're here to become our first sage since our awakening. Why else would you be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Because your sloth have been rampaging in Konoha's lands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konoha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The village hidden in the leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth bears chuckled slightly. \"How cute. The humans have expanded their territories. And just how important is this Konoha? Have the humans finally stopped feuding with each other as clans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only now just registered with Hinata just how old these bears were. They truly had been born during the time of the Sage, before the villages had even been formed or the clans disbanded. Hinata had no idea where she could even begin to answer their questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...C-Complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah,\" said Medve. \"That describes human nature perfectly. But it's all the more reason we need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...Need me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been centuries since we have awoken,\" continued Yanmir. \"And now that we have returned, we need an advisor and friend in this new foreign world. The role of a sage will fulfill this. You will be our first sage and learn the ways of the bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean you want me to become a bear sage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" replied Medve. \"By finding the way into our hallowed vale and impressing all three of us elders, you have proven your worth enough to at least attempt the training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But what about the problem with your sloth? Your kin are e-encroaching on our lands and hurting people. If you don't cease this, there will be w-war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? This is why we need you as our sage. The sloth moves on its own without respect towards any human. Even if we called them back, they would eventually begin to wander again. Only a sage would be able to manage them by rights of blood and bounding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So, in order to have peace, you need a sage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" the female bear repeated. \"And right now, you are the only human with approval from all the elders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part,\" huffed Yanmir. \"There are many trials for you to overcome. You may not succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And if I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering we are the only ones with a cure for your hand, you should at least attempt the trials or you will never return to normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that had happened, Hinata nearly forgot that her hand was still very much a bear's paw. She flexed it slightly, knowing full-well that that might be some cures for this curse, but considering the olive branch the bears were offering her it probably wasn't worth the risk. She couldn't do jutsu until she was back to normal, and the sloth wanted to make her an ambassador of sorts. It seemed like a win-win, but something didn't feel right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only with slight hesitation that Hinata said. \"V-Very well. I will accept the trials and attempt to become a bear sage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" said Medve. \"Now, where do we begin...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFirst question,\u201d said Yanmir as he faced Hinata. \u201cHave you always been that small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a rather brash question, even for an animal. \u201cP-Pardon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said have you always been so small? With humans, I can never remember. I seem to recall you not getting much larger than you are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do tend to be so tiny, don\u2019t they?\u201d said Medve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite. If you are to be our sage and command any respect amongst the sloth, you\u2019re going to need confidence and the stature to match such a position. You being a meager human simply will not do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata did not like the sound of that. \u201cD-Does that mean\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to become one of us,\u201d finished the female bear. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of physical training, if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after finding the magical pond that turn her hand into part bear, Hinata was still not able or willing to comprehend actually becoming a full bear. She had heard from Naruto that the training to become a sage was some of the most intense and absurd exercises he had ever done, with him almost ending up as a frog at a few points. But this went beyond anything she could imagine the sloth to ask of her for the sake of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do I have to? I mean, there\u2019s got to be some other way to earn the sloth\u2019s respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth bears looked at her in a very unimpressed way. It didn\u2019t take long for Hinata to see why. Bumbling through the bushes of the valley came several very large bears, though not nearly as huge as Medve or Yanmir. They looked to be cubs, all of them around the size as the wood Hinata had saved in the forest. They playfully pawed at her feet, causing Hinata to immediately seize up at the sight of a bunch of animals the size of cars attempting to swipe her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, go on,\u201d said Yanmir, cocking his head expectantly. \u201cIf you can\u2019t earn the respect of mere children, you can\u2019t hope to earn the esteem required to command the sloth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata threw her hands up in surrender as the cubs licked at her face. \u201cE-Enough! I get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedve gave a soft growl, causing all the cubs to cease their attacks on Hinata instantly. They stood at attention as Hinata cleaned herself off of their spittle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReason is not the way of the bear,\u201d spoke Yanmir. \u201cStrength and power show true leadership amongst our ranks. You cannot hope to have either as you are now, therefore you must become one of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d repeated Hinata in a much calmer tone. She needed to keep her composure, whatever the bear\u2019s opinions were on diplomacy. \u201cI apologize, but y-you must understand how difficult it is to simply give up my humanity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d replied Yanmir, gruffly. \u201cYou humans are soft and weak. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to be a bear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d interrupted Medve, earning herself an angry growl from her male counterpart. \u201cI apologize for my mate. He does not understand sentimentality. I know you have some doubts, my dear, but rest assured this is not a permanent process. You can return to normal\u2026Given time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female bear\u2019s reassurance helped Hinata relaxed slightly. So long as what she was getting into wasn\u2019t forever, she could be more comfortable with turning into a bear, as strange as the concept was. Hinata closed her eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Alright, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt last,\u201d muttered Yanmir. \u201cCome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty bear took large strides further into the forest as Hinata and Medve followed close behind. Eventually, the group came to a clearing where there was a large ursine-looking tree surrounded by many other cubs like the ones that had swarmed her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-They\u2019re all children,\u201d noted Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d answered Medve. \u201cThis place is simply a nursery or the first step in the journey for the bears on our pilgrimage. We are here as protectors and teachers, helping those too young to live on their own or those on their first step to joining the sloth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-So, it\u2019s the first step in their journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. A perfect place for you to start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained why the bear that had chased her into the cave in the first place. Hinata\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by Yanmir, who cleared his throat and sat next to the bear-shaped tree. He towered over it. With one massive paw, he pointed in the direction of the \u201cmouth\u201d of the sapling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was motioning towards the strange yellow liquid that seemed to be dripping from the fangs of the tree statue. Upon closer inspection, Hinata saw that the substance appeared to be some sort of sap from the veins of the timber. Considering the pool of water at the entrance had transformed her hand, she could only imagine what this would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no turning back now though. Both giants were staring her down, expecting her to take a sip. Hinata took a few deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes nothing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held back her long hair and dipped her head into the running liquid. Surprisingly, the substance was sweet, like honey. When she had gotten a good mouthful of the sap, Hinata leaned back and swallowed. Then she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d said Hinata, looking herself over for any signs of change. \u201cI-Is this supposed to happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Medve. \u201cTo partake in the Nectar of the Mountain is to begin a long process of transformation which will occur over the course of one month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne month!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do not wish to overwhelm our potential sage with a sudden transformation when the intention is to get you used to the idea of being a bear. A slow metamorphism into a bear over the course of one moon will be enough for you to get used to the changes done to your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than my idea,\u201d said Yanmir. \u201cI wanted to simply toss you into the pool. Less waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gulped. \u201cI-I see\u2026Well, what can I expect then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver the month?\u201d asked Medve. \u201cWell, the first changes will be small, maybe your teeth will sharpen or your ears may change shape. But by the end of the first week, you will notice a great increase in mass and height. The second week is when the fur starts growing in. Of course, the changes aren\u2019t just physical later on, but I shall not spoil the surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt a creeping dread spread over her. She had been prepared for an instant transformation, but this almost felt like torture. \u201cW-What will happen after the full month?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Medve seemed to be smiling. \u201cI repeat. This is to teach you how to be a bear. There\u2019s no better way to learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Should I stay in the grove to learn?\u201d Hinata\u2019s thoughts turned to Naruto and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. You should say goodbye to your family and mate while you can. You\u2019re going to be busy the next few months learning our ways. No human contact will be allowed during that session.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded. \u201cW-Well, thanks\u2026I guess. So, I\u2019ll s-see you both in\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA month,\u201d Medve politely finished. \u201cTa-ta, my dear. I never did learn your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hinata. Hinata Hyuga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you in a month, Hinata.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanmir merely grunted a farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cA-And that\u2019s my report, Lord Hokage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi leaned far back into his chair, facial expressions hidden by both his mask and the mountain of paperwork at his desk. He stared hard into the eyes of both Hinata and her team, as they stood sheepishly in the back of the room. The mission had ended quicker than any of them had expected, with Raz even complaining that they hadn\u2019t really even done anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s quite the tale, Hinata. And how do you feel, exactly? Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, the journey back to Konoha had left Hinata in a sort of daze. She wasn\u2019t exactly coming to terms with her supposed crash course transforming into a bear, it was all fuzzy to her. Even the Hokage\u2019s words seemed distant and foreign as she stumbled in place, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes, I\u2019m fine. Please, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019re sure this is what you want? It sounds like a very heavy price to pay for becoming the new bear sage. If you\u2019re unsure, it might not be too late to go to them and ask to reverse the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata flexed her bear claw a little, uncomfortably. \u201cNo, really, I\u2019m fine. This is the best course of action for the v-village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata noticed that Kakashi wasn\u2019t the only one giving her a worried stare. Everyone in the room, especially Naruto and her teammates, was staring at her with a mixture of pity and concern. Perhaps they felt she was taking this news too well, but Hinata truly didn\u2019t feel anything about it. The panic of becoming a bear was nothing more than a distant memory or a feeling, lodged firmly in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Very well,\u201d continued Kakashi, folding his hands and sighing. \u201cSeeing as you\u2019re so determined, I won\u2019t stop you and will leave this assignment in your capable hands. As you\u2026Progress, I will alert the rest of the village not to be alarmed by your presence. During that time and until you meet with the sloth again, your team will act as your personal guard. They will protect you from any threats while you remain indisposed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lord Hokage,\u201d everyone but Naruto said in unison. The blond ninja instead glared bitterly at his former master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and her team stepped out of the tower just as the sun was beginning to set on the horizon. It had been a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stepped away from the doors, Naruto turned to Raz and handed him a coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaz, go with Spades and buy some ramen. You guys deserve a little treat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all due respect, Mister Naruto, I think we were going to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said,\u201d interrupted Naruto with a more angry tone of voice. \u201cGo take Spades and get some ramen, do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could practically see the Nine Tailed Fox\u2019s aura flare up, intimidating both her cadets into almost fleeing the scene instantly. Naruto sighed as they jumped onto the rooftops and into the night life of Konoha, far out of sight from him and his girlfriend. Hinata pretended to be disinterested, though even if she wasn\u2019t listening, she could tell a fight was coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it was the only way I could earn the trust of the bears. You know that they need to have a sage to learn under them. Besides that, they\u2019ve been isolated from the ninja world for a very long time,\u201d Hinata explained. \u201cWhat if they decided they didn\u2019t like how humans did things or if some rogue ninja was their first impression of humans and somehow managed to become their sage? I couldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s dangerous. You can\u2019t put yourself at risk like that,\u201d Naruto said. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done it too many times to count. Back when you and Neji were young, against Pain, during the war\u2026Each of those times you put your life on the line. What happens if you do it again and you don\u2019t come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it will be because of what I chose. From the moment I became a ninja, I put my life at risk and knew the consequences. I\u2019m willing to die in order to protect whatever I value, just like you.\u201d Hinata then placed out her transformed pawn and reached out for Naruto\u2019s hand. The blond was confused for a second, but took it before Hinata resumed. \u201cDo you remember your nindo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It was to never back down or run from a challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is a ninja way you believe in, then why would you ask me to do the opposite of it? I don\u2019t want to run, so don\u2019t ask me to avoid doing something you would for the sake of others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto fell silent and his expression was somewhat disappointed. He folded his arms and looked down before opening his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Naruto said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose you is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust have faith in my skill and resolve, then you\u2019ll never have to worry again.\u201d Hinata took her bearlike paw away from him. \u201cAlright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026Commander Hyuga.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you can still call me Hinata, Naruto.\u201d Hinata said to him. She could tell Naruto was trying to be more respectful, but the way he said Commander seemed hard for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew, thanks. So are you going to rest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go see the sloth of Bears again once I finish resting and have time to prepare. I will send a letter for you, Raz and Spades to join me later on once I\u2019ve fully gained their trust..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha. Be safe, Hinata.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lavender eyed young woman nodded. Even without jutsu, she was determined to make her way and learn as much as she could from the bears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later Hinata was back with the sloth of bears. During this time Hinata found herself having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings. While it was training ground for cubs and a place with virtually no conflict or danger she couldn't\u2019 help but worry about her mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata knew that the task set before her was an important one, but she secretly feared failing. Hinata had grown quite a bit since her days as a genin. She remembered when she was younger and meek, too afraid to do much at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then she had faced her fears, become a chunin, faced many threats in the ninja war and grown to become a powerful ninja in her own right. Now wasn\u2019t the time to let doubt take hold. This was the time for her to move forward and do what she could for the village. She believed what she had told Naruto, and more importantly she believed in herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u2018Just remember your nindo,\u2019 Hinata reminded herself. She decided it would be best to get the lay of the land and better understand the place where she was. She saw several young cubs at play. Either climbing trees or playing with eachother. They seemed so energetic and curious that it reminded Hinata somewhat of her academy days. Other children were as rambunctious as the young cubs were, even if the young bears were about the size of small buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata walked, she began to feel strange. She couldn\u2019t quite place it, but something felt somewhat different. Nonetheless, she decided to go towards a nearby river and wash her face. Once there, she looked at her reflection. Nothing there was different and her body seemed to be the same as well. Hinata chalked it up as her nerves and merely washed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, she was completely washed and felt much more alert. That was when she looked at her reflection and noticed something odd about her teeth. One of them seemed to be looking sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her index finger, Hinata poked her tooth and found it was more sharp, as were a few others in her mouth. She hadn\u2019t expected her teeth to change first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled at her reflection and found herself chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFinding your first changes appealing?\u201d asked a female voice. Hinata gasped when she realized it was Medve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, Medve. I was just surprised by my new teeth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is only natural. Those fangs are rather different from your human ones. Still, they should prove useful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure they will.\u201d Hinata gave a gentle smile. \u201cSo, what brings you out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI merely came to have a morsel or two,\u201d Medve said as she pointed to the river. \u201cThe fish should be swimming about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. Would you like to see me try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded, seeing it as a good chance to learn. She watched as Medve started to paw at the fish, trying to catch them. Hinata looked at her own paw and wondered if she would be able to do the same someday. It was something she resolved to do well while she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about Medve felt naturally motherly. No doubt it was the reason she was chosen to look over the place. While she had a moment alone with her, Hinata decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata stared intently at the river, watching the salmon swim with the currents in a struggle to escape being consumed by the massive maw of Medve. She noticed a few fish were fleeing from the bear's jaws and heading down the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Hinata bared her teeth dropped face first into the water. She tasted the sweet flesh of the fish between her fangs as she lifted her head from the river, looking up to the pleased face of Medve. It took Hinata a moment to realize what she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Hinata. It appears your instincts have sharpened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata spat the now dead fish out of her mouth, no longer amused with the sudden changes that had come over her. With her human hand, Hinata tried to clean her tongue off of the stench of fresh fish, she could still feel the scales between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I have no idea what came over me!\u201d Hinata had completely lost her cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, my dear, it was nothing bad. Your instincts as a bear are simply kicking in. Soon, you may feel the desire to hunt or overeat for the winter. This is all natural, Hinata.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked up at the giant bear then back to the now limp fish lying on the rocks. After a few deep breaths, she calmed down. This was natural as a bear. She couldn\u2019t freak out over something trivial like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Hinata said, bowing slightly to the matron bear. \u201cI-It was just strange. It was almost like I had no control over myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Medve, nodding knowingly. \u201cThe animalistic thrill of the hunt. It\u2019s a common emotion that many of you humans first experience and can\u2019t control. It\u2019s a good thing we bears merely have diets consisting of fish and berries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was suddenly very grateful that she didn\u2019t have a carving for meat. This was all a distract shift in tone than the somewhat peaceful and tranquil experience she had been having up until this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-How overwhelming will these emotions be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re so concerned about them, why don\u2019t I teach you? Come. Let us fish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata followed the giant bear closely as it stomped off to a more active part of the brook. The fish were literally jumping from the river, and Hinata felt a strange urge to eat them which caused her to salivate slightly. Medve came to a halt at the water\u2019s edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, you are to catch for me one single fish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, you have to wear this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedve reached around her side with her giant bear claws and produced a small thin bit of cloth, like a blindfold. She dropped it in the air and it trailed down to the ground in front of Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are to place this cloth around your eyes so that you cannot see what you are doing while fishing. You are to rely on all your other sense to catch the fish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gulped. As a Hyuga, her family relied heavily upon their eyesight. The thought of blinding herself to complete this task drastically increased its difficulty. But, reluctantly, she wrapped the black linen around her eyes and tied it tightly. Even with her Byakugan, she was blind as a bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I supposed to fish like this?\u201d she asked, stumbling over some rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmell, sounds, and feelings,\u201d replied Medve. \u201cUse your other instincts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Hinata managed to waddle into the river, shivering as her feet broke through the cold surface. In fact, she couldn\u2019t feel anything but the frigidness of the river soaking her toes. She sensed that she was going into deep water and tried to focus on where the fish might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt something brush against her leg and swipe at it with her bear claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust relax,\u201d reassured Medve. \u201cUse everything that you have to your advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the cold, Hinata attempted to meditate while standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she couldn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything, like Medve had suggested, the more she focused the more she could detect something. It wasn\u2019t sight that was painting a picture in her mind, but sound. She could hear the fish jumping up and out of the river, and if she listened hard enough she could hear their splashes underneath the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she had to do was wait patiently for one unlucky salmon to linger near her and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSWIPE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift motion, Hinata brought down her bear paw on fish from above. The shock must have knocked it out and it lingered in the river before Hinata removed the blindfold to see what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, indeed,\u201d said Medve. \u201cAnd you managed to trigger the next phase of your transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Hinata noticed when she looked at her reflection in the water, next to the unconscious fish were two fuzzy shapes poking out at the top of her head. Gasping, she grabbed the two new appendages and felt the warm fur between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-My ears\u2026What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot to mention,\u201d replied the matron bear as she stomped over to Hinata in the river. \u201cThe elixir you consumed causes the changes to happen more rapidly if you actually embrace the aspects of the bear. Simply put, the more you learn to become the bear, the quicker the change will happen. You can choose the speed. It doesn\u2019t have to occur in one month. But no matter what you do, the transformation will occur in at least a month\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Hinata was hearing Medve correctly, that meant that the more she studied with the bear matron, the quicker she would learn to become a sage. But it also meant sacrificing her humanity sooner as well, and there still would be things she\u2019d want to do before fully becoming one of the sloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Hinata\u2026</span></div></div>",

All of them were in a melancholy mood, no small surprise considering the recent events of the War. Konoha was still being rebuilt after the Pain attacks. Now it seemed all anyone had time for was preparing for battle. Everyone, that is, save for the three girls who had found time to enjoy a small afternoon tea break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you call us here, billboard brow?\" Ino finally muttered, having gotten tired of the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura closed her eyes, pretending not to hear the last part of Ino's sentence. \"No real reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out at the wide open sky. \"I just figured that with the coming battle...I don't know...It'd be nice to just get one more moment to hang out with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're making a big deal out of nothing if you ask me.\" Replied Ino. \"Things will turn out fine, like they always have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Don't know...You saw what happened to the village after that last battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we still ended up fine, as you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Still I-Ino...\" said Hinata, finally gathering the courage to speak up. \"I-It's nice to e-enjoy a beautiful day.

Come on now, I'm not that stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura still continued to grin. Though Ino wasn't going to admit it, she could feel it. They all could. Change was coming, something big was on the horizon. The coming war had everyone on edge. It made Sakura wonder if afternoon's like this could ever be spent again. So carefree. So simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered and shook off the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coming storm was nearly here. But it was nice to spend another day \"normally\" before it finally happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Which one...\"</i> Whispered a hooded figure.

He couldn't put his finger on it until he looked at her nose. He loudly announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata! What's up with your nose? It's all flat and pig-like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata feel her nose and realized it hadn't reshaped itself from pressing against the plate when she ate the cake.

She had spent half the night trying to pry her nose back to normal but she only ended up hurting herself. A violent rumble almost knocked her off the chair as her stomach let her know it was good and hungry. Hinata grabbed her stomach in pain as she went downstairs to have breakfast. Unfortunately when she arrived, there were pots and pans on the floor as well as water everywhere. Hinata spotted a yellow sticky note that said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, Naruto decided to see what happens when you leave an explosive note in the dishwasher. All the food got ruined so we had to throw it away. We're getting more but it may take awhile. Don't trip over the cups and plates on the floor. -Sakura\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's stomach rumbled angrily. She felt like she was going to die! She had to eat something...anything! She looked around the kitchen and discovered a closed bottle that read \"Pig-Out Sauce\". Without thinking she grabbed the bottle and twisted the cap off. She chugged the entire bottle in a matter of seconds and breathed a sigh of relief. The sauce was surprisingly very filling. Without looking where she was going, she took one step forward right into a small black cup with no handle. Balancing herself against the counter, she picked her left foot and saw that it was wedged into the cup, making her foot like like a little black hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be joking...\", said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to pry her foot from the small cup but was forced to hop backward on one leg. Unwittingly her right foot hopped into ANOTHER black cup of the same kind. Without proper friction with with the floor being wet, Hinata face first onto a pile of cups and pots. When she opened her eyes again, she couldn't move either of her hands. She tried to pick herself up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now...this isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were lodged in the same small black cups as her feet were. Refusing to give in she tried using her teeth to pull the stuck cups off her hands but could not succeed. She couldn't even get a decent grasp on the ground to herself off the floor for some reason. She was stuck on all fours with arms and legs that looked like they had hooves.</span></div></div>",

Hinata was confused when she looked over and saw a curly pig's tail begin to form over her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what *oink* is happening to me??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body was readjusting itself to a more pig-like form. She felt her spine flatten and become parallel to her arms and legs, forcing her to look up to see ahead. Her ribs were also widening to give the appearance of a barrel like torso. She could feel bones shifting and cracking as they remolded into a pig form. Her jacket was becoming tighter. She almost looked like a very skinny pig now. Finally Naruto showed up just as the tingling began to fade.</span></div></div>",

It turns out it's an old magical recipe used by pig herders from the north. It creates the greatest flavors you may ever taste, but too much of it will transform you into a pig for your gluttony.

She just wanted to rent a room in an inn and sleep. Naruto spent the whole walk to the nearby motel trying to make her laugh or forget about their lack of success. Eventually he gave up and bought them a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll go to those mountains tomorrow, okay Hinata? I think I heard that truffles grow on mountains better...or maybe that was moss.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHinata just stared at the floor as they walked to their room. She didn't seem to notice a ninja from a nearby village was walking towards them too. She was a brown haired girl with a low cut fishnet shirt. She apparently didn't see Hinata either and bumped into her snout with her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same bright flash of pink that happened earlier filled the hallway, resonating from both girls. Naruto had to cover his eyes with his arm. When he opened them there was a full grown sow in a pile of clothes where the ninja had been standing, sitting obediently. Hinata had changed too. Instead of the barrel-like pig shape, her body was in the form of a normal girl. Mind you she still had her snout, ears, tail, hooves, and everything else but she looked somewhat normal at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto, (snort)...what just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't Hinata....I think you turned that girl into a pig...but then became more normal...What did you do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I didn't do anything (oink)!

That's what the tablet meant by spreading the gift! You can turn girls into sows with a bump of your nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts were buzzing through Hinata's head.

Buta, where are you?\" Aiko asked, after the duo finished exploring the room, when they were finished they went back to the hotspring, now to see even more pigs, but there was a woman in the pool with them, petting a brown haired sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey youu! are these pigs all yours?\" Hiroko yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense, cute, aren't they?\" the girl asked, the steam from the baths was making her features vague, even as the girls went closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, but do you know where our friend, Buta is?

Naruto grew more and more worried. He needed to tell someone about this. Sadly every person they came across was transformed or scared off by the intimidating army. As he sat on Sakura, he tried to think of a way to wake up Hinata.

Hinata Hyuuga was happy with her stomach full, but noticed that she had eaten the whole damn cake, and a lot of it had ended up on her shirt and skirt. She had to clean herself up or she would get in trouble with eating the whole thing. If she didn\u2019t look like she had eaten the cake then maybe nobody would notice. She still didn\u2019t know that things were changing on her body, but she snuck away to the bathroom. She closed and locked the door before slipping off her shirt and walking over toward the sink to clean it off. It would be a little wet but she could always just say that she had spilt something on herself, no big deal. She turned on the sink and ran the water over the icing and cake crumbs that had spilt on it. Looking from her shirt toward the mirror, she gasped when she saw that her face had grown a snout for where her nose was and her ears became long and pointed at the top. Her nose looked like an upside down heart and it was starting to become long away from her head. She reached her hand out to touch her nose and rubbed it toward the snout part. Was she dreaming, maybe that cake had caused her to fall asleep or pass out. She dropped the shirt in the sink and turned off the water as she turned around to feel her ears and finally realized that her body was begging to change. She had no idea what from, but it was definitely scaring her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like she was becoming shorter and shorter as her legs and arms were becoming hooves and her clothes were becoming much too big for her to wear. She fell down from where she was just standing at to fall down on to her clothes that no longer fit her. She let out a squeal loudly and looked down at her hooves on her feet and \u2018hands\u2019. She looked as her underwear, bra, and her other clothes lay around her and she sat there naked. She looked around and began to cry with confusion and fear. She didn\u2019t know what she was going to do and definitely didn\u2019t want to get caught while she in this form. She was a pure purple pig with light pink eyes and was definitely different from all the other pigs out there. Hinata didn\u2019t want to get eaten either. The female pig walked over toward the door and looked at the door knob, jumping up; she found it amazing that she was able to open the door with her teeth. She let go of the knob and ran along the side of the wall hoping to get outside to find someone to help her, maybe the Hokage. </span></div></div>",

Sure enough, there was a small mouse hole at the foot of the tree. Hinata quickly dove for it and reached in deep, which was easy because of her now smaller size.

Now come on, we're going to find this scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever mouse was growing in her hands, she looked around and saw that it wasn't the mouse that was growing but it was she that was shrinking. Her jacket was covering her like a giant dress now. Fur started sprouting up all over her body like hot little needles popping through her flesh. Her mouse started to itch and began to grow out. IT became more of a snout than a nose as the end turned black and wet. Long hairs were popping out of her lengthened cheeks, forming mouse whiskers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was a little less than two feet tall by the time the changes stopped.

The wolf tilted his head to the side.  \"I want to become strong enough to protect my family and prove myself to my father and cousin.  But mostly, I want to protect this young man I like.\"  The wolf nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why I am saying this.  I don't know if you can understand me.  I just needed to get some things off my chest,\" Hinata said, as she finished mending the wound.  Hinata rose and backed away.  She looked at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope fortune favors you a bit more and I don't see you injured again,\" Hinata said.  The wolf nodded and turned  to leave.  He took a few steps and turned to Hnata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof!\" hesaid.  Hinata looked at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she asked.  The wolf jerked his head to the woods and walked a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof!\" the wolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to follow you?\" Hinata asked.  The wolf nodded and walked  on.  Hinata bit her lip.  \"I hope I do not regret this.\"  She walked after the heavy wolf.  He, in turn, started to run.  Hinata had to run to keep pace  She moved quickly after the beast until the came to a meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky wolf sat with an interesting gleam in its eye.  A smile formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1:  The wolf jumps onto Hinata, biting her and slowly she turned into a she-wlf with a big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2:  This wolf is a summoned creature looking for a master to make a contract with.  He offers Hinata the contract and a chance to become the Wolf Sage.</span></div></div>",

It was called \"The Legend of the Wolf Lady\". The legend told of a woman who was gentle and chubby. She followed a rather husky wolf, who was injured like the same wolf that Hinata followed. The woman healed the husky wolf and the wolf led her to a sacred temple, as the wolf made a deal with the woman that healed him. Through this deal, the woman was forever changed by her pact with the wolf, changing her into an obese anthropomorphic wolf with mystical abilities that no ninja could wield; Nature itself. Through her new abilities, she was greatly respected by most of the countries in the world, including the Five Great Shinobi Countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Hinata saw that the temple's large metal doors began to open, daring anyone to enter inside. Due to her nervousness, Hinata wanted to head back to the training grounds and try to forget about the temple.

Hinata's reaction was of surprise and disbelief, believing that the Wolf Lady was just that; a legend. However, once the shock and awe died down some, Hinata got herself a good long look at the living legend before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the story, when the woman became an obese anthropomorphic wolf, she had snow white fur, as well as keeping her human hair. In reality, Hinata noticed that despite sitting down on the floor Indian-style, the lupine woman in front of Hinata must have stood around 7 to 7 and a half feet tall in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one of her most distinguished features was the amount of fat on her anthropomorphic body, as the large lupine woman sported a large apron belly, a big pair of pillow-sized furry breasts, and a set of thick fat furry legs. In the back, each of her buttcheeks were the size of beachballs, as the excessive amount of body fat cushioned the Wolf Lady upon the hard temple floor she was sitting down upon and meditating, just as Hinata noticed the lupine woman's furry wolf tail slowly wagging from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the thick fat-coated arms and a pair of plump paw-like hands &amp; feet, Hinata could also notice that the obese anthropomorphic wolf woman in front of her was also wearing a loose but large red silk open kimono with silver markings on the kimono, exposing what she wore underneath the vast garment; a large red silk bra, and a pair of red silk loincloth panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, from looking at the very entity before her, Hinata couldn't believe that the legend of the Wolf Lady was actually real, that SHE was real.

Sure, the Hyuga Clan was one of the most powerful clans in Konohagakure, but Hinata never did expect a corpulent anthro wolf woman to recognize her as a member of the Hyuga Clan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..how...how do you k-know who I am?\" Hinata asked, wanting some answers as to what was going on, as the Hyuga heiress started fidgeting with her fingers a bit, showing her timid and somewhat submissive demeanor out of her own nervousness.

Seeing this gave Hinata a shocking surprise, seeing that the living legend herself was a member of the Hyuga Clan. In response, Hinata spoke to the Wolf Lady and said, \"Those eyes! Y-You're-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A member of the Hyuga Clan? Correct. Well, to be more accurate, I haven't been a member of the Hyuga Clan for merely 2 to 3 centuries. *giggle*\" The Wolf Lady answered, interrupting Hinata in the process, as well as revealing that she was far older than she appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 to 3 centuries?! But...B-But that's not p-possible, n-nobody is a-able to live t-that long!\" Hinata said, becoming skeptical as to how the Wolf Lady was able to live for such a long period of time. But then, as the Wolf Lady stood up from her meditation, she walked toward the timid Byakugan user and replied, \"Actually, my dear. When you become a Wolf Sage like yours truly, your lifespan is extended while your age progression is slowed down to a major degree. After all, even though I am a mere few centuries old, I am physically in my early to mid 30s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what the Wolf Lady had said to her made Hinata both surprised, but very curious at the same time.

I mean, i-if you're looking for someone to t-take your place, M-Ms. Wolf Lady, then why not c-choose Neji o-over me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom seeing how she was doubting her abilities, the Wolf Lady could see that Hinata was definitely in lack of self-confidence, due to her own father was always deeming her as unfit to be the Hyuga Clan's heiress. So in response, the Wolf Lady sat down beside the gloomy Hinata, showing how large in both size and bulk she was compared to the Hyuga heiress.

Is...I-Is that the wolf's name, M-Ms. Wolf Lady?\" Hinata asked, now knowing the wolf's real name. In response, the Wolf Lady looked back at the Hyuga heiress and replied, \"Indeed it is.

My name's Sakuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...it's nice to meet you too, Sakuya.\" Hinata answered, looking back at the Wolf Lady known as \"Sakuya\", as the Hyuga heiress began to feel much less nervous than she usually was. She wasn't sure how or why this was happening, but one thing's for certain; Hinata felt...happier when she was with Sakuya.

But, um....what do you mean, Sakuya?\" Hinata asked, both a little curious and unsure about what her large lupine friend was trying to tell her. So in response, Sakuya slowly stood back up onto her thick bulky furry legs and plump paw-like feet, subtly showing how large she was compared to the Hyuga heiress. From there, Sakuya turned her lupine head to look at Hinata and answered, \"I think it would be best to show you, Hinata of the Hyuga Clan. Walk with me, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to know what Sakuya was talking about, Hinata did what was asked from her, following the thick Wolf Lady, despite not straying her eyes away from Sakuya's thick bulky furry booty, as the Wolf Lady's large hips &amp; waist slowly swayed from side to side. Finally, Sakuya stopped at a large painted mural carving of what appeared to be of a woman becoming a large anthropomorphic wolf, as the mural carving was lit up by a strange blue flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakuya...what, um...am I looking at, exactly?\" Hinata asked, looking up at the mural, using her Byakugan to sense and see it, before turning off her ability. In response, Sakuya looked back at the Hyuga heiress and answered, \"What we're currently looking at this moment, is a mural depicting the Contract Ritual. Those who accept it are blessed by the Wolf Goddess herself, Amaterasu.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly recognizing the name when the Wolf Lady spoke of it, Hinata quickly looked at Sakuya and said, \"Amaterasu? B-But isn't that-\" \"The name of a Kekkei Genkai slash Ninjutsu? You are correct. However, it isn't just the name of a series of Ninjutsu attacks used by the notorious Uchiha Clan, my dear Hinata. It also happens to be the name of a female deity we Wolf Sages worship and give praise towards. And don't worry about living human sacrifices or anything like that, Amaterasu isn't into that sort of deity appeasement, anyway. *giggle*\" Sakuya replied, reassuring the timid Hyuga heiress that Amaterasu wasn't someone or something that the twisted Orochimaru would worship, making Hinata feel a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I don't understand, why a-are you telling m-me all of this, Sakuya?\" Hinata asked, still somewhat confused as to why her newfound friend was explaining all of this to her. Then, in response to what the Hyuga heiress had said to her, Sakuya slowly turned around to face Hinata, knelt down on one knee to lower herself down to the Hyuga heiress's height. From there, Sakuya put both plump paw-like hands upon the shoulders of the Hyuga heiress, still locking eyes with Hinata and answered, \"Hinata, the reason why....I'm explaining all of this to you personally, is because....well, I am asking if you want to become a Wolf Sage....like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing what Sakuya had to say, it was a lot to take in for Hinata. After all, she heard the Wolf Lady ask her to become a Wolf Sage like her, causing the Hyuga heiress feel a little uneasy. \"I know....that from what I ask of you is a lot to take in, Hinata. Believe me, I was in the same position as you are currently in when I made my choice to become a Wolf Sage all those centuries ago.\" Sakuya said, doing her best to reassure Hinata, because it felt like looking into a mirror for the large Wolf Lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as she was taking this all in, Hinata kept thinking back to the one person that was the very reason she wanted to get stronger; Naruto Uzumaki. Aside from proving her father that she wasn't weak, Naruto was the core reason why Hinata kept practicing her abilities repeatedly, trying to become a faster, stronger, and more nimble Shinobi, all to gain the blonde male ninja's romantic affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me; The reason why you've been trying to get stronger is because you're in love with someone, aren't you Hinata?\" Sakuya said, snapping Hinata out of her mental decision-making, causing the Hyuga heiress to blush a great deal, enough to cover half of her face in beet red, as well as confirming what the Wolf Lady had theorized. In response, Hinata began to stutter from the embarrassment while she spoke and asked, \"What?! B-But how d-d-did y-you-\" \"Know about your crush? You can say that I heard everything you said to Osiris while I was meditating. *giggle* So tell me; who's the lucky man to get your heart all fluttery, hmm?\" Sakuya replied, curving her plump lips into a curious fanged tooth smile, wanting to know who Hinata had a crush on exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute or two before Hinata had summed up her remaining courage to say the name of her crush to Sakuya and said, \"His n-name...is, um...N-Naruto. Naruto Uzumaki.\" \"Wait a minute, Hinata! Naruto Uzumaki? As in THE Naruto Uzumaki? The golden-haired jinchuriki that holds the infamous Nine-Tailed Fox inside his own body?!\" Sakuya exclaimed, surprised to hear that the Hyuga heiress actually had a crush on the one and only Naruto Uzumaki, judging from how shocked she was, whether her Byakugan eyes were wide open or how her mature and sultry tone of voice sounded more surprised &amp; shocked than the Wolf Lady's seductive demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing some from thinking about Naruto, Hinata spoke toward Sakuya and said, \"Heheh. Yeah, Sakuya, that, um....that definitely sounds like Naruto. But, um...why do you sound so surprised? Are you and the other Wolf Sages....afraid of him?\" \"What? No no, it isn't anything like that, Hinata! It's just that....I've never expected you to be having an actual crush on him, that's all!\" Sakuya answered, shaking her plump paw-like hands to show Hinata that she wasn't fearful of the blonde jinchuriki of a Shinobi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Naruto has been more along the lines of a popular and interesting topic to discuss during Wolf Sage gatherings. But then, once she noticed Hinata lowering her head downward in a upset tone, Sakuya figured out why the Hyuga heiress was so hesitant, as the Wolf Lady spoke to her and asked, \"I'm guessing that would explain why you seem so nervous about what I offer you, huh? You're afraid about what Naruto will think of you, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response that Hinata could give was several nods, which made Sakuya wrap her fat furry arms around Hinata, pulling the Hyuga heiress straight into the Wolf Lady's bountiful bosom, before letting go to look back at Hinata once more and said, \"Hinata, I can....understand the stress of it all, but I promise...no, I swear that Naruto will still have feelings for you, even if you're a big fat furry wolf girl like yours truly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, I'm not trying to sugarcoat it, but....once you become a Wolf Sage, you can never be human again.

I mean, I know that I won't be human again if I go through with this, but....I-I don't know why but I feel so excited about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That excited, huh? *giggle* Well, it sounds like you're gaining some confidence there, Hinata. Alright then; If you truly are this excited to become a Wolf Sage, then I won't keep you waiting any longer, Hinata.\" Sakuya said, just as she gave Hinata a few pats on the top of her head, while the Wolf Lady curved her plump lips into a fanged tooth smile. But out of nowhere, Hinata suddenly leapt toward Sakuya, wrapping her arms as best as she possibly could around the Wolf Lady's body, hugging Sakuya's fat furry belly, noticing how soft it felt to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after hugging Sakuya, Hinata lets go of her loving embrace on the Wolf Lady, as the Hyuga heiress took a few steps back so Sakuya could see her and asked, \"So, um.....how exactly do we plan on, you know, turning me into a Wolf Sage like you, Sakuya?\" From hearing what the Hyuga heiress had asked to her, Sakuya could understand Hinata's curiosity about how this was going to work out exactly. However, the Wolf Lady already knew just how to carry out the deed of making Hinata into a Wolf Sage, as Sakuya looked back at the Hyuga heiress with a fanged tooth smile on her plump lips and answered.....</span></div></div>",

Do you remember when I explained to you earlier about the Contract Ritual?\" Sakuya said, putting both plump paw-like hands on her large waist &amp; hips, displaying a playful fanged tooth smile on her plump lips. Fortunately, the information about the Contract Ritual was still fresh in Hinata's mind. From there, she looked back toward the Wolf Lady and replied, \"Yes, um...I still remember you telling me about it. W-Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Oh, let's simply just say that we're going to perform the Contract Ritual....on you!\" Sakuya answered, having a teasing look in her demeanor, being a little excited about what Hinata would look like as a Wolf Sage. \"Um, are you sure about t-this, Sakuya? I-I mean, do you even know how to do this....Contract Ritual?\" Hinata asked, becoming a little uneasy about the ritual, worried that something could go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding the Hyuga heiress's concerns, Sakuya reassured Hinata by kneeling down on one knee, putting her plump right paw-like hand on Hinata's left shoulder, and spoke to the Hyuga heiress as she answered, \"Hinata, I've earned much experience from the past few centuries as a Wolf Sage, learned many abilities in the process. After all, you wouldn't be the first Shinobi I have performed this certain ritual on. In other words, you are in a pair of capable experienced hands, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what Sakuya had said to her, Hinata felt much more relieved from what the Wolf Lady had confirmed to the Hyuga heiress, regaining her newfound confidence, showing a confident look on her face, as she looked at the large Wolf Lady and said, \"Thank you, Sakuya.\" \"Anytime, Hinata of the Hyuga Clan. Now then, what do you say we start preparing for the Contract Ritual, shall we?\" Sakuya replied, where she and Hinata gathered a few necessary things for the Contract Ritual, making sure that everything goes smoothly like clockwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after setting up the necessary preparations, Sakuya was ready to perform the Contract Ritual for Hinata, drawing out a 10 foot diameter circle using white paint and writing an enlarged kanji symbol that means \"Wolf\" in translation. Once it was done, a large amount of chakra started to flow through the ritual circle. Judging from what she was seeing &amp; sensing, Hinata could tell that whatever sort of deity Amaterasu was, there was definitely a lot of powerful chakra flowing inside the ritual circle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after the immense flow of chakra started emanating within the ritual circle, Hinata then noticed a figure descending toward the ritual circle, landing inside it, untouched by the immense flow of chakra energy. In appearance, the figure looked like 7 &amp; a half foot tall anthropomorphic wolf with snow white fur. Judging from it's physique, the anthro white wolf was definitely female, as it's tail was a little over 3 feet long and was shaped almost like a calligraphy brush, with the tip of the tail a black hue, as if it was used like a paintbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom head to toe, the female anthro wolf had these glowing crimson orange across it's body. And like Sakuya, the anthro wolf was a little on the heavy side, only the weight on the lupine entity was spread into more of a hourglass shape, with a pair of Triple F-Cup breasts, and evenly matched waist and hips. However, like Sakuya, the female wolf entity was wearing the style of clothing, but the garments had a golden ornate yellow lining to the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, from getting a good long look at the voluptuous anthro wolf, Hinata could only guess that this was the Wolf Goddess Amaterasu. Upon seeing Amaterasu for the very first time made the Hyuga heiress feel....nervous, on the inside. After all, she was face-to-face with an actual Goddess! Shortly after she was summoned, Amaterasu was already aware of Hinata's presence, as she sensed Sakuya from behind. Turning around to look at the large Wolf Lady, Amaterasu telepathically spoke toward Sakuya, the goddess's voice sounding compassionate but commanding at the same time, and said, \"I assume that this is YOUR doing, Sakuya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, Lady Amaterasu. The reason why I have summoned you is because of the young girl standing before you. Her name is Hinata Hyuga, and she truly wants to become a Wolf Sage.\" Sakuya replied, revealing the Wolf Goddess why she summoned her, despite Hinata not being able to hear Amaterasu's voice like Sakuya can. From there, Amaterasu slowly turned around some, and looked at Hinata, who stood there frozen somewhat, either from shock &amp; awe or slight nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this gave the Hyuga heiress a good long look at the Wolf Goddess's enticing pair of pale sapphire blue wolf eyes, which had this subtle hint of sheer Celestial power, the kind of power a God or Goddess would possess in their heavenly grasps. But suddenly, Hinata heard Amaterasu's voice for the very first time, as the Wolf Goddess telepathically spoke toward the Hyuga heiress and said, \"Tell me, young pup; Are you truly here for the Contract Ritual to become a member of 'my family'? Or...are you here for....other reasons?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Sakuya did give her some advanced warning to not be afraid when seeing Amaterasu, Hinata felt like she couldn't move. Sure, she willingly wanted to become a Wolf Sage, but having a really close encounter with a deity that was capable of squashing her like a bug made the Hyuga heiress's heart best at a faster pace, as if her fight-or-flight response was on the brink of kicking in any minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the physical tension the Hyuga heiress was enduring, Amaterasu knelt down on one knee, looked Hinata directly in the eyes and asked, \"Are you afraid of me?\" \"....N-No. Just....n-nervous.\" Hinata answered, doing her best to keep calm in front of the Wolf Goddess. Fortunately, Amaterasu could understand that despite showing a sense of fear in facing a much more powerful entity, the Hyuga heiress still showed signs of courage underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Amaterasu had a maternal aspect to her personality, treating the Wolf Sages like her own children. So from seeing that Hinata wasn't actually running away the instant she was summoned made the Wolf Goddess respect the Hyuga heiress's efforts. Then, as a test to prove Hinata's courage, Amaterasu stood back up to her full height, then extended her right paw-like hand out toward the Hyuga heiress, tempting her to grab the goddess's hand and walk inside the ritual circle with the voluptuous deity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you truly want to obtain the same power a Wolf Sage possesses, then you will take my hand...and step inside the circle alongside me, Hinata Hyuga.\" Amaterasu said, looking at the Hyuga heiress with her pale blue lupine eyes. Due to wanting to win Naruto's heart, Hinata was left with no choice but to accept what the Wolf Goddess offered, as the Hyuga heiress grabbed Amaterasu's right paw-like hand, as she gently pulled Hinata inside the ritual circle, beginning the Contract Ritual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she took the first step inside the 10 foot wide circle, Hinata thought the flowing chakra was going to fatally overwhelm her. After all, there was so much chakra emanating inside the ritual circle that you had to be a celestial deity to withstand that much chakra energy. But instead of simply just overwhelming her with inhuman amounts of chakra, Hinata felt perfectly fine, as if Amaterasu was absorbing the chakra to use in the Contract Ritual.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now fully immersed inside the ritual circle, Hinata had passed Amaterasu's test with flying colors, easing some of the stress she was feeling when the Hyuga heiress heard the Wolf Goddess telepathically speaking to her once more and said, \"Impressive. Despite showing a hint of hesitation, I must congratulate you for your courage, Hinata Hyuga. Tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she said those last two words, Amaterasu used her powers within the ritual circle to lift Hinata off the ground and levitate her, having the Hyuga heiress's back facing the floor, separated from the floor by merely 4 to 5 feet. \"How does such a shy timid pup like yourself be capable of showing much determination?\" Amaterasu asked, finishing what she said to Hinata seconds ago, all while the lupine deity began to manipulate and alter the chakra inside Hinata's body, causing the Hyuga heiress's body to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Contract Ritual was sort of a two-person job; One person would keep the chakra flowing, while the other person, a God or Goddess to be precise, would use the abundant amount of chakra energy to change and transform the person volunteering for the ritual, or in this case, Hinata. The first parts of Hinata to change during the ritual was her height, weight, &amp; body shape, as the Hyuga heiress painlessly felt her anatomy alter to a major degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew to be around 7 feet 4 inches in height, causing her clothes to groan and creak from the changes, as Hinata's spine extended to an extra 2 and a half to 3 feet in length, growing what would become her wolf tail. From there, Hinata felt her body becoming both strong and bulky, as her new muscles were adding onto her already existing muscles, while a layer of body fat coated her newfound lupine muscles, starting to make the Hyuga heiress almost as big as Sakuya currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while she was gaining a new set of curves, Hinata felt Amaterasu manipulate her body's chakra into a more...lupine physique, as the Hyuga heiress lost her hearing for a moment or two when her human ears were changed into a pair of white wolf ears as big as a man's hand, placing said ears on the upper sides of Hinata's head, regaining her hearing once again. \"I apologize for your loss of hearing moments ago. Sometimes, it requires to detach certain nerves of the body for an easier desired transformation.\" Amaterasu said, reassuring Hinata that it was simply part of the process in the Contract Ritual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Hinata felt her face stretching into more of a lupine snout, her teeth and tongue to fit with her snout, as her hands and feet began to look slightly more paw-like, growing black leathery paw pads on the inner parts of the hands and the soles of the feet, along with the nails becoming like a pair of black wolf claws. Although her old clothes were now laying on the floor tattered and torn apart, Hinata felt this odd tingling sensation throughout her body, where Amaterasu began to have snow white fur sprout all over the Hyuga heiress's transformed physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after the physical transformation, Hinata's change into a Wolf Sage was nearly complete. Commencing the finishing touches, Amaterasu used her celestial powers to paint a glowing crimson orange marking upon Hinata's lupine forehead, which looked exactly like the Hidden Leaf Village insignia. But then, the glowing orange Hidden Leaf insignia dissipated, causing these mystical glowing crimson orange markings to appear on different parts of her both body, on both sides of her physique. This also caused her Byakugan eyes to change color, taking on a golden yellow hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, Hinata's transformation was truly complete, and had now become a Wolf Sage. From there, Amaterasu slowly lowered the lupine Hinata gently onto the floor, knowing that her work here was done and the Contract Ritual was complete. However, the transformation took a lot out of the Hyuga heiress, leaving her extremely exhausted due to having both body and chakra altered for this new form she now bears, as Hinata slowly closed her eyes and fell unconscious, trying to regain her energy from a good long rest. Though by the time Hinata regained consciousness, she noticed that Sakuya was talking to someone that wasn't Amaterasu. But rather, it was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, Hinata's vision was a little blurry from being so exhausted during the transformation into a Wolf Sage. However, as a Wolf Sage, her hearing and sense of smell was majorly enhanced, recognizing who was talking to Sakuya; It was none other than Team Kurenai, and....Naruto! Upon hearing his voice, Hinata wasn't sure if she should super happy that he came for her, or if she should be extremely worried about how he's going to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Hinata, Naruto began to notice her regaining consciousness, as he quickly went over to the Hyuga heiress, then looked back at some of the other members of Team Kurenai and yelled, \"Hey guys, she's awake!\" \"Ow! Not so....loud, Naruto. Please stop...yelling. *moan*\" Hinata replied, slowly sitting herself up, realizing that she now sat on what appeared to be a strong durable bed, probably Sakuya's guest bed from the looks of things, as she grabbed the side of her head due to Naruto yelling while she was using her newly enhanced senses, causing Hinata to hearing this ringing noise in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the ringing subsided a moment or two later, just as Kiba and Shino came over to check on Hinata, all while Team Kurenai's leader, Kurenai Yuhi, held a kunai against a downed Sakuya's throat, keeping the large Wolf Lady under control, as Naruto looked at Hinata, rubbing the back of his head and said, \"Eh, sorry about that, Hinata. Didn't know you had a headache.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that, N-Naruto. It's just that, um....my ears are a little more sensitive to, um...sound, that's all.\" Hinata replied, her senses returning to their normal parameters, just as she became fully aware that her team leader was putting a kunai against Sakuya's neck, threatening to slit the large Wolf Lady's throat if she made a single move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurenai...what are you doing to Sakuya?\" Hinata asked, getting Kurenai's attention, as the experienced jonin turned her head to look at the anthropomorphic wolf that was Hinata, still holding her kunai against Sakuya's throat, and replied, \"What does it look like I'm doing?! Hinata, you've been gone for almost two days straight, and we had to search for you! Even Naruto was worried about you! What you think we were doing while you were held hostage here?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was known to be a shy and timid girl by her friends &amp; family, Hinata felt something swelling inside of her. It almost felt like...rage. After all, her own team leader was threatening a fellow Hyuga and Wolf Sage due to a misunderstanding. So in response, Hinata did something completely unexpected by both her team and the very person she had feelings for; Hinata....snapped, as there was a subtle growl noise in her tone of voice and yelled, \"Held...hostage!?! Listen here, Kurenai; I wasn't kidnapped against my will whatsoever! I came here out of my own free will, to prove that I wasn't some weak girl! The person you're threatening wasn't holding me hostage, she was HELPING ME!! AND IF YOU EVEN HURT HER, I'LL BEAT THE LIVING CHAKRA OUT OF YOU!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what she saw on the look of the faces of Hinata's teammates and Naruto, Sakuya could definitely understand that seeing Hinata snap was something of a very rare occurrence, as the large Wolf Lady thought, \"Okay, note to self: Don't piss off Hinata. Ever!\" As she let out a few deep breaths to calm herself down, Hinata noticed the reactions on Naruto &amp; Team Kurenai's faces, now realizing that there was a misunderstanding, where one of Hinata's teammates, Shino, stood up, looked at his transformed teammate and said, \"So, what you're saying is that this is all a misunderstanding. Am I right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Yes, Shino. This is all a big. STUPID! Misunderstanding.\" Hinata growled, venting out some of the remaining anger out from her new body, still frustrated about Kurenai threatening Sakuya, all because of a misunderstanding. Not wanting to provoke a frustrated Hinata, Kurenai slowly got off of Sakuya, sheathing her kunai in the process. After all, from seeing how angry Hinata was moments ago, Kurenai knew it would be best not to tempt fate.</span></div></div>",

After all, she was currently in a relationship with fellow jonin, Asuma Sarutobi, so Kurenai could tell the obvious signs of having romantic feelings for someone. And she knew who exactly Hinata had feelings toward: Naruto Uzumaki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shino, Kiba....let's wait outside. I think we need to give Hinata and Naruto some....space.\" Kurenai said, ordering Hinata's two teammates to head outside with her. At first, this made Naruto somewhat confused as to what Kurenai meant when she said to give him and Hinata some space, just as Sakuya figured she should do the same, following Team Kurenai outside her home. Though, it was only a matter of time before Naruto realized what Kurenai meant, as the blonde Shinobi turned to looked at the lupine Hinata, and she did the same, still blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence between the two of them, as Naruto slowly rubbed the back of his head, then finally spoke to the transformed Hinata and asked, \"So...I'm guessing you're...you're in love with me, aren't you Hinata?\" In response, Hinata slowly nodded yes, still blushing from admitting the truth to him, just as she moved her golden yellow Byakugan eyes to look at Naruto and answered,\"I....I-I know what you m-must be thinking right now; Big old me turning myself into a big ch-chubby wolf person just to w-win your...your heart over a-any other g-girl that has approached you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....i-it's true, N-Naruto. I.....I,um....I-I l-l-l-love y-you. There, I said it; I love you, Naruto Uzumaki.\" Hinata said, rubbing her plump right furry arm with a left paw-like hand a little, showing how nervous she was in confessing her love toward Naruto in-person, like facing her inner demons, only they weren't demons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on Naruto's end, he couldn't explain it, but for some odd reason he liked this new look for Hinata a whole lot more than what she originally looked like before her transformation into a Wolf Sage. Maybe it was because he was a jinchuriki, he wasn't sure, as Naruto began to blush a little himself and replied, \"Ya know, for some weird reason, I....I actually like your new look, Hinata.\" </span></div></div>",

I mean, I'm not sure why, but uh....You can say that you're more attractive this way in....in my eyes, Hinata.\" Naruto answered, stuttering a little since he was new to the whole \"having a romantic relationship\" thing, since the thought of having a girlfriend never occurred to him until now.

However, even though she was now proclaimed a Wolf Sage, Hinata was currently a mere Wolf Sage in-training, which meant she wasn't ready to go back out into the world....yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long discussion, Sakuya explained to both Naruto and Team Kurenai that Hinata would have to stay at the temple for at least or two, where the Wolf Lady would be training her in being a Wolf Sage. At first, they were a little doubtful in this idea, but the Hyuga heiress simply reassured them that she'll be alright &amp; promised to return to Konoha Village once her Wolf Sage Training was complete. Left with no other choice in the matter, Naruto and Team Kurenai simply said their goodbyes to Hinata, then returned to Konoha Village, leaving the Hyuga heiress with Sakuya to begin her training as a Wolf Sage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n// One Week Later... //<br>\r\n(the background music used for Hinata's return to Konoha Village is the song \"Kushi's Ride\", from the video game, Okami.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven long days had passed, as the sun sets over the horizon and the moon rose into the sky, turning day into night. However, little did the sleeping creatures of the vast forest knew, but a certain Hyuga heiress turned Wolf Sage was sprinting her way back home at breakneck speeds, faster than most Shinobi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the aggressive pacing of her training, Hinata had finally become a full-fledged Wolf Sage, as she transitioned between a bipedal sprinting stance and a quadrupedal sprinting stance, like a wolf running through a forest hunting for it's prey. Even though she had gained an extra hundred pounds from eating, Hinata felt like she was as light as she was when she was human, just as she performed a powerful locomotion jump that launched her through the tree line and reaching a few yards above the forest canopy, showing just how strong the Hyuga heiress had now become, before landing back on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to prove that she was now a Wolf Sage, Sakuya gave Hinata her own Wolf Sage robes to wear, which were both loose and form-fitting, as well as being somewhat revealing and showed off Hinata's new curves. The robes looked similar to that of Sakuya's robes, but with golden yellow lining to the robes. However, to show the difference, Hinata was wearing a pair of red silk sleeves with golden yellow linings on both of her plump furry arms &amp; paw-like hands, as well as her chubby furry and almost lupine legs &amp; paw-like feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she was sprint and quickly maneuvering her way through the dense vast forest, Hinata had this feeling of...freedom, just as she leapt from cliffside to cliffside. To her, it felt...relaxing, in a way. No berating from her own father, telling her that she was weak and not worthy of being a member of the Hyuga Clan, or anything like that. It felt really good overall. Finally, after about 45 minutes of quickly traversing through the immense forest, Hinata had finally returned home to Konoha Village, looking at the village on top of the same plateau where the Hokage statues were built into the cliffside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about Naruto, Hinata couldn't help but display a fanged tooth smile upon her slightly chubby snout. And to let the blonde ninja know that his lupine girlfriend had returned home, Hinata let out a long and booming howl from stop of the plateau, just as there was a crescent moon behind the Wolf Sage. The howl lasted for almost 3 long minutes, just to make sure that Naruto had actually heard her. But then, looking down toward the streets of Konoha Village, Hinata noticed that....</span></div></div>",

In the middle of the room sat a few scrolls and what looked to be an amulet. Hinata walked over to the scrolls and saw that they were all sealed with what looked to be a seal with a wolf's head howling on it. Hinata shakily touches the Amulet and sees that it has a picture of a wolf as well. She looks at the corpulent wolf and she asked \"w-what is this?\" She was utterly surprised when the wolf answered in a strong but caring voice \u201cmy name is Sirius and I have been watching you for a very long time now.\" Hinata was clearly in shock but showed no weakness to the wolf\" I am here to give you a few things to help you become stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this for me Sirius, I mean why me why not my cousin Neji.\" Said Hinata. Sirius looked at her and responded \u201cBecause you are the only one that is kind and caring but you have the most power; you just need to release it.\" Hinata looked at the corpulent wolf and said\" But I\u2019m worthless I can\u2019t do anything right why me.\" Sirius looked at her and said \u201cbecause you never give up even if you don\u2019t notice that you do it.\" Hinata looked at the scrolls and the amulet and asked \"well since you want to help me go ahead.\" Sirius walked over to the pedestal and pointed at the amulet. \u201cThis amulet will let the wearer merge with my form, giving you my power that you can use; you will also be able to use jutsu without hand signs. But be weary with this one for once you put the amulet on you will be able to revert to human form but you will have either ears or a tail but my weight will only be in wolf form. You will look like you always do but just with the tail, ears, or both.\" Hinata looked at the amulet with awe as it glowed a deep blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the scrolls are few special jutsu and one of them is a contract for the wolves. The reason why nobody has had the wolf contract in so long is one, it only belongs to the Hyuga clan, and two and not many people have ever found it. \"Said Sirius. Hinata looked at Sirius and asked \"W-who was the last one to find it?\" Sirius sat there for a second and responded with\" you\u2019re grandmother\" Hinata looked in shock as her own grandmother had the wolf contract. \u201cI will sign it but one question, are you one of the wolf summon?\" Sirius looked her in the eye and happy said \"no I am not a summons but I will be able to merge with you through the pendant so I\u2019m kind of like you\u2019re partner now.\" She looked at the wolf and smiled at the thought and said \"ok now that that is cleared up where do I sign the contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius opened the scroll with his muzzle and told her to bite her finger and sign her name in blood. She did what Sirius told her that everything was complete and he howled in the temple. For some reason Hinata rally liked he wolfs howl. She left the temple with a couple of new scrolls that contained jutsus for her to practice. She decided to go into town since she had lost track of time and it was morning.

The hyperactive knucklehead ninja was eagerly awaiting the lavender eyed kunoichi's arrival. She smiled when she noticed he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, I made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hinata! I was getting worried for a bit.\" Naruto said. Hinata blushed and twiddled her fingers shyly before going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, when you said you needed me for something important, I figured I needed to come immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is, it's of the utmost importance.\" Naruto said, \"I'll need you to come with me. You're the only one who can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right, I won't let you down!\" Hinata replied as she followed Naruto. The two continued to walk until they at last came to ichiraku ramen. Naruto stopped in front of the stand, a serious expression on his face. \"Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awright, here we go!\" Naruto said before he sat down at the stand and patted the spot next to him. \"Hinata, sit here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure, but Naruto, what does Ichiraku Ramen have to do with the important matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a special challenge Teuchi and Ayame made. I need a partner to beat it.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" she asked, just as vaguely evil laughter was heard. Moments later, Teuchi appeared almost from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, after all Naruto has undertaken the Super Ramen Bowl Team Challenge!\" he explained. \"I'll have you know, this year it'll be tougher than ever to complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well, Hinata and I are going to win, believe it!\" Naruto annouced. Hinata still seemed confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the Super Ramen Bowl Team Challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a game Naruto and my dad play once a year.\" Ayame explained as she approached. \"Naruto sometimes runs a high bill, so he and my dad have this challenge. If Naruto and one other person eat a combined total of 50 bowls of ramen, they both get free ramen for six months and all of Naruto's previous debt is forgiven. If he loses, he has to pay the old debt plus an extra 100 Ryo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, usually Choji helps me, but he caught a bad flu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so you didn't ask me first?\" Hinata asked, sounding dejected. She was already a bit surprised the serious matter was something so silly. Naruto shook his head, oblivious to her wounded pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I asked bushy brows next, but he was busy training, Shikamaru said it was too much of a pain, and Kakashi and Iruka both turned me down. Still, I know you and I can totally beat this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Alright.\" Hinata replied, glad he at least trusted her. \"I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I knew I could count on you!\" Naruto said, \"So we're set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but Ayame and I have added brand new ramen to the menu just for the occassion, even extra filling ones Ayame and the Cooking-nin created. Are you sure you're ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive.\" Hinata affirmed, trying to show Naruto she was just as invested.

Let me give you a hand.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amulet glowed an ominous green color, though it wasn't noticeable to anyone else besides Hinata. Suddenly, there was a ravenous hunger that overtook the shy ninja, like she hadn't eaten in days. With as much dignity as a tranquilized rhino, Hinata dumped her face into the first bowl in front of her and practically swallowed the ramen whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto dropped his chopsticks as he and the chefs of the ramen bar looked on. \"H-Hinata, slow down a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slurped up the last remaining noodles of the bowl, she giggled nervously only now realizing the mess she had made of herself. \"Opps, pardon me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" said Naruto, trying to catch up to Hinata. \"Just save some for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did little to halt the onslaught on her feasting as Hinata continued to plow into the bowls before, eating more than she could ever possibly think she could. It wasn't long before the line of full ramen bowls were turning into a mountain of empty ones. Three bowls, seven, fifteen, twenty two with no signs of slowing down. Compared to Naruto's meager thirteen finished bowls, Hinata was on a roll as she struggled to fill the empty void of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite eating the entirety of her half of the contest, Hinata was still hungry for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, she patted her stomach and was greeted by a surprise. It had extended outwards, beyond her jacket, by almost half a foot. She gave it a slight jiggle and felt the ramen wobble around inside her. \"Oh, my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What's the matter?</i>\" asked the voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach!\" she shouted internally as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes...What were you expecting when you took in my power? Don't fear though, it won't stay that way for long.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You'll see after a night's rest...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ominous as that thought sounded, Hinata's belly still rumbled with hunger and she looked greedily over at Naruto's pile of ramen. Without another thought, she grabbed one of Naruto's bowls and chowed down. Naruto did nothing to stop her, if anything he was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a bigger eater than me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short fifteen minutes since the contest began, it was over with Hinata eating thirty six bowls and Naruto only finishing with fourteen. Her belly was resting on the table and she let out a big sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We did it, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" he laughed and patted her on the back. \"You did, is more like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her for a second, causing Hinata to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Naruto?\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto turned to Hinata to ask her how she was doing but when he turned to her she was now a beautiful white anthromorphic wolf.

O-oh...What's t-this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the dreary colors of the rest of the town, this buildings was bright and illuminate. Neon lights covered all around it, displaying an image of a hooded woman holding a sign that read \"Lady Xana: Fortune Teller Extraordinaire\". Giant red arrows jutted out from the building pointing down at the door, making Hinata feel a little bad she didn't notice the building to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wonder what t-this is about...\" Hinata opened the door and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was completely dark making her think she would have to activate her Byakugan to see anything. However, a loud voice boomed from within the darkness, startling her. \"Welcome young lady...\" A row of candles lit up by themselves around a circular table. Two bean bag chairs were placed on both ends of said table, and in one sat the same hooded woman depicted in the neon lights over the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um h-hello...I must h-have come in the w-wrong door...excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous my child!\" With a puff of pink smoke, the woman disappeared and reappeared behind Hinata. \"I've been expecting you! Have a seat! Here, have some delicious herbal tea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hinata could react, she was already sitting comfortably in the bean bag chair with a cup of steaming tea and the hooded woman had sat down across from her. She smiled at Hinata and motioned for her to take a sip out of the glass. It tasted like clumps of grass mixed with mud, and Hinata quickly spit it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much herbs, huh? Sorry, I'll get it right next time...Anyway, who are you my dearie? No wait! Don't tell me...H-Hina....Hinata!

Her eyes rolled back into her head as she chanted some foreign words that Hinata couldn't understand. With a sudden jerk, she was back to normal and gave a soft chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Hinata...What happened back there wasn't your fault. Ms. Kurenai is a strong woman, and everyone makes mistakes...But no... I sense that is not why you are upset. It's deeper than that...You see yourself as weak...You always have. But don't you see? You have the will to change yourself. Naruto showed that too you. Still, you lack confidence...Perhaps I can help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXana clapped her hands twice and a strange bowl of dust appeared on the table in front of Hinata. The dust looked coarse and dark, almost like ash. Hinata reached in and took a handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's this do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toss it into the fire and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obliged, the candle in the center of the table cracked and fizzled from the dust.

It was a wolf, howling in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Hinata? Inside of you is an independent wolf, longing to break free. You needn't be afraid of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf disappeared, but Hinata was confused. \"I-I don't understand w-what you mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well...Maybe actions would speak louder than words.

Feeling shame, Aerore left the pack and cried alone on a mountain, until she was comforted by a travelling male fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt these words, Hinata's heart began to beat faster, she looked at the pelt and could feel something deep and intangible exuding from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After hearing her story, the fox had told her that she possessed true inner strength,\"Xana continued \"and that Aerore had something special.

Years later they made their own unique pack, which was the most feared of all in their territory. Aerore lived a very happy and magical life, and died decades later after saving a few lost children. The people of the children's village then took Aerore's skin, and kept it as a testament to her memory. It was passed down from mystic to mystic, and now I pass it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, b-but what do I do with it?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it on when you sleep tonight and tomorrow all will be made clear.\" Xana said, when the clock struck 11. \"Oh dear, I must be going to bed, I'm sorry but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, good night and thank you.\" Hinata said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Goodbye dearie!\" Xana said, glad to be of service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Hinata wore the pelt to bed and awoke early the next morning to find...</span></div></div>",

The sun had barely come up and she was the first one awake in the entire house. As she got to her feet, she suddenly remembered about the wolf skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Aerore's pelt! Where is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frantically looked around her room, desperate to find what happened to the sacred pelt. It just so happened that she noticed something odd about herself in the mirror when she looked near her makeup set. Pausing to get a good look at herself, she noticed that there were whisker marks on her cheeks much like Naruto's. Two sharp teeth poked out from her mouth as well, she smiled to see that her canine teeth had grown tremendously over night. It was almost like she had become more wolfish overnight. Even her eyes looked different, her irises were thinner and more feral looking. There was something else too. She felt stronger, more confident. It was the feeling she experienced every time she saw Naruto. She smiled at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...I feel....great!\" Brimming with energy, she hopped several feet in the air, flipped, and did a handstand. She was able to hold herself up with one finger and push herself off the ground and back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is wonderful! I can't wait for today's mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Hinata found herself skipping across rooftops to her team's meeting place. Hinata had decided to go exploring with her new strength all morning and didn't watch the time, so she was running late. She saw Kurenai in a cast, patiently waiting for her along with Kiba and Shino. Normally Hinata would have been too embrassed to even look her teammates in the eyes for being late, but not today. Today, she had Aerore the Wolf on her side. She jumped high in the air and landed in the center of her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning guys!\" She beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata...\" Said Kurenai clearly confused at her new behavior. \"You're late...and...excited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sorry sensei. I decided to go exploring for a bit and lost track of time. But enough about that, what's the mission today!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Shino and Kiba gave their female counterpart a weird look. Kurenai on the other hand was happy that Hinata had such a positive outlook today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you asked...\" She smiled. \"Here's what we're doing today gang....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had never had a better day than this in all her life. Not only did she not panic again when enemies attacked, but she even managed to save Shino and Kiba from harm. Even Kurenai-sensei had complemented her on her renewed strength and eagerness. But now, Hinata was exhausted after spending so much energy all day. She didn't even have time to eat before she went to bed. She passed out in the early evening, a smile across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day however...</span></div></div>",

It was early in the morning again, but unlike yesterday the pelt was on top of her! Strangely enough, it looked larger than before. Hinata could even see a head and feet. It was almost like one of those bear rugs one would find on the floor of log cabins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How did this get here again?\" She looked over the wolf skin. \"Wait, what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd white note tied to the ears of the pelt, written in a fanciful manner on the cover was \"To Hinata.\" Curious, she opened the letter and read outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you already know what the pelt did to you my dear Hinata. You have taken the aspects of the great wolf Aerore, and are now more confident and stronger. However, do not think for a moment that such a feat is without drawbacks. There are two rules you must abide by or else face dire consequences. I am sorry I neglected to mention them when last we met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst: You may never, under any circumstances, fall under the light of a full moon. Doing so will curse you until the next full moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond: NEVER wear the skin EVER. Once was all that was needed. If you are to wear Aerore's pelt again, you will take her shape. This of course means you will also inherit her vast strength and speed, but at the cost of never returning to normal again. There is NO cure for this, DO NOT DO IT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you need me, all you must do is whisper my name...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Xana, Mistress of Magic, Witch of Wonder, Seer of the Future, Woman of Foresight, Master of Mindreading-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lists of titles went on to the back of the note, causing Hinata to sweat drop. But this note had created a deep fear in her heart. If Xana had mentioned the side effects the night she gave her the pelt, Hinata would have never taken it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So, which rule does she break first?)</span></div></div>",

Also an unexpected result of her changes was that Kiba seemed to have a crush on Hinata, as he was flustered whenever she spoke with him, and stared at her when he thought she wasn't aware (but her Byakugan and heightened senses made it impossible for her not to know.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but it seemed like Hinata and Naruto were growing closer. The Hyuga girl was now brave enough to overcome her embarrassment around Naruto, which had caused a vey happy event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened midday, at the training field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata, there's been somthing I've been meaning to ask you.\" Naruto began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Naruto?\" Hinata asked, her heart began beating faster with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind...Y'know, going on a date with me this afternoon?\" He asked, now it seemed like he was the shy one, as he blushed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all Naruto!\" Hinata said, hugging him. \"So where will it be? Ichiraku?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'll pick you up around five.\" Naruto said, before he reluctantly broke the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed as well and smiled even more, showing her wolfish teeth. \"See you there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce hinata got home she squealed happily, and mentally thanked Lady Xana and Aerore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thn began preparing. She picked out a nice, blue chinese dress with gold trim, as well as a pair of matching cerulean heels. She also set out a pair of Obsidian earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to be sure that she was perfect for Naruto, Hinata went into her tub and took a long, cleansing, warm bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got out and went to get a towel, she found that it was all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, Father did say that he was getting the towels cleaned today...and I can't get a new one while I'm naked.' Hinata thought, before her eyes fell on Aerore's pelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I could use it as a towel for now...That won't count, will it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale eyed girl picked up the legendary wolf skin and used it to dry off her skin, but contact with Hinata's naked body was all it needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pelt fused into Hinata's skin, causing her to fall on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no!' Hinata thought, as she began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst a tail emerged from her backside, much like any other wolf's, then her hands and feet began to become paws, as pads and fur emerged on her shrinking fingers and toes, as well as her limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer torso and main body began to get smaller, more streamlined, and finally her mouth and nose became a wolf's snout, and her ears lengthed and became pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally fur grew all over, and a mostly white wolf was in the room.Aall that remained of the old Hinata was her hair and pale eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, can this get any worse?\" Hinata said aloud, surprised that she could still talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a knock at her door, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then</span></div></div>",

You gotta be done by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was coming in! Hinata held her breath as the door slowly opened. All Naruto saw was her clothing scattered around the floor.

She never stopped, even passing her father on the way out of the Hy\u016bga mansion. This was probably the worst day of her life, she finally had the chance to go on a date with Naruto only to get cursed in the form of a white wolf for life. Tears were rolling down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I have to touch that stupid pelt?! I couldn't leave well enough alone could I!? Why do I always have to mess everything up!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same self-hate and loathing that she had tried so hard to run away from filled within her again like a wave of hot air. She wasn't thinking clearly at all. She ran right under the cover of the dark forest outside of Konoha, wanting nothing more than to be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later, dusk had finally settled but Hinata was not even out of breathe yet. She had stopped running at least, easily miles away from Konoha at this point. Looking around, Hinata had no idea where she was anymore. All of that running had given her time to think. She realized that by running away, she proved that she hadn't improved in the slightest. Still she was cowering away from her problems. Nothing had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe starry sky at least gave her some ease, she walked up to a nearby pond to gaze at her reflection. An unfamiliar face greeted her, but even she had to admit as a wolf she was beautiful. Her pearl white fur softly blew in the wind, along with her black mane. Her eyes were red from the running in the wind and her tears. Hinata was lost, confused, and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed like a bad dream. A nightmare that she was sure to wake up from any second now. But nothing ever granted her relief. She saw in the pond a full moon peaking out from the clouds. Lifting her head to the sky, she took a deep breath and gave the saddest howl anyone had ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did this happen to me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice spoke out from the darkness behind her. \"Because, you didn't listen to the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and saw.</span></div></div>",

With renewed hope and determination, she took off like lightning through the forest. She was already nearing Konoha in half the time it took to run away from it. But something on the wind caused her to stop. Her heightened wolf senses detected something familiar...approaching her fast! Thinking quickly, she dove into the nearby river and awaited whatever was out there to show itself. Naruto and Kiba both dropped from the trees above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Said Kiba. \"I thought I had a scent...but I lost it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on dog-boy!\" Yelled Naruto. \"We gotta find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool your jets Naruto! Half the village is looking for her. You know how important a member of Hy\u016bga main branch is, Lord Hy\u016bga demanded the best trackers. We'll find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father...\" Mutter Hinata to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw her this afternoon...Dammit all to hell!\" Naruto punched a nearby tree, causing it to snap in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax idiot...Here I picked up something from this way. Hurry.\" The two set off on the path Hinata had come from, she took the chance to leave the river and head quickly to the pond. It wasn't far from where she was. In mere minutes she came face to face with a stone statue that greatly resembled her wolf form. A large pond and cave were behind it. She was compelled to go running into the cave, but instead proceeded cautiously. Darkness covered the tunnel but in the distance stood a small light. Hinata started heading towards it but felt something with teeth grab her! She gave a yelp of surprise when another mouth bit her on the back, she tried rolling over to throw whatever it was off when a bright light illuminated the cave. A giant orange scarred fox was walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Spoke the fox, getting a good look at Hinata. \"...By the gods...Aerore?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had the chance to see what was biting her. Little gray and orange wolves playfully nipped her, each of them crying \"Momma! Mommy!\" The fox shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible...That witch took you and...You look...different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am not Aerore...I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could not finish, a cloud of white smoke began to pour out of her mouth. It began to take the shape of a wolf, it was Aerore's spirit. Her kind eyes opened and fell upon the fox, who looked shook up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love...\" Said Aerore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore...What is going on? If that's you then who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midnight by the time they had finished speaking with each other. Aerore introduced Hinata to her pack and explained what had happened with Lady Xana. The great fox growled at her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thousand curses upon that witch! She and her treachery will pay dearly for the damage they have caused!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand...\" Said Hinata. \"Why do you hate her? It was my own fault that it happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Hinata, the first pelt she gave you was a fake. It was merely enchanted and boosted your confidence and strength. My real pelt was the one you found the next morning. It was her intention to curse you all along. She tricked you, just like she tricked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore sighed. \"You recall that story? The one of me saving those children? I did save them, but it was from her. She kidnapped them for they were members of a respected ninja family. She had the intention of holding them hostage, but I foiled her plans. She then cursed me...into the form of the pelt. I suspect...you were another one of her targets Hinata Hy\u016bga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible! Who would want to target me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who indeed.\" Said the fox. \"But this is not the time to think this through. You came here for the moon-water, right my girl? Drink from this. You have until sunrise tomorrow until you return to normal, use that time wisely to set your affairs in order. Afterward...You can stay with our pack until we decide the best course of option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a jar of water with his teeth. \"T-thank you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, you're wasting precious time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata drank as quickly as she could from the container. The water tasted sweet...like lemon tea. She felt cooler, fur was falling off of her in clumps. Soon she could stand upright again. The snout and tail had completely disappeared. She was back to normal (though naked).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it, thank you...\" She bowed to the fox before running as fast as she could to Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaylight would be in a short six hours and there was so much she needed to do!

He ate swiftly and stony faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Dog-boy left me here to set up a camp while he kept looking!\" He yelled to himself \"I don't care how strong his nose is....I need to find Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sniffled a bit. She was absolutely touched that he was this adamant about finding her. It would be hard for her to tear herself away from him after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\" she said, stepping out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde turned to see his dark haired sweetheart \"Hinata!!\" He yelled hugging her. \"What happened to you? I went by earlier a-\" He began, when she cut across him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...I don't have much time. I need to tell you that...Some things have happened and I can't stay at the Leaf, but I needed to let you know I'd be fine.\" she said, on the edge of crying. Naruto looked at her and could tell that her leaving wasn't voluntary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, please tell me why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette shook her head no. \"I can't...My time is short and I have to hurry.\" she said, before she kissed his cheek softly and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Naruto yelled, Hinata paused and looked at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jinchuuriki was certain that he didn't want her to leave again, not without him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Let me go with you! Whatever it is, let me do this with you!\" He said more softly. \"You can tell me everything and I'll do whatever you need.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know about everything, but Hinata could see the determination in is eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto would never accept her, not even her own family would. It hurt beyond belief, but she needed to do this alone. Naruto was slowly approaching her, his eyes filled with confusion and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for you Hinata, now please just stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. But he gently placed both hands on her shoulders. His calm blue eyes looked deep into her tear filled ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" He said. \"You're an important person to me Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would not be able to get away from him. There was only one thing she could do. With her Byakugan activated she struck him in the heart, causing him to cough out blood and fall to ground. Her eyes were being to hurt from the tears. Naruto looked up at her but was unable to move. She had only done enough damage to keep him from following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why Hinata? S-sasuke...and n-now you...w-why can't I s-stop anyone I c-care about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-naruto, please forgive me...I will see y-you again the n-next new moon...Wait for me until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed onto her ankle and passed out. Hinata stood over him for awhile but had to leave, the night was growing short and she could smell Kiba returning. But in her heart, she desired nothing more than to stay there with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn broke over the treetops of the forest. Hinata had been able to write a letter to her father and gather enough food to last her for a month. It hadn't been easy, avoiding being seen with squads of ninjas looking for her, but her new wolfish traits granted her superb stealth. The tasks had granted her some relief from her aching heart and she had managed to complete them all before the sun rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for breakfast, and the great fox had bought a giant deer to feed the pack. Hinata, who had returned to her wolf form, stuck to eating the supplies she had brought much to the disapproval of the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pardon Ms. Hinata. But you must learn to adapt to your new form. Eating human food as a wolf will not strengthen yourself for the fight against the witch-seer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't in the mood to argue so she changed the subject. \"Is there anything you guys learned about Xana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's moved from the lair you discovered her in, so we've been thinking of areas she could possibly be. The witch is not someone who pays no heed to caution. When we find her she WILL be expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed. \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now? Rest. Aerore told me you had a troubled night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is as much a part of you as your flesh and blood Ms. Hinata. What you know, she knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Hinata thought to herself. \"So no privacy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go take a walk.\" Spoke the fox. \"Some adjusting and exploring might take your mind off things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily obliged and set out into the woods.</span></div></div>",

The hag wanted the girl alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasuo laughed sinisterly as he brought the knife up to slice at the poor girl's legs. Hinata couldn't stand by any longer, she jumped out of the forest to attack. Her sudden appearance startled Yasuo and the young girl took the opportunity to her advantage. It seemed she was a skilled fighter as she was able to disarm the burly man before delivering a swift kick to his groin. While Yasuo doubled over in pain, Hinata charged at the thinner man who looked positively frightened. He guarded himself from Hinata's teeth as she violently bit down on his arm. With the ferocity of a true wolf, she easily picked up the man with her teeth and tossed him aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shit, Yasuo run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the girl was already sitting on top of the giant man, giggling away with a knife pointed at his neck. The skinny man cursed again and took off, his arm was badly maimed so Hinata let him go. The girl began to tie up the fallen giant before turning to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore! I knew I'd find you eventually! The old hag wouldn't have gotten rid of you that easy!\" She gave Hinata a giant hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh, I'm not Aerore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and that's what happened Lady Xana...\" Said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXana merely laughed, preparing a cup of tea. \"I know that already; for I, Lady Xana, Witch of Myth, Hag of Knowledge know what you know. I merely sent you and Yasou out to find where that little wolf had been hiding. I knew the girl would lead me right to her, she's so inspired by Aerore the Mutt after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXana poured a packet into the cup and handed it to the bleeding man. \"Here have some tea. It will make the pain of your wounds end faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you m-my lady.\" He took a sip. \"W-what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? You mean 'I'. I will find a way to lure out the Hy\u016bga girl. I never expected her to flee to the safety of that mutt's pack. You, on the other hand don't need to do anything...ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man suddenly started coughed blood. Hacking, he collapsed to the floor. Xana laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much poison, huh? Sorry, I'll get that right next time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't explain to the girl who she was and what happened to Aerore. She figured the best course of option would be to return to the great fox and have him tell her everything. Hinata was surprisingly able to carry both the girl and the giant man on her back with ease and made it back to the cave in no time. The girl seemed familiar with the fox and cubs as well, hugging them all when she saw them. Explanations began and the girl was properly introduced to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kohana! It's a pleasure to meet you Hinata Hy\u016bga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's nice to meet you too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's one of the children that witch was after.\" Said the Aerore's mate. \"A member of a royal family from the north and a skilled fighter...and thief.\" The girl giggled. \"Kohana witnessed Xana's curse upon Aerore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I thought it was odd that you looked so much like Aerore. You're cursed by the hag too huh? I'm sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright...\" Said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you come here, Kohana?\" Spoke the fox in an angered tone. \"That witch could have been following you, you know. We're trying to find a way to fight her without her realizing it. You could have single-handedly jeopardized our chances!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great fox seemed to do a good job of scaring her. \"S-sorry Mr. Vulpes...I j-just wanted to s-see Aerore again...Besides, we found someone working for her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes turned his attention to the unconscious man still tied up in the corner of the cave. He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have...Shall we find out what he knows?\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't even care that both the cubs and Kohana were jumping on her to wake her up the following day, despite it being four in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Hinata! Ms. Hinata! Ms. Hinata!\" They all chanted at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf? W-what is it?\" Hinata yawned sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to play tag! You have to play, Ms. Hinata! Promise you'll play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Alright, alright...Let me just get some breakfast from my pack...\" She hadn't eaten since lunch yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana grinned and held up a brown backpack. \"You mean this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hinata could respond, Kohana and the cubs took off in separate directions into the forest. This left Hinata sitting confused in the middle of the cave. No pack meant no food. Her brain finally jump started, and she chased after the children. As she ran off into the forest, Vulpes stood smirking on top of the cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know Hinata,\" He said to himself. \"That children games are actually physical tests for situations in adulthood? Even a game so simple as tag teaches fundamentals of hunting and tracking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Hinata would have just relied on her Byakugan to track the children. But her wolf form did not grant her use of her previous skills. She was virtually running blind through the woods. A smoothing voice whispered in her head. \"Just relax Hinata and think, what are the strengths of a wolf?\" She galloped down the forest path while thinking, something in the air made her realize the answer. Tracking! She could smell where they were. Kohana had the smell of fresh daisies, Hinata locked onto the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana was hiding up a tree, looking down the road for Hinata. Hinata was easily able to get the jump on her by leaping up the trunk and stealthy sneaking up behind her. She put one paw on the girl's shoulder and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I caught you...Now please, can I have my breakfast? I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana grinned and showed Hinata empty hands. \"Hehehe, I don't have it. I gave it to one of the cubs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed. \"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot...Maybe Luna...or was it Yami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't have made a difference to Hinata, she couldn't even tell the wolves apart. She just groaned and let Kohana climb on her back. \"You're coming with me then...We need to find them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sniffed in the air. She was trying to detect the smell of a wolf. However, she could not tell the difference between another wolf and herself. She almost lost hope but then thought of something else. She homed in on the smell of a nice box lunch...that did it. The smell was coming from a clearing south of her. Jumping gracefully from the tree, with Kohana cheering, she took off to find the cubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the clearing she discovered...</span></div></div>",

She took cover in a bush and peaked out, she was in for a surprise.

He even pawed Naruto in the face when he tried poking the young wolf. Kohana pulled on Hinata's fur and whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that Ms. Hinata? He's pulling Yami by the tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he's a close friend of mine. Listen Kohana, he can't see me like this. If he does I could never face him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh. I get it.

The biggest give away would be her voice, she had to disguise it. Aside from that, Kohana was right. There was no way he could recognize her as anything other than a wolf. With as much calm as she could muster, she quietly walked out of the bushes to confront her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you kindly release him, Mr. Ninja?\" Hinata tried her best to mimic Aerore's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto fell down in shock. \"Gah! A talking wolf!\" The wolf child in his hand was able to break free and happily hopped over to Kohana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for finding my...brother. I'm sorry if he caused you any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto dusted himself off while Kohana and the young wolf chanted, \"Yay! Sister! She's our sister!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...It's no trouble I guess. He sort of found me actually. I'm Naruto, and I'm going to be the Hokage! Who are you? You look kinda familiar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata turned to Kohana and the cub and gave a look that said 'Play along'. \"My name is Aerore. And you're in our territory. What business do you have in these woods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for someone. Yea, have you seen a pretty girl out here? Look, this is her backpack I found it in that little wolf's mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed. \"Um, if he found it...It must have been here awhile. I doubt Yami would steal anything from anyone.\" The young wolf whispered to Kohana behind her \"Yes I would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, well. You're sure you didn't see anyone then? I've been looking for her for days. Isn't there someway you guys can help me track her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's been lying in the forest for a few days I don't think we can help you.

Kohana realized that her joke was hurting Hinata so she tried to console him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you'll find her soon.

I have a fox spirit inside of me.\" Naruto lifted up his shirt to reveal the seal that held the nine-tailed fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the nine-tailed fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Why? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since Hinata had met him, Vulpes looked completely shaken. He lay on his stomach with his paws over his head. Muttering to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fox lord...unbelievable...Let me tell you all something right now. The nine tailed fox is in fact...my own father.\" This of course had everyone in the entire cave yell 'WHAT?!' Vulpes continued with the story. \"Back when I was to marry...my mate, he opposed us. In fact, the reason why our union was so strong was because we only had each other. Both of us were banished from our packs. Needless to say, my relationship with him has been...complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked worried and waved his hands. \"H-hey don't worry! I'm not like him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes got to his feet. \"I know you aren't boy. In fact, I see something of myself in you. But enough storytelling. You were looking for someone correct? Who might that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right! Have you seen a black haired girl around these forests? She has somewhat short hair and pale eyes. Her name's Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, huh...?\" Vulpes thought for a moment, Hinata was mentally begging him to play along and not give her away. \"No sorry. No one besides Kohana has come through these forests in a while.\" Naruto groaned and looked depressed again. \"You're welcome to stay though, my daughter Aerore can show you to a crevice in the cave where you may sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Vulpes-sensei for covering for me.\" Said Hinata a few hours later when she had a moment alone with the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore's spirit came to me and told me everything just before you arrived. You can thank her.\" They were both on top of the cave entrance, looking down at Naruto and the twins below. One of the wolf cubs had Naruto's headband in their mouth and was being chased around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an odd lad...\" Continued Vulpes. \"But I wasn't joking when I said he reminded me of myself. I don't think it's any coincidence that you came across Aerore's pelt. You do look so much like her...after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you think this was meant to happen then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know Hinata. Something like this has never happened before. I do know one thing though...you're going to have to act like a real wolf while that boy's around if you want to keep this act up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's stomach growled. \"I am painfully aware of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it was lunch time, Hinata was forced to eat raw deer with the wolf cubs while Naruto enjoyed the box lunches from her pack. Deer wasn't that bad actually, still Hinata would have preferred it cooked. She could only take a few bites before having enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Aerore?\" Asked Naruto between mouthfuls of sushi. \"Not hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some of my food then? There's enough here for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was about accept, but Vulpes gave her a look from across the cave. \"No...I think I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged and went back to eating.

She couldn't move anymore, yet her body seemed able to move on its own. Aerore was in control of her body. She could feel herself smile slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please to meet you! I'm Aerore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked annoyed, strangely not surprised that a wolf just said something in human language. \"Don't change the subject you damn wolf...You smell just like Hinata. Spill it, who are you really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto told you. I'm from a clan of foxes and wolves in the forest. Really, your nose must be deceiving you.

Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kiba looked ticked. \"You little mutt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, we should go right? You needed ramen and we need to get back to the cave before nightfall. Plus, we're kind of drawing a crowd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople walking by stopped what they were doing to see Hinata talk like a human. The ninjas were indeed causing a commotion. Naruto seemed eager to go but Kiba grabbed him by the collar and pulled him aside out of hearing from Aerore/Hinata. He whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's hiding something Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that dog-breathe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My nose never fails me. Just be careful, okay? I've never heard of this pack before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, whatever alright? They've all been kind to me. Mind your own business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore had returned control to Hinata. Still, the shy ninja was immensely thankful for her help. She could not help but feel Kiba suspected her, but even so she had at least postponed the issue. Naruto didn't bring up their encounter around as they walked back, they continued to pleasantly chat with each other same as before. Vulpes was there to greet them when they returned to the cave. It was already turning red in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we're late Mr.Fox.\" Said Naruto. \"We ran into a friend of mine and got held up some. Where's the girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kohana is hunting with my children in the forest for their dinner. Since you were with Naruto all day Aerore, I took the pleasure of hunting an extra rabbit for you.\" He pointed to the crumpled mass of fur on the ground behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was uneventful. Naruto spent the meal telling Kohana several tales of his missions. The twins continued to giggle amongst each other at Hinata's eating habits. But she did manage to finish half of the rabbit this time, so at least she was improving. After dinner, Vulpes told the group a fireside story to prepare everyone for bed. Hinata had to pretend she knew most of it already, but Naruto and the children were all enraptured by the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so...The maiden perished instead staying with her lover. All of the armies dropped their weapons at such a sad sight. Her sacrifice ended the great war, 'tis a lesson we all can learn. Sometimes for the greater good we must all give up something. But enough tales, time for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww....\" Muttered the twins and Kohana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey put up a slight fight but eventually tired out. The twins collapsed on top of Naruto as he snored a way. Kohana decided to use Hinata's stomach as a pillow and was fast asleep. Despite having only met everyone (besides Naruto) less than a week ago, she felt at piece. Like they were a real family to her. She closed her eyes, tomorrow was another big day...</span></div></div>",

Instead she found herself in a completely empty cave. Yawning, she got to her feet. She wasn't hungry like yesterday, meaning her stomach must have shrunk due to the lack of food. When she went outside to see where everyone was, she found Vulpes staring into the pond. He sensed her approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you'd wake up. You do seem to have difficultly breaking away from your sleep Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed slightly. \"Where is everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are waiting for you to go find them. Well, the twins and Naruto are anyway. Kohana went home for a few days but she'll be back soon enough. I was able to convince Naruto to assist in your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata got worried. \"You didn't tell him what it's really for, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I did not. But it boggles my mind why you would not get it over with and tell him outright. He will find out eventually, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the dirt, somewhat ashamed of herself. Vulpes sighed then gave a soft laugh. \"Still...I suppose it's something Aerore would do too. You really do take after each other so much. Anyway, I told Naruto this was all part of some rites that you must undertake for adulthood. He happily agreed to help out to earn his keep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What must I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply? Track Naruto down in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked. It couldn't be that simple. \"Isn't that too easy? I mean, it's just too straight forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunting and tracking isn't about unnecessary complications such as 'looking for hidden meanings within hidden meanings' that you ninja take pride in. In the wild, you must act with instinct and focus on the goal. Kill or be killed, nothing more. But just to make things harder for you, I had Naruto transform himself into one of the twins. Take heed, he won't be as easy to find as Kohana was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes was right. While Naruto had a distinct scent that Hinata knew all too well, he had the twins sleeping on top of him the entire night. Assuming he hadn't bathed, the mixture of scents would not leave him anytime soon. Hinata would have to rely on more than her nose this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have until noon. Best of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed around the forest in vain. The scents Yumi, Luna, and Naruto had left behind were leading her around in circles. Hinata was beginning to give up hope of catching them before lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think Hinata! Think! Where could they be?!\" She yelled at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was doing so much thinking that her head was starting to hurt. Maybe something Vulpes said was a clue of sorts that would help her out. \"In the wild, you must act with instinct and focus on the goal.\" Well, she certainly was focusing on her goal. What did he mean by instinct though? Wasn't that just reactions to scenarios? The word \"instinct\" continued to ring in her head though. Was she just not thinking ahead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" She muttered. \"This is so pointless! What does this have to do with hunting?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would Naruto be?\" Spoke Aerore's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked several times. \"What do you mean where would Naruto be? How am I supposed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she thought about it. Naruto was a simple person, as much as she didn't want to admit it. He had a childish mind and would think he was safe in an easy to spot place. He'd be somewhere where he could see everything...someplace high. Hinata then remembered a rock ledge near a waterfall in the forest with a large bush. She knew where he was! Without wasting anymore time, she took off for the waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, she had stealthy stalked around the ledge and was approaching the bush from behind. Sure enough, a small furry tail poked out from the plant. Hinata almost snickered to herself in happiness. She did it! She had managed to use pure instinct to find where he was hiding! Without much thinking, she pounced on him and knocked the disguised ninja out of the bush and into the river below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! WHA-WHOOOAH!!!\" Screamed Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLOOOSH! They both crashed into the water below. Naruto poofed back into his normal human form but Hinata didn't let go of him, she was just so happy that she had found him. He managed to drag both of them to shore, Hinata was laughing the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I did it! I found you Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto coughed out the water in his lungs. \"*Cough* Congratulations *Cuff* Aerore...Did you *cough*, have to push me in though?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Naruto!\" She released him. \"I got a bit over excited, I guess. I did it though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was starting to take off his wet jacket. \"I know, I know. Good work. What happens now? Do you like go off on your own or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do yo-\" Hinata almost gave herself away. \"I mean...No, I stay with my father for several weeks until I find...errr...A mate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well best of luck with that. Hmm...you know....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook herself dry like a dog. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...You just kinda reminded me of the person I'm looking for. She would be that happy about succeeding in something like this too.\" He gave a giant grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two returned to the cave to find the twins and Vulpes were waiting for them. Yumi and Luna jumped around their 'sister' with all the excitement of a bunch of two year olds that raided the sugar jar. There was a smile across Vulpes' scared face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, my daughter. You can consider yourself a full grown wolf now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe outstretched his paw, which was covered in some sort of ash, and gently tapped her on the forehead. A black paw print contrasted her white fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, you and I will go on our first hunt together. But for now, let us feast in celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was deer, again. Hinata didn't care though. She felt stronger now, and even more confident than ever before. Eating a fair portion of raw deer seemed like a meager task compared to what she had accomplished. Even the twins did not laugh at her new eating habits. Naruto didn't take his eyes off of her the whole time, though Hinata had the feeling it wasn't because he was interested in her. He seemed...suspicious in a way. All of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

Are you alright!?\" Cried the wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't answer though, his face was starting to lose color. Worst of all, blood began to leak from the corners of his mouth. Vulpes leaned over to sniff the ninja boy's bowl of ramen. He growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's poison!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could feel tears begin to build up in her eyes. \"P-please save him Vulpes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had the power to. But there is little I can do. Thankfully, the poison is only instantly vital when consumed with a liquid. But we may only have an hour to save him! Yami, Luna! Run to Kohana's country. They should have the only medicine that can save Naruto's life! Hinata, I need you to find a special herb in the forest! It will only delay the poison, but it will grant us all the time we will need until the medicine arrives!

She found herself afraid and paranoid. Every second seemed to tick slowly and painfully away as the knowledge that Naruto's life hung in the balance burned into her mind. Aerore provided small comforts though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think back to training Hinata...Relax and stay calm. You will save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stopped short at a ledge.

Hinata growled menacingly but the old woman merely laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to threaten me Hinata? How barbaric. You're becoming more like a wolf by the minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want you evil witch!? Were you the one who poisoned Naruto!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, to lure you out and tell you something. You see, thanks to an idol in your new 'family's' cave I can't touch you within a mile of their home. It's an annoying bit of old magic that saved Aerore from me countless times. I won't eat up much of your time, because I know you're in somewhat of a rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her hand and there was a bright light. It consumed Hinata before dispersing into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go my dear...That should grant us some privacy from our little friend in the pelt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hinata wasn't convinced. \"Why should I trust you!? You've been after me from the very beginning haven't you?! They told me everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you trust them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do! They took me in and support me! They're like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A second family. But have you ever considered that's exactly what they want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked several times. \"What are you saying...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your resemblance to Vulpes' wife is uncanny. Aerore was beloved by many, Vulpes sacrificed so much to be with her as did Aerore to be with him. What are you being trained for exactly, Hinata dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be...more like a wolf...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seer gave a smirk. \"Why do you think that is? Do you think...being more like a wolf will allow you a better chance to defeat me? I may be powerful Hinata, but I am old and fragile. You could defeat me right now if you wished. Those beasts are trying to use you to take the place of their lost one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that can't be true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not possible? I admit my methods are a bit....uncanny. But they are all for the greater good. I tried to help you and I warned you very clearly about Aerore's pelt did I not? Now let me help you again. Don't let these monsters deceive you. They are single minded creatures that chase the first thought that enters their head. They will use you to their needs and Hinata will be no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata!\" Yelled an approaching voice. Xana turned to leave but not before giving the girl one last piece of advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what I said Hinata. Resist them or you'll become them. If you can, I will be able to help you return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disappeared in a puff of smoke just as Vulpes appeared. He seemed out of breath but at the same time happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? I heard another voice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine it was just me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I bring some good news. The poison seems to have escaped the boy's body somehow. He's going to be fine, though he is unconscious for now. Let's go back to the cave together, it's not wise to linger out this far in forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes gave her a look of confusion but Hinata ignored it. Both of them set off back for the cave. The whole time, Hinata's mind with filled with doubt and paranoia. Who in the world could she trust now? Had the witch been right? Had they really just been trying to bring Aerore back through her? She was being to feel more and more uncomfortable with Vulpes but said nothing. Watching from the treetops was the old seer, silently chuckling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...very good. Doubt is perhaps the greatest weapon an enemy has. The more you doubt, the stronger I am in the long run Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the cave...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Hinata had arrived with Vulpes, Naruto was awake and leaning against the cave wall. Kohana and the pups had also made it as the girl checked his health and feed him medicine. They seemed overjoyed that Hinata had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore! It's good to see you again! Naruto's all better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hinata mostly ignored them, she was too confused to be greeting anyone. Though she was relieved that Naruto was alright she decided to go outside to be alone, much to the disappoint of the twins. Vulpes had a worried look on his face when he saw her sulk away. When Hinata was outside staring into the pond and out of hearing range he turned to the poisoned ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better...thanks to you. I don't understand though, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate poisoned ramen...In fact you're lucky you're alive. It must be my father's spirit that expelled it from your body. As for who did it and why...well I think that can wait. The important thing right now is that you're still with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins playfully nipped at Naruto's hands, causing him to giggle. \"Yeah, thanks for everything. Mr. Fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana handed him a vial of brown medicine and told him to drink it. He took a sip and promptly spat the disgustingly tasting drink on the floor, which earned him a slap on the head. He seemed completely better though as he rubbed his new bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes sighed. \"Listen Naruto, I'd hate to impose after such a horrific event. But there is something I must ask you to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hinata gazed at her reflection in the water. On the outside, it merely looked like she was deep in thought. However, within her mind she was having a fierce conversation with the spirit of Aerore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who can I trust now? Certainly, not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, why would we deceive you? My time has long passed, Vulpes and I both know it. I don't know what that witch has told you, but you must believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe you? I've known you for only less than a week! Who's to say this wasn't all some big ploy for me to replace you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you honestly believe her? Do you know how many people she's swayed with doubt and lies!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many people have you!? This whole catastrophe is too coincidental to be normal! I don't trust you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe argument continued to heat up, Hinata refused to hear Aerore out. She was too enraged and too confused that she didn't even hear approaching footsteps from behind her. Naruto was limping near to talk with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she broke from her talk with the real Aerore. \"O-oh, h-hey Naruto. Sorry, I was just...thinking. Are you feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on the ground next to her. \"Don't worry, it'll take more than poison to take me down. I'll be the next Hokage, after all. I heard from Vulpes that you rushed out to find the herbs to cure me. Sorry I didn't need them, but the effort was kind enough.\" He grinned his usual smile at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-still. Are you sure you should be out like this? I-I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, besides you look like the one who needs to be worried over. You seem to have a lot on your mind. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're sure...\" He paused and looked at her for a moment. \"You do remind me of her, the person I'm looking for that is. She used to always keep stuff to herself too, I could never tell what she was thinking. But one day, I think she just got tired of it. That was just before...she left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already getting dark out, they had spent the entire afternoon worrying over healing Naruto. The two of them watched the big red orb in the sun slowly burn into the trees in the distance. It was a view that you would only see once in a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if she's looking at the same sunset somewhere else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't take it anymore. \"I just feel...confused. I don't know who to trust anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what this is about? Come on. I never had a family or friends for the longest time, but you have both. You just need to trust yourself, like I did when I was confused. Your friends and family will support you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea...You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned back at her again. \"There you go. Now let's get something to eat! I only had half a poisoned ramen bowl all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and headed back from the cave, Hinata looked at her reflection a little longer. She had the same grin Naruto had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata mended her relationship with Aerore over the course of the day, causing Vulpes to be more relaxed. Naruto devoured mostly everything in the cave, much to the dismay of Kohana who insisted that he check for poison. Hinata confidently ate more deer this time than Vulpes did, causing the twins to go into shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days went by. Hinata learned the basics of stalking and killing prey with Vulpes every morning, soon she was an expert hunter catching her own meals. Naruto spent every day searching in the woods for Hinata, but of course was never lucky. When he wasn't in the forest, he taught Kohana and the pups the basics of jutsu. Well, the pups merely watched as wolves could not cast ninjutsu. They'd cheer Kohana on and eventually she was able to master the Shadowclone Jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day, Hinata was growing stronger and more adapted to her form. She had almost forgotten what it was like to walk on two human feet. But she still longed to return to normal, no matter how enjoyable the pack's company was. The face of the witch was permanently burned into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe late winter was slowly turning into early spring...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Preparations had been made the following day. Vulpes had taken Hinata on an \"all day hunt\" that would last overnight. Secretly they brought with them a vial of moonwater and fresh clothes. Vulpes would head back the following morning to the cave and tell Naruto that 'Aerore' decided to hunt a big game on her own. This would give 'Aerore' a somewhat flawed excuse to be absent when Hinata returned, but it would be enough to fool the none-to-bright ninja. Hinata had been looking forward to this moment for weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember Hinata,\" Said the great fox. \"When you wake up tomorrow you will be back to normal. You have until sunrise, like last time. And...Be. On. Your. Guard. You were lucky you were in range of the cave when you encountered the witch. If you plan on going to Konoha, you will be vulnerable to any attacks from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" She took a sip from the vial. \"Thank you Vulpes-sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birds were chirping on the new spring day in the pink flowers that colored the trees. Hinata had fallen asleep on a pile of leaves for comfortable. Despite being spring there was still a nip in the air, which she woke up from the shivering. She found herself sitting in a mass of shed white fur. She made her way over to the nearest reflection which consisted of a small puddle and was greeted by a face she hadn't seen in such a long time, her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could have jumped for joy. \"Yes! I'm back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost ran off for the cave without getting changed. Vulpes had stolen a very natural made dress for her from a local village; it seemed to be made out of soft fibers and leaves stitched together. Unfortunately, he had failed to find shoes for her which were something Hinata did not miss as a wolf when she stepped on a jagged rock. But it did not stop her from running to the cave as fast as she could. Strangely enough, her time as a wolf did not halt her hair from growing naturally longer. It swished in the wind and caught the leaves that blew in the air. She looked like a goddess of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, she found herself behind a tree near the cave. Naruto was playing fetch with the twins. Kohana was hard at work practicing to make more than one shadowclone. Vulpes seemed to sense her, sitting vigilant in his favorite spot over the cave. Hinata took a deep breathe. She had rehearsed this moment thousands of times in her head, but now that it was really happening she drew a complete blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...You can do this...You know you can do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to take a step from the tree, but chickened out at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I kidding? What am I going to say to him? Hi, sorry for running away for weeks? I can't do this...I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her body began to move on it's own again. Aerore decided to take matters into her own hands. Despite Hinata screaming at her body not to move, she found herself inching out into the open. She was in plain sight of Naruto, who dropped the stick in his hand that Yami was chewing on. He shook his head and rubbed his eyes at what he thought was just his mind playing tricks on him. Hinata was red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hin...Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi...Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could not ask for a more thicker atmosphere. A deep silence filled the ears of both ninjas, aside a slight gust of wind. Kohana was the only one out of the group who didn't know who Hinata was, because she had never seen her human form before. She tugged Naruto on the pants as Vulpes descended from his stoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto, who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata...the person I was looking for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S Hinata? Huh, I always thought she'd be uglier...\" This earned her a smack on the head from Vulpes, as he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings. You must be the one Naruto here was looking for. Pleased to meet you, I am Vulpes and this is my pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...Pleased to meet you too Mr. Vulpes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another awkward silence between the two. Hinata couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning he went up and hugged her. There was a big smile across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like you said...You came back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned the smile and the hug. At that moment, she knew everything was going to be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana had managed to sneak some tea from her home to the cave. She was boiling it for everyone as Hinata and Naruto talked. Naruto had hundreds of questions for Hinata but thankfully none of them were too difficult to lie about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where have you been Hinata!? You've had everyone worried!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you...I needed to go training in the forests somewhere. I can't tell you where, it's a secret and important assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on! I won't tell anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she wouldn't give him any answers. He eventually gave up with a pout as the tea was served. Hinata was almost used to tearing her food and drinking with her tongue, that she nearly made a fool of herself sipping the tea. Naruto wasn't too bothered with it though as he burned his mouth on it and was screaming in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad...\" He said to her as he fanned his mouth. \"That you couldn't meet Aerore. She acts just like you sometimes, I'm sure both of you would get along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gulped and looked at Vulpes. He gave her a look that said \"You're going to have to tell him sooner or later.\" She tried to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anyway Naruto...I was wondering. Since I have the day off and all...Would you l-like to go on that...date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and half-expected a no. \"Yeah! We can go to Konoha and tell everyone you're back! Wait- Kohana, you mind if we skip today's training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do min-!\" Vulpes smacked her on the head again. \"Ouch! I mean...I guess you can go....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" He grabbed Hinata by the wrists, causing her to drop her tea. He then dragged her along before Hinata could thank Vulpes for the tea. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were a speck of dust down the road, Vulpes shook his head and chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it father?\" Asked Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...He's just like me when I was younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, the two dating ninja where at the gates of Konoha. It was a new day and the people of the village were just waking up. Both of them had a giant smile on their face. There was so much to do and so much time to do it all!</span></div></div>",

Tailing them out of sight was a certain orange fox, who smoothly walked between the crowds of people. Xana huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulpes! I should have known you wouldn't leave them alone. How rude of you to spy on their date! You know me well enough that I wouldn't directly attack them. I use more...subtle methods.\" She chuckled and took a sip of her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get some breakfast Hinata! How's Ichiraku sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had a 'why am I not surprised' look but laughed. \"That sounds fine Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds they were sitting at the bar. Naruto eagerly banged his utensils together for the food while Hinata sat quietly listening to the people whisper about them thanks to her superior hearing. \"Is that Hinata? I thought she was on training.\" \"She looks so beautiful now...\" \"How did an annoying guy like Naruto get a girl like her?\" \"I think I'm in love...\" Hinata wasn't too bothered by the gossiping though, not with Naruto at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had already finished his sixth bowl by the time Hinata could eat one. \"Errrup! Ahh, that was good. So what do you want to do today Hinata? It's your day off after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you didn't mind Naruto...I'd like to see my teammates and family again before today's over and let them know I'm well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, sure! Uhh...\" He reached into his pockets but had an embarrassed look on his face. \"D-do you mind paying? Heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to giggle. Thankfully, the dress Vulpes had got for her had a little bit of money in it. It would be just enough to cover the bill. They quickly paid the shop keeper and left for the center of the village. Unfortunately, Naruto was not watching where he was going and smacked right into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! What the-? Dog boy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was on the ground rubbing the part of his face where Naruto had run into. \"Naruto...Watch where you're going goddammit....huh?\" He seemed to suddenly notice Hinata standing behind Naruto. \"Is...that Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kiba...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Hinata's back dog boy! Isn't it great? We're going on a date together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was a little embarrassed to say the least. \"Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...that right...\" There was a hint of anger in Kiba's voice. \"Well, welcome back Hinata. I don't know what you see in an idiot like him...but whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed him glare at Naruto as he took his leave, Naruto didn't seem to see it though. He turned to Hinata and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of crap!\" Said Kiba to no one in particular as he threw a kunai knife at the alley wall. He was in an abandoned backstreet cursing randomly at anything in sight. Little did he know, he was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she like him? He's a complete moron! I've known her longer, I'm her teammate for god sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw a glass cup in the direction of a hooded woman, it hit her right in the head and she collapsed. Quickly Kiba ran over to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shit! Sorry! I didn't mean to throw that at you! I'm just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady laughed as he helped her to her feet. \"No harm done my boy, these reflexes aren't what they used to be. You seem angry though so you probably had a good reason to be chucking things at random. I used to throw my cat around the house when I was upset. Tell me, what's on your mind? Talking about it helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave a short laugh but shook his head. \"No, I don't think it's something I can talk about with a complete stranger. Let alone one I just beamed in the head with a cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hohoho, I'm fine already my child. Come now. You'll feel better, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Naruto and Hinata had visited her teammates to let them know she was fine. Kurenai and Shino both seemed much more happier than Kiba that Hinata had returned, if only for a day. Afterward, they headed to Hinata's home to stay with her family for lunch. Her father seemed much more open and somewhat relieved that his daughter was safe, much to Hinata's surprise. Still, he insisted that she wear a less \"savage\" outfit and gave her a fresh pair of her old clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, the couple spent the whole day looking around Konoha. They saw the famous sights and monuments, enjoying each others company. At midday, they were on top of the Hokage monument alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.\" Said Naruto. \"After all the times I've spray painted up here. I never realized how beautiful it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a gorgeous sight indeed. One could see the entire village and forest from there. \"Yeah, it's really something isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed nervously and put his arm around her shoulders. Hinata leaned in closer. It was clumsy and awkward, but both enjoyed a long kiss as the sun reached it's highest point in the sky. They never stopped holding each others hands. Below them sat an orange fox that sighed at the couple, reminiscing his own days of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying this is a magic amulet?\" Said Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes indeed my child. It has the spirit of a powerful man-beast inside of it. He was tortured by the loss of the one he loved, who rejected him. But still, his soul prevailed against the waves of hatred for his heroic deeds. Just wear it and immediately you will feel his power and will consume you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks...Uh..Mrs....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xana, dear. And thank you for listening to an old woman's tale. You've earned it. Now I must be off, take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXana stepped out of the alley leaving Kiba alone as he stared into the blood red ruby of the golden chained necklace. She chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should keep the two 'lovers' busy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a small party at one of the clubs in Konoha, Naruto decided to take Hinata there as the last major thing to do on their date. The club was basically a giant rave. Lights and colors blinked all around above the dancers. The music hurt Hinata's sensitive ears a little but she soon got accustomed to it. Eventually, after they sat down for a bit Naruto worked up the courage to ask her to dance. She happily agreed. They did not realize that Kiba had been watching them from the crowd the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had nearly made himself sick from all the spinning, he had apparently inherited two left feet. One thing led at another, and the two found themselves desiring some privacy. They exited through the back and into a small balcony jutting out from the building. A giant white orb lit the sky above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Said Naruto. \"Look at that moon. It's huge tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's very beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long kiss, followed by a small pause. They stood silhouetted in the moon. Naruto was very happy, but to Hinata the moon was a cruel reminder of how short their time was. She had to tell him; here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Naruto...There is something I need to tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't know how to say this exactly...\" She stared into his blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish, the backdoor of the club was kicked open. There stood Kiba with a look of disgust on his face. There was a small red pendant dangling around his neck. His very appearance made Hinata shiver, it was like he was Kiba....but at the same time wasn't. Sharp teeth flared in the moonlight. Akamaru sat whimpering on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope I'm not interrupting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto too sensed something was wrong. He got between Hinata and Kiba. \"You want something Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a twinge in the dog owner's face. Hinata could have sworn, his eyes were glowing crimson red. He had the same overall appearance when he used his Four Leg Technique, sharp claws and teeth. Naruto was growing more and more nervous, he had never seen his friend this bloodthirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sinister laugh. Something evil was taking shape in Kiba. \"Blood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the shadows of the club, Kiba was transforming. Akamaru quickly jumped off his master and hid in the corner. His mouth became longer like a snout and his ears pointed and migrated up his head. Black fur sprouted all over his body as a tail grew out of the back of his pants. Perhaps worst of all, his entire body was growing and not just in height. His muscles expanded to beyond bodybuilder's size, particular in his arms and legs. He soon towered over both ninjas. His teeth were sharper than ever as saliva dripped out of his gaping mouth. His claws were like daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly turned to Hinata. \"Hinata! Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully her wolf instincts took over, she dove to the side just as Kiba made a massive swipe in the air. Three giant claw marks remained where they had just been standing. Neither of them had been hit though, Naruto took the time to charge us his most powerful jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! It's still Kiba! Don't hurt him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba made a horizontal strike at the blonde, which he narrowly avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming he doesn't hurt me first! Rasengan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of wind hit the giant wolf right in the center of his chest. Instantly, he was knocked back into the wall behind him. Kiba was shocked but was still able to stand. He glared at the boy and howled. This time he used his legs to attack Naruto. The claws slashed him shallowly across his chest, causing Naruto to grimace in pain on the ground. Kiba was preparing to make another giant slash to finish him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop Kiba!\" She got between the wolf and Naruto, it didn't stop him though. Kiba swung and blood filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata opened her eyes. A large orange fox had taken the entire blow. Vulpes! He landed on the ground with a thud. Kiba howled again and kicked the fox aside. Hinata grabbed Naruto in one arm and jumped to save Vulpes before he fell from the building. She succeeded and landed with the two of them on the roof of the club. Kiba looked around aimlessly for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, are you alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...just a scratch. We need to take him down before he hurts someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea...I'll hit him hard from the front, if you can get behind him and land your most powerful Rasengan we must be able to stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba seemed to finally know where they were, but Hinata was already rushing at him. She had her Byakugan activated. Two blue lion faces formed in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was launched back and coughed up blood. Naruto was right behind him with a massive Rasengan aiming right for his stomach. He punched Kiba's gut with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rasengan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock wave was immense, nearly knocking Hinata off her feet. Kiba slammed into the balcony, which cracked under the power of Naruto's Rasengan. Kiba gave a final howl before he slowly returned to his normal human form. He was completely unconscious and badly wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata stood there catching their breath. Akamaru slowly worked his way out of the shadows and sniffed his master's body. Vulpes was also knocked out and bleeding badly from the stomach. Hinata panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! We need to take them to Kohana! She'll be able to save them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was a little confused as to why Hinata knew that, but quietly agreed. He threw Kiba over his shoulder, Akamaru hopped on his free one. Hinata carefully scooper up Vulpes and used her jacket to stop the blood. Together they headed for the cave as a single old woman sat laughing on a nearby rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hohoho...They're quite skilled together aren't they, Ren? They are indeed similar to Aerore and her fox husband...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a sip of her tea, but her hands were trembling. A small tear rolled down her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can never forgive them Ren...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana and the twins were shocked to find Hinata and Naruto back so earlier, and were even more surprised to find them carrying their wounded father/master. Kohana immediately knew what to do and treated Vulpes, who had the worst injures. The pups stood crying over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father...Please don't die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was treating Naruto's wounded chest, the nine tail fox was already healing most of it though. Kiba was asleep with Akamaru lying on his stomach, they tried to remove the necklace he had on but it would not budge. Kohana finally brought up the question on everyone's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen? This morning you guys were fine and now you turn up with two badly injured people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what happened exactly.\" She Hinata. \"Kiba, t-that boy there, came up to us and turned into some kind of monster. He attacked us but Vulpes-sensei took the blow. We were able to stop him but...\" She looked at the fallen fox's face. \"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana sighed. \"Well you're lucky medical training is the first thing they teach us in my country, if you had brought them a moment later I probably couldn't save them. But they'll be fine. They just need their rest is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief. We had to hit Kiba pretty hard to stop him.\" Said Naruto, the fist he used his Rasengan with was in a cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kohana turned around to get more medicine, she came running back and screamed. \"Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at the entrance. There...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What Hinata saw was the last thing she wanted to see. At the end of the cave, light was making an appearance from under the trees. Sunlight. Hinata had completely lost track of time. And now, like sand in an hourglass, her time as a human was down to it's visible last grains. What was worse, Naruto sat confused next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the noise for Kohana? It's just morning. Man, we stayed up the whole night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was being to sweat. Something warm and hairy was spreading all over her body. \"Naruto! I...I need to go! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Wait Hinata!\" He tried to make a grab at her but she was already out the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why now?! Why NOW of all times!?\" Hinata thought to herself. Claws and teeth were being to take shape and her ears slowly moved up her head. She looked behind her and to her horror saw that Naruto was still pursuing her. He was determined not to lose her again. She attempted to pick up her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, please! Tell me what's wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! Just leave me alone! You can't see when like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you like what!? What's wrong!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer him though, her nose was becoming wet and pushed out like a snout. Thankfully Naruto could not see most of the changes yet while running, but it would not be long until she was forced to run on four legs. He would certainly know what was going on then. Hinata jumped up a tree in an attempt to throw him off. He would not be fooled though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata I'm not stopping! Turn around and talk to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have tried making a doppelganger to throw him off, but she feared that her own changes would effect the clone's appearance. When he caught up to it he would know what was wrong, even if she lost him. Slowly her hands were turning into wolf paws. The time she had left to run was drawing to a close; she knew her feet were going through the same process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! I'm begging you! Get away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being out of breathe, Naruto never lost his speed. If anything he was gaining on her because of how awkward it was to run now. Sweat trickled down her back. White fur was spreading all over her body like wild fire. She was beginning to fear Naruto would catch a glimpse of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata? What is that white...fur?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't run away from him anymore. Her body was forcing itself on all fours. She stopped at a tree and crawled behind it before he could see her. Every bone in her body was reshaping itself now. The last thing to sprout was a large white tail. She softly cried to herself and prayed that Naruto didn't know where she was. This was twice the gods hadn't granted her such a gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never went around the tree, but merely stood in front of it. \"Hinata...Please, trust me. Just this once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last shifts in her body took place, she was a complete wolf again. Hinata wanted nothing more than to just be alone. She felt trapped and separated. She hated it. Most of all, she hated herself. If she had just had the confidence, she would have never had to use Aerore's pelt. She wouldn't be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're here now, Hinata.\" Whispered Aerore. \"Sometimes, we must make do with what we have. Even if it mean confronting our worst fears. No one can run away forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata peaked around the tree with one tear filled eye, and saw that Naruto stood there crying as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be strong Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...Please understand...I meant to tell you last night...Please don't be a-angry or...or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled. \"I never go back on my word...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...Here it goes...\" She stepped out from the tree. To Naruto, she looked just like Aerore only in Hinata's torn clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to describe Naruto's facial expressions. First, he was surprised. Then, confused. Then...sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore? No...Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. He slowly approached her dropping to his knees and embraced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you two showed up!\" Yelled Kohana. \"You know how much help I need mending these two!? The twins have been trying to help with the medical stuff, but that's awfully hard to do without thumbs isn't it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thumbs!\" Said Yami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, sorry.\" Said Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!? In case you haven't realized, your friend and Mr. Vulpes are dying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said they would be fine though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! With your help! Now they'll be lucky to wake up by next month-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kohana...\" Spoke a weak voice. \"That's enough, go easy on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Vulpes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great fox slowly stood up, Naruto rushed over to support him but he casually nudged him off. His orange fur seemed dulled and less vibrant then usual, but he was alive. He looked at Hinata and gave her a nod before going off to sit in the corner of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that...Hinata has told you what has been going on Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Most of it. Something about an old witch and a curse on her. She's the one who poisoned me, right? And should you really be getting up like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes sighed. \"If I have an ounce of my father's blood in me, a small paper cut like this won't kill me yet. But, you are correct. She's the one who poisoned you. And she's been targeting us for quite awhile now. That's why I trained Hinata. I had a plan to assault her base of operations today, but seeing we are all in no condition to be fighting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba wouldn't attack us willingly Vulpes-sensei,\" Said Hinata. \"I think- I think the witch may have gotten to him too. I've never seen him turn into a monster like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. This is a cursed amulet he's wearing.\" He pointed to the golden chain around Kiba's neck. \"And there's only one way to remove it, the seer has to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No complaints there.\" Smirked Naruto. \"What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep, I need to rethink our strategy...\" Vulpes muttered because collapsing on the cave ground. Kohana shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Mr. Vulpes, I knew he was overdoing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...\" Yawned Naruto. \"Sleep sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But big brother Naruto! Who's gonna play with us!\" Cried Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, play!\" Chimed Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll play with you guys tomorrow, okay? We've all had a rough night.\" Naruto was already on the ground and had his eye's closed. The twins turned their attention to Hinata instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big sister Hinata!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"Sorry you two...Naruto's right. We need our sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pups groaned making Hinata feel a little guilty. Kohana didn't look up for entertaining them as she changed the bandages on Vulpes and Kiba. Then she noticed Akamaru sitting on her unconscious teammate. \"Alright...Tell you what. You see that little dog there? I\"ll bet he wants to be your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little dog? Where!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right there Yumi! See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yipped and quickly ran out of the cave. The twins happily chased after him, barking away. \"Come back new friend! Let's play tag!\" Kohana mouthed the words \"thank you\" to Hinata as she giggled and closed her eyes. Because she had stayed awake all night, she probably wouldn't wake up again until tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough, when Hinata opened her eyes again it was dawn of the next day. It seemed Akamaru had finally become more friendly with the twins and the they were happily playing on the cave floor. Kiba was still was unconscious but Vulpes sat silently watching the three canines play. Kohana and Naruto were no where to be seen. Vulpes noticed Hinata awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well, Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Vulpes-sensei.\" She was slowly coming her senses, recalling all that had happened the previous day. \"Where's Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes chuckled. \"Don't worry, he didn't leave. Since we aren't in any position to be hunting and I fear the twins may be targeted by the witch, I sent him and Kohana into town for food. He should be back soon though. Now, how about yourself? How do you feel now that your secret's out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince yesterday, Hinata had been filled with strange emotions. It felt odd knowing that Naruto saw her as a wolf but at the same time...\"It's like I feel weightless. Like an eminence burden has been lifted off of my shoulders.\" She smiled. \"You were right, I should have told him sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've never been one to gloat. But Aerore and I are...proud of what you did. It took a lot of strength, more than anyone should ever have to muster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Vulpes-sensei.\" She turned her attention to Kiba. \"Is Kiba alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy should be awake sometime today, according to Kohana. His health isn't what worries me though.\" Vulpes began to pace around the cave with a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you yesterday, I needed to rethink our strategy against the witch. For years, we've been in conflict with her but...This is something different entirely. Never before have I witnessed something so destructive created by her hands. She was able to transform one of your friends into a killing machine that took me out in one strike with a simple trinket.\" He pointed to Kiba's necklace. \"She's become much stronger than I could have possibly imagined. Merely rushing in and killing her will not be an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes stopped at the cave entrance and stared out into the sky. \"My guess is, she's surrounded herself with minions just like your friend Kiba. Cursed souls, forced to do her bidding. That's how she works. She plays with her victims, tortures them until they beg for death. She deceives all of them. And treats them like disposable pawns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shivered. \"What do we do then? How can we possibly beat her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. \"How many times must I say it? We rethink our strategy. I think it's time to teach you the true power of our clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good, fox.\" Came a voice at the other end of the cave. A boy with short brown hair was sitting up, covered in bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata...I knew that it was you the first day I saw you.\" Smirked the dog-boy. He still looked incredibly weak. \"Alright, explanation time. Why am I bandaged, why can't I remember anything, and who's this witch you guys keep talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to bring Kiba up to speed. When they told him about the amulet and it's properties, he tried in vain to rip it off and almost hurt himself. He took Hinata being a wolf very well, much like Naruto did. Hinata was beginning to feel extremely foolish for hiding it from the start. The story was finished, and Kiba bowed his head in apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, I didn't meant to attack you and Naruto. I guess...I was jealous. I'm sorry. And sorry for wounding you, Mr.Vulpes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Replied Vulpes. \"What worries me though, is if you can control yourself. The necklace cannot be removed and it appears it reacts when you're angered. You could very well lose yourself and end up becoming a liability in the long run, not that you would willingly do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave Vulpes a nasty look and was about to say something but Hinata quickly halted the inevitable argument. \"Vulpes-sensei, I trust Kiba with my life. He won't lose himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox sighed. \"Alright, I'll trust you. But if someone ends up hurt because of him, he can't stay here. Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" They both replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now then...\" There was footsteps at the door.</span></div></div>",

The two had apparently been training while they shopped, and from the looks of things, Kohana was drained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they stepped into the cavern, Kohana didn't get the oppurtunity to blink before she was playfully assaulted by Yami, Luna, and Akamaru. The young girl was so surprised that she fell back, dropping her bags, alongside the stressful jutsu she had held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha! Gotcha!\" Yami sang happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your back!

Normally, Naruto would have created several clones to help carry the bags but Kohana seemed more than content, if a little exhausted, to carry them all with 5 clones. Beneath her strained grunts, Naruto chuckled a little; he remembered the day when he had learned the forbidden art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr.Naruto.\" One of her clones said, breaking Naruto from his memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it Kohana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you and sister Hinata, like, a couple still? I mean, she's a wolf right? Isn't that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bestiality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed. \"WHAT!? Where did you hear something like that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um. A-around...town...and stuff. Yeah...But don't change the subject. Are you guys still dating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at her. \"You know, you're going to get into a heap of trouble one of these days with that disturbing attitude of yours...And no it's not bestiality! She's only a wolf for 29 days of the month right? We're only dating on that one day she's human! I mean, I care for her and all but I would never- God no! That's disgusting Kohana! She's still Hinata, she's still human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"But you're blushing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you're perverse! I would never, EVER do something like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana continued to tease Naruto, who continued to yell at her. And rightfully so, though Hinata and Naruto still loved each other there was no sort of interaction between them while Hinata was a wolf. But Naruto was very touchy about the subject, the two didn't even notice a cloaked figure standing in the middle of the road as they argued. As they neared him, a giant grin stretched across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing Kohana-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me,\" Interrupted the hooded man. \"Would one of you happen to be Kohana of the Northern Peaks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana had a worried look on her face as she answered. \"Um, yeah. That's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I'm supposed to kidnap you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Responded Naruto. The hooded stranger delivered a powerful punch right into the ninja's mid-section. Naruto went flying through the air, breaking several trees in the process. The man with the fox grin turned to Kohana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! Omph!\" The man gave a sharp blow into her stomach as well, knocking Kohana out. Her clones disappeared one by one and he threw her real body over his shoulders. He gave a soft chuckle before turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was almost too easy. What a dis-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rasengan!\" Naruto delivered his most powerful jutsu right into the man's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed up blood and reined in pain, but otherwise did not go flying away like most enemies. He completely stood his ground against a full blast of Rasengan. It didn't seem to do any damage to him at all! His hood had fallen off and turned to Naruto with his face exposed. It was a fox, well a fox-man. He had a sly grin across his face, two black ears and a pointed snout. Blood dripped out of the corners of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Xana warned me about you. You're the other fox-guy with a nasty temper. But if you're going to hurt someone kid, you gotta do it like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with Kohana on his shoulders, the fox-man was insanely quick. He instantly appeared in front of Naruto and put an open palm to his chest. It felt like Naruto was standing in the middle of an earthquake. The shock wave traveled through his entire body, damaging his internal organs. Naruto's eyes rolled back into his head, and he fell back unconscious. Blood was pouring from his nose, mouth, and ears. The fox chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops, heheh. I think I overdid it a little. Xana said not to kill anyone. Oh, well. Can't be helped. At least the brat's alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left with Kohana, leaving Naruto to cough up blood on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the present time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps at the end of the cave belonged to Naruto, who was bleeding all over and limping in his way towards the others. Hinata ran over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mis-stepped and landed on Hinata's furry back, she gently lay him down on the ground while Vulpes brought him a cup of water. The great fox stared at Naruto's bloodshot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Kohana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...he took h-her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-some guy w-working for the witch. H-he's strong...v-very strong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes shook his head. \"I was afraid of this...It's like I thought, she's surrounding herself with beings like Kiba. Fighters enhanced in strength by cursed objects. She may have dozens at her disposal. This is bad, real bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, there was still some leftover ramen in the cave which Hinata had given to Naruto. It seemed to instantly heal him as he scarfed most of it down in a matter of seconds. Enough though Kiba had no idea who Kohana was, he sensed something was wrong and he stood up, looking prepared to leave. Oddly enough, the twins and Akamaru were no where to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to save her Vulpes-sensei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course we need to save her! But you can't go! This is exactly what the witch has planned! She wants to lure you out Hinata, and with half of us injured like we are we'd be easy prey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you propose, fox?\" Said Kiba cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wait a week. I can ask for help from the other packs. Rushing headlong into a clear trap isn't going to get Kohana rescued, it's grounds for getting everyone killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we wait a week, there's no telling what the witch will do to Kohana! We need to go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game. You alright Naruto?\" Smirked Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond ninja gave a short chuckle. Despite being covered in blood he seemed fit and full of energy. \"Don't underestimate me, I'm ready to kick some ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" Replied Vulpes. \"I forbid any of you to step foot outside a mile range of this cave! You're all primary targets for Xana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox walked near the cave entrance and blocked it, his teeth gritted. He was prepared to defend that spot with his life. Hinata tried to reason with him. \"Vulpes-sensei...please. Kohana means so much to both you and me. We can't risk waiting, we need to act!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to stay put, Aerore. Even if it kills me!\" Snarled Vulpes. Little did he realize, Kiba had been stealthy approaching him from behind while he yelled at Hinata. With a swift punch at his head, Kiba had completely knocked the great fox out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had it coming. He wasn't going to let us through anyway. So...what's the plan Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The plan?\" Both Kiba and Naruto were standing side by side, waiting orders. Even after she had worried them sick for the last few weeks and hidden herself away, they were standing by her. They had determination in their eyes unlike anything Hinata had ever seen. Her two best friends in the world were willing to die for her sake. \"W-will you guys help me save Kohana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed a smile back at them. \"Thank you, both of you. Thank you. Get your bags. We need to catch up to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grabbed their things, and left Vulpes alone in the cave.</span></div></div>",

Hinata began to think back to Xana's words, of how Vulpes and his family sought to 'replace' Aerore with Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even so, Hinata could feel that Aerore's family wasn't like that, but still the words of Lady Xana and Vulpes' actions bothered her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kiba halted, Hinata and Naruto both looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kiba, what's up?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got company, three others like me, coming fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally ten seconds after Kiba said this, the fox man from before and two other hooded beings appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there other fox guy!\" the familiar foe said, greeting Naruto. \"I see that you and this traitor guy Xana hired were nice enough to bring Aerore to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off this is Hinata and my name's Naruto, I'm Konoha's future Hokage!\" Naruto began, his eyes reddening. \"Second of all your not getting your hands on her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox guy chuckled \"Well I'm Kitsumaru, and it looks I'm about to have to defeat you again right now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Foxlike males tensed up, gearing up for all out battle while their companions watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Naruto whispered to Hinata and Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two....\"</span></div></div>",

Actually we aren't even supposed to be here, but I had to see something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox man sprinted right at Naruto to deliver a punch, this time Naruto was able to stop it. He returned his own blow right into Kitsumaru's chin and set him flying into a nearby tree. But the attack did little to affect him. He grinned and wiped the blood off his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't fighting me with your full strength last time were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto returned the grin. \"Nope! I hadn't eaten in days! Now that I had my ramen, I'm fit and ready to kick some fox butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two immediately went at it. \"Come on, Hinata. Naruto's got this guy under control. What's your guys story?\" Asked Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Hinata thought was another fox-man looked surprised and lowered his hood. He was taller than the other three, but still Hinata was shocked that he was an actual bear-man. He had a sincere sympathetic voice. \"Oh, I'm sorry! My name is Grills! Please accept my apology for not introducing myself sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller hooded figure of the three slapped Grills across the head. \"Don't apologize to your enemy you idiot! You! Wolf-girl! You're Hinata right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked a little confused but answered. \"Uh...Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry small hooded figure uncloaked himself. He was a giant talking mouse. \"You met my brother, didn't you? Yes...Yasuo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba turned to Hinata. \"...Do we know a Yasuo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...No, I don't remember anyone by the name of Yasuo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU HAD HIM CURSED IN THE FORM OF A TINY RAT!\" He produced a small cage with a brown rat squeaking inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'OH HIM'??!!\" The mouse-man was about to charge at the pair until the giant bear grabbed him by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry for my comrade's unruly behavior. He and his brother were very close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was beginning to look annoyed. \"These jokers are our 'big enemies'? Give me a break! And stop apologizing already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to bite down on Kiba's ankle to prevent him from attacking the apologetic bear. When he settled down Hinata had the moment to talk to them. \"What do you guys want exactly? Are you here to take me as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrills responded. \"No, we had not received any orders to prevent you from reaching Lady Xana's hideout. Kitsumaru here merely wanted a rematch against that boy, Naruto.\" The fox-man skidded on the ground past the chatting group, his teeth were flared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr, you're a lot tougher than I thought at first boy. No more fooling around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitsumaru made the same open palm pose as he did when he knocked out Naruto earlier. Naruto was already charging up his own Rasengan. The mouse-man tried to stop his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Kit! Don't be an idiot! The hag told us to not use those moves unless we needed to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it Nezumi! I'm going to kill this brat! Yaahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rasengan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth blows collided and both attackers flew in seperate directions. Naruto landed on his tree at the foot of a tree, while Kitsumaru had his spine wrapped around one. Both were alive but were bleeding pretty bad. Kit growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it! I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" A large familiar cloud of smoke filled the area between the groups. When it cleared, the witch Xana stood facing the frightened pair of animal men. Only Nezumi was brave enough to address her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"La-lady Xana...I-I'm s-sorry. We t-tried to convince h-him to stop but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be silent Nezumi! I have a right mind to jinx you into a rat just like your brother!\" The mouse-man yipped and quickly backed down. Xana gave a friendly face to Hinata. \"Hinata dear, so good to see you. How is Vulpes doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shove off, witch! What have you done with Kohana?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, she's safe and sound back at my tent. You may come and see her if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had had just about enough of the freak show, he ran at the old woman and was about to deliver a solid punch right to her face. But his arm passed right through her head in a puff of smoke and he landed on the ground behind her. She merely laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, is that anyway to thank an old lady for giving you a priceless necklace? You should be grateful for my gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell! You're not getting away with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minions. Leave now, before I really lose my temper. These children are not to be touched until they reach the tent. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now farewell Hinata dear. I expect to see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, all four of them were gone. Both Kiba and Naruto were extremely annoyed but Hinata was somewhat relieved. It appeared that their only interest was luring her into their hideout for some reason, meaning Kohana would remain safe until then. It was as good a time as any to set up a camp despite the grumbles from the boys. Everything was fine until...</span></div></div>",

Little did they know, they were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana groaned and rubbed her head. The last thing she remembered was some strange black hooded guy attacking Naruto and...Everything went black. She was dreading where she was, captured by the witch for a second time in her life. When she came to her senses, she took a look around where she was. She had woken up on a mountain of colorful pillows in what appeared to be a circular room filled with dozens of windows and a single door. Pressing her nose up against the stained glass window, she realized she was not above ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the room was a virtual pit of darkness, the room she was in appeared to be suspended in some sort of giant cavern. Any attempt of jumping out the window would be...suicidal. Strangely enough, Kohana was not chained or handcuffed at all. There was nothing keeping her from exiting the ornate door behind her. And being the curious kid that she was, her exploration senses were tingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't at all what happened last time. She kept me and the others on a mountain in the cold...\" She shivered to herself, remembering that freezing night when Aerore had rescued them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana half expected the door to be locked when she gave it a push. But no, they swung open and banged loudly against the hallway walls, completely defeating the purpose of stealth. She winced and prepared to here a \"Hey! What was that!\". But when she opened her eyes, there was naught but a deserted hall filled with fancy paintings and vases though dimly lit. In fact, the whole area seemed completely devoid of life. This scared her somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is anyone out there?\" No, no one. Not even a single guard. Kohana was totally alone in what seemed to be an underground castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a few steps out into the darkness of the hall, and set off to see what she could find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kohana had trained with wolves, spent weeks in the freezing cold, but there was really nothing that put her more on edge than being alone. Let alone kidnapped and alone in an empty castle. Every hallway she went through looked the same as the last, and each one felt longer and more empty. She needed a landmark, anything easily recognizable. She felt like she was going around in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-man...the w-witch sure has a strange taste in decoration. Where is everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hopes got up when she saw a large wooden door at the end of the hall. She silently ran over and put her ear to it. Nothing on the other side. Carefully, she creaked it open. Darkness. Just pure darkness was all that was on the other side. She looked down and noticed gray bricks leading down into an endless chasm. This door was a door sitting in thin air outside the castle walls. Stalagmites covered the ceiling above, and it was a long, long, LONG way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana gulped and turned around. \"There is no way I am climbing down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm climbing down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer kidnapper had apparently not removed any of her ninja kits, she had plenty of rope to climb down the castle walls. She looked for anything that would qualify as a window or a way inside. As she climbed down, her thoughts turned to Hinata and the others. She hoped they weren't worried, especially the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tended to get a little aggressive when they got worried. Kohana almost slipped from laughing to herself at the mental picture of Naruto running around screaming with two wolf pups trying to bite his ears off. At last, she had a break; her foot had found a small window. Slowly, she creeped down the sill and peaked inside. There were voices coming from within. One of them, she recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust they are on their way?\" Said Xana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Replied a broken up voice, though it seemed strangely familiar to Kohana. \"The fox-boy decided to run ahead, just as planned. When the others found out they quickly set off after him. They should be arriving at your base of operations in a matter of hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana couldn't get a clear look at what Xana was talking to. It seemed like some sort of spirit-like form in a golden bowl. The witch laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something amusing, witch?\" Asked the blurred being. \"You have not forgotten our agreement, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, my dear friend. The girl is safe and sound. Last I heard she was wandering around the castle. But do not worry. There is no escape from this place unless I allow it. She'll never find her way out. You are aware that I...require her for my needs though, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sighed. \"Painfully aware. It won't kill her though, will it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all! You'll find her quite alive and well after this is all over. Just make sure Hinata gets here, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit hesitated but nodded. \"Yes...What must be done, must be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good boy. Now run along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit dissipated, leaving Xana to laugh to herself in the empty room. She turned her attention to a small statue near the window Kohana was peaking in. The girl had to hide before the witch noticed her. Her heart was pumping, but the crone didn't seem to see her. Kohana didn't get a good look at the statue she was looking at, but she was beginning to talk to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fool...What a fool...Don't you think so Ren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone was changing. Rather than the sarcastic sinister tone Xana usually had, this was more softer and...calmly. Like a mother cooing to her baby, trying to make it fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon Ren...Very soon...You will be avenged. And they will pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch stretched her hand out at the window and angrily clenched her fist. There was a bright fire and a large blast that blew the window apart. Xana didn't notice her but Kohana wasn't about to stick around and get herself killed. She quickly started climbing back up the wall to return to her room.</span></div></div>",

Her brother, on the other hand, had seemed to make it his sole mission in life to bother Kiba to no end. Every few seconds of the trip were plagued with repetitive questions like \"Are we there yet?\" or \"How much longer now?\" Patience was wearing thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! For the last time! Shut up! No!\" Screamed Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that Kiba might attempt strangling him now, Yumi tried his luck with asking Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister Hinata? When are we gonna be there...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed. \"Soon Yumi. Can't you keep yourself busy like your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's nothing to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She turned back to Akamaru. \"Why not...Go scout ahead with Akamaru? Just please, be careful okay? Find us at the first sign of danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he already wasn't listening. He and Akamaru barked happily and tore off ahead of the ninjas. It seemed that all that food had given them a ton of extra energy. Before Kiba could get the chance to yell at them again, they were already a speck of dust on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's a giant hole. I don't get it.\" Said Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been hours since he had given the others the slip to find and fight that Kit guy alone. Somehow, he thought he had gotten lost. While he had found an abandoned village with a giant tent, all that was inside was an empty fortune teller's home. That and the giant hole leading into the ground. It was pitch black down below and there didn't appear to be any ladders. Naruto scratched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this sucks...How am I supposed to get down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden brushing noise and approaching footsteps made the blond ninja spin around with a kunai knife drawn. The cloth door to the tent blew open but there appeared to be no one there. Naruto still remained on edge though as he looked around everywhere but down. Then something bit him in the ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya big brother Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's mutt, Akamaru, had decided to take a large chomp of Naruto's foot while Yumi sat there wagging his tail. Naruto violently tried to kick Akamaru off his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akamaru!? Yumi!? What are you guys doing here!? Wait if you're here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, big sister Hinata asked us to scout ahead! Yep! They'll be here in a few minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...Hinata's going to kill me. And then Kiba will probably lose it too. Well come on guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped the two dogs in his arms and stood over the hole. Both of them started to kick and bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Brother Naruto! Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the rabbit hole. Keep your heads down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen down they went into the witch's hallow to bet Hinata and Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell Naruto!\" Yelled Kiba. \"He seems to have found Akamaru and Yumi. They're...going underground?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group eventually broke out of the forest and into the abandoned village Yasuo had mentioned when they tortured him. Just as he said, there was a large purple tent just outside the ghost town. They cautiously approached it; Kiba and Hinata were sniffing around all the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was here...And he went....there...!\" Kiba pointed to the giant hole in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had already jumped down before Hinata could even come up with a plan. She sighed and approached the hole. Luna looked nervous about jumping down a seemingly endless pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on tight Luna, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay sister Hinata...\"</span></div></div>",

She was even in her old clothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on!?\" She yelled to herself. \"Luna!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked behind her where the wolf pup had been just moments before to find that she had vanished! She was alone back at...her house? She rubbed her eyes several times to make sure it wasn't a mirage or her mind playing tricks on her. Wasn't she just at the bottom of an underground cave? What happened!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hinata?\"</i> Spoke a familiar voice behind her. She turned and saw her father, holding a newspaper in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What are you doing outside, Hinata? Have you fallen asleep again?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what? Father?

Have something to eat, that will help you wake up.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and slowly walked inside, leaving Hinata completely confused. She had just been a wolf no more than a few moments ago! And yet she was clearly now, human. It was like...everything that happened was a dream. But that was impossible! Wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, Hinata!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around. \"N-Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingenious.\" Spoke a gruff voice from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, isn't it though?\" Answered Xana as she looked through a large window. \"All five doors led to the same room, but to each of them seemingly entered alone in the most ideal setting they can image! It's an extremely powerful illusion that completely incapacitates the victim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the window, there were 6 figures on the ground that all looked peacefully asleep. The figure in the shadows shifted slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you not just enter and take Hinata then be done with it? I would like for this to end as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't. Once each of them drifts into a deep sleep. You see, though asleep they are extremely sensitive to any contact from the real world. A simple tap on the shoulder would instantly undo the spell! We must wait an hour for the effects to sink in. Then my dear friend, we will have our prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...unsettling to watch them like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there. You do what you must. Your needs exceed their own after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I suppose you are right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, no! This isn't right! Hinata was sure that what had happened the last month had been real! But...was it really? Naruto stood very clearly in front of her. This had to be an illusion! A trick! She bite down hard on her lips until a drop of blood dripped from her mouth. Naruto looked concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hinata, you're bleeding! Here let me get that for you...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the sleeve of his orange jacket, he cleaned the blood from her lips. This wasn't an illusion. Was this a dream then? Hinata tried pinching herself but nothing seemed to work. Naruto grabbed her around the shoulders and led her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're starting to make me nervous, Hinata. Come on now. Let's go inside and have some breakfast. It's not easy being Hokage you know!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked for a second. Naruto's clothing changed into the Hokage's red and white robes. He giggled and played around with the odd shaped hat. He looked much older, like he had aged years in a blink of an eye. There was also a ring around his finger, as was there one around her own. A wedding band. He passionately kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Come on, the children are waiting for us. Let's go home.\"</i></span></div></div>",

He suddenly had a disturbed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hinata?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything changed. Like the channel on a television switching to another, she found herself in another familiar place. The cave. Happy barks were heard within the wolf home and Hinata cautiously went inside. The twins were wrestling each other on the ground as she saw herself in wolf form sitting next to Vulpes-sensei. Wait...it wasn't her...it was Aerore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore!\" She yelled to get the wolf's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

Though he looked distorted somehow, which only added to the strangeness of the look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stop Hinata! Don't fight it! Just stay here! You're happy here aren't you!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to answer. Hinata was trying to return to the location Aerore was. Something wasn't right and she needed to find out what. The world shifted and changed like it was being sucked through a black hole. She found herself face down in the dirt back at the cave again. Vulpes and the twins were looking more like hell-hounds now as they growled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is where Aerore is happy! You belong where you are happy! Can't you see you're not wanted!? LEAVE!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore was beginning to panic at her mate's sinister appearance. \"What's going on!? Vulpes!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look what you've done! Get out!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a surge of energy and Hinata blacked out. It felt like she had been yanked on the collar. However, instead of finding herself back at her house with Naruto she was in an empty space. Floating in the distance was a distinct figure of a hooded old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The witch...She's the one doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata landed hard on her back back with Naruto again. He was beginning to look like a mere shadow with blue eyes now. Oddly enough there seemed to be tears rolling out of them. The shadow never said a word but Hinata said to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Naruto. Wait a little longer, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought hard about where she really was. The underground cave with the doors. She was propelled forward. Space and time seemed to fly past her head. In the distance was a bright white light. Hinata closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf in the room beyond the window was stirring in her wake, as if she was waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...It looks like because those two share a body their dreams overlapped.\" Said Xana. \"Hinata was able to break free.

Don't mess this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch huffed. \"I don't recall you having the authority to order me around. And fear not, though they may have broken themselves out of this spell we can always just use brute force to subdue them. I'll get my best men right on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the shadow was already gone. The witch sighed before leaving the room herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark my words Hinata. I always get what I need. Your life will be mine. You will never see the light of day again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata groaned, waking up from her sleep. She was now in a large circular room, five doors were behind her and one large door in front. Naruto, Kiba, Akamaru,and the twins were asleep on the ground all around her. It didn't take long for her to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must have...casted a spell on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Answered Aerore in her head. \"Thank you for saving me Hinata. If it wasn't for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank me later...We gotta save Kohana! Wake up guys!\"</span></div></div>",

She seemed to be communicating over a loud speaker. \"That would be far too meager a task for entering MY domain. Please don't panic, the smoke isn't poisonous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite dense smoke began to pour from vents of the room. It was only too late that the group realized what was going on. The smoke was preventing the group from seeing anything at all. They could feel the floor shift beneath their feet. Suddenly, the ground opened up and both the clones and the real group members fell down separate holes. They were being split up without knowing who was real or fake. Hinata landed with a thud on the soft dirt. It was dark but she could sense three more beings with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, sister Hinata!\" Said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here...\" Said Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too sister Hinata!\" Said Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata suddenly remembered the clones.

You've been separated into three different groups. But of course, so have the clones. They have been mixed into your three groups, there's no telling who's real and who's not. You'll find that even the clone's scents match their corresponding targets. You might not have any in your group, but then again you might be completely alone. And there's no telling when the clones will back stab you, especially at a moment when you least expect it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed evilly as the speakers went dead.

Luna and Yumi, you two ask each other questions since you're brother and sister. And Kiba...I'll think of stuff for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf and hour later, Hinata had taken Kiba to one corner of the room and Luna and Yumi took the other. It wasn't too hard to think of questions for Kiba but Hinata didn't know what the witch knew about her. How long had she been watching her? She could have known tons of facts about her teammates and life. And this Kiba seemed to know every answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's our other teammate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned. \"Shino...Come on Hinata, it's me alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wanted to agree with him but some niggling doubt in the back of her head kept her from simply moving on. She had to think of something really deep, something that would really get into her teammate's head. She suddenly remembered Kiba's reaction when he discovered she was on a date with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba...A-are you in love with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just answer. Please.\" Hinata blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not! You're my teammate Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not him!\" Looks like the witch had slipped and left out that one detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the clone could react Hinata and jumped on top of it and bite in right at it's throat. Kiba's apparition disappeared with a puff. Hinata was alerted by a second puff of smoke behind her. Yumi had vanished as well, only Luna remained wagging her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it sister Hinata! That wasn't my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but how do I know you're not a clone and just covering for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young wolf gulped and slowly backed up. Suddenly, a calm voice filled her head. Aerore was speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Hinata. That's Luna. I can sense my children's chi. That's definitely my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna still looked on edge. Hinata tried to calm her down and explain what Aerore said to her. She reluctantly believed her. The two wolves decided to leave for the next room and find what happened to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-brother Naruto? Wh-what happened?\" Asked Yumi as he rubbed a gigantic bump on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh don't worry about it Yumi. Sorry for the bump. I just had to attack all you guys to find out which were the clones. It's just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I guess find the others. Hopefully they were able to beat their clones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru were already on their way down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was easy, wasn't it Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small dog barked in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, stupid witch underestimated the Inuzuka clan. We have other ways of finding our own besides smell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn those brats! Each of them were able to see through the clones!\" Yelled Xana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg your pardon, madam.\" Said Nezumi. \"Why not send us to deal with them?

At last they found a very ornate looking door with a giant letter \"X\" on it. When they opened it, they were in for a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sister Hinata? Are we dreaming again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't think so Luna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in what appeared to be a massive royal garden. It was full of rose bushes and other lovely flowers as well as towering groves. Behind the beautiful garden in the distance was a massive castle seemingly built into the side of underground walls. There were several lights in the many windows of the towering fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is where you must go, in case you were wondering.\" Spoke a snide voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of the trees to the side of the wolves sat a glaring mouse-man. The squeaks of a rat were heard as he gently patted the small brown rodent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax brother, your revenge is coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna...\" Hinata whispered to the young wolf. \"Keep going to the castle. Find Kohana. Find the others. I'll handle him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup nodded and took off into the groves, Nezumi shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you you could leave from here you mangy flea bag...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was just able to follow him, he leap from the tree and dove for Luna with his sharp claws. But like a sharp sword, Hinata whizzed past him leaving a gouge in his chest. The mouse man covered his wound and then looked at his blood covered hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way then, Aerore's host. It's you who I'm really after anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata growled. \"Why are you attacking us!? Why did you kidnap Kohana!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think I'd tell you? My brother was cursed because he couldn't keep his mouth shut. The last thing I'm going to do is give a bitch like you any information!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was coming for Hinata this time. With lightning reflexes, Hinata was able to jump in the air and narrowly avoid the attack. She landed in a nearby tree only to have to jump out of it; Nezumi slashed with his razor claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could do was keep dodging. She needed to get on the offensive. When she landed on the ground, instead of avoiding the next attack she countered. Biting down hard on Nezumi's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse man roared in pain and took a few steps back. Hinata had rendered his left arm useless and it dangled at his side. Still, he had a sickening smile on his face as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot. You have Aerore on your side. Your strength and hers have combined into something even more powerful. And I would be worried...if I hadn't had some interesting powers of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going on about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"You saw Kitsumaru's ability already correct? His is that of raw power and speed like the nine tailed fox. He carries within him the essence of the great fox. But I carry in me the power of a mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe extended his working hand out as something glowed in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you think the essence of a small and sneaky mouse is...?\"</span></div></div>",

In a blink of an eye he disappeared and rushed for the young wolf. Though smaller now, Hinata was just as fast as before. A quick charge at Luna allowed her to push her out of the way to safety just in time. Nezumi missed by inches and got his claw stuck in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing, Hinata took the moment to assess a plan with Luna who was looking more and more frightened by the second. Nezumi continued to mindlessly curse while pulling his hand out of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I couldn't even see him S-sister Hinata! H-how are we supposed to fight him?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried to think of something. She hadn't been this driven in the corner since her fight against Neji. If only Naruto were here, or someone, anyone besides herself. But no she was alone. She had to be the one that saved the day this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, listen. I can't take him on at this size. I can get around him and maybe find a way to undo this spell. I think it only works on one person so you should be safe from it. But I need you to keep him busy. You learned some fighting skills from Akamaru, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea but Sister H-Hinata, I can't take him on! I...I'm not like my brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You were great back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! It was just a tiny mouse. I'm a-always following my brother, h-he's much better at fighting then me. I'm gonna lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNezumi had managed to slip free slightly. \"You don't have to win Luna, just keep him busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I'm gonna mess up! I'm terrible at this kinda thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere had Hinata heard that before? Luna seemed almost exactly like a younger version of herself. No confidence at all. She remembered the one thing she knew that would get her to stand and try her hardest. The one thing she wanted Naruto to say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe in you Luna. You can do it.\" She tried to sound like the young wolf's mother as best as she could. \"Your mother knows you can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNezumi at last broke free and laughed vilely. \"Thank you so much for waiting patiently small-fries! Now I'm clobber you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed at Luna again. This time she seemed to react differently. She dodged and bit down hard on his wrist causing him to yell in pain and wave the wolf wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! You stupid mutt let go!\" His other arm was still useless from Hinata's previous bite, the best he could do was wave Luna around like a rag doll. But the young pup refused to let go. Hinata took the time to backtrack around behind the mouse-man and ready to charge at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready Hinata?\" Asked Aerore. \"I can help you with this attack just this once, but at this size you'll be completely drained by the end of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. A ghostly white mist encircled the miniature wolf-ninja. Hinata charged, the fog followed her like a cloak. She aimed right for the back of the angry mouse man just has he whipped Luna into a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Take that you stupid bit-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! Even at a shrunken size, the attack was absolutely devastating. As Hinata's nose tapped the center of Nezumi's spine, the white fog shifted into a large wolf head that plowed through the mouse's body. Nezumi coughed up blood. He was losing the balance in his feet. He walked around trying to hold himself up, by eventually blacked out and crumpled to the ground. Defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Hinata's form swelled back to normal size. But she too was having difficultly holding herself up. She couldn't stay awake and passed out as Luna limped over to her fallen sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sister...H-Hinata....\" The young wolf too couldn't remain awake from the sharp injury to her spine when she was thrown into the tree. She collapsed on top of Hinata's head. But they were victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until a shadowed form that had been watching from above crept towards the knocked out wolves. The four legged creature shook his head at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please accept my apologizes. Again Hinata, my needs are greater than yours.\" </span></div></div>",

Last time she walked out the door one of them chased her around with the giant pole-arm it carried. So here she was, sulking in her bright pillow filled room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys! What's taking you so long!?\" Kohana was beginning to get nervous. That shadowy figure she saw talking with Xana was pretty ominous. Did they really even stand a chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe buried her head in one of the red pillows. She couldn't think like that. Sister Hinata and Brother Naruto would come save her for sure! Maybe even Mr. Vulpes too. Without thinking, Kohana pegged the ceiling with the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! A large fissure formed at the spot where the pillow at hit. Bits of ceiling landed on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Hey! It's an opening!\" Indeed the soft pillow had somehow managed to puncture a hole in the roof of her prison. Wasting no more time, the young girl hopped up the opening. It appeared to lead to some sort of shaft that ran above the corridors. Kohana grinned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for some more infiltration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ventilation was less roomer than would be desired. But Kohana was still able to squeeze on through. The darkness was making her a little on edge though. She sped towards the only source of light which illuminated the bottom of the vents ahead. Voices were coming from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Xana wishes them to be placed in separate cells, but we're out of room thanks to that other brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, she won't mind. Both of them are completely knocked out anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana peered through the cracks of the grate and covered her mouth to prevent a gasp. The two armed guards were standing over both Hinata and Luna, who were unconscious. The guards turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on. The hag's 'guest' told us to be quick about this. He gives me the creeps, he does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana waited for the sound of a door shutting before bursting through the vents. She pushed Hinata around to try and wake her, but she didn't budge. Kohana sensed that she was merely drained of her energy, Luna was in far worse shape. Her spine had been cracked and was in danger of being broken. Without hesitation, Kohana began to repair the young wolf's back to the best of her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no...no...They're both so injured...How did this happen!?\" Luna's back was mostly healed, but even if she were to wake up there was no way she'd be able to run around for at least a week. Kohana couldn't help but feel a little guilty, they got themselves hurt trying to save her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys...\" A thought suddenly occurred. \"Wait...Where's Naruto? Did he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear Kohana, he still remains alive. That much is certain.\" Spoke a familiar voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana turned to discover...</span></div></div>",

Why both you and Hinata are so desired by the witch. You see I am the one who brought them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Kohana took a weak battle stance as Vulpes approached. \"That couldn't be true! Stay away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Please forgive me, again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strike was quick. Kohana couldn't even see what had happened before she blacked out. Vulpes had used his snout as a fist and punched right into her stomach. Vulpes stared with a hardened look at the three bodies on the ground. Hinata. Kohana. And his daughter Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There can be no repentance for what I must do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana blinked slightly. She was on a soft couch and she was hearing voices talk in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So it seems the girl has discovered your little ploy Vulpes, eh? She's such a sneaky little minx that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. She has the right to know why we must do this....When she awakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to wait then.\" The witch turned to Kohana who tried to pretend she was still asleep. \"Come now my girl, you think I do not see you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no sense hiding it. Kohana sat up and pointed at Vulpes. \"You...you lied to us! You were working with the witch all along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes calmly nodded. \"It's true. I deny nothing. We had to gain Hinata's trust. I've had to do some very elaborate things. Like get deliberately wounded by that Kiba fellow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch laughed. \"Yes, it was very much like a good cop bad cop routine. Hinata proved the biggest challenge. You and Vulpes's family would naturally never suspect him. But she was new and did not know any better. Even when she brought her friends, I knew so long as she trusted Vulpes they would trust him too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes continued. \"Xana would cause doubt and confusion, Aerore and I would comfort her and make her see reason. It was a foolproof way of earning her trust. Even Aerore didn't know what I was doing, who I allied with. I bet on her doing the right thing which she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do this Mr. Vulpes!? You knew the witch was the one who did this to Aerore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am painfully aware of that. As is Xana. But she came to me immediately after the incident in Snowpeak with apologizes and a way to return her to normal. A way for us to be a family again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I know how it feels to lose someone...Let me tell you a little story my girl. Perhaps it will help clear things up. You see this castle? Do you not wonder where it came from? Well originally it was above ground...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifty years ago. I was a young woman then, in love. This castle was part of a grand kingdom, ruled by a just king. My lover and I were very happy here. However, the king's daughter was a spoiled thing. Despite being young, she demanded things even adults in the kingdom did not have for no reason at all. In fact one day, she mistakenly started a war. My lover was forced to fight in the bloody battles. We spent one final night together and then he left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never returned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 3 months later that I received the horrible news that he had died in battle. It was also that very day that I learned I was carrying child. Twice I cried that day. Once out of pain. The other out of joy. I decided to name the child Ren, water lily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths later. Life had been rough. The effects of the war had been grim on the kingdom. Every ally we once had turned their backs on us, for the war we started for no reason at all. But the princess cared little for the country's problems, so long as she got what she wanted. I was nearing the end of my pregnancy term as the princess's birthday approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the princess was used to vast parties. Everyone in the kingdom was expected to be there and honor our princess. On the day of the party I went into labor with Ren. I had hoped that a mere peasant woman would be excused from the party, I was having a baby after all. I spent the day at the only doctor still in town, a traveler who had been kind enough to take me in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow I did not escape notice of the princess. Gossiping in the party made her think that I had snubbed the girl. She was FURIOUS, angered that a peasant would find something more important to do than attend HER birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go hunt that woman down, and teach her a valuable lesson!\" She said and took a handful of guards to search through the town...</span></div></div>",

I named her, bathed her, and comforted her. Not once did she cry. But of course, the princess learned where I was and rummaged through the good doctor's home. I remember the look in her eyes when she saw Ren, a newborn babe that shared the same birthday as she. I remember what she said to Ren...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...thing shares the same birth as me!? That tiny abomination!?\" She was so arrogant. Riches and power had made her blind to anything save her own needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ordered the guards to kill my baby. Of course they hesitated and refused, the girl who was merely ten snatched a sword from one of them and ran it through Ren and into me. A noble child was so heartless that she would kill a newborn baby. I lost so much blood, but I never let go of Ren. I passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the next day when I woke up again. Thanks to the doctor, I had survived the night. But he could not save Ren. I can't remembered if I thanked that good man or not, I was so distraught. The princess had also decided to burn my home down. I buried Ren on that spot and marked it with a small statue, the only thing that survived the fire. I wandered aimlessly into the forest. Revenge. I wanted revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won't tell you how I came across my powers. It was a sworn oath to not reveal the nature of my magic. Let's just say, I sacrificed much. But I cared little for the cost. I needed the power. It was then, 10 years later I returned to the kingdom. It was nearly in ruin to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess's father had died, she was forced to marry and became the queen. She ran the kingdom into the ground, she cared only for herself. Even young as I was then, I was still very powerful. I slaughtered every last guard I found, their armor blackened by sot and ash from me, and made my way into the castle. I will spare you the details of my revenge. In the end, the queen was stabbed through the gut and bleed to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still not enough. I grew sick of the sight of the castle. Using all my power, buried it underground. Ironically it is here we stand now, it has served as a base of operations for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevenge left me empty though. My lover and daughter were dead and I had no home to return to. I grew more and more lonely each day. My hatred of noble daughters caused me to be chased out of every village I entered. I needed Ren back. I at last found a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is where we stand now Kohana dear. I began to kidnap noble daughters to use as a means to resurrect my deceased daughter. Blood for blood, all noble girls were wicked in my eyes. They would return to me what was most precious. However, Vulpes and Aerore's wolf pack had been a constant thorn in my side. I found a way though, to return Ren to this world without killing anyone. Of course Aerore interrupted the ritual as you remember. I was forced to curse her. By doing so I robbed Vulpes of the thing most precious to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great fox looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a heartless person Kohana. I gave Vulpes my offer. He accepted. I offer you this. Merely go along with this ritual. Give Vulpes and I back what we most desire. I have no reason to harm you or anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohana still didn't trust the witch. \"I...don't believe you! You're insane, using other people for your own needs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kohana...\" Started Vulpes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now Vulpes. The young lady has made up her mind. I'll have her sent back to her room. Her cooperation would have been helpful but it is not necessary. Now that we have Hinata, the ritual can begin. Guards, take her away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo black armored men grabbed Kohana by the arms. She kicked and screamed until she at last left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ritual...is safe right?\" Asked Vulpes when he was alone with Xana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sound. You may come and watch if you desire.\" She walked towards the giant window at the end of the room. \"It will take place on the roof of the castle. I will begin but it will be some time before I can cast the spell. Our other guests must be kept entertained until then. Speaking of which...One of them is fighting on the bridge now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the violent battle. It was...</span></div></div>",

Naruto had caught him by surprise with a barrage of Rasengan, creating critical internal damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was in a similar state, but the battle was decided. The blonde was standing, with a doppelganger preparing one last Rasengan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn...Maybe it's the bloodloss, but that brat looks so much like Ako.' Kitsumaru thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts travelled to happier times, back to when Ako Fujikaze still lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Kitsumaru's younger sister. She was three years younger than Kitsumaru, and a nice enough kid. She was alot like Naruto in appearance: blonde spikey hair (albeit longer), blue eyes, even whisker marks. She wasn't a loudmouth though, she rarely even spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitsumaru and she often had to steal, being orphaned from birth. Even so, they got through it, even though everyday was a struggle. One thing that stood out among the pilfered items was A silver fox head necklace that Kitsumaru took for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen on, Ako wanted a pet fox more than anything in the world, since they reminded her of her brother. Kitsumaru laughed it off at first, but he soon regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year ago, when Ako was 11, she became bedridden. The local doctor saw her once, and told Kitsumaru that she had a month left at most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks later, she passed her necklace to her brother, saying: \"Keep this, so we'll always be together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get her back, Kitsumaru went to Xana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch agreed, in exchange for him working for her. She then noticed Ako's necklace and noted it had latent magic within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said his sister had left him a great gift, and she could also give him it's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it was a sign, Kit accepted, and became how he was today.

When he stared at Kit, breathing heavily something changed. Instead of a bloody fox there was a young girl, just about his age staring sadly at him. Naruto's eyes widened and he blinked. She was gone. Kit glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for...finish it!\" Spat the fox, blood poured from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something else odd occurred. The world seemed to slow down around Naruto, he watched as a drop of blood came to a standstill in mid-air when it dripped from Kit's jaw. The fox's angry defeated expression became frozen in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remind me a lot of Kit.\" Whispered a voice from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned his head to see the same girl as before, quietly looking over him. Her eyes were as pale as a full moon. She seemed to be floating in midair, as her feet were somehow distorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...Either this fight has gone way too long and I'm seeing things or...\" Muttered Naruto. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kit's sister. Ako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a ghost I'm guessing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In one way...But more of his guardian if anything else...Why are you trying to kill Kit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...He kidnapped a friend of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must you really resort to this though? He's just lost his way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you have me do!? Let him walk free!? Besides if you're so benevolent as you seem why haven't you talked some sense into him!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if I could...But he can no longer hear my words...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that isn't my problem is it!? He threatened my friends, people that are precious to me! Even if I have to kill him...I'm going to protect them no matter what!\" Naruto turned his attention to the Rasengan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAko's ghost sighed. \"I guess I have no choice then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for the blond boy's head just as he finished preparing his attack. Everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto landed on the ground hard. He was outside again only it was cold and snowy. Strangely enough everything but him seemed to be in black and white, even the people walking around. Naruto looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where...Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clear voice called out in the crowd. \"Come on Ako! Maybe the bartender will be nice enough again to feed us again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tall boy with sharp pointed hair and fox like eyes pulling along the ghost girl Naruto had just conversed with. Only she now appeared to be very much alive this time, and extremely healthy. Though she did not look happy with her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Kit, I don't think he likes you anymore...The last time we went there you nearly got beaten up for stealing from his wife's purse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! I'm sure he's forgotten all about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stepped up into into the bar as Naruto watched with increasing interest. He was about to follow them but noticed that he wasn't the only one spying on the siblings. Sitting on a bench was an old woman bundled up in a dark cloak.

She was headed for the bar the two siblings had just entered. She was tailing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly decided to do the same, no longer worried about being seen. He sat down right next to Xana as she sat at a table near the entrance of the bar. With a wave of her hands, food appeared in front of her. She then took out a small bottle and poured a little of its contents in one bowl. There was a giant skull on the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKit, meanwhile, had nearly gotten into a fistfight with the barkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said GET OUT!\" Growled the burly barkeeper, grabbing young Kit by the throat. \"You and your sister have pick-pocketed your last in here! I'll have no more of it! There will be no food for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed Kit on the floor near the exit. Kit glared at him and spat in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you little-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXana quickly stood up and got between both of them. \"Now good sir, surely there's no need to get violent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way, old woman! You have no idea what that brat has stolen over the years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her usual persuasive manner she replied. \"Well, if it makes you feel better...I will watch over these two for you so that they don't cause any trouble. I'll cover for any damages they cause. Fair enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender spat on the floor. \"Any crime he commits, you pay for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXana helped Kit up and led him to a chair at her table. She then sat Ako down in front of the soup bowl she had poured something into. Both of them were too surprised by the sudden act of kindness to do anything but oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat.\" Said Xana in a motherly voice. \"You look like you're both starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKit wasted no time chowing down and began to gobble up the bowl of soup, Ako was a bit more delicate when eating though. Xana waited until Ako took one spoonful of soup before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what are your names, children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit (Kit).\" Mumbled Kit with a mouthful of noddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ako.\" Whispered the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, it's very nice to meet you both. How long have you two been on the streets like this? You seem to have a reputation for trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bor Beers (For years).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How awful, surely you must have some home to go to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAko answered. \"No...Our parents died before I could remember them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible! Why not sell that pretty necklace you have there, my girl?\" She pointed to the silver pendant on Ako's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I could never...My brother...got this for me. I could never sell it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. He 'got' it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda wish I hadn't in a way.\" Laughed Kit, he had already finished his soup. \"She's always going on and ON about getting a fox because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...That pendant intrigues me...Anyway, are you both finished with your soup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAko was starting to look a little pale and had barely touched hers. Kit looked at his sister with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, okay Ako?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Just not used to food again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKit shrugged and turned to Xana. \"Well, thanks for the grub Mrs...Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xana, my dear.

He saw what Xana poured into Ako's soup. Poison. His vision was going black again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the dead of winter this time. The chill in the air cut to Naruto's bones. It was a blizzard, snow whipped around his face. The time had to be late, probably midnight. Blackness was all he could see, save for under a nearby lamppost. A figure was limping along, loudly sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between his fingers was a silver foxhead necklace. Naruto watched as Kit lifted the head to his face. He mumbled the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her...that lady...She said it was...special. Help...She'll help...Sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKit put the pendant into his pocket, gently patting it as he turned down the road. He walked into the darkness of the night. The snow blew all around him, but he didn't so much as shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. He was back at the castle again. The Rasengan was fully charged. Kit, now a fox again, continued to breath heavily and glare at Naruto. Closing his eyes, Naruto heard Ako's voice in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do?\"</span></div></div>",

But my orders were to guard this bridge with my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru were on one of the upper tier bridges, over looking the main castle bridge that Naruto's battle was on. Before them was the massive bear-man, Grills, who was guarding an entrance into one of the jutting towers. Kiba and Akamaru had been fighting Grills for a half an hour, still the bear-man did not have a single wound on him. No matter how powerful the attack was, he seemed to be just able to shrug it off like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting us no where, right Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog barked in agreement. The poor pup was nearly out of energy, they had used every jutsu in their arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. But like my comrades I too have my own special ability. As you could probably figure out by now, my body can absorb power from jutsu fueled techniques. Every attack you've thrown at me so far as been utterly worthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed and removed his jacket. \"Fine then. I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort this until we got to the witch but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one fist on the ground, Kiba leaned all his weight into it. His eyes were turning red. Claws formed and his teeth grew sharper. Strangely enough there was no fur, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose I'm going to need the boost to beat you. I figured it out. Those powers she gave each of you guys. Each of them grants you an ability at the cost of your humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrills nodded. \"Yes, very good. I'm sorry, I understand you are one of us. But why isn't it you take the form of a beast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled in response. \"Isn't it obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, his muscles budged out in every direction. The ground beneath him cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power is to go from man to beast, and everything in between!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down on his legs, Kiba launched himself at the giant bear-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Naruto.\" Said Kit as they finished off the last of the black armored guards. \"I would love to navigate us to the witch, but looks like she's already jinxed this hall. We're going around in circles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a minute before asking. \"What would break the spell then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...It's merely an illusion placed on us. Maybe if something from the outside pulled us out of it we could break free. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was too busy fiddling around in his side pocket. \"Good, next question. Can you track a smell, like Hinata and the others can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question confused Kit. \"Yea...What did you have in mind...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned and held up a strip of bacon. \"Let's just say, I have a little friend that was able to sneak inside while you were busy with me.\"</span></div></div>",

It was the same result for Kiba's last few attacks, strangely enough Grills never struck back at the feral dog-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the blood from his jaw, Grills calmly said. \"I'm sorry, but you're going to have to attack with more ferocity then that to knock me out brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's hands were all bruised from wailing on Grills like a punching bag.

Something tells me finishing him is something Hinata wouldn't want me to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...Since you insist on such tales of the past...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born into slavery, I never knew my true family. The only thing that was warm and familiar to me was the sweat of hard-work and the beatings for failure. However, I was eventually bought by a rich family and sent to work in theirs fields. I thought the slave-master's treatments were brutal, these people were barbaric. They killed a boy no more than a year ahead in age when I was but a child of six years, right in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For another long six years I was raised in constant fear that any moment I could die by the hands of my masters. We all were, but the slaves were too frightened to do anything about it. I had adopted a strange habit you see from my time as a slave. Whenever one of the masters spoke to me, no matter what it was I was answered \"I'm sorry.\" It was a pathetic form of protection but it was all I had to defend myself from those monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kept hoping that one day I would be sold off to another family, or maybe I could run away. Any escaping slaves though were tortured beyond belief. I recall being forced awake all night from listening to an escaping man being skinned alive by them. Every day was hazy with fear of death but it was the only life I knew. I thought if I just kept my head down, I'd stay alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then one day, the masters had found a cheaper and more productive way of doing the hard-work of us slaves. By using newly invented machines, our jobs were easily replaced. At first I thought they'd set us free. But those ogres had no such intention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was cleaning under the deck of the house when it happened. The masters had called all the slaves together, but by sheer luck I was left behind. I watched as the others were rounded up and burned alive in the slave shack. Those monsters...they were laughing at the sight, there was no escape for me. I must have went insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the dead of night when the masters were all alive, I walked into their mansion and took a royal sword from their wall. I won't lie. I killed every last one of them. I butchered them like they would have done to me. It was revenge. It was delicious. I was so aborbed with the act that my clothing was matted with blood by the next morning. There were only mere pieces of the masters left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid of what happened to me. I had lost myself, I had ENJOYED killing them. Worst of all, I lost all sense of purpose. Frightened I fled into the woods before the locals discovered what had happened to the family. It was a local noble family, so I had to hide in the trees all day and night while the villages looked for me. And that's when I found Lady Xana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In an instant, Lady Xana gave me a purpose to protect her. Since I refused to ever attack out of fear of killing someone, out of fear of losing myself again. My task was to be her personal bodyguard. She too hated royal and noble families as much as I. She gave me the power of defense, something that I will forever treasure dearly. Something you couldn't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed. \"She brainwashed you, bear. She's only using you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that matters to me? Without her, I'd be dead!\" Grills was starting to get extremely emotional and angry. \"She gave me reason to keep living!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! A reason to spread terror and pain! Don't you get it!? You're acting no matter than the people who kept you as a slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrills snapped and charged toward Kiba at blinding speed, Kiba hardly had any time to react. \"I'm nothing like them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Grills could take a swung at Kiba, he coughed up blood his body gave away. Kiba relaxed his guard as the bear-man collapsed on the ground, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Hinata, I guess I hit him with more than I thought I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's own body started to wobble around but he still stood up. \"Woah, at this rate I hope we have enough power to take down the witch...\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto will be too much for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Nine Tailed Fox...\" Muttered Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. The beast most likely wishes to destroy his bastard child. In order to win against Vulpes, Naruto will have to unleash it. And considering how angry the boy must be with Vulpes to begin with, I'd say it would only be a matter of time before your lover finds himself overwhelmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but surely he must know that! Why would he trust you to fight Naruto if he knows you're sending him off to his death!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a simple trick. See this?\" Xana held up an amulet with a fox carved on it. \"He believes lies so easily. He truly thinks we're allies. I merely told him that hitting Naruto with a copy of this would suppress the Nine Tailed Fox. He of course bought it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulpes...No...\" Whispered Aerore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you worry Aerore. You'll be with your traitorous husband soon enough. Now...sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up you giant oaf! We need to get out of here before the hag finds out we lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrills blinked his eyes several times. Standing over him was Nezumi, holding his still unconscious brother by the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I'm sorry Nezumi.\" Grills sat up and stared at his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing you lazy bear bastard! Can't you feel that chakra up on the castle!? There's a massive battle! Something big happening and I don't want to be here when it ends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy...He was right...We're no different then the masters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNezummi jumped in the air and kicked Grills right in the head, but only succeeded in hurting his own feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU MUMBLING ABOUT YOU IDIOT!? LET'S GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Nezumi, but I'm not going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say such stupid things! You know as well as I do what the witch does to those who fail at their orders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'm going to go help that guy and stop her.\" Grills stood up. \"Do you wish to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELL. NO. I'm getting out of here while I still can! You go by yourself on your suicide mission! I was just looking for some extra muscle in case we needed it when escaping!\" With that, the mouse man quickly left for the caves in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph. Oh well.\" Grills closed his eyes. \"Now where are you, brother Kiba?\"</span></div></div>",

While Vulpes was more agile and had a clearer mind, Naruto's instincts were taking over, filling him with chakra and murderous intent. Vulpes had been thrown by a chakra claw into the ground, he yelped in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!!!\" Yumi yelled, the cub tried to run to his father, but he was stopped by Kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back kid.

'Has that hag lied to me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Naruto roared, the fox's cloak had turned a drak red, completely hiding his body beneath a coat of Chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpes smirked \"Well, even if I wass lied to, I won't lose to you...Father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response was another roar, before the two clashed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't expect for you to get up that fast...You're one tough monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear man offered Kiba a hand. \"I'm sorry, but you're one to talk. Can you get up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely.\" Kiba was pulled to his feet, but his legs were filled with immense pain. \"I take it you're on our side now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked in surprise. \"No? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my own side Brother Kiba, it's just a matter of convenience that our ultimate goals are the same. And I can use all the help I can get to accomplish my task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enemy of my enemy, huh? Well that's fine by me.\" Suddenly his ears twitched. \"What the hell is going on out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one called Naruto is currently fighting against a powerful ally of the witch. I believe his name was Vulpes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened, but he gave a long sigh. \"So that's what happened then? Well, let's get going to the witch Grills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we shouldn't go and help the boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. We'd just be getting in his way. Naruto is stronger than all of us. Whoever it is, he can handle it. Besides Hinata is counting on me. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the very beginning, I've lead you two into our clutches.\" Those words which had been spoken from Vulpes mouth echoed in Naruto's head. Rage, endless rage clouded his vision. The power of the fox was seething throughout his body. He hadn't been this angry since Sasuke left. There was only one command Naruto gave to his body. KILL. Kill Vulpes. Destroy him. Rip his heart out. Let him choke on his own blood for doing this to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a massive red chakra swipe at the incoming fox. Strangely enough, Vulpes didn't evade the blow. A torrent of blood flew in the air. It was as if he was purposely trying to get hit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Thought Vulpes. \"He's so blinded by rage that he neglected to realize he's allowing the precious chakra of my father is seeping into my wounds. Just a little more and I'll be able to do it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto made another light slash across Vulpes face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\" Yelled Vulpes, he ran right up to Naruto and bit down hard on his shoulder. The fox-carrier roared in pain but could not move. Vulpes was slowly developing his own red aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've let your guard down Naruto.\" Mumbled Vulpes to the boy. \"With the small amounts of my father's essence coursing through my veins, I am able to attract and drain his very being into my own body! Soon your energy reserves will be entirely depleted and then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto couldn't hear him. There was too much rage coursing through his mind. All he heard was chanting, steady as a war drum. \"Kill...Kill...Kill...Kill...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red aura around Naruto doubled, another tail sprouted next to the first. \"KILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Vulpes was knocked into the wall with a spine shattering crack. Naruto gave him no time to take the recoil and pummeled him with a machine-gun-like barrage of blows. Blood spilled into the air like a fountain. Naruto did not even need to use chakra to damage him, the claws on his hands were enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGashing wounds appeared all over Vulpes body, and there was no sign of Naruto ceasing the assault. In an instant, the tide had totally turned. Vulpes lost too much blood was too fast and was slowly beginning to black out. But still Naruto didn't let up. It was a gruesome sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-damn witch...\" Thought Vulpes as he stared into the hatred of Naruto's eyes. Naruto had the same eyes that he had when he first learned the fate of his beloved mate. \"No, I caused this...Aerore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto brought his hand back for a killing blow and charged up a Rasengan.</span></div></div>",

Not one of these cubs would let that hag live if she used us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, however, there was cruel laughter. \"Oh Vulpes. Do you really think your pups could do such a thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to see Xana, alongside an unconscious Hinata and Kohana. All three were in a magic circle, bathed in a purple light. Xana then held a dagger to Kohana's throat.\"But you needn't worry.

Hinata's soul had been taken from their shared body, leaving the wolf alone in the Hyuga heiress' body. She was tired and confused, mostly by the absence of her close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill standing was Xana. She was the only one unaffected physically or spiritually, but something in her mind was unhinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer was she quite so lucid, instead she seemed to have lost her mind. Her will to see her daughter was not only one of her greatest ambitions, but also one of her greatest dreams. During the spell, she was required to focus on that one person, her daughter Ren, but Vulpes' attack had caused her mind to wander back to that accursed princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of her misery.

Xana should've been hurt the most since she was nearest to the source of the noise, but she only held her disfigured child tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Aerore had ran towards her comrades unnoticed by either the behemoth or it's creator.

Mr. Kiba! Wait, where's Luna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrills lowered Kiba to his feet, he staggered slightly but was able to stand. \"Don't know. Grills followed the witch's trail from the prison room. We couldn't find her...Huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba at last noticed the grunting monster in front of him. \"...What the hell is that thing? And where is Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine...for now.\" Answered Kit, preparing to fight Ren who was slowly returning to reality. \"We're about to get really busy though. You guys good to fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of them took a fighting stance and surrounded the howling beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was crawling through the ventilation of the castle, she had been following the smell of the witch to find Kohana and Hinata. They had gone up but suddenly...Hinata's and Kohana's scents disappeared. Now the entire roof of the castle reeked of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had woken up, the other girls had been taken away and brother Kiba was unconscious, she knew there was no time to waste. She had to do something to save her friends. Her claws were bleeding when she dig into the side of the vertical vents. She had to hurry and do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the highest tower of the castle, the large clock had its two giant hands placed at twelve. The clock gonged but did little to drown out the sounds of fighting. Twelve loud earth rumbling rings filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! Aerore charged at Xana, narrowly dodging two more shots of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDONG! Kit and Grills tackled Ren while Kiba tried to hit her from above. Akamaru and Yumi attacked her from the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! Aerore bit down on the wooden staff Xana swung around, snapping it into a bunch of little splinters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDONG! Kit was thrown back from a giant kick, Grills held his ground though. Kiba gave everything he had into his punch but only succeeded in feeling something snap in his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! Aerore was thrown back by a blast of magic from Xana's hand. The witch glared at the wolf and prepared to strike with a bigger lightning bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDONG! Kit was slowly getting to his feet again, Akamaru and Yumi narrowly avoided being stepped on. Grills, was taking the most damage, blood was everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! Aerore rolled on the ground, a bolt of lightning left a gigantic crater where she had been moments again. She sprung to her feet and focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDONG! Kit watched in horror as the bear man Grills was sent flying into the ceiling of the underground cavern. Akamaru got kicked out of the way while Yumi desperately bit Ren's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! Aerore rushed at Xana as her form turned into that of a wispy ghost. She jumped at the witch as she muttered something under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDONG! Kit tried to save Yumi, but the pup was smashed into the wall, next to Naruto. Kiba came in with another swing but was crushed into the ground. Kit was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! Aerore knew she should have connected the attack with the witch, but she instead went right through her. That was the extent of her power, she was completely drained. She was alone.</span></div></div>",

Not too far away, Kiba was besides his wounded pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wildman's arms was fractured in many places, but he managed to use the less injured one to prop himself up agonizingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around to see Naruto, barely conscious, groaning and watching helplessly as Kit did his best to evade the lightning swift attacks from his Cerberus like opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as the foxman might, he couldn't dodge forever, and ended up with a terrible gash across his face. Reaching from Kit's forehead to his right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-crap!!\" Kiba swore as he observed the one sided slaughter, \"That thing can't be that strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words managed to reach Xana, who laughed as she looked at her longtime foe in Hinata's body. \"My dear child, Ren is much more powerful than you can imagine.

She wasn't as strong as the others, and clung to life by the thinnest of threads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may die due to your wretched child, but at least you shall perish as well.\" Aerore said, watching her dying victim, her muzzle dyed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed she was now the only one able to face Ren, when she saw a very welcome sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was her daughter, Luna, standing strong against the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore figures approached from behind her, including a large gray wolf with tinted orange fur going from his ears to his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lupus...?\" Muttered Aerore, her strength was about to wane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello mother...\" Spoke the large wolf in a gruff voice. \"It seems we've just made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked around at the battle scene; it was a grizzly sight, worse then anything she could imagine. Aside the living atrocity in front of her, there were numerous bodies scattered around the floor. All bleeding, all near death, all faces she recognized. Her brother...Naruto...her father...She felt herself longing to cry, but she shuddered it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your chin up, little sister.\" Barked Lupus as he and the other two black wolves behind him prepared to strike. \"There's still fighting to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore felt herself passing out. \"Wh-what about t-the rest of the pack? A-are they...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On their way. I was the first to sense Luna's call for help and was the first to arrive. Go to Vulpes, mother. This will be over soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aerore nodded and stumbled over to her husband's defeated body, the monster slowly lumbered it's way to its dying \"mother\". Xana lifted up her hands trying to speak to her creation, no words could come out of her mouth. Only blood. Ren sniffed Xana and gave a mournful wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother...Mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupus spat. \"How awful, the witch has created a monstrosity of hatred and sadness. I only hope we can save the hosts before it's too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata...Kohana...\" Whispered Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the beast howling into the air, causing a shock wave that nearly knocked the wolves off their feet. The very tower they stood on shuddered under the mix of pain and agony that emitted from the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow wolf creatures that had been so patiently watching the battle the entire time now lunged at the four wolves, thousands upon thousands of them. All teeth and claws aimed at Lupus and his guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna! Stay under our cover!\" Shouted Lupus as he and his alpha pack counterattacked. They formed a protective barrier around Luna as the black shadows descended upon them like a wave of locust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood and shadow spilled into the air but nothing seemed to deter the mass of muscle and fur that shielded the young wolfing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my mark!\" Snarled Lupus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three adult wolves readied their hide legs to pounce back at the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree massive slashes jetted outwards, cutting into the waves of shadow creatures like grass. They had managed to draw a line in the army of shadows, all that remained of the legion were a few stranglers that were in the outer portion of the horde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupus turned to the two black wolves. \"Take care of the survivors!\" They nodded and then Lupus turned to his sister. \"You're with me sis. Let's take this beast down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen was still loudly sobbing over Xana. The witch slowly raised a wrinkled blood stained finger at the two wolves fast approaching her daughter. But Ren merely swatted them away with a whip of her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill you....KILL YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupus caught his sister with his back before she hit the ground. They were both alright, the sudden attack had merely surprised them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for getting it while it was distracted...\" Said Lupus as he licked a few drops of blood around his mouth. \"Flanking it will do no good Luna, try to get it from above. Take no unnecessary risks. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" This being only her second real battle, Luna was quite nervous especially when facing such a daunting and terrifying foe. She had to be strong though, she couldn't back down from this. Not when all her friends and family had given so much for this fight. All eyes were on her and Lupus. She took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn of the tide was at hand...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The duel was unlike any other Luna had seen. Her elder brother Lupus was staring down the monstrous Ren as if she was merely another wolf. That was the amazing thing about Lupus, as the eldest, he always had a calm mind and a grand confidence.  Never had Luna thought that anyone aside from maybe Vulpes or Aerore could best him, but seeing the wraith of bloodlust and destruction that was Ren, she was beginning to feel dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this gloom didn\u2019t reach Lupus, who was more than a tad upset at the fact that his younger brother and his reborn mother were being attacked by the daunting entity. \u201cNow then, you miserable excuse for a bitch, let\u2019s see how skilled you are.\u201d The half-breed said, his sounding rather calm, only the slightest undertone of arrogance present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen\u2019s only response was a deep, primal roar, issuing from all three heads. \u201cDIE!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen \u2019s right paw, now swathed in a malicious, miasmic aura went toward Lupus. He was barely able to evade it.  Seizing his opportunity, Lupus growled and bit down on the beast\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen growled a bit in pain, but swung her arm until the offending wolf-fox let go. She once again utilized one of her tails as a whip, beating Lupus with them in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAGHH!!\u201d Lupus howled, his bones breaking from the force of the blows. The Gentle hearted Luna was on the verge of breaking down,  and the others could barely watch. Somehow though, Lupus managed to maneuver out of the way of the lethal appendages. He did have heavy injuries, but what hurt the worst was his pride. Rarely did he lose, and even when he was a cub Lupus was somewhat vengeful against creatures who weren\u2019t close to him. Unexpectedly, an aura of pale tangerine colored chakra enveloped his body. It was fiery like the Nine-Tails\u2019 chakra, but much weaker. Still, the energy was strong enough that Lupus believed it could injure his enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you are pretty strong, but\u2026TRY THIS!!!!\u201d He cried as he rushed headlong towards Ren\u2019s body, like a blazing missile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brilliant, near blinding flash of light, but when everyone\u2019s eyesight returned, a defeated, blood bathed wolf laid silently on the ground, while a sizeable wound remained on the three headed she-beast\u2019s ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLUPUS!!!!!\u201d Aerore howled, not daring to believe that her eldest son might be dead. \u201cNo! No! No! No\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother!\u201d Yumi managed to cough, \u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the presence of utter defeat was thick in the ear, even though the two other half-wolves were fully capable fighters, they were weakened by the shadow wolves and stood no chance. Not a single warrior who had faced Ren dared cling to the hope that the amalgamated being could be bested, or even that Hinata or Kohana could be saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one who had yet to face her stood her ground, albeit fearfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked to see Luna, who had hung back in terror throughout the entire battle, but now something within her had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that the fear still existed within her, but now it was being pushed aside. A more powerful, more valorous emotion had risen to the surface of the half-fox\u2019s very being: Courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourage born of love, loyalty, and the need to protect those important to you. A courage made of the most important things in life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, strong enough or not, Luna was ready to fight with the entirety of her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, this change sparked something within Ren. She, a misbegotten \u201cchild\u201d, combined with other foreign souls and reborn into a being of pure suffering and malice could feel something else\u2026a strange and faint sense of warmness, with potential to grow stronger than what she felt for her Mother. Still, the beast did her best to resist this sensation, focusing solely on the annihilation of everything in her path\u2026Starting with Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026You\u2026\u201d The creature began, still confused before she managed to catch herself,  \u201cYOU WILL SUFFER!!!!!\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Luna heard the threatening cry that escaped Ren\u2019s beastly jaws, her mind was too focused to be daunted. Suddenly, a light blue chakra, more elegant than the seemingly slain Lupus\u2019 enveloped her body, illuminating and awe inspiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig sister Hinata, Kohana, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d She said, before making her assault. </span></div></div>",

Something human-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Something in pain. It was as if Luna could feel Ren's very essence cry out for release.<br>\r\n Hinata and Kohana were holding the beast back? Possibly, but highly unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The little wolf in the blue energy and the mammoth-like monster stared each other down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Each waiting for the other to make the first strike. If Luna could sweat, it'd be running down her back at this point.<br>\r\n The intensity of the moment was so thick you could cut the air with a knife. Was<br>\r\n this what it was like when Lupus, Hinata, or her mother fought? Was this how it felt to<br>\r\n be strong? A burning desire to protect everyone. The will to end the fighting. Enough was enough.<br>\r\n The first was swift and deadly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna thrust her self forward, calling upon all the might within her body, using a kind of speed that would make Rock Lee envious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Her strike at first was nothing more than a simple bite to one of Ren's paws, and yet<br>\r\n it seemed to cause her severe pain. The She-monster roared, trying to wave her foe off as she swung her fore paw around, but Luna wouldn't let go until she was flung upwards.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Once airborne she seized the chance and came downward, striking Ren's middle head straight on. She landed on the ground, albeit shakily. Her energy mostly spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Luna saw it. An opening. The beast had tilted its heads up and was roaring in pain. How long did she have before it snapped out of its frustration? Five seconds? Two? Didn't matter. Luna's body was already moving on its own, like she had done this thousands of times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that stood in her way was the mask of doubt. Could she do this? This was undoubtedly her final attack, most of her energy had been spent getting to the battleground and fighting for as long as she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. There couldn't be any doubt, not this time. Not in herself. Not with so many of her friend's lives on the line. Summoning all her energy, Luna crouched down and prepared to strike at Ren dead center in its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the heads finally stopped crying out, Luna pushed off the ground. Like a miniature missile, she propelled herself into the air towards her target. She could do this. This was going to be a direct hit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blow hit home, landing exactly where Ren\u2019s previous foe had last harmed her. There was an explosion of chakra emanating from the spot where Luna struck, making the canine-monster\u2019s pain all the more excruciating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Ren howled, phantom trails of energy were seeping from her newly created weak point. It was as if a bit of her evil essence was dissipating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething deep seated and malicious had begun to die, it\u2019s very soul ceasing to be. Once it truly disappeared, only internal suffering would  remain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it would be several minutes before that happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grand, foul cry, Ren Grabbed Luna by the hind legs and squeezed. Putting all of her remaining evil into one crushing grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\u201d Luna cried, feeling pain no child should ever have to feel. Her bones and muscles didn\u2019t ache, for they were all but destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuna!!!\u201d Aerore screamed, fearing that another of her precious children would be lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments Ren\u2019s grip loosened, more of Hinata or Kohana\u2019s spirit taking over the accursed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey half-wolf cub was breathing, but her lower body was obliterated. Quickly her two remaining siblings came and managed to move her before Ren could strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Naruto felt a burning desire to act. Everyone had suffered enough while he sat back, albeit badly wounded\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly, Naruto ambled forward, fatique making his steps slow, his eyesight blurry from agony. 'I've...got to stop this...' was the only thing that ran through his mind, pain making his thoughts disorganized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him, Aerore could see that he couldn't make it, not by himself. The power of the Nine tailed fox deserted had him, and while his own chakra reserve was vast, he was  in no shape to continue. She had to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was staggering, at this point walking normally was an impossible challenge. Each limp forward felt like some had taken a knife and stabbed his leg. He couldn't quit though, he couldn't back down. That wasn't his way. Just like the fight with Gaara or Kabuto, he couldn't just give up. If he just kept pushing everything would turn out fine, just like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to normal...\" Whispered Naruto. \"Hah...That's a laugh...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n There was no back to normal after this. The damage had been done and now Naruto was seeing it with his own eyes. Luna was lying flat on her side, coughing up an<br>\r\n abnormal amount of blood. Her legs they...They just didn't look like legs anymore. They<br>\r\n were bent in a sickening angle. Shards of bone jutted out from the skin. If Naruto had the strength for it, he'd probably vomit at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As one of the black wolves dug around in a pack on its side, Naruto asked it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Is...Is she going to be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProducing some bandage the wolf replied. \"She's alive, but only just. Every bone in her legs has been broken, combined with the dark energies of that monster it may be impossible for her to walk around again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be impossible for her to walk around again.\" Those words<br>\r\n echoed in Naruto's head like the clanging of a giant bell. The fox boy gritted his<br>\r\nteeth, wanting nothing more then to just deny the statement. But he didn't have to be a doctor to see the wolf was correct. Luna had lost her legs forever..<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That's so unfair...\" He muttered with a twinge in his tired eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She was so young and...That's just so...unfair...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n A large shadow loomed over the distraught Naruto. Ren was moving in for the kill.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"That's so unfair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen had managed to crawl towards Naruto on all fours, her wounds had kept her from walking erect, but her lingering instincts...The drive to kill, to make them suffer.<br>\r\n Something was bugging her in specific. about this blonde boy. Seeing him set something off, something more than what Luna did...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Seeing him made her feel worse, it was if something pure and wholesome had fused with her reigning desire to murder him, dying her claws red with his blood... the pain was maddening, she had to end it. Faster than the normal eye could follow, her forepaw went forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! Her mighty claw slammed down right where Naruto had been standing. The two black wolves quickly pulled Luna backwards, attempting to avoid the blow back of the strike. As the dust cleared, Ren howled a fearsome and mournful cry. That one strike had hurt her in a way more then just physically. Slowly, she lifted her gigantic claw up out of the smoking crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was no where to be found. At first the beast thought it had obliterated the ninja, but it turned to the left following the sound of panting. Aerore, while breathing heavily, had Naruto's shirt collar in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aerore gently set him down, Naruto covered his forehead with his hand. \"...Isn't fair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore spoke in a commanding tone, though soft and motherly. \"Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to turn away and ignore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto.\" She spoke once more, with a stronger tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grimaced and faced the beaten wolf mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me Naruto, don't turn away. It isn't your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have gotten here faster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore sighed. \"There was nothing you could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have done something! Anything! It's...It's because of this Luna's life is ruined! I failed her! She can never walk again now because of this! And now...now...Hinata and...and Kohana....\" He covered his eyes. Naruto wasn't crying, but he was hurt real bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, I know your in pain, and I hurt as well,\" Aerore said as a tear sprung from her eye. \"It's no easy thing for me to accept, knowing my youngest cub will be crippled, but we can at least save her life and the lives of Kohana and Hinata, but only if you regain your will to fight.\" She said sternly, trying her best not to think of Vulpes, or the horrific price of defeat...<br>\r\n\"At least?\" Replied Naruto. \"At least!? If it hadn't been for you guys! If...If Hinata had never gotten involved with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto choked on the last words. He was redirecting all his anger and frustration at Aerore, but even that couldn't silence the sharp pain in his heart. No one had ever told him that they loved him before. Not one person. The thought of losing Hinata was...too painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is always an 'if' Naruto. A what if. Another possibility. A single desperate hope that we long to cling to, a lie to comfort ourselves in the darkest of hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox boy looked up at the white wolf. Tears were slowly dripping down her face. But Aerore continued speaking, despite a shakiness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to b-believe that Luna c-could walk out of this u-unscathed. And that e-everything would just go back to n-normal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and wiped her eyes with her front paw. \"But I'd just be lying to myself...Life is, and always has been, about holding onto what you can as everything else slowly fades away. Life is cruel. Life is never fair. And you know what Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories, solid pictures of Naruto's life growing up quickly flashed in front of his eyes. The pain of being picked on. The silent dread of being alone. Not a friend in the world to comfort him. Hell on earth. With a calm but weak voiced, Naruto answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore smiled. \"In the end, it's always right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Naruto's mind he was remembering all the good times with his teammates; Sakura's violent rejections, Sasuke's constant rivalry, Kakashi's insistent request that Naruto would start eating healthier. Iruka's stern teachings, but kind words over a dinner of ramen. Shino and Choji getting in trouble with him after classes. Tsunade and Jiraiya smirking at his diligent training. Rock Lee giving him the thumbs up. And...Hinata standing there smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral endless moments passed before Naruto spoke again. He was talking to Aerore, but he faced the dying monster that was Ren as he spoke, looking for something within any of her six, hate filled eyes. For a moment, it seemed as if he had found it. \"Let's go wild then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline pumping through his veins, Naruto summoned around 4000 shadow clones, half of which went forward to strike the weakened enemy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Using one of his older ploys, the clones started with The 2k Barrage attack. <br>\r\n They may as well been gnats striking a T-rex, as all the attacks fell short of harm.<br>\r\n Lashing out, Ren decimated half of them. Within the cover of the smoke though, 500<br>\r\n transformed into large shuriken, which the remainder threw, scoring a plethora of small,<br>\r\n irritating nicks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Once more, Ren charged a Chakra beam, and killed them. This time, she heard a stampede, and turned to see an army of Narutos riding on Aerore's back, each one wielding a rasengan.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Too weak to fire another Chakra beam, Ren suffered several more serious injuries. Each one causing her to yowl in pain, but not fell her. For none had hit her weak point. She managed to take down most, but while she was distracted, the real Naruto and Aerore leapt into the air. Ren managed to see Naruto, wielding an extremely large, lavender colored Rasengan, head towards her weak spot. Somehow though, he managed to project it, using the Nine tails' fox cloak to fire it like a missile.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n It wouldn'tve made it, but Aeroe howled, imbuing her cry with her own energy. The lavender Rasengan covered in red energy suddenly took on the form of a wolf's head, and struck home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within moments, there was a bright flash of light which momentarily blinded all who saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was barely able to raise his head to see what had occurred. Even with his superior healing skills, it would be weeks before he was fully healed. When the light had disappeared, Ren\u2019s body was gone, and in it\u2019s place were two glowing mists and Kohana, sleeping peacefully. One of the ethereal orbs were light lavender in color. Being around it, one could feel a soft, timid kindness exuding from it. One that, while meek and peaceful contained a powerful, nearly indomitable will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next soul was a faint, cinnamon color. It was much smaller than it\u2019s lilac counterpart, and seemed highly disoriented. It was fearful, confused\u2026a mixture of memories and faint images were within the otherwise innocent being. Slowly it flitted from Kohana, to Naruto, then Aerore and lastly Luna. When it came upon the injured pup, the spirit hovered down closer to it. Then somehow it made everyone around it feel it\u2019s words, as it had no physical means of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I\u2026Did I do this?\" The specter asked. It\u2019s voice was that of a toddler\u2019s, yet the words were as clear and eloquent as if a learned adult had spoken them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the lavender orb, flew towards it\u2019s companion. \"No\u2026You didn\u2019t Ren. The Monster did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Naruto gasped and managed to call out to the larger orb\u2026He recognized the voice. \u201cHinata!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the blonde could feel her acknowledging his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren...\" Came the childish voice again. The crimson orb flickered from place to place. \"That's such a nice name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your name.\" Said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name....My name? I have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb seemed to swell with a blueish color, Naruto was filled with an indescribable happiness of the likes which he had never felt before. The orb was bouncing up and down, like a child, reflecting its true nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren? Ren! That's my name! That's MY name! Ren! I have a name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of happiness radiated from Hinata's spirit as well. \"Yes, you have a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a name...\" Repeated Ren. Its reddish hue was returning as the spirit calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was pulling himself towards the floating entities, he still had no idea what was going on, only that this lavender spirit seemed to be Hinata. It was her essence, it was her. He reached out for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata...Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the spirit spoke to him. \"Yes, Naruto, I am here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" The blonde boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...I think this is my soul, and Ren's soul.\" The spirit confessed. Naruto then gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does...Does that mean you're dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not dead...\" Came a weak voice from behind Naruto. Aerore was struggling to pull herself up, most of the muscles in her body were beyond their limits but she still somehow gathered the strength to stand. \"...At least, not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore was still focusing on standing, but gave a strained explanation. \"From what...I can gather...That entity we fought and defeated was...A combination of Hinata, Kohona, and Ren's body and souls...I'm guessing the witch intended to use Hinata's soul to summon Ren's...Then put Ren's soul into Kohona's body...Reviving her from the dead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, what happened?\" Asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Vulpes crossed the summoning circle...Something must have malfunctioned...I'm not sure what exactly but...There was a fourth presence in that body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The monster...\" Spoke Ren, her red orb shivered slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. \" Aerore affirmed. \"It was thanks to Luna that most of the evil spirit was destroyed... and Hinata and Kohana for holding it back. Now we can put Xana\u2019s wretched life behind us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho? Who is Xana?\u201d Ren asked curiously. \u201cI feel like I\u2026I know her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one who was still able to talk said anything, but Aerore turned her head in the direction of the hag\u2019s corpse. \u201cShe was the witch who cursed you and my allies\u2026and caused your sister such pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-my sister?\u201d The soul asked, before turning back to Luna. Yumi\u2019s eyes were wide, as were those of the two other conscious children, but no one said a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my precious Ren, but\u2026It\u2019ll be okay. She will live past this, but your brother Lupus and father Vulpes\u2026They await us in our home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome? Where is our home\u2026Mommy?\u201d The young ball of raw Life asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the Afterlife\u2026\u201d Aerore explained gently. Somehow she managed to walk over to Yumi and pick him up by the scruff of his neck. He winced since his body still hurt, but was laid gently beside Luna. Looking up, he faced his last living parent. \u201cMother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYumi my son. With your Father and Lupus dead, we no longer have a pack leader. You are young still, yet you and Luna possess such energy, such potential. As of this moment I am going to give clan leadership to Crest\u2026But I want you to look after Luna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mother.\u201d The cub managed to say. He looked to be on the verge of crying, yet he held it in. He had to be strong now, for with no parents and his sister crippled\u2026He needed to show that he was capable of handling the harshness of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, in five years time\u2026You shall become the next Clan leader, and I know you shall be great.\u201d With that, she licked him and Luna once upon their brows affectionately. She then faced Crest and Wane, the two present wolf-fox hybrids and gave a bow, which they returned. Then she went besides Hinata\u2019s orb of light, Ren\u2019s own trailing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata\u2026Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates of heaven must have opened up, the light was so blinding that no one could see a thing. The spirit orbs and Aerore disappeared in the glowing mist. Naruto winced in pain to see what was happening, but he couldn't make anything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the blinding fog disappeared. There was nothing left save the body of a single dark haired girl lying unconscious on the ground.</span></div></div>",

There was a deadness in the air, like the world had just been over a great tragedy and was bracing itself for the repercussions to come. The dying trees shuddered releasing withered leaves that rained on the ground. But in the midst of things, two young lovers walked hand in hand down the blistery woodland trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invasion of Pain had been a little more than a week ago and Hinata had just fully recovered from her injuries. Naruto's mind was on the death of Nagato, as well as how his fellow shinobi were suffering. That's why he had suggested going to a place only the two of them knew about...So they could escape their suffering before Naruto left for the Land of Steel, and so that they could be together before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding Hinata's hand tightly, Naruto and she drew ever closer to a certain cave-like den. Hinata felt a great wave of nostalgia overtake her. Just seeing the dwelling in the distance made her grow warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they're still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't answer, he wasn't sure how to. After the business in the underground fortress and the fight against Xana...It just seemed so long ago. Worst of all, it never felt concluded. It felt like all of them had lost something important that day, some more then others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached, the shinobi's hopes slowly faltered like the dying leaves in the trees. The place looked deserted, it hadn't been touched in years. The cave was covered in mold and was cracking in some of the more 'soft' parts, making it look unstable. There was a fire pit, the bits of charcoal had long since blow away in the wind. Everything was dead and decayed, like a mausoleum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spoke at last, surveying the ruins with a look of sadness in his eyes. \"I feel old Hinata...Really, old. Just being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata bent over to dig through a layer of leaves covering the ground. She found a small stone necklace of a wolf and fox and held it up like it was more precious then anything else in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tossed a skipping stone across the small lake next to the cave. It bounced once, then twice, and then finally sunk to the cold depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it all for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...For you, and Kiba...and and our friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this triggered tender memories within Hinata's heart.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She recalled meeting Xana, then growing more confident, her transformation, Meeting<br>\r\n Aerore, then Vulpes, Luna, Yumi, Kohana, reuniting with Naruto, telling him and Kiba the<br>\r\n truth, Vulpes' betrayal, and meeting with the spirit of Ren. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Then the goodbye. All of there memories, tender and untouched for years. suddenly she broke down and cried. Instantly the blonde shinobi knelt down and hugged her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh Naruto...Why, why did they have to suffer?\" Hinata sobbed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Because of Xana and maybe Vulpes...but that was because he was in love. At least<br>\r\n Kohana, Luna, and Yumi are still alive right?\" He tried to console her, but it seemed futile.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"But we had a part in it, we...We helped ruin their lives.\" Hinata cried, caught between anger and agony. \"It's not fair, it's not!!! If only we had never met them, if I hadn\u2019t met Xana, then maybe it would've been b-better for them.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n As she stifled cries into his shoulders, Naruto himself remembered something. A wise saying a friend had told him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hinata, there is always an 'if'. A what if. Another possibility. A single desperate hope that we long to cling to, a lie to comfort ourselves in the darkest of hours. I'd love to tell you that after we left everything was okay and now they're pretty happy, but I'd just be lying to myself...Life is, and always has been, about holding onto what you can as everything else slowly fades away. Life is cruel. Life is never fair. But y'know...In the end, it's always right somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata choked on her tears slightly, slowly trying to calm herself down. Slowly trying to be strong, knowing full well who Naruto was quoting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey owed them all so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled and reached for the stone amulet, still clutched in Hinata's hands. The markings had left imprints in her skin she was holding onto to it so tightly. With tenderness, she released her grip on the necklace and slid it into Naruto's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...It'd be nice to see them all again...You know...Just to know how they're doing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rustling in the leaves behind them caused both of them to spin around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister Hinata? Naruto?\" Said a familiar voice, made deeper and stronger by age.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was a little bigger than Akamaru, and looked alot like Vulpes, with the kind of smile the ninja had seen Aerore use.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You two have barely changed.\" He laughed running towards them. \"I really<br>\r\n missed you guys, and Kiba and Akamaru. How are they?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"They're fine.\" Hinata said after composing herself and wiping the last of her<br>\r\n tears. \"They were hurt in a battle, but nothing too serious. How have you been?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Being asked about his life since their last meeting made Yumi's expression to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He had become more serious, like he too had aged. \"Hard. A lot has changed...After you guys left we found out that Luna really never would be able to walk again, after that I went through training with my older brothers. I began to become a warrior for my clan and fought many foes, I can\u2019t say I won every fight, and every loss wasn\u2019t graceful\u2026Even so I\u2019ve gotten stronger and survived, and Luna received a kind of gift.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Gift? Whaddya mean?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Remember when she struck the Monster while it had taken Sister Hinata and Kohana? I think that when she did, some of that stuff that spilled out was magic that Xana had put on Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But Xana cursed my body, not my spirit, right?\" The Hyuga heiress asked, becoming confused.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"To be honest I'm not sure, but mom told me...way back before we met you guys that magic affected one's being, not just their body. So maybe when the evil was being purged the curse began to break. Anyway she got your old power.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You mean she can become human?!\" Hinata gasped wide eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. As a matter of fact she's human right now, and visiting Kohana's kingdom. It turns out she's an excellent ambassador. Right now she and Kohana are working together to make a safehaven for our clan. It may take a few years, but we have a better future than we had a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Well I'm glad to hear it Yumi.\" Hinata said hugging him softly. Her worries had been eased by this information, \"I hope that everything works out for you. Afterall you'll be leading your pack soon.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yes. Kinda like how big brother Naruto wanted to become Hokage. I bet he will, the<br>\r\n way he beat down Xana's Monster.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Speaking of which...Whatever happened to Kit and Grills?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a large figure began romping around in the trees behind them. Naruto and Hinata looked alarmed but Yumi made an annoyed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on...I didn't want to be followed...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting from the trees was a giant bear like creature, it had on white robes as well as a shield strapped to its back. Naruto and Hinata relaxed, they knew who it was almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Yumi!\" Roared the bear creature. \"I'm sorry, but you were ordered not to leave my sight. I cannot allow you to wander off again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi glared. \"Spare me please, Grills. I'm allowed to come here whenever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grills?\" Said both Hinata and Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear man blinked a few times. \"I'm sorry, I vaguely recall you two from somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto and Hinata...\" Muttered Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, from the incident with the witch...Yes, I'm sorry, it's all coming back to me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it...\" Said Hinata. \"What are you doing here, Grills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the fight with the beast, Master Yumi succeeded in allowing both me and Master Kit to join up with their clan. It was a generous offer indeed after all the harm we had caused. I was given the position of the young master's babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bodyguard!\" Growled Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kit is a part of the clan now too?\" Ask Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrills paused for a moment, and looked down. \"I'm sorry, Master Naruto. Master Kit declined and left on his own some time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Naruto asked, he looked a little dissappointed, \"It's weird, but I miss the guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I, but Kit was always that kind of man.\" Grills said calmly, \u201cMore than likely he's out there somewhere doing some soul searching.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sure we'll meet him again someday though.\" Yumi said before sitting down, Grills did the same. \"So how have you two been these past years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Naruto and Hinata began to relay tales of their adventures. Stories of growth, strange happenings, the loss of other close friends, and how they had been fighting Akatsuki. Yumi and Grills listened attentively, but after they finished, the Wolf-fox had a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you two still together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Umm...We didn't break up but things didn't have time to take off.\" Naruto said, \"Pervy sage had us leave a little bit after I healed up entirely, and we haven't had much time to ourselves lately....For awhile we were kind of scared to get together until Hinata told me that she loved me. \" The blonde said holding his girlfriend's hand tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that and the fight against Pain, we got together again and came here to see you guys again.\" Hinata continued, \"And we're glad we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi smiled bittersweetly. \"Your lucky you chose today....We're leaving for Kohana's nation tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp wind from the east blew in, cascading between the group as a slight pause filled the air. The heaviness set in as a creeping realization began to dwell over the assembly of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...You guys are leaving for good then?\" Asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi gave a melancholy response. \"Yeah...At least for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Master Yumi, but we can always make a trip back whenever you please. You aren't leader of the pack yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winds swirled around them like a whirlwind, blowing leaves to and fro in a tornado. Yumi closed his eyes and smiled. He really looked so different now; mature, strong. Loads different from the little trouble making pup Hinata remembered tagging along with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChange was in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make a trip to visit you.\" Added Hinata. \"After this whole war is over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that...I think Luna would look forward to seeing you guys again too. Kohana wants to see everyone too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Yumi, catch ya later.\" Naruto said sadly, putting his hand on the wolf's forehead. He did his best to not let it show \"Keep getting stronger.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yes, make sure to tell everyone we said hi. And take care too Grills.\" Hinata added. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I will sister Hinata, brother Naruto, until then.\" Grills said bowing, \"Shall<br>\r\n we go Master Yumi?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah...Take care too Brother Naruto,\" Yumi said before he and his \"bodyguard bounded off on top of the collapsed den. He then spoke to them once more. \"Make sure you two bring your kids when they're born!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n That last comment made both Shinobi blush. Naruto would've said something, but Yumi was far off by the time he composed himself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n They stood there smiling after several minutes, letting the wind blow over them until Naruto spoke up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"We just saw him again and I already can't wait until we meet them again.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Hinata nodded. \"Me too. That's one journey I'll never forget....But we still have another.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah...The Akatsuki...and Sasuke.\" He said grimly. He was about to brood, when Hinata took his hand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"And when it's over, maybe you can tell him about this.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Those gentle words were enough to bring the Jinchuuriki back to happiness, and he replied staring into his love's gentle lavender eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah....Maybe. For now why don't we get some ramen? I'll buy.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Let's.\" Hinata said, brimming with happiness.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n And that is the story of how Hinata and Naruto met the spirit of a Aerore, and how Hinata's courage grew stronger. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Come whatever may, she and Naruto now had the confidence and strength to fight on, and though one great journey had ended and they were continuing another...They were ready for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hinata would tackle her trials with the ferocity of a Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A stage took up the southern part of the cafe, maids would sometimes sing and dance for the pleasure of the audience. The rest of the area was devoted to tables and booths, which were currently filled with dozens of young men. Hinata prayed that Naruto wouldn't show up, she'd probably end up making a fool of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can start,\" Said Sen. \"By taking orders for customers. Just write them down and give them to the barkeeper, okay Hinata? Are...you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was spacing out. \"Huh?!

Her entire body was tingling and becoming unbearably hot. She was afraid that whatever Sen had injected into her was affecting her in a very VERY bad way. Still, she couldn't make a fuss. In two hours she would have a break and she could run home immediately to get the milk. Giving a big sigh, she rolled up her sleeves and went to her first customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello sir, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her shift, Hinata had these strange urges. One time, a man had ordered a salad and she stared at it for ages, drooling. It looked like the most tasty thing on the planet. Even stranger, she caught herself several times looking out the window at the fields of grass. She had an impulse to tear off all her clothes and do nothing all day but eat grass! This, thankfully, distracted her from the terrible outfit she had to wear. The shoes were high heels, something she was not accustomed to. They seemed to be several sizes too small for her, digging into the sides of her feet painfully. The apron had also gotten tight over her shift, especially around the chest. She had to pause in between orders to loosen the straps but nothing seemed to ease the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hinata had the moment to sit down and adjust her shoes. Her feet had lost all their feeling by now. She undid the straps and practically fell off her chair at the sight of her feet. Or should I say, hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what on earth....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth feet were now dark and hard cups that went up to her ankles. Her skin up to her knees had also changed dramatically. Soft white fur with black spots had sprouted all over her legs, like a cow. Hinata couldn't fit her shoes over the newly formed hooves and was forced to cover them with her apron. When she stood up, she noticed that her height had also increased!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have hooves...\" She whispered to herself. \"I need to get h-home and quick! O-only an hour l-left until b-break...I h-hope I make it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped that no one noticed her new changes, but gave a yelp when she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned and saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hinata stood on stage, staring nervously at the guests in Caf\u00e9 Moo, she began to feel a cold sweat come over her. So far it seemed as if none of them had noticed her hooves. She felt her heart beat going a mile a minute. Hinata was already easily excited or startled, so she could already feel herself on the verge of a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u2018It\u2019s okay Hinata, just calm down and Breathe, it\u2019ll be okay\u2026\u2019 she thought to herself as she began to dance. She moved as gracefully as she could manage, which considering her occupation as a ninja, was still great even with hooves, it was all a matter of making sure that she moved in time with the fiddles and didn\u2019t make too much noise when she stepped. From the well-lit spot, she couldn\u2019t see the audience any longer, but she could tell that her performance was getting a positive reaction due to the claps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata got so lost in her performance that she didn\u2019t notice at first the changes that continued on her body, such as her nose and mouth, changing as her lips and nose turned pink and wet, her face developing a muzzle. Despite this and her mental changes, Hinata was still mostly human mentally and the crowd did not notice, however her changes were not over yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination of the shot and her lack of taking the milk resulted in an imbalance. What would have originally just made her breasts larger and fuller and given her a stronger spine to support such a figure, was now making much more drastic changes to Hinata\u2019s body and mind as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her dance, Hinata had been wearing the French maid outfit that was signature to the staff of Caf\u00e9 Moo. Though it fit her well it had originally been loose, but during the whole of the dance Hinata felt it grow more and more tight on her body. Passingly, she thought that the material was shrinking, but in truth it was her body that was growing larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great deal of weight was being added to her frame as she started to weight little more than ten times her actual weight, coming to barely over half a ton when it was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grew from svelte to pudgy, her belly slightly showing and her breasts filling out, her rear also growing larger as more subtle changes within her bone structure. Few had noticed her added weight, as her dance ended when she was certifiably rubenesque by the end of her performance. There were many claps and when Hinata bowed and tried to thank them, she accidentally mooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself having to run as fast as possible offstage in her current state, being put in the back of the stage, Hinata\u2019s transformation began to come in full swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands began to stiffen and become more cumbersome to use as she transformed fully into a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her ears elongate and change as her weight began to redistribute itself. She became less human in shape, her body becoming more bovid and acclimating itself for quadruped movement. Her clothing, once fitting her figure well and complimenting began to rip and tear at the seams. The feeling was uncomfortable for her at first, until at last the cloth ripped, freeing her from their confines and releasing her from their pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hands and feet fully turned into hooves, the next thing Hinata felt was the spread of warmth over her body. It began to sprout a coat of fur all over all at once, covering her soft, pale skin in white fur with black spots. The lavender eyed shinobi had no idea what was going on and began to desperately try to find a way out of it. With no hands she couldn\u2019t manage to transform back to normal, and she couldn\u2019t see anyone around the back stage to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, Hinata tried to call out, but only the sound of mooing emitted, her vocal cords no longer capable of human speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she felt was a change in her chest. Her mammaries began to disappear and were soon replaced with large udders, full of fresh and nutritious milk. Small horns began to come from the top of her skull, poking out from her hair which remained after her changes. The next change was the final of the evident ones, as Hinata felt her long bovine tail emit from her hind, swishing around left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the end of Hinata\u2019s physical transformation, as at last the Sheriff and Sen both came within Hinata\u2019s sight. She tried to call to them, but the Sheriff only sighed in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDang it, Sen. It looks like she had an adverse reaction to that there shot you gave her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry Sheriff. I thought she had been drinking her milk like she was supposed to.\u201d Sen said, shrugging. \u201cStill she made it through the performance and no one seemed too concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, I reckon we\u2019re lucky they thought the whole thing was part of the show.\u201d He said as he tipped up his ten gallon hat and scratched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole Time Hinata had no idea what to do or how to react to the odd situation, but she could tell both of the two before her were concerned. Perhaps they would know a way to change her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s the issue with Tomo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe lied on her application and didn\u2019t mention she was lactose intolerant. Because of that she half-changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell we can\u2019t do much about that now, but what do we do about little miss Hyuga here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf anyone comes around, we haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d Sen said, giving her employer a cover story as she smiled blithely. \u201cAnd I doubt anyone\u2019s gonna pay another heifer much attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmm\u2026That\u2019s good and well, but we have enough quality milk givers as it is. Maybe just maybe we could sell her off. I\u2019m pretty sure some of these Ninja would enjoy having a cow\u2026I\u2019ll hafta mull it over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn\u2019t believe her ears, or the sight. Her options were staying there and seeing what her fate was, or trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had managed to stumble in the back alleys in order to avoid any unwanted gazes as her transformation had been progressing more rapidly. Her arms were now covered in cow fur and her fingers were fusing together with thickening nails growing into front hooves. Her horns were becoming more protruded and the bulge that was her udder was growing more and more. All of this was taking a toll on Hinata as she was breathing heavily, feeling her mind slowly loosing itself more and more to the animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026just a little more.\u201d She said in between pants. \u201cHave\u2026to make it back to the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she wasn\u2019t able to complete that thought as her feet stiffened and shifted to the back legs befitting of a cow. Resisting the urge to fall on all fours, she hobbled forward as she felt a growing pressure on her face. Her nose was flattening, her ears were growing larger and the rest of her visage was pushing out into a more bovine shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! I have to keep moooooooving!\u201d Hinata immediately clamped a hand over her changing mouth before looking at her appendage in horror. Her thickening fingers had shifted and melded together and her finger nails had hardened and formed front hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingle at the base of her spine signified the emerging of a tail snaking out from her pants, and cow fur now completely covered her body. Suddenly she could feel herself growing larger and heavier as she felt her organs shift inside her and her body fattened into a shape befitting of a healthy bovine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes began to tear as her uniform fell to tattered pieces to the ground and with the combined factors of her no longer human feet and her heavy body, Hinata fell to the ground on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her ribs inside her grow to keep up with her enormous body. Her udder grew larger as the pink sack filled with milk. With a little jolt, she felt her stomach grow larger and develop four individual compartments. Her lungs expanded to a size befitting her new status as cattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNn-nnuuuuuu\u2026\u201d Hinata tried to speak but language was rapidly failing her as all she could make were animal sounds. She felt her spine thicken and grow longer, causing the rest of her body to grow as well. Her head felt harder as her horns grew in and the base of her neck moved to the back of her skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pressure on her face resumed once more to a much greater degree and her flattened nose and mouth pushed out into a complete bovine muzzle. Her hair was falling out while her head grew larger to match her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding atop a pile of torn clothes, the girl once known as Hinata Hyuuga was now a healthy female cow. Looking around, she could feel the mental changes coming as her mind began regressing into a more simple state. She knew she didn\u2019t have much time left so she slowly trotted back to Sheriff. She decided that if she was going to make one last decision with her human mind, it might as well be where she will be spending her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Sheriff outside Caf\u00e9 Moo who didn\u2019t look all that surprised that a cow was making her way to the main entrance, unlike some other people who were staring at her not sure what to make of the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make it in time, eh missy?\u201d Hinata\u2019s only response was a mournful moo, Sheriff sighed. \u201cWhelp, guess nothing can be done now \u2018cept decide where you want your new life to be.  Would you like to be put to work as a milking cow? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although her feet were now human-shaped again, she now had 2 hoof-like ties on each foot. No longer in the 5 foot range, Hinata now stood around 6 feet 4 inches in height, as she now had the same fur pattern as your average bovine.

But even with these interesting facets there was one thing that Hinata found the most eye catching feature of the shop: with the exception of the man at the register <u>ALL</u> the workers were female, and were dressed up in very skimpy ranch girl clothes with a cow bell around their necks, and a cow tail 'seemingly' sowed over their tailbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with these features what drew Hinata's attention away from the female employees uniforms was that each and everyone of them had bodies so sexy a goddess would be jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at them Hinata for one of the few times in her life felt jealous of someone's looks. Hinata thought 'Maybe if I looked that voluptuous, Naruto would notice me...\" she mused, when the man from the register walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy mam, welcome to The Lon-Lon dairy Shop and Restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello sir.\" Hinata said to the large man.

Would you like some Miss Hyuga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how much will either of them cost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well our 'Kenk\u014d-Kenk\u014d Milk' is priced at 1100 yen, and our 'Kenzen'na seich\u014d Milk' goes for 600,000 yen a serving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the difference in prices Hinata asks \"Why is the 'Kenk\u014d-Kenk\u014d Milk' and 'Kenzen'na seich\u014d Milk' so differently priced if they do the same thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer to your question Miss Hyuga is that 'Kenk\u014d-Kenk\u014d Milk' is a vastly deluded version of the  'Kenzen'na seich\u014d Milk' that would take months of drinking it to get the same results as drinking two servings of  'Kenzen'na seich\u014d Milk'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to let you know Miss Hyuga right now we just had a few of our girls just received a promotion leaving us with a few job openings, and one of the benefits we give our workers is two free servings of our 'Kenzen'na seich\u014d Milk' everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be aware that if you do take the job you're going to need to sign a few employment papers today; after that we can get you your two servings of 'Kenzen'na seich\u014d Milk', and get you to work right after that.\" Sheriff said before bringing out a bottle of 'Kenzen'na seich\u014d Milk' with the uniform, and employment papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this offer which choice does Hinata make?</span></div></div>",

They were close, but not close enough to Hinata who was wandering around in grass so tall that it seemed to block out the sky. Hinata did the only thing a six year old lost in a forest could do, she sat down and cried. The sobbing was partially due to being lost and alone and partially due to the giant scrapped knee she had while running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family had decided to celebrate her birthday this year by going on a small picnic in the woods around Konoha with close members of the main branch (and Neji whom her father insisted on bringing along for some reason). The party went as would be expected, the adults sat and had conversations while the children ran around and played in the many nooks and crannies around the forest. Indeed, all was going well until the kids found themselves growing bored of the usual games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play hide and seek!\" said one of them. \"In this big forest and with the people we have, it will be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, including Hinata, agreed. The only one who showed no interest in the game was Neji, who had been spending the entire party glaring at everyone from the top of a tree. This didn't seem to bother any of the children, most of them were willing to play without him, but it was Hinata who approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come play with us Brother Neji, it will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji shot an angry pair of eyes at the young girl. He had no interest in childish games, not when he could be training. But Hinata did not give the impression of leaving without a fight, so Neji agreed. \"Very well. I'll play your little game. However, you have to be 'it' Sister Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she too agreed to his terms and after counting to one hundred she began searching the forest for the other children, being sure to leave behind kunai knives every so often so that she wouldn't get lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know, Neji had been closely following her since she had finished counting. He chuckled to himself at his own skills at stealth and for his own amusement stole the kunai knives as Hinata placed them on the ground. When he was sure Hinata would get lost, he made his way back to the picnic before disposing of the knives so that no one would suspect him of being involved in Hinata's disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Hinata to find herself completely lost and when she tried to turn around to find her way back to the picnic she found that her trail of kunai knives had been cut off. Needless to say, she was terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have to press on,\" she said to comfort herself. \"They'll find me eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut minutes turned into hours, and before long darkness crept over the forest. Hinata was tired from walking so much and she was nowhere nearer from finding the exit. Back at the picnic, all of the children returned to the party after growing bored. Hinata's father took notice of his daughter's absence and questioned the children, but they did not know where she was in the forest. Angered, her father sent a search party to look for Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the forest, by a bit of misfortune Hinata wandered into a nearby cave hoping to find someone who could help her find her way back. There was no one inside the cave, no one except a few playful furry animals who startled the young heir. Hinata had managed to stumble into a bear cave and at that very moment the mother of the cubs was just returning from her hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pitch black of the cave all Hinata could see was a pair of big red eyes and a mouthful of fangs charging at her. She screamed and scrambled out of the cave, she made it only to trip on the way out and badly scrap her knee. Once outside she limped for the tall grass, hoping to hide from the 'monster' chasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is where she found herself, she attempted to stifle her cries so that the giant bear after her wouldn't hear her. But it didn't do any good, the bear could find her easily by the smell of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got closer and closer. Hinata felt the hot tears drip down her face. She had never been so terrified in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hinata!\" called out the voice again, it too was closer but not as close as the monster chasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bear poked its horrible mangy snout out of the brush and stared right at her with its cold glowing eyes. It growled a horrible bloodthirsty roar and charged right at Hinata. She didn't even have time to scream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata!\" shouted Hanabi, kicking her sister's bed. \"Wake up you're going to be late for your mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata jumped from her horrible nightmare. That's all it was, a memory from the past come back to haunt her for some reason. She breathed in and out a few times trying to compose herself, she was so shook up that she had been crying. It had been awhile indeed since she had thought back to her sixth birthday, the day she developed her terrible fear of bears. Melissophobia it was called, ever since she was rescued from that mother bear that frightening night she couldn't bare to be in the presence of one of the furry mammals no matter how friendly the animal was. Her father took her to doctors to attempt to cure her of it, but no treatment ever seemed to stick. Not that it ever seemed to get in the way of her training or daily life, her father just didn't like the fact that his heir would have such an embarrassing weakness. After the tenth attempt to cure it, however, he just gave up trying and Hinata learned to live with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HINATA!\" Hanabi shouted again, Hinata had been spacing out the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is it, sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a mission with your team today, remember!? You need to get going or you'll be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...Um...What was it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi sighed. \"Can't you remember anything? Your team's supposed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Probably to do odd-jobs for them and the like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clan of ninjas Hanabi was referring to were an odd bunch. They were perhaps one of the last group of nomadic ninjas left in the world, they traveled the land staying in no country for too long and retaining a neutral position in most types of conflict between the bigger ninja nations. It was because of their neutral position that they were usually welcomed into most ninja countries with no questions asked. A neutral party traveling between various nations was seen as a good thing as the clan traded with each country as they went along, sometimes they even had news to share all of which were highly valued especially by nations such as Konoha. Aside from being a known nomadic clan, however, no one really knew much about them. Not what their techniques were, not their system of government, not even their leader's name. This was why Lady Tsunade had arranged for a personal welcome with the leader of the clan. The whole village saw this as an opportunity, and everyone was doing their best to make the clan feel welcomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's right...Thank you Hanabi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet. Father is on his way upstairs, he already very angry with you for oversleeping on such an important mission for the village. You might want to sneak out through the window before he comes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Hanabi left Hinata alone in the room. The Hyuga heiress quickly tore off her silk pajamas and threw on her usual outfit; dark blue pants, gray fuzzy coat, black fishnet shirt. She finished putting everything on just in time for her bedroom doorknob to start violently turning. She dove out the window as the door to her bedroom opened to reveal her very angry father. This was going to be a very eventful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had just managed to escape getting a lecture from her father (though she felt terrible about running away like that and was sure he'd be even more angry with her when she returned home today). She jumped from rooftop to rooftop heading for the nomadic clan's assigned spot in the forest's outside of Konoha. Lady Tsuande had offered them lodging within the village itself, but for some reason their leader preferred that his people remained in the woods, so the Hokage granted an entire clearing to them. It was by some odd coincidence that the spot she gave them was the very spot where Hinata's family had that picnic so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it has something to do with my dream I had.\" Hinata thought to herself, but quickly shrugged it off. It was just an odd nightmare she had, nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was in for a huge and frightening surprise when she arrived at the clearing to find her teammates cleaning and pampering a group of large furry animals. All the feeling in her knees suddenly gave away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-bears!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was the first on her team to take notice of her. As he turned to greet her, he failed to notice that the hose he had in his hand to wash the bears with was spraying Shino. \"Oh. Hey Hinata! We were wondering when you would show up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, what the hell are you doing!?\" Yelled Shino as he stood drenched in water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, sorry about that Shino. You could probably use the bath anyway with all those bugs crawling on you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny...The one who comes from a family of smelly dog keepers is talking to me about proper hygiene!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Why you...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went at each other from there while Hinata still stood frozen in fear at the sight of the three bears who were puzzled as to why their bathers suddenly started fighting with each other. Shino and Kiba didn't stop until a strange man separated the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out, both of you. Your sensei placed her trust in me to make sure you didn't kill each other, and I aim to keep that promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked like no one Hinata had ever seen before. He was tall and muscular and wore little to no clothing, save for a pair of leather pants covered with feathers that traveled up the sides of the legs. His torso and arms were covered in beads, multicolored feathers, and bands. His black hair was long and done up in a ponytail with another single large golden feather tying it together. With both boys in hand by their collars, the man finally took notice of Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who might you be little miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hinata was still on her knees unable to move at the sight of the bears. They seemed to be responding to this large man and followed him closely as he approached Hinata to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...t-the...b-bears...,\" was all she managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bears?\" said the man. \"Oh, you needn't worry about them. They're all very well behaved and won't harm anyone unless you give them reason to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was beginning to worry when Hinata's reaction didn't change. Even her teammates were starting to take notice to her unusual behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata? You okay?\" asked Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I-I...d-don't like...b-bears...\" she said, instinctively rubbing the spot on her knee where she tripped and fell so many years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's other things that need to be accomplished elsewhere if you'd feel more comfortable away from the bears. Come on now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man dropped Shino and Kiba like a sack of potatoes and gently picked up Hinata before whispering something to the bears following him. After that, he told Shino and Kiba to get back to giving the bears a bath and carried Hinata away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, after she recovered from the initial shock, Hinata discovered that the man's name was Gunther. He was the leader of the clan of nomadic ninjas, if they could even be called ninjas. Unlike the ninjas of other villages, they carried no kunai knives nor did they even wear headbands. They were also 'more closer to the Earth' as Lady Tsunade put it, growing crops to feed themselves and communicating with the nature around them. This explained why they had several bears traveling with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gold-feather clan, as they like to be called, use the bears as protectors of sorts,\" explained Lady Tsunade to Hinata and her team. \"They believe the bears to contain spirits of their ancestors and hold them as sacred animals. In return, the bears provide the clan with gifts of honey and their steadfast protection from enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they're much like the Nara clan and their affinity with deer.\" said Shino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. Which is why you are all are to show the utmost respect around the bears. No fainting,\" she added, her eyes trailing to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave a yelp of surprise and bowed in apology. \"I-I apologize, Lady T-Tsunade. I can't h-help myself. I have a t-terrible fear of bears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, then you'd best take the jobs that do not involve interacting with them as Gunther suggested. We don't want to give our guests the wrong impression about us, so I want you all on your best behaviors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" all three said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Hinata's day went on with little trouble. She did her best to steer clear of contact with the bears which was easy enough considering most of them spent time around the woods far outside the ninja's camp. She was given jobs such as kitchen work and herb gathering, while Kiba and Shino focused on any jobs concerning the bears. The gold-feather ninjas were extremely friendly the entire time, and appreciated all the help that the team gave them no matter how trivial the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the sun was setting and it was time to leave. The ninjas gave the team their thanks and everyone was looking forward to their jobs tomorrow. But just as Hinata headed down the road back to the mansion, she was approached by...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata slowly headed down the path as dusk overcame the surrounding woods. She turned around just for a brief second, she could have sworn she heard something behind her. Activating her Byakugan, she scanned the area behind her. There was no one around for several hundred yards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" said a booming voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata screamed and fell flat on her butt. The person who had been behind her towered over her. It was Gunther! He apologetically reached his hand down to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" he said, hoisting Hinata to her feet. \"I didn't mean to scare you like that, Miss Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's no trouble...\" Hinata replied sheepishly, recalling what Lady Tsunade said about maintaining the village's image. \"I-I just thought y-you were one of the bears...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther frowned. \"You have nothing to fear of them. Lady Tsunade spoke to you all already, didn't she? The bears are our clan's guardians. They will only harm our enemies and even then only at our command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know...\" Hinata did her best to sound reassured, but Gunther was able to see right through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have such a fear of bears, if you don't mind me being so straight forward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a l-long story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have time if you do. Come, let's head to my tent. I'll fix up some nice tea and we can have a chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hinata could even decline or oblige, Gunther grabbed her around the waist and threw her over his shoulders next to a few dead animals that he had been hunting. She didn't make much of a fuss as she thought it would be rude considering the leader of the clan wished to have tea with her. Nevertheless, she wasn't exactly looking forward to this tea party. The two made their way back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camp was much more quieter at night than it was during the day. Most of the ninjas were gathered in their own tents, cooking whatever they had hunted during the day for their supper. Gunther and Hinata only saw a few faces as they headed for Gunther's tent which was on a large cliff that overlooked much of the Konoha forest. Gunther's tent was much larger and decorative than the other tents Hinata had seen around the camp, and impossibly so the inside of it appeared to be even bigger than the outside let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was gently set down on a pile of feather pillows in the center of the tent surrounding a warm glowing fire. Gunther took off his own caught animals and turned for another section of tent behind a wall of beads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just set these down and prepare the tea. Feel free to look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hinata was already enraptured by the many sights and smells of the tent. The air was full of incense and smoke, which gave an otherworldly feeling to Gunther's home. Hanging from the ceiling by bits of string were various stuffed birds and animals, some of which Hinata had never seen before. A squirrel with two heads. A bird that appeared to be part horse. But most imposing of all the decorations was the giant stuffed bear with golden fur that shone like the sun. It had to be standing in over fifteen feet in length on its hind legs and was almost touching the top of the tent. Hinata shivered at the thought of encountering such an animal while it was living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther returned with two cups of steaming liquids. \"Drink this, it'll warm you right up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata bowed as she took the warm cup and carefully drank the contents. It tasted sweet yet spicy. Like a creamy mixture of honey and cinnamon. Gunther took a sip of his own cup and gave a refreshed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an ancient recipe passed down by our clan. We normally exchange these cups only when meeting with important visitors or guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, thank you. I'm h-honored.\" said Hinata, as her eyes trailed yet again to the stuffed bear behind Gunther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther turned his head. \"Ah, you're looking at our patriarch. The founder of our clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clan f-founder was a bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. Yes and no,\" Gunther reached into his waist pouch and pulled out a long pipe. \"Our clan has always had a close affinity with animals, particularly bears. Legends say that our ancestors were so close to the bears that they weren't human at all, That they were able to change between human form and bear form at will. But such arts are lost to time, that bear you see behind me is said to be the man that united our people together with the bears permanently, and he was the last member of our clan to be able to shift forms like in the legends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blew a ring of smoke out of his pipe and smiled. \"Now then, why are you so afraid of bears? I know people fear them in the wild, but I have never meant someone so paralyzed in fear by the sight of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hinata told him her tale of her youth. How her own clan celebrated her birthday and how it quickly turned into chaos when she disappeared. She was sure to go into great detail concerning the bear that attacked her. All the time, Gunther listened intently and when she finally finished he sat back and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are aware,\" he spoke. \"That that bear was only trying to protect it's young? That it was probably more afraid of you than you were on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata found that hard to believe, the thought of the red eyes and fangs still terrified her to this day. \"I-I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther snorted black smoke out of his nose. \"Yet you still retain an irrational fear of bears. Hmm, what if I were to say there may be a cure to your aliment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh n-no...Many of o-our village's greatest d-doctors have attempted finding a c-cure. Nothing worked though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cure would be very unlike any other cure you've tried so far. In fact, it is a trial that all of our young members entering adulthood must go through in order to earn their place in the hunt. But...\" There was a hanging tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...?\" asked Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther suddenly had a very serious look on his face. \"Now pay attention Miss Hinata. What I am about to tell you is one of our clan's most ancient jutsu's. It is a part of our culture and is never shared with outsiders, even the very act of telling you of its existence is punishable by exile from the clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then why mention it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a surprised look on Gunther's face, like he hadn't thought about why he did it. \"Well...Because you are of the Hyuga clan and are well renowned in the village of Konoha. Helping you would be a boost to my clan's reputation in your village. And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trailed off. A warm look suddenly glowed in his eyes. \"And your need sounds sincere and dire. As a man, I cannot look away from your plight. Not while I have the power to cure it potentially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was somewhat shocked by his answer. She felt honored, no one had ever really given her the amount of respect like Gunther just (except for Naruto). She nodded and calmly said. \"W-Well, after hearing your cause for such reasons, I must at least hear your proposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. \"Then I will not stretch the truth about the process. Simply put, I will turn you into a bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stood quiet for a full thirty seconds before answering. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using the ancient jutsu passed down by our patriarch, you will slowly turn into a bear and learn to live as one. The actual transformation takes roughly a week, during which you will come to the camp normally. Once you've changed, I will tell your superiors that you're helping me with a specific task and you'll live like a bear for two full weeks. After which, the spell will wear off and you'll slowly turn back to normal over the course of a week. In other words, the entire process will take a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was speechless, dumbfounded was a good word to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, this is a rite we put our young through. They are turned into bears and sent out to live on their own in the wild. There they commune with other bears and learn to become a part of the family. It is something I hope you will learn to do, and by doing so you will be cured of your fear of bears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no rational way to describe what was going on in Hinata's head. She had lived most of her life in fear of bears, but to actually BECOME one!? It seemed absurd...yet...it also felt so crazy that it would have to work. She sat there with her mouth open, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther sensed her confusion. \"I understand such a bizarre offer would make it hard to give an answer immediately. So I will await your response by the end of the day tomorrow. You will have twenty four hours to think it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata still didn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off you go then. Stay safe.\" Gunther picked her up again and carried her outside and all the way to her home. He left her on the doorstep and after she was scolded by her father for being both late to go to her mission and late to return home she went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Hinata decided...</span></div></div>",

It didn't seem possible. Sure, there had been jutsu that transformed people into other animals, but they worked vastly differently then what Gunther was suggesting. The user of the jutsu's true form would not be altered but merely replaced by another. This jutsu had to be more like a shape-shifting spell, if Hinata used it her true form <i>would be</i> that of a bear's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no going back for a month. She'd be stuck in the form of the thing she feared the most for four whole weeks. It seemed insane. What could that accomplish that dozens of therapy sessions and medicines couldn't? But then why did it seem so plausible, like Hinata needed to do it? Why did the thought of it both excite her and terrify her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata awoke groggily the next day, this time she was sure to be on time when going to the camp for she woke up at the crack of dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sloppily put on her clothes and headed downstairs for some breakfast, her mind still turned to Gunther's offer. This wasn't going to be an easy decision. On the way down, she looked around at her life. Gunther said that the first week the changes would slowly begin, what sort of changes would they be exactly? Would her family notice them? Would her teammates?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about when she left for the woods for half a month? Her family would probably buy any excuse Gunther gave them, in fact they might even be proud of her for being chosen for such a specific assignment from an honored guest of Konoha. She imagined the look on her father's face when she told him that she not only completed the 'assignment' given to her by the head ninja of the gold-feather clan but also conquered her foolish fear of bears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was assuming that this idea would even work. It was one thing to live as the thing you feared the most, but it was quite another to face it. Then there was the fear of the jutsu not working. What if because Hinata was an outsider something went wrong? What if she somehow got stuck as a bear for the rest of her life? This could probably be the biggest risk she'd ever take in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't stop thinking about it, not even as she walked outside and headed for the ninja camp. Her head was so far in the clouds that she didn't even see Naruto running around backwards on his hands heading straight for her. They collided right into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph,\" grunted Naruto as he landed on top of Hinata. \"Oh, sorry about that Hinata. I didn't even see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's face turned completely red, suddenly her own problem with deciding on what to do didn't seem to be the biggest thing on her mind. Naruto's face was literally inches away from her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you up at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks...W-what were y-you doing h-here, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training! I need to get stronger so I asked Rock Lee if he knew any good training exercises. He told me that running around Konoha on my hands backwards is sure to make me faster and stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy.\" said Hinata, a little more bluntly than was usual for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I thought it would be too but...\" Naruto flexed. \"I'm starting to feel stronger already, and it builds endurance like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and put his hands behind his head. \"I guess no matter how stupid or insane something seems, you'll never know if it will work or not unless you try it. If you're not willing to make the risk then you can't ever go forward, right? You can sit around at home and hope things will get better for you or you can take the risks and just maybe change things for yourself for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause after that. Naruto laughed again. \"I guess I sound pretty goofy then, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, not at all. It w-was quite profound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Huh. Anyway, I got to get back to training before the sun rises and we go on another mission. Where are you headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-The nomadic ninja camp. My t-team was assigned to help them there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well good luck. Maybe we should hang out sometime later, I could use the break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...Maybe later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the blonde did another handstand and went right back to running. Hinata watched him until he disappeared and smiled to herself. Naruto was right, this was a chance to improve herself and if she didn't take it she'd regret it forever. The clan was only in the village for a month. She had to do this now or there'd never be another chance like it. Her mind had been made up and she walked confidently to the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of work went by no differently then the previous day. Though Naruto's little speech inspired her, Hinata couldn't get over her fear of the bears though she did try to help Shino and Kiba once. They were supposed to help with the birth of a new bear, but one of the larger started to approach Hinata and she froze up again. Gunther had came to her rescue and she spent the rest of the day chopping firewood and helping with the cooking. Still, she was determined to go through with Gunther's idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun finally set and her teammates said their goodbyes, she headed straight for Gunther's tent. Inside, the giant man was waiting for her underneath the stuffed patriarch. There was a large cauldron bubbling over the fire, adding a new smell to the scent of incense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing you here,\" said Gunther. \"I am to assume that you've made up your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes.\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clenched her fists together and bit down hard, trying to build up as much courage as she could. At last she spoke, without stuttering and will a clear confident voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to do it. Make me into a bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther smiled warmly. \"I knew you'd be brave enough to go through with it. There's a spirit inside of you not much different than others from my clan. You have a strong thirst to proof yourself Hinata, and that will always make you stronger. Now, we can begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motioned to the giant cauldron in front of him, Hinata leaned over and peered inside. It contained a bubbling golden liquid. The strangest thing was that when Hinata stared long enough into the cauldron, she could have almost sworn something bear-shaped was forming with the bubbles. Gunther presented her with a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this and dip it into the cauldron. Once you have a healthy amount of the contents in the cup, you must drink the entire thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata took the cup. This was it, her last chance to turn back. She quickly found her resolve bubbling like the liquid in the cauldron, Gunther saw the troubled look on her face and smiled warmly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having second thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...Just nervous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to be. The drink is as sweet as honey. You'll be back to normal before you know it, and all for the better. Now drink up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and dipped the cup into the cauldron. The golden liquid slowly worked it's way into the cup like sap. After what felt like an eternity the cup was finally filled almost all the way up to the top. Gunther raised his own cup of what appeared to be tea as if to give a toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To curing you of your fears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata closed her eyes and swallowed. She opened them in surprise. The liquid DID taste sweet, it was very sugary and Hinata found herself enjoying the taste. When the last of it trickled down into her stomach Hinata looked intently at Gunther. She didn't feel any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What happens now?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you just go home and rest. You'll feel no different than you normally will. The changes will probably have already begun first thing in the morning of the next day, so try not to wake up surprised. But the changes won't be so noticeable that we will have to pull you from your duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, t-thanks again.\" bowed Hinata as she turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" added Gunther. \"The average size of a female bear your age is about nine to ten feet, the bears we raise are very large. You may want to look into a temporarily larger wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and left for home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been the first night in awhile since Hinata had slept so soundly. Whatever was in the cauldron had really filled her up and made her really tired, the moment she got home she went straight to bed and passed out instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Hinata lazily stretched and sat up, completely forgetting about what happened yesterday. She casually eyed her alarm clock. Seven o'clock. Odd, she had came in last night at seven o'clock, but she didn't remember much after that. Did she really fall asleep for twelve hours? And why did she feel so much more heavier for some reason? It was like there was a heavy weight in her stomach. She looked down and yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-wha-what happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes, which she had fallen asleep in last night, were no longer a perfect fit on her. Her stomach was now protruding out from under her jacket by several inches like a giant potbelly. It jiggled when Hinata poked it, pure fat. To Hinata's horror, it wasn't just her belly that had grown. Everywhere felt a little bigger; her butt, her breasts, her arms, her thighs, everything! Standing up, Hinata tried to get a better look at herself only to discover her view of her room seemed a little bit higher than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes looked a little small on her now, like she had a miniature growth spurt overnight. Looking over to her door frame (which had her height marked on it from year to year) she discovered that she was over three inches taller since her last measurement, making her effectively five feet tall. What had happened!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You may want to look into a temporarily larger wardrobe.</i> Gunther's advice from last night replayed in Hinata's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that what he meant by looking into bigger clothes? There was only one way for her to find out, head to the ninja camp and ask him. Hinata waddled over to the door. Unfortunately these were the largest clothes she had right now, no other outfit she had would be any different. She would just have to endure it during her duties until the day was over and go quickly buy a new outfit that would fit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one step out the door before doubling over in pain. Her stomach was growling fiercely, she felt famished! But if she stopped to eat breakfast, she'd be late for her job at the ninja camp. Her stomach rumbled again, there was no winning this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I-I suppose a little s-snack won't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully everyone who was supposed to be up at this hour in her house were no where to be seen in the kitchen. Hinata opened the fridge and immediately started to chow down. It wasn't until a half an hour later did she finally stop eating and her giant belly had grown even bigger. But it took that much food just to sate the unending hunger in the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling embarrassed, she headed straight for the ninja camp, not stopping for anything. Who knows what someone would say if they saw her like this? She felt like she was carrying a bowling ball for a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually reached the ninja camp to discover that Gunther was at the entrance waiting for her, much to her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good,\" he said, waving hello to Hinata as she approached. \"I see that the changes are already going along smoothly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you mean this was s-supposed to happen?\" asked Hinata, pointing at her large muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" he stood next to her and measured his height with his hand. \"Bears are much larger mammals then we are, you have a lot of growing you need to do over the course of the next week. I did mention that you should find a larger wardrobe, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes! But I d-didn't think this is what you meant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't make such a fuss. Your changes are coming along smoothly, have you eaten yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed. \"Yes, I...a-ate all the food in our fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther laughed. \"Sounds about right, your body needs the food to grow. You'll be eating much more each day until the changes are complete. Judging by the outfit you're wearing, I'd say you don't have any larger clothes, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured as much. Not to worry, I'll give you some time after lunch to run a few 'errands' in the village. You can spend the extra time you'll have to get more fitting clothes. I expect by then you'll have grown even more, so be sure to pick the largest outfits you can find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all happening too fast, Hinata's head was spinning. She knew she was going to be in for a headache, but this was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you'll be working with someone else today. I believe you two know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking with someone while blowing up like a balloon wasn't Hinata's idea of a good time. \"W-who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

I got to speak with him and he mentioned you, naturally I thought he would be a good companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...Naruto will be working with me...\" she trailed off, more to herself than Gunther. She could feel her heart beat go faster and faster, spending time alone with Naruto would be wonderful, but what if he was off put by her sudden changes? Hinata was already feeling embarrassed, thinking of him pointing out how big she had gotten. Gunther  had noticed her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I'm f-fine...Just a little hungry maybe.\" Hinata said half-truthfully. Gunther nodded to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry, I'll make sure we feed you something.\" he said going through a bag and handing her a satchel, it gave off a sweet smell. \"For now have these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in Hinata saw some small blueberries. Instinctively she reached down and ate them. They were delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bears are mostly carnivores so you may prefer meat, but these berries should sate your hunger if it really bothers you.\" the nomad explained. \"If you ever need them just let me know, and I'll provide them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you.\" Hinata said before devouring some. Her eyes widened at how delicious it was. She decided to try just a couple more and save some for later. \"So, do you know where Naruto is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's over at the Village entrance gate. he'll have a list of the things you're supposed to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll be off Gunther. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, be safe.\" Gunther said waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later Hinata arrived at the village entrance and looked for Naruto. She didn't have to wait long as she saw him asleep next to the post. The kunoichi giggled to herself a little at how cute he looked. She wanted to just watch him or awhile, but decided it would be best to awaken him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked him gently with one finger, and he instantly took a pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" he cried. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naruto are you alright?\" Hinata asked fearfully. She reached out to him and noticed that her nails had grown sharp, not unlike Kiba's. She gasped inaudibly when she saw a spot of blood on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...A bug must've bit me or something after I fell asleep.\" he said before looking at Hinata oddly. \"Hey Hinata you look different...You did something with your hair right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked at her hair and it was the same as before. Naruto had registered that she looked different, but not why. She was somewhat relieved and a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Something like that.\" Hinata replied before eating a blueberry. \"B-but I'm here to help with the mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, they sent you to help me.\" Naruto said smiling, \"Honestly I'm glad they didn't tell anyone like Kiba or Shino...They'd be no fun at all. Anyway lets go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure.\" Hinata said happily, she was glad that Naruto seemed happy to have her around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk back to the village could not have been more awkward for Hinata. All the while during the journey, people were staring at her and her pudgy stomach sticking out of her jacket. Some of the villagers who recognized Hinata pointed and said things like \"Isn't that the Hyuga heir?\" or \"My word, what did that girl eat?\" This embarrassed Hinata to no end, she blushed the whole way and snacked on some blueberries in a vain attempt to block out the stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least having Naruto around with her lightened the mood somewhat. While Hinata never said one word the entire walk, Naruto made up for her silence by talking nonstop. He'd tell her all sorts of things: what sort of training he was going to do later, how his last mission went, and even what he was planning on eating later. Hinata couldn't help but laugh a few times. So long as Naruto was there to make things easier for her, perhaps this whole process wouldn't be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they at last arrived in the market district of the village, Naruto got more serious again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said. \"What's the first thing we need to do on the list Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had handed Hinata the list for safekeeping, or rather Hinata insisted on carrying the list so that nothing would happen to it. It could have been a bit too overcautious, but with Naruto it was wise to not take chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...\" said Hinata, trying not to get blueberry juice on the paper. \"It says t-the first thing on the list is...to c-collect the listed foods for the bears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata caught herself drooling after reading the first few items of food. Roasted smoked pork. Fresh salmon and tuna. Even fruits and berries of all kinds. This was going to be slightly more challenging to do than Hinata had initially hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" smirked Naruto. \"Where do we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata picked something less tempting to start with, the fruits and vegetables, having already a sack full of blueberries handy- albeit it was rapidly being depleted - Hinata could tide herself over when picking out most of the foods. Her stomach was growling something fierce, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gathered up the bags, he demanded that he carry most of it claiming it would be good training. He grinned. \"What next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list of food had them running all over the village. From the butcher to the fish vendor, Naruto and Hinata both were getting well acquainted with the merchants. And the food kept piling up into one big mountain in Naruto's arms, he was struggling to keep it all from falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata on the other hand was struggling with her own internal battles. She was already completely out of blueberries when they finished half of their itinerary and was feeling famished again, just like she did this morning when she cleaned out her kitchen. It was taking every ounce of willpower and mental strength to not dive on the glorious mountain of delicious food Naruto was carrying and chow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally finished, Naruto grunting and groaning under the weight of all the food, Hinata sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shall we head back now, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took slow and heavy steps forward and managed to spit out. \"S-sure...N-no problem...I-I can do this...H-how long is it u-until the camp again, Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A g-good mile at least, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Naruto gave a giant groan and the entire mountain of food started to shiver violently. Hinata could sense that Naruto was quickly losing his edge over holding the entire thing up. Reacting quickly, she came to his aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please, Naruto let me help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just one hand, she grabbed the bottom of the pile were Naruto was holding it. It felt odd. For some reason, even though she knew she was putting pressure on it to lift it up, she felt like she wasn't holding anything at all. She tried lifting up a little harder and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Hey! What the heck's happening, Hinata!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't even sure if she could answer that herself. From her point of view, it looked like she had lift not only the entire mountain of food but Naruto as well several feet into the air with one arm. That had to be ridiculous though, she could never be that strong. But there she was, holding up the pile of treats like it was a cardboard box with Naruto's feet dangling around underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finally let go and landed flat on his butt. His eyes widened as he looked up at Hinata. \"Wow! I mean...Wow! I had no idea you were <i>that</i> strong Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I had no idea e-either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be okay carrying it back like that? I mean, I did offer to carry it all myself but it looks like you don't even need me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, this isn't that heavy,\" she replied as she used her other hand to get a better grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're sure...\" he dusted himself off. \"Shall we head back to the camp then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they both made their way as quickly as they could back to the nomad's camp. After all those chores, it was already lunchtime and Naruto was as hungry as Hinata at this point. It didn't help that Hinata was receiving even more stares carrying the food as she was. But she shrugged it off and they made it to the camp just before noon came around. To Hinata's surprise Gunther was there waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you two would arrive back here. Lunch is already being served around the campfire, why don't you come with me Hinata and we'll put the food in storage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata followed him as Naruto ran off to claim a seat by the main fire in the middle of camp. Gunther led her to what appeared to be a log cabin smoke house and told her to set the food down in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't eat any of the food, did you Hinata?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. But believe m-me, it was tempting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it was. You could have called that a little test of sorts, and you passed with flying colors. It is easy as a bear to lose yourself to the nature of the beast. You must keep a clear mind, a focused one. You are human first, only in bear form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um. Mr.Gunther...H-How did I exactly carry that huge pile of food here? It f-felt like nothing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"That's merely your new found energy being used to its potential. You'll find yourself growing even stronger as the days go by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led Hinata out of the hut and slammed the door shut. \"Now that that's all done, let's go get something to eat. You'll no doubt want to replenish that lost energy and you'll be heading back to the village again afterwards.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lunch went on without any truly interesting happening. Like yesterday, all of the camp gathered in front of the grand campfire at the center of the settlement. Everyone from the gold-feather clan who saw Hinata didn't seem all that surprised by her appearance, Gunther must have had a discussion with them beforehand. Kiba and Shino, who hadn't seen Hinata all day, on the other hand responded with a general shock that would be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, is that you!? What in the world happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was afraid that this would have happened, unfortunately Naruto handled it with his usual grace. \"What do you guys mean? Her new hairstyle doesn't look that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- Are you dense Naruto!? Can't you see how swollen she looks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Hinata long and hard, making the poor girl blush and feel even more uncomfortable. \"Hmm...Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Kiba even more agitated. \"What do you mean, yes!? Are you blind as well as stupid Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say dogbreath!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir argument began to quickly escalate after that. Hinata tried her best to think of something that would cease the fighting between the two, but her mind was going blank. Thankfully, Gunther saw the rising conflict and quickly stepped in, having prepared a story beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children, stop this bickering at once or I'll have you all thrown out of the camp. Hinata accidentally ate one of the poisonous berries from the fauna around here. It isn't deadly but causing swelling, which is why she looks like this. You can stop your worrying, we've already given medicine for it. Right, Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave Gunther a look a relief and nodded. \"Y-Yes, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that outburst, things settled down until lunch ended. Kiba and Shino went back to gathering firewood from within the forest while Naruto and Hinata looked over the list Gunther gave them to find out what they had to accomplish next (but not before Hinata personally thanked Gunther in private for covering for her). The next item up was to gather weapon supplies, which confused the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't these guys peaceful?\" asked Naruto. \"I mean, it's no business of ours, but what could they want with this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shrugged, she didn't know the answer either. It was unusual for Konoha to vendor off weapons to people from outside the village excluding underground black market dealings. Gunther probably had his reasons to ask for such things and it wouldn't be any trouble for them to get the weapons, it was just odd was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd truthfully, Hinata didn't care about what task they had to complete for Gunther now. As Gunther had pointed out during their brief talk after lunch, Hinata had grown even more over the course of the day. It didn't look like much but her belly was definitely sticking out further then it had been just this morning. Her clothes were all tightly wrapped around her chubby form and quite frankly it was becoming difficult to walk in them. Gunther must have sensed her discomfort and said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like those clothes are starting to dig into you. You should probably go find a larger outfit when doing the next thing on the list, don't worry about not finishing before dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, hastily they made their way back to Konoha with Naruto wondering what the rush was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh,\" explained Hinata, trying to use the excuse Gunther gave everyone. \"I-I just need to g-go get some bigger clothing. I need s-some relief from the s-swelling of the berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we can stop somewhere real quick then. We got all day after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided it might be easiest to shop for clothes before going to pick up a heavy shipment of weapons, so they headed back to the market place in search of a 'larger' clothing store. It was proving harder to find then what was initially expected, apparently there just weren't many people of a 'bigger scale' in Konoha that the village would need such a store. After searching around for almost an hour, Hinata was about to just go ask Choji where his family shopped for clothes until Naruto loudly pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata, look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pointing to a store just across the street from them. The outside looked normal enough, save for the giant billboard with a buxom and plump woman on it with big red letters reading 'Big and Beautiful'. It appeared to be a big and tall shop went for women, or as the sign read \"The shop for the big beauty in all women!\" Hinata had to blush again at the thought of entering such a store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's check it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Hinata by the hand and dragged her all the way to the inside. Sure enough, all the outfits within the store were for plus sized women. There were outfits of all different styles, just like normal clothing only they were much bigger and baggier looking. It was unlike anything Hinata had ever seen before. Thankfully, no one was inside that would see her save for a large brunette woman putting new clothing on the racks. She must have been an employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are you waiting for?\" smirked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Hinata decided on...</span></div></div>",

It was a fishnet jacket over a low cut black blouse that fit her expansive body well. With it cam a pair of excessively short shorts and high heeled black sandals. Looking in the window and striking a sexy pose Hinata faced Naruto. \"What do you think? Does it suit me Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde had a surprised expression. He had never seen Hinata act in such a way, but the Hyuga heiress was feeling different. PArt of her wondered if it was part of her changing, but she decided to go with the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh? Well yeah it does look kinda nice.\" Naruto replied. Somehow Hinata decided to draw closer and grab his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You think so? I was worried you wouldn't like it.\" Hinata said happily, but she said it in a low whisper that seemed to make Naruto flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hinata? What're you doing?!\" Naruto asked backing away. \"You're acting odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it feels right she said before she kissed Naruto full on the lips. She then moved one hand behind his back and met no resistance. She had no idea what was going on, but she was enjoying it so much she didn't notice her bear tail grow thorough her clothes or her ears move atop her skull and become the same as a bear's. A minute passed before Naruto and her separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what got into you Hinata?\" Naruto asked, caught between shock and enjoyment. It wasn't his first kiss, but it was definitely his most enjoyed one. \"You're usually so shy and reserved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats because I like you Naruto. I just didn't know how to say it.\" she said before pulling him into a tight embrace. Naruto was only lucky that it didn't hurt him with all of her newfound might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?! And when did you put on those fake ear accessories.\" he asked when he wriggled loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you over some ramen, my treat.\" Hinata replied paying for her new clothes. \"I need to get some solid food and I know you enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramen? Well I guess it's fine by me.\" Naruto said, \"But no more lovey stuff, not for now ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Hinata replied grabbing him and running off. Whatever had caused her to change she was glad that she at least confessed her feelings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She ran off into the sunset, which for some reason had a giant smiling face on it. Hinata looked and saw rivers of golden honey flowing by her and mountains of food, much like what she and Naruto had been carrying earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrooling, she jumped face first into the pile of tasty goodness with Naruto still holding onto her. She ate mouthful after mouthful of delicious food. As she did, she felt herself swelling to ridiculous proportions but also felt herself not caring in the slightest. She just kept eating and eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hinata!</i>\" called Naruto, his voice sounded misty and far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata!\" yelled Naruto, banging on the door of the changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sat up with a jolt (which was hard to do considering her current girth). She must have fallen asleep while trying on clothes, even though the dream looked and felt so real. To her embarrassment, she still had the revealing outfit she had been eyeing lying rumpled up on the bench with its hanger still on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely not...\" she thought to herself, as she stepped outside patting her head to make sure there were no 'bear ears' that had grown in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, Naruto...I-I don't mean t-to be difficult b-but can I get another o-outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he didn't seem to mind. But it didn't help that it still made Hinata feel like a typical girl being difficult with clothing. Moving as quickly as she could, having already wasted who knows how much time taking a nap in the changing rooms, Hinata grabbed a few modest looking outfits that seemed to be in her new size. She didn't want to waste more time trying them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe partially threw them at the cashier, who was the big looking woman seen wandering around the store earlier. The woman gave her an odd look but quietly rung up all the clothing and put them in a bag. Secretly, Hinata was completely unaware that the woman had sneaked in the very revealing-looking outfit Hinata had been looking at in the changing room into the bag with the other clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking the cashier, Hinata grabbed the bag and Naruto by the wrist determined to leave the store as quickly as possible. Once they were a good distance away from the shop with Naruto confused as to what was going on, Hinata said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, I just felt really u-uncomfortable there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, well okay. You shop really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. The memory of her daydream came to mind, making her entire head completely red. Naruto grinned warmly, completely unaware of what the shy girl was thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you...Want to change into your new clothes?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata slowly began to realize that her tight clothing was beginning to tear in some places. She was in such a hurry to leave the store that she completely forgot why she had even bothered to go there in the first place. In fact, she was sure she felt a few stitches rip right above the back of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slow nod, Naruto led her to the nearest restroom on the streets of Konoha. Once inside, she ripped off her much too small clothing just in time. Every breath she made was straining the material of her old clothes to the point of bursting. She had to give a sigh of relief when she stood in her underwear in the bathroom stall, her body fat finally freed from its tight prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beyond strange to look down at herself and see a giant stomach where there had been a trim flat belly not a day before. But it was even more strange when she reached into the bag and pulled out the outfit she was sure she left behind in the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did this get here!?\" she cried out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to think though. An hour had been spent finding her clothing and it would probably take another three to complete the task of gathering the weapons requested by Gunther. If they were going to get back before nightfall, she couldn't afford to waste any time at all. With a sigh, she began putting on the low cut blouse and fishnet shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emerged from the bathroom, dreading the reaction Naruto was going to give her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not bad!\" he said with a smile. Hinata wasn't sure if he was serious or just being polite though so she changed the subject with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We should get going, N-Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the thick of a crowd of people, a person wrapped in a black cloak watched them speed off for the weapon merchants. He was covered up so that no one could see any part of his face save his mouth which had a twisted smile on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the target, huh?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed and the two genin managed to arrive back at the golden feather camp. They had had a long day of doing chores for their clients, but at last it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally found a place to rest, Hinata had smelled something in the air. The scent was nice and smoky, it was more than likely some kind of roasted fish. Almost possessed by the fragrance she began to walk off, surprising Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Hinata? Where're you going?\" he asked. It took her a second to register that her crush had asked her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well I smelled some fish cooking and I wanted to see where it came from.\" she confessed, \"I'm starting to get hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Naruto said, \"Checking out where the smell is coming from is a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks.\" Hinata said blushing. The heavier kunoichi and her blonde companion went to the other side of the camp where they saw Kiba and Shino taking a break. They were sitting on logs near a small campfire. The fish was cooking there, making Hinata lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kiba, Shino. What're you guys doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're resting.\" Kiba said laying back. \"We've been at work all day. We just now finished cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sounds like you were working hard too. Me and Hinata had to do a bunch of chores too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you?\" Kiba asked to Hinata before getting a surprised expression. \"H-hinata, you changed your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...I had to buy new ones to keep my old ones from ripping.\" she said blushing. \"You don't mind do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no not at all. It looks great.\" Kiba said, his eyes on the fishnet skirt and low cut top He could see her developing cleavage so well, and if he focused he could see through her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!!\" Kiba shouted, he looked and saw that shino hit him. Apparently he noticed his teammate's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Shino why did you smack Kiba?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a deadly bug on his head. Incredibly poisonous.\" Shino answered giving Kiba a knowing glare. The wild man got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Hinata said before her stomach grumbled. She then blushed. \"I guess I'm a little hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here. I could use a bite.\" Kiba said. \"I'll go find Gunther.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. hurry up about it!\" Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour though Kiba had not yet returned, and Gunther had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey everyone. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're good. We wanted to know if we could eat yet though.\" Naruto said a bit irritated. \"Did Kiba get you?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba? No he didn't.\" Gunther said, now growing thoughtful. \"I hope he didn't wander off. He may know the area, but some of our bears laid claim to some territory. He could be in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better look for him then.\" Shino said. \"Knowing him he may have done just that out of carelessness. I suggest we split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the Genin split up to find Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata went off on her own and began to search with her byakugan despite her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata froze in terror, for Kiba was currently asleep on the back of a very large bear which was staring right at Hinata. Maybe it was just its overwhelming size, but Hinata felt like she was six years old again staring down the face of the angry mother bear. She shivered as it approached her, so close that it started sniffing her face. It's head had to be the size of her entire torso, even blown up like it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned from on top of the bear. It seemed to sense him stirring and leaned over in a slight bow so Kiba's feet could touch the ground. The dog ninja rubbed his eyes as he touched down, slowly stumbling around as if he had just woken up from being knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" he mumbled to the bear, it seemed to roar back in response and turned to leave back down the path from where it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata waited until she was sure the bear had vanished into the shadows before going over to comfort Kiba. He seemed somewhat startled when she grabbed him by the shoulder, as if he hadn't even noticed she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kiba, where have you been? Are you a-alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata? Ugh, my head. Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata explained how he had simply vanished after he went to go get Gunther and the rest of the group was worried when Gunther mentioned not seeing him. She finished up with saying that she only found him just moments ago being carried by the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I honestly don't remember anything,\" he said, still rubbing his head. \"I know after I left the campfire I went down the path to Gunther's tent then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced as if there was a sudden pain. \"...Just waking up in the mass of fur, which I guess was the Shinpo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shinpo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's the head bear that oversees all the other bears that guard the clan. Gunther introduced me and Shino to him when we had to bath the bears. He's like their commander, didn't even let us near him. Only Gunther could go up to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen why did Shinpo go up to Hinata and sniff her like that? Was it because of her transformation? Did he sense what was happening to her or did he somehow know because Gunther spoke with him. Whatever the reason, Hinata shuddered again. This Shinpo bear was very intimidating indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My head is killing me,\" Kiba said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on t-then,\" replied Hinata. \"Let's go find the others, G-Gunther will know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two of them headed back the way Hinata came. The others were sure to be back at the campsite now to report their findings and Gunther was sure to want to hear what had happened to Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-It was an honest mistake my lady! Please! Have mercy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl dressed in fancy attire and with hair done up in pigtails tapped her foot angrily at the groveling man before her feet. She had the air of nobility in her presence and a lasting sense of self entitlement as was clear in the manner of which she addressed the begging man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An honest mistake? An HONEST mistake!? How stupid are you, you grubbing fatso!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe folded her arms and looked down at the man. He was dressed in rugged clothing stretched tightly around his big belly with a rifle stripped across his back. His black beard covered most of his face and was touching the floor he was kneeling so low. The girl gave a look as if he had personally insulted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you realize how much time you've wasted because of your stupidity? How anyone could mistake the target for that...boy...is just- Did you even pay attention to word I was saying when I asked you to do this assignment!? Are you incapable of hearing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No ma'am! I can hear perfectly clear! You said to grab the one that looked the most feral and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated as the the girl glared at him. \"And-And that boy indeed looked feral. I should have known he was a part of the Inuzuka clan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl spat in disgust and stamped her feet slightly, as if having a tantrum. After a few moments she calmed herself down and lowered her right hand into the man's face. Her finger had a massive diamond ring on it bearing the initials 'FM'. The man suddenly sighed in relief and began to sloppily kiss the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank ma'am! You won't regret this mercy, I swear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd best hope not. Bring me my pet before I feed you to the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kiba and Hinata returned to the camp, everyone was very relieved and the search was called off. Gunther himself inspected Kiba's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you indeed have a lump on your head Kiba. But considering you don't know how it happened and are fine right now I'd say it's nothing to worry over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed. \"You probably tripped over your own clumsy feet and knocked yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes for the fight between Naruto and Kiba to die down, but thankfully they were both so hungry that once the food was brought out they stopped their fighting instantly. Everyone was enjoying themselves with helpings of cooked pork and grilled corn. But no matter how hungry everyone was, it was Hinata who ate the most out of everyone. In fact she probably ate more then Naruto, Shino, and Kiba combined. When she was finished at last (her new clothes already feeling tight her stomach slightly more bloated again) she let out a satisfying burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed as the entire camp stopped to look at her. \"E-Excuse m-me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the feast was finally over and the long day finally finished, the Konoha ninjas said their goodbyes and returned home. Hinata decided to stay behind, of course, and help clean up the campfire with Gunther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The changes appear to be coming along rather well.\" said Gunther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from being heavier since this morning, Hinata had grown several inches again putting her almost at five and a half feet tall. Thankfully, she had had the sense to pick up larger sized clothing when in the clothing store earlier so that way she'd have something to fit her. Her sharp nails also seemed to be darkening, but nothing so extreme that it was noticeable. Internally, Hinata felt very much at peace and comfortable. The fat was like an extra soft padding that provided an instant pillow when sitting down. It wasn't difficult to move at all, though that might have had something to do with her muscles growing underneath all the blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I t-think so too.\" she replied with a slight blush, poking her exposed stomach. \"What will happen tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow? Hmm. Well, that's usually when the second part of the transformation begins. Bear's aren't bald you know. So aside more weight and height, expect something a little more <i>hairier</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata paused, trying to imagine herself covered in fur. But all she could picture was herself in a giant fur coat looking ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can shave it off, don't worry. It won't affect the changes or anything. But it grows back like a weed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata bowed in thanks once again and turned for her home. What morning was going to bring to her the next day was still vividly burned into her mind, but if it was anything like it was today it wouldn't be so bad.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was hard to describe how Hinata felt the following morning. Heavy would have been a good word. When she opened her eyes she felt herself weighing down her mattress, sinking into the center like a bowling ball. Even her pajamas, which were very stretchy and had fit her comfortably enough last night, were now very much tight around her giant belly. Daring a look, Hinata turned her gaze down at her mountain of a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't exactly prepared for what she saw and let out a small gasp. Two enormous globs of flesh took up her immediate vision but beyond that if it was somehow possible her belly was even bigger than before. It took up so much of her vision that she couldn't even see her feet anymore. What was most noticeable, however, was the bits of dark brown hair growing out at the top of her stomach like moss on a rock. Hinata reached up and patted the mat of fur. It wasn't rough like normal body hair, but soft and fuzzy. Like fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially Hinata thought sitting up on her bed was going to be a challenge due to so much extra weight, but it was not the case. She was able to hoist herself up without having to grab on anything at all. The bed started to creak violently though, straining to hold up her great weight, she must have been nearing three hundred pounds at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata stood up for the first time she was not prepared for just how much taller she had grown overnight. Having once been a measly four foot eight just two days ago, Hinata now stood at an impressive height of six feet two inches. She could now see over everything in her room. It was so bizarre and yet so exciting at the same time. She felt powerful. Strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she managed to say, looking at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now looked like an adult very tall over weight woman attempting to fit into a pair of kid's clothes. It was a good thing she had picked out some outfits that were much bigger than yesterday's, else she'd have to go into camp naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging around in her bag, she picked the biggest outfit she could find. A plain blue shirt and some stretchy black pants. By some bit of luck everything fit her just perfectly. Not even her hairy belly was exposed. Hinata thought for a minute, unconsciously rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly...\" she thought out loud. \"G-Gunther did say I could shave and it wouldn't do anything to effect the growth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind made up, she waddled into the bathroom (with no one in the house seeing her of course) and found her mother's razor. She had never shaven before, but how hard could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, are you alright?\" asked Gunther, when she arrived at the camp. \"You appear to be bleeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"I-I cut myself shaving the fur on my b-belly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Ah, of course. Here, we have some medicine for minor cuts like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther retreated into his tent and briefly returned with a small vial that contained a wax-like material. When Hinata rubbed it over the cuts on her stomach, the bleeding ceased instantly and provided a sort of minty relief. She thanked him but he just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble. That antidote is a mixture of beeswax and mint, it works very well with closing up small scraps. Huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused and looked curiously at her. Hinata didn't realize until that moment that she was almost standing at eye level with Gunther and he was a man who had towered over her just a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I'd say tomorrow we'll have to separate you from Naruto before he catches on. He might not notice your changes, though I don't think you'll want your teammates seeing you like this. Just as well, I had something special planned for tomorrow for you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't know if she should smile or frown. Gunther folded his arms in a commanding sort of way. \"In the meantime, you should finish up your tasks on the list from yesterday with Naruto. He's waiting for you just outside the camp entrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing, Hinata dreadfully obeyed his wishes and headed for the start of the camp. Naruto was sure to notice something was off with her now, he wasn't that thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata! Wow! Okay, now I know you did something with your hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave off a short laugh. \"Y-Yes, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! And Kiba says I never notice anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly very glad that Naruto was her partner in this mission, for more reasons than just liking him. They talked briefly about the mission and what they were going to be doing today before consulting the list which Hinata had held on to from yesterday. The first task was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Their first job was to acquire some herbs for Gunther and his kinsmen. Both Shinobi went to a good spot to pick herbs. Hinata knew of it because of how gentle and serene the place was. She used it for when she wanted to train and had sometimes gathered the herbs. The trip wasn't particularly long so little was said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived they saw the area was as picturesque as before. Light verdant grass shone brightly, a fine blanket of dew making them glisten in the morning sun. There was also the melody of songbirds, like something from a fairytale. Hinata suddenly felt at peace here, and even Naruto who was usually hyped up seemed somewhat more restful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. This place is pretty nice.\" Naruto commented, in awe. He turned to face his plumpened friend, \"You said you come here sometimes right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do, but not as often as I like.\" the giant girl said. Even as large as she was now it still looked magnificent. \"It's like my own private place. It should have most of the herbs that we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Then let's start looking.\" Naruto said, his usual energy back in place along with a rather large grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two searched the ground all over for any sign of medicinal plant life, the whole thing was much more uncomfortable on Hinata who was still getting used to her new height and weight. Despite her changed body she managed to find some herbs, but much less than she expected. All Naruto was able to find was one single calendula and a few weeds. Together though the only had six herbs, the ursine lass knew something was up though because she noticed that there were spots where the ground was disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought there would be more herbs than this\u2026\u201d Naruto sighed, rubbing the back of his head in confusion.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI think someone else has been though here.\u201d Hinata said sniffing the air. Her sense of smell was highly sharpened though, as if it was seven times as sharp as a bloodhound\u2019s.  She noticed the fragrance of the herbs. There was the scent of aloe, speedwell, and honeysuckle. As well as a foreign scent. It was another human. Moving instinctually she followed her nose wordlessly. Her orange attired friend seemed bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata? Where\u2019re you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I noticed someone ahead with the herbs. \u201cshe explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Naruto asked looing ahead and squinting. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything, did you use your Byakugan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I actually smelled them.\u201d Hinata admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026Oh! Did you pick that skill up from Kiba?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026Y-yes.\u201d She lied. To be honest she didn\u2019t know bears could smell so well. Even so she trusted her new skill. \u201cWell anyway c-can we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Naruto said. The two went onward silently for several minutes. Soon they cam across a clearing that had a boy around their age gathering herbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin was dark and his ebon hair was spiky, reaching to his shoulders. His eyes while gentle were practically glowing yellow. He didn\u2019t seem to be from Konoha, and he had no ninja headband on. Silently he picked a few more herbs and put them into his basket, which was practically full.  He seemed not to notice them until Naruto sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs anyone here?\u201d he asked in a firm, yet curious voice. A moment later the two ninja revealed themselves. He inspected them closely, but his gaze was soft. \u201cAre you two\u2026ninja?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe sure are.\u201d Naruto said boisterously. \u201cI\u2019m Naruto Uzumaki, and this is Hinata Hyuga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry to bother you, but we were wondering who had picked all of the herbs and noticed you had some.\u201d Hinata explained. \u201cI was worried that you might be an enemy ninja.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh, is that why?\u201d the boy asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I took so much. My name is Taizen, and I\u2019m just a wanderer passing through. I\u2019ll gladly give you some herbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the stranger handed them his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake as many as you need.\u201d He told them, a faint smirk on his otherwise stoic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. But if you don\u2019t mind us asking why did you need them?\u201d Hinata asked the stranger. So far he seemed kind enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell to be honest I\u2019m running low on funds and I planned on selling them in the village\u2026Though I\u2019m a bit lost now.\u201d He admitted looking embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you want we can take you there.\u201d Naruto offered. \u201cIt\u2019s really not that far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Hinata replied. \u201cWe have chores to do though in the village anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell to repay yout kindness I\u2019ll help.\u201d Taizen said. \u201cI hope I can be of use.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll help us plenty.\" Hinata said, a bit surprised by his formal words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached Konoha and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having evenly split up the herbs, the group of now three turned and headed back down the path from where they came. With the first task done on their list already, finishing what remained before dark seemed completely possible, so both Naruto and Hinata were in a fine mood. It was Naruto, however, that chatted away most of the time with their new friend who seemed more content with silence than anything but kindly replied to each question the blond asked. No matter how foolish the question was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wear's your shirt?\" asked Naruto, noting Taizen's lack of wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finding materials to make a shirt is a waste, especially when your body is used to being in the sun all day anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make your own clothes? I didn't know you could...How do you do that?\" said Naruto, apparently he had thought clothing just grew on trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its very easy. The forest gives you everything you need if you look hard enough, well mostly everything you need. With some yarn and a frame I think you could probably manage it too in an afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough internally Hinata blushed in doubt of Naruto's capabilities behind the delicate art of knitting clothes, no matter how determined he was, she didn't mention that out loud though. What did interest her about Taizen was where he came from, but he was so laid back he didn't even seem to notice her. She tried to get an answer out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, e-excuse me Taizen. You said you g-get things from the forest, does that mean you l-live near it or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taken by surprise when he gave her his full attention, though his eyes seemed to wander beyond her as if he were looking through her or something. \"You could say that, Hinata was it? I actually live within the forest itself, among all its bounty. Very rarely do I even get to see other people from outside it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto butted in. \"Wow, I'll bet you and your family really like living off the land, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaizen turned away from both of them, a sad smile on his face. \"I have no memory of a family, unfortunately. I've been on my own in the woods since I can remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew real quiet after that, both ninjas knew they had touched on a difficult subject for their new friend despite the smile on his face. Hinata pretended to look over the instructions from Gunther while Naruto shot Taizen a sympathetic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no real approach in concerns of talking to be made in the group again until they reached the gates of Konoha. Hinata and Naruto walked forward as if nothing was unusual, but Taizen stopped in place and took in a huge gulp of air as if he were doing a very long gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" asked Hinata in concern. \"It s-sounded like you've been in the city before, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be fine.\" said Taizen who had a look on his face similar to that of someone who swallowed a watermelon whole. \"I can never get over the initial feel of entering the city. So many people in one place...It overloads my senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ninjas shot him a confused look, Taizen seemed to catch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, I forgot to mention. I'm blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reacted in a overly concerned manner. \"Blind!? Are you alright!? Can we get you medicine!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaizen spoke over Naruto's continued ramblings of 'Maybe Granny can fix him!' \"No, you misunderstand me. I've been blind since birth. The retinas that should be in my eyes never existed. You can't heal what was never there in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then h-how are you able to get around?\" Hinata asked in a confused tone. \"I mean, y-you seem to be able to see us and e-everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just because one of my senses is gone doesn't mean I am senseless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to his ear. \"I can hear both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he pointed to his nose. \"I can smell both of you- No, not in that way Naruto. And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand did a sort of waving motion. \"I can feel both of you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel us?\" questioned Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's difficult to explain to someone else. You know how there's Charka in each of us, right? There's also your soul within each person too. That warmth, that life force leaves a...\" he struggled to find the right word. \"I guess you can call it a weight, or a pull, in the area around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA leaf blew past Taizen's hand. He seemed to notice it and waved his hand around it. In what initially Hinata thought was a trick of the eye, the leaf seemed to be following the boy's hand movements, bobbing up and down as if it were on top of a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything thing around us gives this pull, this force.\" he continued, using the leaf as a visual aid. \"Once you feel it or sense it, you can eventually control it and manipulate it with practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a violent flicking gesture with his hand and the leaf snapped in half before fluttering to the ground in two pieces. He turned his attention back up to the pair who were ogling him in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That about sums it up. That's how I can tell where you two are in the given space around me. I can also determine shapes, sizes, and even thoughts if the feeling is strong enough without ever needing my eyes. For example...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at Hinata. \"Your presence in the space for a human is unusually large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed as Naruto paused to look at her. \"Now that you mention it...She does seem bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, she tried to change the subject. \"T-T-Then why is w-walking into t-the city a burden on your senses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's like if someone placed an explosion next to your ears. So many life forces in one given place make it painful to stand. I'll get used to it eventually, but chances are I might bump into a few things by mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no problem!\" grinned Naruto. \"We'll lead you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaizen returned the smile. \"Thank you. With any luck, I'd just end up getting lost on my own. I'm glad the two of you found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued but their curiosity satisfied, they marched into the village. Naruto had took it upon himself to wrap one arm around Taizen's and lead him on through the crowds of people while Hinata was focused mainly with not knocking anyone over with her massive gut. They were determined to focus on their initial task, which was...</span></div></div>",

According to a picture that Gunther showed them he was somewhere in his early twenties. Gunther had mentioned that he was one of the more radical clansmen, but probably wouldn't be much of a problem. Word had it he was still somewhere in Konoha, but no one had managed to find him. It was now up to Naruto and Hinata to find him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly they had forgotten this momentarily after meeting Taizen, but Hinata managed to remember as they re-entered the village. As they entered the market area she kept Byakugan-activated eye out for him. It wasn't long before  Taizen had set up shop and began trying to drum up attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying some of them out front he wordlessly aced the large crowd of villagers until he called out to a woman walking  with a slight limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss, but are you in any pain?\" he asked her in specific. The woman noticed his blindness and seemed surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes actually. I hurt my leg a week ago and it hasn't gotten any better.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure some fresh medicinal herbs will help. Please try some.\" he said handing her a small fresh herb. \"Rub it on your leg and I'm sure it'll be well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously she listened to what he said and did as instructed, she gasped as she felt her pain disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow it worked!\" she said, \"it's like a miracle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata seemed amazed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that medicine would work so well?\" the puffed up lavender eyed girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could hear that there was an irregular walking pattern in the crowd and focused on it.\" he explained as the woman paid him before he pointed to a man with his arm in a sling. \"I can tell he also has an injured arm, that there is a small child with severe allergy issues, and that you and Naruto aren't normal by ninja standards. As if there is more to both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shinobi looked at Taizen almost bewildered. Hinata wondered if he knew about her changes, but she was unsure exactly what he meant about Naruto. Either way she wondered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Taizen...Can you sense someone with negative emotions around? Like resentment for example?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. If I focus.\" he said closing his already sightless eyes, momentarily ignoring the incoming customers that his \"miracle\" had attracted. After a minute he reopened his eyes. \"There is a particularly bothered man headed towards a large building near what I believe to be the village's center. He seems to be angry judging by his breathing and stride...He also has the same kind of scent that's on you and Naruto that the others don't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. That must be Sylas.\" Hinata deduced. She then looked at Naruto. \"We've got to go to the Hokage's office before he gets there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Taizen, we'll see you later. We've got to find this guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck. I think I'll join you in a few moments.\" the blindboy said as he began handing out medicine and taking the customer's Ryo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two ninja set off and encountered their target who...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first Hinata didn't even realize that the man quickly making his way to the Hokage's office was even a part of the gold-feather clan. He was dressed in relatively normal looking clothes of a typical villager, a stark contrast to the beads and feathers members of the clan usually wore. Naruto and Hinata weren't even sure he was the real target until he slipped out a wrapped oval shaped object and chucked it at the entrance of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bomb. The moment it hit the door, the two guards were thrown back by a gigantic fireball that seemed to whip through the air like a snake. Naruto cursed loudly and performed a few hand gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow Clones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat instantly caught the attention of the gold-feather terrorist, who spun around and tossed a handful of red wrapped bombs in Naruto's general direction. Three loud explosions peppered the air as Hinata felt herself being thrown from mid air into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" she cried out, unable to catch a glimpse of the blond in the thick fog of red smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrorist then turned to her and eyed her suspiciously. Perhaps he briefly recognized the process of transformation that were a part of their clan. But he spared Hinata no less than he did Naruto and tossed a big blue bomb right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't have time to dodge, not exactly being as nimble as she used to be. She closed her eyes and felt something heavy slam into her protruding stomach, giving off a echoing '<i>BOING</i>' sound. The bomb had collided with her belly and ricocheted harmlessly away from her before exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata finally opened her eyes, believing herself to be dead, she stared dumbfounded at the ex-gold feather clan member who looked very annoyed and was reached into his back hip-pack for more explosives. That was when out of the red cloud in the sky came Naruto and one of his shadow clones, both looking completely unharmed, barreling towards the man with an odd blue light in the palm of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat this, Rasengan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the man had already pulled out an odd twisted shaped bomb, which he didn't throw but held outstretched at Naruto's oncoming attack. Hinata's brain finally came back from its five minute coffee break and she too ran for the terrorist, hoping to reach him in time before he could react to her as well. She found that she could not move quite as fast as she normally could with the extra weight. How she was going to perform Gentle Fist, she had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was simply no way to reach them in time. Naruto and the gold-feather clan member's hand's smacked into each other. A blinding light flared up between the two, followed by a spiraling twister that consumed Naruto. The sound it gave off was similar to metal twisting and scrunching around itself. Naruto found himself spinning in mid air backwards and smashed hard against the wall of a building before slumping down, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clan member's hand was now smoking and charred, he flinched in pain as he brought it down to his side. It was probably going to be completely useless for the remainder of the fight. This didn't give Hinata a load of confidence though as she charged at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Byakugan was already activated and she gave a heavy jab forward straight for the man's shoulder. It connected far harder than Hinata had intended, she felt a hot liquid ooze over the tips of her fingers. Her fingernails had punctured the man's left shoulder, red blood was spraying all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrorist grunted in pain but pulled Hinata towards him. Hinata lost her balance and toppled forward, afraid that she was going to fall and crush the man. Instead, she felt a paralyzing push crushing right into her stomach. A deafening screech was all she could hear and she felt herself flipping backwards in a manner similar to Naruto just a few moments ago before landing hard on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped a few times, despite the ferocity of the bomb she had only had the wind knocked out of her. At least all that new fat was gone for something, it had probably absorbed most of the attack. Across from her, the terrorist was looking disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It figures...I had heard a rumor that Gunther had let slip one of their traditions yet again. I never dreamed they'd be the one to come and stop me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was coughing for air now on her knees. \"W-What, d-do you mean...G-Gunther let s-slip-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said firmly. \"I have no quarrel with the ninja of the Leaf. Understand that what must be done must be done. For the better of all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud 'Hah' caused the man to pause and look up at the Hokage office, Hinata did the same. Lady Tsunade and Lady Shizune were both looking down at the attacker from above, an angry look covered their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what do you think you're doing injuring MY villagers with no reason?\" scowled Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hokage...\" muttered the man. \"I hadn't counted on meeting you so soon, it's an honor. I'm going to have to attack you though, you'll try your hardest to defend yourself. Won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any other warning, the man tossed the largest bomb yet in the direction of the Hokage. She just stood there though, as if only mildly impressed and prepared to deflect it in an instant. She never got the chance though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bomb suddenly stopped in mid air. The fuse on the top had seemingly disappeared and the ball tumbled to the ground, bouncing harmlessly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you two were fighting...\" said a familiar voice. \"I could feel the explosions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was coming from where Naruto had landed. The blonde was currently being supported by a boy with dark hair and skin, several shuriken were tucked away behind his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taizen!\" called Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I owe you two an apology.\" he muttered. \"Couldn't smell the gunpowder on him, though its pretty obvious now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you the one that stopped my explosions?\" asked the man, growing more and more weary looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Taizen's faced disappeared and he stared down angrily at the man. Hinata felt herself shivering, even though he was blind it felt like his eyes were staring through her very soul. It seemed to be effecting the man as well, he took a step back in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the one that hurt my friends. Your fear is immense, I feel it...In your heartbeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the terrorist threw another bomb at Taizen. Taizen raised his free hand, releasing the shuriken he held into the air. It was at that moment, the sound of what seemed to be a thousand angry hornet rumbled in the air. It happened so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of large gray bees passed in front of Taizen and consumed the bomb in a giant fog. When the cloud disappeared, there was nothing left of the bomb. Hinata looked more clearly at the hornets as a realization hit her. They weren't hornets at all, it was a cloud of floating shuriken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaizen gestured for the cloud to come closer to him. It was like watching Gaara's sand techinque only with hundreds of sharp blades instead. The weapons spun around him in a circle like a predator waiting to pounce on its prey. Taizen again glared at the panic-stricken man below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not be able to defend yourself against this. No explosion can stop a cloud of a thousand spinning blades. Any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrorist just bit his lip. A great look of frustration spread across his face. He never gave his final words, he just reached into his pouch and froze. The cloud of shuriken suddenly materialized behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Hinata thought it was just a scratch that happened to graze the man. But then dozens of different wounds appeared one after the other until the blood soaked his clothing and he collapsed in a heap on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaizen spat. \"I shouldn't have kept him alive after all that.\"</span></div></div>",

It made Hinata a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Lady Tsunade?\" she asked a little fearfully. The village leader sighed before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing now, but to be honest I'm amazed by the precision of those attacks. The lacerations he suffered were just shy of life threatening...If I didn't know any better I'd say this was the work of an advanced Chunin, maybe a Jonin.\" she explained before looking at Taizen. \"And you say you're not from any village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am. I cannot recall much of my past, but I know for certain I'm not a ninja.\" the foreigner explained before gesturing his useless eyes. \"Besides I doubt a blind ninja is worth much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose, but whatever skills you possess, they are impressive. I want to personally thank you for helping to save the village, and trying to protect me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no problem. I appreciate your thanks.\" he said. \"But Naruto and Hinata were the ones who told me to be alert, I'm just glad I came to help in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case Hinata, Naruto, I don't want you to breathe a word of this to anyone else. I know this ninja is a renegade, but if word gets out the people may begin to distrust the Gold-feather tribe.\" Tsunade said before handing Naruto the man's unconscious frame, \"Take him to Gunther and have him decide what to do. In the meantime I'll come up with an explanation for the events outside.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Alright, trust in us Grandma Tsunade!\" Naruto told her confidently as he lugged the heavy man. Taizen followed the blonde as if he could see him as clear as day and then Hinata followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still wondering what he had meant by Gunther letting traditions slip? And why again? Were there others he had helped like Hinata? Either way she knew she shouldn't trust the word of a traitor, but a seed of doubt had been planted. As if sensing it the struggling Naruto turned to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata, is something the matter?\" the aqua eyed boy asked, immediately the plus sized kunoichi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, nothing really...I just feel a little confused is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confused about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...I thought that a friend of mine may have lied to me, and I don't know why.\" she said, \"It's really bothering me too and I don't quite understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend?\" Naruto said as he continued to lug the body, \"Well friends really shouldn't lie in the first place, but sometimes they lie for good reasons. I'm not saying it's right, but people with really good intentions sometimes lie so good things can happen, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\" Hinata said as her stomach growled, she wished she had some food, her stomach was bothering her focus. A second later Taizen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is food cooking a little further ahead at what I assume to be the Gold-feather tribe's camp. It should be five more minutes until it's at it's peak judging by the scent.\" <br>\r\n   <br>\r\nWithin moments the trio arrived at the camp and saw Gunther. Once he arrived...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Hinata saw Gunther, she suddenly doubled over and started moaning. Her stomach had given off a stabbing pain as if it were trying to eat its way through her skin. She was completely famished. With all the excitement from the start of the day she had not only skipped breakfast but missed out on lunch as well. Though she was eager to question Gunther with what the traitor had meant, she was dying to get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther seemed to sense her discomfort as the group approached and said. \"Hey guys, there's food cooking over the fire-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get to finish his statement as Hinata tore off for the campfire, leaving Naruto and Taizen to deliver the unconscious ex-gold feather clan member. She didn't care, she'd apologize to them later. Right now her stomach had forced her brain to take a backseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping down next to the roaring fire, she discovered a bounty of cooked fish on sticks as well as smoked corn and tasty looking fruits and berries in small baskets. She was in complete bliss as she violently shoved unhealthy amounts of food into her mouth, her hunger seemed to know no end. A few of the wandering clan members turned away with a mixture of both shock and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing off about thirty sticks of fish, ten baskets of fruit, and twenty corn cobs, Naruto and Taizen finally made their way over to the fire. Thankfully, Hinata's sudden glutenous need to eat had been somewhat subdued and she was now eating slowly enough to be considered 'eating normally', so she wouldn't embarrass herself in front of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'd thought there'd be more food here.\" said Naruto, as he grabbed a pike of fish while Hinata buried her head in a blush. \"I guess we're a little late to the feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more than enough here,\" Taizen calmly replied as he sat next to Naruto with his own bit of fish. \"Maybe you should give the notice to Hinata before you forget, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what- Ah, right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reached into his pocket with a hand that was covered in grease from the fish. He handed Hinata a paper smeared with sauce with her name on it in simple writing. Opening it between mouthfuls of fish she discovered that it was a message from Gunther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hinata,<br>\r\nI trust that the 'process' is going quite well, judging by your sudden disappearance to race for food. That's quite understandable though, eat up. Tomorrow will be a bit rougher for you. I suspect you will be unable to continue your chores with your comrades so I will pull you away for a special assignment. Report to my tent an hour earlier than usual tomorrow. I'll explain everything then as I will be away for the remainder of the day. For now, good luck.<br>\r\nGunther</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata read it over several times, the thought of what that clan member had said was resurfacing in her mind. But if what he said was true, she wouldn't be able to ask him until tomorrow. She turned to the boys who were busy devouring their own meals and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What b-became of that ninja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buno,\"  said Naruto between big bites of food. \"Bunter bust bok bem bnabay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what Naruto is trying to say is Gunther didn't tell us what would happen to the ninja. He just took him away after we handed him over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaizen wiped his mouth and gazed sadly at Hinata. \"If I had to guess, I'd say Gunther took him to be immediately executed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" both Naruto and Hinata yelled at once. Taizen just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This clan has been known to deal with traitors rather...harshly. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" muttered Naruto, bits of sauce dripping down his chin. \"They really don't fool around, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at it from this point of view. They're a neutral clan, as a result they can trade and converse with the many different villages. If one of their members attacks a village, that neutral stance will do them little good. It's hard to say you're a peaceful clan when you have people attacking other people. They need to maintain a strict order over the do's and don'ts of their clan members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded deeply, pretending he understood all of it when really have no idea what anything Taizen said meant. Hinata, however, was still slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do y-you know so much about the c-clan, Taizen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Ah, well. As a child of the forest, I need to also wander from village to village a lot. We've crossed path many times over the years. Even Gunther recognized me after you left for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked as if to say to Hinata 'It's true, they know each other'. Hinata smiled back in return, but was still slightly confused as to why Taizen hadn't bothered to mention his relationship with the clan before. She supposed he had his reasons though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the food, Naruto got up suddenly and ran off yelling something about \"Feeling a turtle head poking out.\" Hinata took advantage of her brief time alone with Taizen and asked him.</span></div></div>",

I thought you knew about him yourself?\" The blind warrior said, \"As you have been working for him for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but you've known him longer, maybe you know more overall.\" Hinata lied quickly. Taizen seemed able to tell that something was amiss, but he held his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I would. I met Gunther several years ago during my wanderings, during that time I was rather weak, but the Golden feather clan took me in until I was well. During our first encounter I interacted with them very little although they were more than hospitable. When I was well enough I left and went about my business. It was several months later in another land when I met them again, this time though I was attacked by someone, but when I subdued her a group of hunter nin arrived and I found out she was a member of their tribe. Naturally I followed them back where they rewarded me. When I inquired why that person had done those things I was informed that she was trying to steal clan secrets and thought I was an enemy. They then told me that she had been killed, and that I was to see Gunther.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" Hinata asked, hardly able to think that her new allies would kill anyone, even a traitor. For a Leaf villager such thoughts were unbelievable, even for traitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, but he wanted to thank me for what I did and said that he was amazed that someone my age could defeat one of the clan's stronger warriors. For a time he took me under his wing and I sensed that he had a warm spirit, but there was something even I didn't understand deeper inside of him. For a time I ignored it until I heard him mention my name one night to his elders and something about a ritual. I couldn't hear what they said exactly, which was odd, but I didn't like what I had overheard. Ultimately though I think that for whateer reason the elders rejected me due to my blindness, but what difference does a blind sacrifice truly make?\" Taizen asked, more to himself than Hinata. Now he seemed concerned, his blank eyes staring uselessly as if trying to grasp some deeper meaning. \"As far as I know he is a good man with good intentions, but he is not always entirely honest. I would recommend that you be wary around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after Taizen told Hinata his story she felt some uneasiness well up in her stomach. She was unsure if it was her transformation or Taizen's story, but she showed no signs of unease, or at least tried not to. Taizen still caught her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is mostly my theory you know, I can sense intentions, but I could've been wrong.\" he added quickly in an attempt to make her more calm, it hardly worked, but the dark haired girl appreciated the sentiment. Moments later Naruto returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did I miss?\" Naruto asked them as he arrived back on scene. Taizen was the first to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Hinata and I had brief conversation about Gunther is all.\" he said before gesturing towards the setting sun. \"It's getting late, I think I'll head over to my own camp for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're going off into the woods all by yourself?\" Naruto asked, even though he knew Taizen was strong he still didn't want to leave the blind boy alone.\"Hey why don't we go with you?\" Naruto offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Hinata?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just to make sure you get there safe and all.\" Naruto went on before turning to his ever growing companion, \"Right Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Naruto...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the blonde shrugged and grabbed the dark boy by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, suit yourself then. It's probably important anyway. Come on Taizen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, Gunther is a good man.\" added Taizen as he was being pulled away. \"Keep an open mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata waited and watched as the two boys disappeared out of sight into the thick of the forest. \"A good man...,\" she repeated to herself, trying to measure the value of that sentiment. Would a good man lie? Would Gunther have lied after he said those nice things to her. Those uplifting and encouraging things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped her fists hard and felt the sharpness of her nails dig into her skin. There was only one way to determine the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky glared fire red by the time Hinata made her way to Gunther's tent. She could have gone straight to him after leaving Naruto and Taizen but felt the need to wander around a bit and think to herself. Thankfully Shino and Kiba had left already too, as had most of the clansmen who were gathered around the main campfire for dinner. This made the camp feel very empty and lonely as she slowly waddled to the large tent on the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther was there skinning a caught deer over his own small campfire. He sensed her approach, which probably wasn't difficult with the weight of each of her steps as she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Hinata!\" he said. \"Just in time, I had something for you to accomplish before you left this evening-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Actually...There was something I wanted to a-ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a look as if he had not expected her to interrupt him like that. Like no one had ever interrupted him before. But he maintained a calm expression and plainly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will have to wait, I'm afraid. Whatever it is on your mind. This is vital to the process of the transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave a worried frown but nodded. Gunther seemed to sense her concern and quickly added. \"I promise, whatever it is on your mind I will address vividly tomorrow morning. I wouldn't ignore your thoughts unless something was of the utmost importance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata faked a smile and nodded. Gunther then cleared his throat and crossed his arms. \"Anyway, there is another reason we come to this forest every so often. Deep within it is a rare tree that gives off an unusual sap. It has fairly normal properties and appears unassuming until one tastes it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What happens then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When consumed the sap gives more bear-like tendencies to the eater. In other words your mind, scent, and even personality changes ever-so slightly to a more bear-like nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't understand...Why is t-that necessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment, as if he were searching for the words to explain it clearly. \"Well, for most members of our clan it isn't when they go through this rite. We live daily around our guardian bears and thus adapt to their nature over the course of our lives. You on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have not...\" she finished for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. You forget, in five days you will be living with a sloth of bears in the wild. Your success with hinge of if they accept you as a member of their group or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I need it to g-give me the best chance of being accepted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. The sap is called bearblood. We reserve a small supply of it for members who are not confident about their rites so that they don't end up being mauled or beaten alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata winced slightly but nodded. Gunther continued. \"Seeing as you need some of the sap yourself, I thought it would be a good task for you to acquire some for yourself and for the clan's stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why w-wait until the evening to assign this t-though?\" asked Hinata. Wandering around in the woods at dark with bears in the forest was not her idea of safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sap only drips from the tree at dusk. I had been meaning to tell you about the task this morning but I forgot to mention it, so you have my apologizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a small vial. \"After you collect the sap, just take one drop and eat it. Only one drop. Anymore and you risk losing your mind completely to the beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One drop...R-Right.\" muttered Hinata. It could not be any more apparent that she was nervous. \"Where's the t-tree in the forest though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther gave her a reassuring smile. \"It's just south of here deep in the woods. It's large, dark, and shaped like a bear. You can't miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stared at the tiny vial in her hand for a moment, pondering if this was really the right thing she should be doing. Gunther finally spoke, waking her up from her thoughts. \"Don't worry, this is all perfectly safe. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere further away in the woods, up a rather tall pine tree a large man was sitting rather uncomfortably near the tip of the top looking through a long black rifle's scope. In t he distance the sun was setting and his vision was going darker, but he could see his target perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, she's on the move now...\" he smiled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All seemed quiet in the woods as Hinata Hyuga progressed through the leafy locale. The dead of night made it hard for her to see, and even with her Byakugan activated the more massive kunoichi was having trouble navigating. Every time she moved she felt as if she was going to run into a tree or trip on a root somewhere under her clawed feet. Already she could feel her newly regrown fur underneath her clothing reemerge, as if on this journey to make her more bearlike, her body was already adapting itself. Perhaps to help make her journey less difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her nose just as well as her eyes she created a path to allow her to get to the bearblood sap safely and quickly. Her senses helped her to avoid any unnecessary confrontations, as if she had continued on what seemed to be walkways made by other creatures she would've entered the territory of a few wolverines or a stream teeming with parasitic leeches. She had heard the expression treacherous paths before but had never thought that it would apply to a forest. Then again as a ninja she had to be prepared or anything that could be thrown her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed she felt herself grow tired, partly from the trek and partly for having her Byakugan active for such an extensive period if time, and she sat back against a small rock formation. Exhaustion from the trip was taking it's toll on her, more than likely Hinata would end up not finding the tree, as dusk was dangerously near. She felt as if she couldn't even move a muscle from tiredness, when she heard the sound of footsteps. Turning quickly she saw that the rock she was leaning on was actually part of a cave entrance, and walking out she saw what looked to be a bear standing erect. She had spent enough time with Gunther's people to deduce that it was a male of some sort. She feared she had entered his territory unwittingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I-I'm sorry for disturbing you.\" she said gently to it, hoping it knew what she was saying. \"I r-really shouldn'tve just plopped down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata prepared to flee the scene however she was surprised to hear a soft spoken yet strong male voice speak out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry as well. I should've taken up a dwelling elsewhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the source of the voice Hinata saw that the bear was actually more of a bear-man. He was a large humanoid bear wearing a simple beige cloak with a hood.  He was much taller than Hinata, and that was quite a statement given her growth spurt. He looked meek, yet powerful. Something about seeing him felt nostalgic to Hinata. As if they had met in another world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me sir, d-d-do I know you?\"  she asked. The creature before her looked surprised, but actually seemed to think on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am unsure. I do not think this is the first time we've met, but I have no idea who you are. Sorry about my poor memory. In any case my name is Grills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am Hinata Hyuga.\" Hinata said bowing nervously. She didn't know what to say exactly after such an awkward meeting, when a thought occurred to her. \"Are you a member of the golden feather tribe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but no, I do know of them however.\" Grills apologized needlessly. \"You probably thought that due to my appearance, but this form is from an unrelated source...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it happen to be the bear blood sap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that's not correct either. I also know about the sap though, it comes from the tree atop the next hill. I learned about it from an acquaintance  of mine named Ichikuma during one of my stays here in the winter a few years ago. That is how I know of the tree and the Golden Feather tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see.\" Hinata said, her eyes on the ever shrinking sun, now a slight pink color on the western horizon. \"Well may I ask you to show me exactly where the tree is? I need to get the sap relatively soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Grills said walking out before her. \"It would be a pleasure. Though can you tell me why you have come to look like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you yourself have begun to change.\" He explained further, \"I am sorry to intrude, but I do not often see other humans becoming more ursine in nature like myself so I was curious as to why you have taken your current form, and wish to become even more like a bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata...</span></div></div>",

The bear-man was seemingly interested in the tale, he said nothing but paid close attention. His eyes shined with wisdom as Hinata finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then Gunther sent me out here to find the bearblood. That's how I met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" he muttered. \"I'll admit it does sound suspicious, I have to say Gunther's actions are less than understandable. I do not know him, but I know his tribe generally praises him and openly despises all dissenters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're all such good people.\" Hinata said, thinking of the Gold feather tribe and the time she spent working with them. \"And they hate people who attack Konoha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But does that truly make their leader good? he inquired. \"They could have their own views, but Gunther could be using you in his plans or be deceiving you. As I recall deception was a key trait among ninja.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stopped at this once they reached the massive tree seeping with bearblood sap. Her sudden halt had more to do with a realization over the fact that Gunther very well could be evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stood there quietly for a long time until Grills touched her to grab her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, I'm sorry but I must go now. I suggest you take the sap and leave. The woods can be quite dangerous at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, right.\" Hinata said as she quickly vialed the sap. She wasn't sure she should take it yet, so she decided to only take a sample for now. Once she was done she looked at Grills. \"Thank you for listening to my problem and guiding me. It helped alot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Grills said. \"I'm just sorry I couldn't help more. Until we next meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he left, as did Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned to Konoha....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though this bear...man...person seemed trusting enough a last bit of loyalty to Gunther prevented her from divulging the issue. She just bowed her head in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't tell you, I a-apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear-man didn't seem angered by her response and instead appeared sincerely remorseful. \"I'm sorry as well, I shouldn't have pressed the issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remained quiet with each other after that, the sound of crunching leaves was all that could be heard as the moved through the thick of the forest. Grills led the way, crashing through branches that stood between them and their destination. Hinata was suddenly very glad that this creature was friendly. Yet even with the raw strength the both of them had together, she couldn't help but feel like something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that someone was watching her...Though her senses told her nothing, not even her Byakugan detected any presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it lies, straight ahead.\" spoke Grills at last, pointing a clawed finger at a large mass in front of him. \"Have a safe night, my lady. I'm sorry but I have urgent matters elsewhere that cannot be delayed further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, it's fine. It's enough that y-you even brought me this far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear- man bowed and stomped off back into the forest. It was when his steps could no longer be heard did Hinata turn to face what he had been pointing at. Even she was not fully prepared for just how large the tree was. It wasn't the tallest tree in the forest, the overgrowth above neatly hid it from a topside view. However, it was massive in bulk making it seem almost like a large boulder. But the twigs and leaves growing off it in various directions said otherwise. The shape of it could only be considered as one form. A giant bear roaring into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gulped, now that she was here alone the tree looked very imposing indeed. She half-wanted to run to find Grills again but shook her head. She had come this far already and she couldn't just turn around and run away when the goal was right there. With renewed determination, she stepped up to the bulky tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Hinata wondered where she was supposed to draw the sap but then she noticed that the \"claws\" of the bear-tree were dripping with some red liquid. Hinata shuddered and immediately thought it was blood until she took a closer look at it. It was too thick to be blood, it dripped like honey almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This m-must be the sap then...\" she whispered, unpacking a vial from her side pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sap ran slowly into the vial, it only seemed to swirl violently when collected as if it were a beast that could not be contained. When she felt she had enough, she screwed the cap back on and turned around into the blackness of the forest. Dusk was over. There was nothing but darkness now, so much that Hinata couldn't see two feet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown too tired to use the Byakugan she so reached into her pouch again and pulled out a flare. As the warm light lit the area surrounding the tree, there was something out of place. There was a dark figure directly in front of her and the exit to the grove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done,\" spoke a voice.</span></div></div>",

While Hinata could just barely make out his features, she recalled his sensory skills were intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taizen? How did you get here?\" HJinata asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go out into the woods often, especially when I cannot sleep. I was surprised to see you though, in a manner of speaking.\" he chuckled. \"What brings you out so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, erm...Just a bit of personal training is all.\" she lied quickly. Despite his inability to see it she flashed a quick smile, filled with sharp fangs. Taizen seemed to buy it though if his countenance was anything to judge by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well I can definitely tell you worked hard. Sadly we won't be able to make it back to the Gold Feather Tribe or Konoha tonight. I am setting up a camp soon though, would you care to join me for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Hinata agreed when she felt him take her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me guide you, step carefully.\" he told her. Agreeing Hinata and her blind guide brought her through the forest. Though she couldn't see where she was going, she ached badly enough to know that they walked quite a ways. Eventually he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, there's a boulder here you can sit while I set up.\" the impaired youth said putting her hand on the sizable stone. Finding her seat Hinata finally rested, letting her feelings of tiredness wash over her. As she did her stomach rumbled. She was hoping that Taizen had some food ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I caught some wild quail earlier.\" Taizen said as he lit a fire, the flames radiating warmth and enabling Hinata to see with it's light. \"I couldn't catch any fish, but I do have some water ready to boil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thank you, I don't have many provisions left.\" she said  as she watched him begin to roast the small birds. They had already been plucked and cleaned. As time passed it began to give off an enticing scent. As she inhaled the scent she heard Taizen speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I hardly ever have company. I'm glad to have you here.\" he said to her quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad I ran into you too. Thanks for helping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem....Can I tell you a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A secret?\" Hinata asked, feeling a bit awkward. She wondered what it was. \"S-sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On quiet nights like this I feel at one with natre. I can hear the animals far off, feel the wind and earth. If I stay utterly still...Sometimes I forget I exist.\" he said, almost dreamily. \"You know, people sometimes pity me for being blind, but when I can feel and sense so much...I feel I am blessed. A part of nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know you understand it a little. After all if you stay on the path you are on, and if everything goes as it should you will really know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, the changes you are going through are beyond the Gold Feather's Rite of Passage. It is different, it will make you more in tune, possibly because of your bloodline. Unlike me, your sight will advance along with your senses, in addition to you actually becoming a creation of nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa-wait Taizen, h-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All will be explained in time, for now I must rest. Goodnight Hinata.\" he said giving her pillow and pointing to the one tent he set up. Immediately he himself went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that All hinata knew for sure was that Taizen knew something and, as crazzy as it sounded, made some sort of prediction about her future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it was just his tiredness...' she thought yawning and crawling over to the bed. 'Still, I better rest too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so hinata slept soundly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Hinata awoke from her slumber early. Her mind felt hazy at first, but slowly she came to her senses, recalling partaking of the bearblood sap the previous night and Taizen's cryptic message to her. With the back of her hand, she rubbed her eyes, opening them slowly, only to see the odd sight of a snout on her face, covered with lavender colored fur. She gasped, surprised by it. She saw her new, black nose on the snout's tip. It was animalistic, much like her ears, which she felt had changed not only shape but position on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Hinata asked, glad that she could at least still speak. Her voice wasn't different, but as she tried to stand she noticed she was taller. Looking down at her body, the fur had covered it, her clothes once more ripped from her increase in mass. She looked at her hands, to discover there were pads on her palms, soft to the touch, but protective, while her fingers had claws. The same was done to her feet, the soles being padded, now slightly pawlike and too large to fit in her now broken sandals. The last change she noticed was her tailbone having become an actual tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no easy way of judging how much her form had changed at the moment, so Hinata called out for Taizen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taizen? Taizen aree you here?\" Hinata asked, only to be met with silence. She looked about, but saw him nowhere. His scent was gone, as well as any trace of where he went, though his tent and camp were still there. It was almost as if he had disappeared into thin air. She wondered where her blind friend had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood, happy to see that she could still walk erect, though she had no idea if she was fully a bear or not. She tried to walk, though it was more like lumbering. Her form was awkard and she was unable to determine whether or not she was fully changed or if it was just a partial one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she knew for sure was that she needed to determine how much she had changed and make her way back to the golden feather tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she travelled through the woods, she found her senses had increased. Though her sight was already grand due to the byakugan, she could also hear better. She could locate the birds from their calls, high up in the treees, the few wilf foxes, squirrels and mice that scurried about on the ground, and smell where they had been in the area around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing that very smell, she smelled the scent of water in the air. she approached and saw her reflection. She still had human eatures, as if she was at the midway point between being a human or bear, but why  had she changed so much and so fast? It was a mystery she couldn't quite solve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GRUMBLE*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially not on an empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt herself grow embarassed as she realized just how hungry she was. She felt as if she needed something in order to quell her newfound hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing close to water, she saw many fish. Though she knew bears preferred rivers with fish, she decided it would be easiest to go with what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she dove in, activating her byakugan. It made it asier for her to see every fish in the area, and making catching them much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin half an hour, she had five fish in hand and had thrown them on shore. Her first instinct was to  eat them there as they were, but her human sensibilities demanded she  cook them. She soon built a fire and prepared them, practically salivating at the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Hinata heard a noise, one not too far from where she was. She tried to detect what it was and discovered that it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata gasped in surprise, seeing  that a wild bear had come, approaching her. She could only guess that she was in it's territory and  was disturbing it. She felt her adrenaline pump, her fight or flight instinct engage as her old fear reared its head. It reminded her of so long ago, when she was small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new senses were almost too much to bear. While not nearly as great as her sight, her other senses were in hyperdrive, so much so that she had to focus in order to calm herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, it had become obvious that the bear meant her no harm. It merely wished for the food Hinata had caught and roasted. It looked at the fire curiously, and the fish before seeing Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear wasn't quite sure what to make of her, all it knew as there was food and another member of its species perhaps. Hinata could see its confusion, but decided to show she was no threat. Carefully plucking a cooled, roast fish from near the fire, she placed it near the bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few apprehensive sniffs, the bear took a bite, before consuming the fish whole, enjoying it. Hinata smiled to herself upon seeing its happiness and ate as well, sharing her meal with this new ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was within minutes that they finished their food, and Hinata was more than satisfied by her catch. All she needed now was to rest, as she felt far too tired to go back to Konoha or the Golden Feather tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed the bear with her seemed eager to go, as if it had some place to be. Hinata followed and was soon led to a sloth of bears, a strange and small community of them. Hinata was intrigued by them, but wanted to fit in. This was a chance for her to learn about bears, but she needed to blend in with them in order to get to know them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, she got on all fours, trying her best to look like a normal bear. To her surprise, her legs had changed so she could walk either on all fours or erect whenever she wanted. This revelation surprised her, but she felt as if this was natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked for a place of rest and saw that there was a hollowed out tree, one that was empty and free for her own use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily, she crawled inside and tried to make a place for herself. As all the other bears readied themselves for slumber she decided that it would be in her interest to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Hinata slept, her mind again wandering to where Taizen went, what Naruto was up to, and if Gunther would be proud of her progress. Those very thoughts continued into her sleep and influenced her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata awoke the next day, she found she was still in the woods with the bears, each of them going about their lives as needed. The mothers tended their cubs, watching them as they went to play while the males went off and foraged for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata knew little about bears before now, but she was certain that they didn't live in such communities and that their behavior wasn't exactly what they had seen. Then again those were typical bears she had learned about, and there were a fair number of creatures that acted differently from their feral counterparts. All she could do was wonder and try to fit in as best she could with the current group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passed, and in that week Hinata learned many of the trials of being a bear. Among the chief lessons was to avoid going in areas with disturbed bees. Though she could easily do away with them, it was exhausting and her balance took some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had good times getting to know the other bears and their habits, using identifying traits with scents and making mental notes of who they were. Likewise, they had taken her in and things were peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new state of being had its trials, but Hinata was growing stronger for it and more content, though she needed to occassionally go off on her own and perform a few exercises in humanity, such as taijutsu training or writing, using her claws to scratch words into bark. She couldn't do it much, so she only wrote important things, such as important lessons of the day or a warning to stay away for other humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eight days...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata\u2019s time among the bears continued to change her as she lived in day to day life. It seemed she was getting more and more comfortable with her new place in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing with the bears, she was starting to grow more attached to them. She started to identify with them not by names, but by sense of smell, relying on animalistic instincts more than her human ones. She found her mind focused less and less on memories of home and her loved ones, but more on survival. It wasn\u2019t that she was purposefully forgetting, but she had begun to feel her memories get pushed back to the back of her mind, just under the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had vague awareness of being human formerly, but otherwise she believed  herself to be a bear. She had lost her anthropomorphic status, her arms and legs becoming totally ursine and indistinguishable from theose and others. Her hands and feet now completely paws as she began to feel a heavier coat of fur grow over her body. Her fur had a passing similarity to her hairstyle, but if one did not look closely, they would not consider her to have any relation to her former self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued with her day to day routine, walking about foraging for food and  making sure that the other bears in her sloth were alright. She eventually saw them separate out though and into their own territories. As it turned out bears were asocial for the most part. The ones she had been with were merely relatives come to see the cubs. She was fortunate enough to learn the basics from them before she began to look for food of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with her climbing trees in search of acorns. Being the bulk of a bear\u2019s diet, she had to start there. She found a reasonably good haul and soon took her fill of the food. When she had gotten as much as she could, she went down from the tree and back to walking around. She found herself looking for berries in the area next as she was not in the mood for fish. Her sharp sight thanks to the byakugan enabled her to find everything she needed and she led a very content life for some time. It wasn\u2019t until three weeks after she had given herself over fully to being a bear that she noticed something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an intruder in her territory, one that had passed through, but not too long ago. Hinata had also learned part of a bear\u2019s nature was to be more territorial. Hinata began to look around, following her nose. She prepared herself for any or all threats, but she didn\u2019t notice any come by. She knew it wasn\u2019t the other bears. She could recognize them easily if she had seen them, but she had not found anything to indicate it was them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was utterly puzzled, wondering what it could have been. Putting it behind her, she returned to her den around nightfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Hinata, the forest of death where the chunin exams were held had been opened lately, a few of the animals clawing at the gates for unknown reasons. Because of this, many of those creatures had spilled out. Ninja from the Leaf village had done their best to wrangle as many as possible, but many more had evaded their grasp. This was a problem that Hinata would soon be dealing with as she continued her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, she woke early and with a loud yawn, rising sluggishly at first, bur soon facing the new day. She walked outside, smelling the scent of flowers, herbs and other plantlife and the tweeting of birds in the area. Hinata did also hear the buzzing of bees. They weren\u2019t making honey yet, but they would be soon. For now she decided it was best to leave them be and look for more filling sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had noticed deer in the area and was hoping to bring one down so she could eat. Being omnivorous she ate what she could, but she felt as if today was a good day to go for meat. She went onward out to a clearing where some deer were grazing. She could see them and how skittish they were, a few stags on the alert. In a way she felt as if the does and their fawns reminded her of her old self. However they were animals, no, prey and they had to fall so she could thrive. Her hunting of them was not malicious or personal, but just nature necessary for her to survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that chance, she began to draw closer to the ungulates. With a leap, she bounded out, only to see a great tiger come around, pouncing on the fauna and trying to consume it. The sight shocked Hinata, it was a surprise to see such a large tiger so close to the woods. It was five times her own size and it was ripping into the deer with gusto, consuming it and ignoring the others. It had ruined Hinata\u2019s hunt, but she was not in the mood for conflict. She tried to walk away, but was surprised when she found that the tiger has seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor their environments, Bears were typically apex predators, ones who were at the top with no contest, however tigers were the one exception to this rule. They would sometimes prey on bears and while Hinata did not know this, she could certainly sense the creature\u2019s intent. No mere deer would be enough sustenance for it, and it  was hungry for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could feel herself gearing up for conflict with the giant tiger, the great feline baring his fangs. Hinata watched as he rushed up at her, only for her to sidestep. Even with just her instincts, her muscle memory from her time as a ninja remained, and with it she had adapted some of her moves. Her ability of sight enabled her to predict the creature\u2019s movements and intentions. She dodged the first claw strike flawlessly before following up with a slash of her own, scoring on it\u2019s face. The creature roared in pain before Hinata roared too, telling it to go back before she attacked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature chose to ignore the threat, and instead pounced harder, once again being met with defeat. This continued for some time, several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata did have a few admittedly close calls, but it wasn\u2019t long before the large foe was sufficiently wounded. Her claws dug deep. Blinded in one eye, blood matting its fur, and several deep slashes in it\u2019s limbs and body made the tiger begin to fall. It slumped over slowly, no longer able to limp after her or run away. Hinata could tell it would be dead soon, but she was exhausted as well. She slowly limped back to her home to rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a brisk fall day, the sort of day that everyone spent bundled up in warm jackets while they raked the leaves in the back yard. Hinata would have normally been enjoying the bright vibrate colors of the trees were it not for the simple fact that she had been kicked out of the Hy\u016bga mansion. Her father felt that she had not been trying hard enough to improve herself, despite her training every single day for hours. She vividly remembered what he said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not going to try to takes the reins of this family, then we will not support you. You're going to go find your own job and live by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was that, here she was looking around town for any place that was willing to hire her. This wasn't the first time something like this had happened, her father would often lose his patience with her and kick her out until Hanabi tried to talk him out of it. She'd just have to go find a job and apartment for a week or so, maybe one of her teammates would let her stay. She blushed a little at the thought of Naruto letting her stay with him. But such daydreams weren't helping her find a job, and the cold was making her hands numb. She was beginning to lose hope of finding hire before nightfall. As luck would have it, she spotted a small ad on the nearby lamppost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Panda Fu?\" She read aloud. \"Looking for hire. Good pay. Flexible hours. Are you a ninja in need of extra cash? Look us up near the Hokage monument...How interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ad seemed to have everything she was looking for. She quickly sped over to the printed address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was safe to say Hinata arrived at the right place. There was a giant balloon panda with a cardboard take-out box in one hand floating over the quaint little shop. It looked like a very traditional Chinese restaurant, bold red colors and beautiful roofing. The inside was also filled with delicate chinaware and panda wallpaper. It seemed like it was newly opened, as no one appeared to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" Shouted the shy girl. \"I-is anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bald Chinese man jumped up from under the counter causing Hinata to jump. \"HOWCANIHELPYOU!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl had practically jumped through the ceiling, and was breathing in and out heavily. The man apologized. \"Oh I'm sorry miss! I wasn't expecting any costumers with the renovations and all. Welcome to Panda Fu! How can I help you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, u-um. Actually I-I was wondering if y-you were h-hiring by chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, you must have read our ads then huh? What's your name girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hinata, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hinata, we're looking for someone who...\"</span></div></div>",

'Wearing a costume wouldn't be all that bad,' she reasoned 'It might be embarrassing if someone saw me, but no one has to know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Hinata said, after considering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah excellent.\" The man said before reaching beneath his counter and handing her a box. \"You'll be acting as our mascot Pan: the lovably playful Panda.

Is it cursed or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not! It's just very old my dear. So you must be extremely careful with it, you could wear it out if you have it on for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, that makes sense...I guess...\" The bald man handed her a large box. \"Thank you mister...u-uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yun Zi, Just call me Mr. Yun, Hinata. And thanks for taking the job, I was afraid we'd be without a mascot on opening day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's no trouble...I'll see you tomorrow f-first thing in the morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to go find an apartment or at least somewhere to stay for the night. Yun Zi waited until she was out of earshot before muttering to himself. \"Thank the gods I was able to get rid of that damned thing! Hopefully she at least has the sense to not wear it after work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's day brightened up after that. She didn't have much luck finding an open apartment on such short notice, but she happened to bump into Naruto while in town. After asking her what she was doing there when it was almost nightfall, he treated her to some Ramen from the Bar and offered a spare room. She didn't want to impose but the blond practically dragged her there, possibly because he had never had a friend stay the night and to him it was just like a slumber party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending half the night watching TV with Naruto, which she handled with her usual 'grace', Hinata decided to some well deserved shut eye. It was then she noticed the box containing the panda suit Yun Zi had given her earlier that day. She hadn't even checked if it fit her. But he did say to never wear it off the job because it was delicate...Should she risk it?</span></div></div>",

But then, just when she thought the changes were over, Hinata started to grow black and white fur all over her body, as her hair went from black to white. However, her changes were not over just yet. Hinata then felt her body slowly expanding all over with muscle and body fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, her breasts grew from a scrawny B-Cup to a pair of jiggling Triple D-Cup breasts. Then, Hinata felt her arms and paw-like hands become bulkier with fat, as her belly became a big paunch of fat. But the biggest parts of her was her waist, hips, legs and her butt, as Hinata felt her big furry butt become like two beanbag chairs, as her furry hand sink an inch or two into her big fatty rear, making her around 4 to 4 and a half feet wide. But as she felt her fatty panda legs on the verge of touching each other, Hinata's panda face had a thick double chin and a pair of chubby cheeks, completing her transformation into a fat Panda Girl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nearly everyone from Konoha was there, apparently there had never been a Chinese restaurant in the village before. Hinata could spot several members of the her squad, and several others including Naruto. She didn't tell him that she was working at Panda Fu and was immensely thankful for that. The panda suit completely disguised her identity as no one had yet approached due to recognizing her, only to ask where the restrooms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Hinata had been welcoming in costumers for hours now and it was well past her lunch break. She made her way through the crowd of people to find her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mr. Yun...C-can I take a small break now?\" Her hair was getting all matted in the sweaty suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh! Yes of course Miss. Hinata! Only fifteen minutes though, I don't think I can direct all these people by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding she made her way into the employee's break room. Sighing in relief, she gently removed the suit's mask and scratched her head to unclog her hair. The break room was rather small but it did have a table and chairs to eat lunch. Hinata couldn't afford any food but it was good to sit and rest for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the room as her belly growled. The walls were delicately aligned with bamboo sticks, glued to the wall. Sure, they were for decoration but Hinata was starting to get REALLY hungry. Even fake bamboo looked tasty, Hinata shook her head. Was she really that desperate for food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HINATA! It's been thirty minutes! Please, I need your help out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gasped. Thirty minutes!? She could have sworn she had just sat down for her break. How long had she been staring at the bamboo...?

Dragons of my breeding can heal while in close contact with another being.

It was like she really was a...dragon. Yesterdays events with Anne suddenly flooded the young ninja's mind. She looked down the collar of her bed shirt. Sure enough, there was a glowing purple scar on her stomach in a letter Hinata could not recognize. Hanabi was looking more and more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you through checking yourself out!? Get up and eat breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata decided to not test the patience of her sister and father further. Hanabi left her sisters room in a huff while Hinata quickly got changed into her usual outfit. There was a strange warm feeling in the pit of her belly but she ignored it. In a matter of moments she was standing in front of her father, who looked very cross with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata! This is the third day in a row we've had to wake you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry father.\" Hinata winced slightly. Partially at his scolding, but mostly at the warmth in her stomach getting hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrogant human...\" Whispered a soft voice. But only Hinata seemed to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was getting hotter. \"I have been lenient with you Hinata! But my patience grows thin! You have brought nothing but disgrace to us as of late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistreats you out of his own weakness and shame...\" Murmured the voice, which grew steadily louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat was beginning to turn into pain. Hinata clutched her stomach. Sweat was dripping down her forehead. \"F-father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic!\" Mimicked the no longer soft voice, which Hinata could now hear as clearly as her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't take it anymore. It felt like hot magma was swirling around in her body. Did this have something to do with accepting Anne into her body? Hinata looked at her hand and to her horror noticed black claws had punctured through her fingers like paper. Hinata hid her hand before her father could notice and turned to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family didn't stop her.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n\"W-what's happening to m-me?\" Hinata had managed to run into the woods outside of her family's mansion. Her sweat was like drops of hot lava pouring out of her body. Something under her skin was growing, painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she collapsed on the ground. Her clothes were beginning to tear as her whole body began to swell. Just above her butt and at the base of her spine, a tail was protruding from her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gritted her teeth in pain, which were now sharp as daggers. Under her soft human flesh was a hard jagged set of links. It was almost like someone had inserted chain mail where her muscles would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bones were becoming tougher and added to her ever growing physique which ripped her clothes in half. Black claws ripped out of her toes and fingers, red blood dripped from their sharpened points. With her clothes removed, Hinata was able to see that the 'seal' that had been placed on her stomach had spread it's way up her body like an infection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a balloon being pushed to its limits, Hinata felt cramped and about to explode. Her face had become more like a snout while a large light purple tail had tore a opening out of her back like. It was almost like she was in a tiny Hinata suit while a mighty dragon took shape beneath her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit a breaking point. With a roar that caused the ground below to rumble, her skin ripped apart. A large purple wingless dragon stood over the mass of human remains on the ground. Tears of pain rolled down Hinata's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurm. I had no idea you were so young. All humans look so alike, but perhaps this will work to my advantage.\"</span></div></div>",

And w-why did this...happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA manifestation of the magnificent dragon princess towered over Hinata. Despite the ninja's new size, she was but a tiny house cat in comparison to the giant tiger that was Anne. Hinata was under the height of the trees so she feared someone would notice Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, no one can see you but me unless I allow it. I've been watching you...Hinata is your name correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare moment of defiance Hinata roared at the mountainous shade. \"You did this didn't you!? Change me back, I never agreed to this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne glared to Hinata. \"I could honestly care less about what you want human! You offered me a home and I accepted. I will not leave until I am fully healed or am given no other choice! It's not my fault that your are so weak that you can barely control the blessing I've granted you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I did this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne gave an annoyed look to Hinata's confused look. \"Obviously! Did you really think I would grant you the beautiful form of a dragon if I had no choice? The bearer of a dragon can manipulate the forms of both a dragon and human if they train hard enough. However, you may not get the chance. Once I heal which should be a matter of days, I will leave you and take my powers with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...good! I didn't ask for this! Tell me how to return to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great dragon shook her head. \"Such arrogance and self-entitlement. Just like every other human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shade disappeared before Hinata could stop her. She was alone. Stuck as a giant dragon. What would her friends say? Her family...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please...I'm sorry. T-this just took me by surprise...Please, c-can you please tell me how to get to normal again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence. Hinata gave a sad sigh. \"Very well...Hinata...Since you've asked nicely. I will help you. Picture yourself as you truly are. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had the image of her human self in her mind, though her own faults somewhat disgusted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus! Don't alter it, it needs to be your true self! Now bring that image into the pit of your stomach. Let it consume you like the red hot flames of the dragon did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt herself shrinking. Almost like she was cooling down. It was working. The strong purple scales of Hinata's dragon form flaked off her skin as the pale human flesh of her true self returned underneath. Eventually, she stood naked in the middle of the forest relieved to be back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Anne...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, at least you have decency to show gratitude when it's required...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gathered her destroyed clothing and returned back to her house, hoping no one would see her...</span></div></div>",

Soon, a new set of clothes was on her body, not unlike Anbu armor, but more lightweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser inspection revealed it to be made of fine, purple scales, that felt...attached to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" asked Hinata. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a type of hide that mimics clothing,\" Anne explained, sounding tired. \"It took some effort to make, so be grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, thank you Anne.\" Hinata said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was a little pleased, but said nothing.

Members of the Hy\u016bga clan muttered amongst each other discussing the clan's inheritor's sudden leave. Thankfully many were too distracted with each other to notice the naked girl walking through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such vermin. Gathering in the corners gossiping like a bunch of rats. How can your clan stand them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried talking to the mouthy dragoness using only her mind as to not give herself away. \"T-they serve a purpose. Each of them do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. My flight's leaders would strike anyone down for such talk. Leaders should not be questioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, y-you have your way. W-we have ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata?\" Said Hanabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata screamed in surprise. Hanabi had merely opened the door to her room only to find her older sister walking around naked. All the gossiping ninjas turned at the noise and started laughing. Hinata blushed and covered herself as best as she could, running to her room in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smooth.\" Whispered Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was at least alone in her room, Hinata quickly put on some fresh clothes and collapsed on the bed with relief. It had been an eventful morning to say the least, her father was probably going to kill her for running away like that and everyone was laughing at seeing her walk around completely naked. Here she was, forced to randomly change into a giant dragon every so often with no way to control. It sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it, it's only for a few days at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dark corners of a musky bar sat a tall dark clothed man. Amongst the black hat and scarf illuminated two red eyes staring at the drink on the table in front of him with disgust. Dancing women seemed only to add to his annoyance. He picked up the cup of alcohol and sniffed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can humans drink such sludge?\" He snarled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly two burly men came through the saloon doors. It seemed they were looking for someone. One turned to the black garbed man in the corner and led his partner to the sulking figure. Both grabbed a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we're late boss. Jimmy got us lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the heavily armed newcomers seemed friendly, the dark man was not. He glared at them from under his black straw hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, gentlemen. What were my orders to you or did you forgot that as well as our meeting location?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...Trap the dragon. Leave the rest to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" He rose from his seat. He must have been a good seven feet tall. The bar went silent. \"And what did you two do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man stammered. \"B-but boss I thought w-we were supposed to kill it! I mean d-dragon skin's worth a lot-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere there had been a rugged face was a flapping tongue. The tall man had sliced the hired goon's head off from the jaw up with his hand alone. A woman screamed and the bar quickly began to clear out. The other hired man looked terrified as he took a knife out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make me sick...human barbaric scum like you. You have no right to exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stay back! I'm w-warning you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud scream followed by a sickening ripping sound. Only the tall dark man exited the bar. Red blood covered his black business suit, his right glove was painted in the gooey liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if human skin sells well, you disgusting piece of trash.\" He looked in the distance as his straw hat blew off his head, revealing a greasy black head of medium length hair. \"She can't hide forever. I will find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I just streaked across the entire house...in front of everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still on that? I had to admit, that was pretty humorous. I've always wondered why you humans even bothered to wear clothes. We dragons make fine without.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed. Today was just not a good day. She just wanted to stay in her room and be alone. Maybe even figure out how to control changing her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not go out into the woods again and practice? Or are you just being lazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had just about enough of Anne's smart comments. But before she could reply there came a knock on the door. It was...</span></div></div>",

Surrender before the damage becomes permanent.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked into the black eyes of a shadowy version of herself, the result of a forbidden jutsu she had stumbled across in her family's treasury. It had taken all the courage she could muster to read from the scroll, but now the training it offered required something more than bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp of air, Hinata charged at the shadow. She seemed to pass through it like it was made of mist. Her face was greeted by the taste of dirt as she felt the shadow step on her back, posing for victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Admirable. But misguided. Your attempts at attacking me were more impressive at the start of our fight.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wanted to tell the shadow she had only lost her edge because she was tired, but she knew even if she was at full strength there would be no way to damage this thing. She felt the hand press at the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Game over. For today.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt a cold sensation at the back of her neck and the shadow vanished. A presence entered her mind, something that could speak in her thoughts. It sounded the same as the shadow she had been fighting just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I grow tired of these pointless exercises. You said you would release me.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you make me stronger,\"Hinata replied mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seem to ponder Hinata's response for a moment. \"<i>It's true, you are the heir to the Hyuga clan, and also true you are the one who found me trapped within the scroll. Were it anyone else, I would have turned them into ash. But at the rate you're going, you'll never succeed in mastering the hidden jutsu of the Gentle Fist.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata flinched. \"I refuse to believe that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Believe it, Hyuga. We need only look at your last attempt to best me. Charging right at me without grace or form. That's something only an elephant would do.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <b>promised </b>me you would teach me the secret Hyuga arts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had at last found the strength to rise from the ground. Glancing around the training grounds, she found no one watching her. Every time she had these conversations in her head, she worried that someone was listening in on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You will learn nothing continuing as you are and I don't have the time or patience to continue to train you. You need to learn to be more gentle if you're to succeed in the simple task of hitting me.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing more gentle was a complaint Hinata never thought she'd hear. If anything her father would tell her the exact opposite. But every attack against her shadow clone resulted in passing through it, like it was nothing. Hinata sighed. She needed to learn this jutsu if she wanted to become useful in the coming battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how? How do I be more gentle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Offer me your body. I will mold it into a form more ideal for training of this caliber. It will be a unique sort of training, one that you will have to practice every second of every day.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata paused in her limp home. The shadow from the scroll was essentially a trapped demon. She had agreed to give up her body as a temporary host, similar to many of the tailed beasts. No one in the Hyuga clan knew what this thing was, only that it was dangerous and deserved to be locked up. Making a deal in exchange for freedom was one thing, but making a deal to surrender her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Choose or I will leave you.</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, we're being paid a fortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your gambling debts?\" Naruto snarked, only to be hit upside the head.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As far as missions go, this was an important one for Hinata Hyuuga. For starters, this was her first solo mission, a chance to really prover herself on her own ever since she made chuunin, and secondly, she got wind that her dear Naruto-kun was coming back to the village soon and she wanted him to be impressed with her so much, so as soon as she heard this opportunity, she jumped on it as soon as she could. It was rather routine, simply protecting a caravan of a rather wealthy family. She did run into some trouble along the way, a few shinobi who belonged to no nation attempted to rob the caravan, but it was nothing she couldn't handle. The enemy was disposed of, the caravan was secure and the family was safe. After accepting their thanks and bowing to pay her respects, she departed the estate and set off for Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was making her way through the woods near the road where the caravan was attacked. As she leaped form branch to branch, a little gleam caught her eye. Quickly leaping down, she found a lacquered box with a little latch in the front. Thinking back, she did remember that during the attack, something did fall out. She tentatively picked it up and broke off the lock that secured the latch and popped it open. As she looked in the velvet interior she found nothing but a simple folded piece of paper. When Hinata unfolded it, there was nothing on it but a simple seal, one of which she had never seen before, surrounded by circles of complex kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Now what kind of a seal is this? And why was it stored in such an expensive looking box?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could wonder any further about her mysterious find, the paper started to tremble in her hands. Looking at it she could see the circles of kanji start to light up in sequence before the main seal in the center flashed a blinding light and before she knew it, a powerful force knocked her to the ground. A few seconds later, Hinata quickly got back up on her feet, her kunoichi mind on high alert, and activated her byakugan to search for any enemies. However, no one was around, save for her, and she did not feel particularly harmed in any way. Hinata shrugged, drawing the conclusion that whatever that seal was, was probably just a fluke. She folded the paper and put it in her pocket, deciding that she would ask Lady Tsunade about it when she got back to Konoha. In the meantime, there was a town not too far from here, it would probably be best to stock up on some supplies and get a meal before she set out for home. With that, she took off, leaving the lacquer box open on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way to town\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata walked down one of the many dusty roads in Konoha, a rather morose expression on her pretty young face, as the afternoon slowly progressed to twilight. It was only a week ago that she was assigned to her team and already she could tell she was the odd man out. Kiba was loud and brash but he and his partner already had a impressive if not simple grasp of his families techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino on the other hand was almost as silent as could be, but underneath that stoic exterior was an impressive intellect maybe not as impressive as Shikamaru but it was definitely there. Lastly there was their teacher Kurenai-sensei, she was new to the world of Jounin but Hinata could tell that the red eyed woman was very talented, and while she was glad to have such a kind woman as her teacher she knew one other thing for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, Hyuga Hinata, was a weakling, what's worse her teacher continuously coddled her. She was never going to get stronger at this rate. Hinata reached into the pocket of her jacket and pulled out one of her most beloved possessions. In her hand was a small figurine of, of all things, a hippopotamus. The little river horse was a gift that her late uncle gave her on a trip to the zoo, it was the last thing they did together before, the incident with Kumo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before that day hippos were her favorite something about the heavy semi-aquatic mammals drew her to them, they seemed unimpressive but in the land they were from they were one of the most feared animals around. Something about that made her wish she was strong like them, then maybe 'he' would notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata snaps up like coming out of a dream at the voice calling to her. Mentally bemoaning her lack of focus, knowing it could get her killed in the field, she turned as saw a street vendor stand, not uncommon in the village but a little odd this time of year, and sitting at it was an elderly gentleman, wearing a clean but simple kimono, his paper white eyebrows knitted in focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help but notice that headband around your neck, that means your a ninja doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps in the loosest sense of the word, she thought to herself. But nodded all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, I bet a fine upstanding ninja like yourself would appreciate a little something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man reaches under his booth and pulls out a scroll. Even in the fading light Hinata could read the kanji, inner beast style jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This my dear girl is a rare ninja technique scroll, it is said that those who use these techniques can use the power of their inner animal, it is said that every person has one and that no two are alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pauses for thought, her hand holding her beloved figurine tightly, it seemed almost to good to be true. But on the other hand it sounded eerily similar to Kiba's family's techniques so it might not be so farfetched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're having trouble deciding, understandable so I'll tell you what, you buy it now and I can guarantee this one time price of 20 mon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata almost stumbles over from the shock, even the ninja libraries couldn't go that low for their fees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tick tock, my dear I've got other business to consider do you want it or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata took one last glance at her figurine and made her decision.</span></div></div>",

It was then she saw the large bulbous objects next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the...Eggs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropped against were five large eggs, each the size of a small child. Hinata realized she was actually sitting in a nest, and a big one at that. She groaned as she tried to stand, only realizing now her legs were wounded. Blood seeped out from the rips in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could solve the mystery of her injured state, the alcove she found herself in rumbled as a terrifying roar echoed in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was t-that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of quakes rocked the nest. Hinata activated her Byakugan and peered into the distance, only to gasp at the sight of a massive creature lumbering in her direction. She had never seen a monster quite like this and it reminded her of a tailed beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried to hide from the creature as it sped towards her, using one of the eggs as cover. Within minutes, it arrived and let out a deafening roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata held her breath as she tried to think of some sort of jutsu that could save her from ending up in the belly of this monster. It looked like a giant lizard, with an over-sized head and tail. Its arms were comically small, though its legs more than made up for it in power. Hinata was more preoccupied staring at the many teeth in its mouth, each the size of a knife. It was staring right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please be a dream,\" Hinata muttered, still having no idea how she ended up in such a situation or what she was doing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster leered in close to her and began to sniff the eggs.

She then turned to treating her wounded legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What am I doing here?\" she asked herself. She closed her eyes and tried to recall the last thing in her memory. \"I remember some sort of mission with Naruto and Kiba. B-But I don't even remember leaving the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she wasn't in danger of being eaten, she studied her environment a little bit more thoroughly. The nest was in a jutting cave off in some mountain. There was a dense forest surrounding her, with trees unlike any she had ever seen. Their branches were long and reached high into the sky. The floral was all exotic to her, matching none of the plant types she knew from memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata observed the surrounding perimeter with her eyes. She was in some sort of jungle with various creatures she didn't recognize all over what appeared to be some sort of valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were in bad shape. She was sure she sprained the both of them, from a fall if she was reading the injury properly. Other than that, she was famished. She wasn't sure just how long she had been asleep, though by the quality of her clothes she guessed it had only been a few days. There were no other clues as to why she was here or what mission she had been on.

As one of them stood upright, Hinata could see that it was almost as big as she was. It crept up to her, its eyes not fully open, and sniffed her. The smell of egg clogged her nose as she patted the baby on the snout. It reacted by yelping as its brothers continued to break from their containment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Hinata was surrounded by the siblings, all licking her out of curiosity. She giggled at their behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop it. That tickles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar in the distance signaled that their mother was returning. Hinata tensed up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster came back to the nest, only with a smaller creature in its bloody mouth. Its children all squealed in delight as they waited patiently for their mother to deposit the animal's body on the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe babies then attacked the lifeless body of another lizard like a swarm of locusts. They messily devoured the carcass in a grizzly display of blood and gore. Hinata winced and crawled away from the site. The mother took noticed to this and leaned in to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, no...\" Hinata raised her hands in a pitiful form of defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster used it's head to gently push Hinata in the direction of the dead lizard. Hinata had the sudden realization as to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm one of your babies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother continued to push Hinata into the corpse. She wasn't going to take not for an answer. With the dead animal's tough scaly exterior, she knew there was no way her human teeth put puncture the flesh to appease the mother. She suddenly remembered a jutsu that Kiba often used in battle which could aid her enough her to stop worrying the creature. However, Hinata was not pleased to consider eating the raw flesh of a fresh kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, Hinata considered trying to make a break for it.

Her legs would not last ten yards before giving out. \"Think, Hinata...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only jutsu that could help her here was one Kiba used in his bestial form that she recalled him teaching her team during one of their meetups. The jutsu was meant to grant the user claws and sharper teeth for attacking. Kiba probably would have never considered using the jutsu for eating meat. Hinata leaned over to do the hand signs and felt a sudden rage pass over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chakra flowed through her body, Hinata could feel her teeth harden and grow. The new points dug slightly into her tongue and she found she had to open her mouth slightly to prevent biting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up her hands as her nails expanded out into claws. Hinata clenched her fists and could feel their sharpness. She could rend flesh with ease using her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to remember to be careful not to scratch,\" she said to herself as she stepped up to the dead body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother continued to watch her patiently as she took her first bite of the killed beast. Hinata gagged as she swallowed her first mouthful of raw meat. It tasted like copper mixed with a sweaty sock. Blood from the meat dripped down her chin as she took her second bite. It only took three until she was full and couldn't eat anymore, but that seemed to satisfy the mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Ugh,\" she muttered, as she fell back into the nest with the rest of the children. \"I don't feel so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightheaded feeling passed over her mind. Her  legs were beginning to feel like jello and she knew she wouldn't be able to stand. Hinata deduced that it had to do with healing and she needed more sleep for energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe babies were curling on top of each other as Hinata used a few as a pillow.

I should have run out of chakra by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt a little more awaken than she did before, with strength in her legs returning enough to stand.

From her perspective, they were as big as tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother growled when she saw Hinata walk as she normally did. Her pose was completely different from the babies and it was obvious that she was standing out. Even the other babies pushed her around, like she was a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not good enough, huh?\" Hinata wandered aloud, hoping the mother wasn't the kind of creature to kill off a crippled child out of survival and pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about how she could fix the problem. It wasn't so much that her posture was bad, as she could mimic the babies well enough. It all had to do with the tail. The tail was keeping the babies balanced so they could lean over and walk more naturally. Hinata had no such appendage and had to stumble without something on her but to balance her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was going to continue this disguise, she needed a tail.

This was followed by a ripping sound. The sensation of her spine lengthening traveled all the way down her back.

There was only one jutsu that she could think of which would result in expanding her entire body and that was the Multi-Size Jutsu. While she had certainly never practiced it before, she knew the hand signs and general technique while studying under her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crept away from the nest to a quiet area in the jungle. When she was alone, she did the jutsu, pouring only a little chakra into it to ensure that the expansion was enough to bring her up to the height of the other babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata lurched upwards as her bones lengthened. She felt her clothes grow tighter from her swelling body. If she was standing upright, she would have been almost twice her normal height as a human. Instead, crouching over, she was about the same size as a typical human adult. She moaned slightly as she got bigger and bigger, almost not wanting to stop but knowing the mother would suspect something if she got too large too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally ceased the jutsu when she was significantly bigger than the other babies. She tugged at her constricting jacket and pants, both riding up in her joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow,\" she muttered, adjusting to her new perspective. \"I feel...Powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was still a far cry from the mother monster, Hinata felt like she could handle herself better in these wildernesses. But nothing could prepare her for what awaited her and the other babies today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, she...</span></div></div>",

She cooed at the sight of Hinata's new size, pleased that she was apparently catching up with the others. The day went on as it normally did, with the family. The mother kept a close on her children for a time as they traveled through the jungle, searching for both food and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they went further than they had ever gone before as a group, the mother stopped and did something odd. She nudged Hinata and the other hatchlings forward and turned around back in the jungle. The babies looked at each other confused and scrambling around to follow their mother. Hinata stayed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Maybe she's testing us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter minutes of waiting, Hinata determined that the mother wasn't coming back. The other babies took to turning to her for direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't look at me. I'm just as lost as you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the hatchlings weren't taking no for an answer. They began to claw at her, expecting her to led the on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. We'll look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the forest path, she used her Byakugan to find the way back to the mother. But along the way, something caught her eyes. Something out of place within the wild jungle. Curious, she decided to lead her band of hatchlings towards the disturbance. In an opening of the forest, Hinata found what could only be described as a camp site that was torn to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, my. What happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatchlings immediately got curious and looked around the ripped tent and stomped campfire. Hinata looked around herself, giving the area a sniff with her heightened smell from her continued use of the beast jutsu. She determined that the camp was abandoned after getting attacked by some creature, looking to be almost as big as the mother. She couldn't tell, however, if the inhabitants of the camp were still alive or even from Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvestigating the downed tent, Hinata made a new discovery...</span></div></div>",

Both Sunagakure and Otogakure caused so much for the village hidden in the leaf, mostly because of Orochimaru, but they were amazed that Konohagakure didn\u2019t try to get revenge. That\u2019s a good thing because neither one of those villages wanted to create a war over something that was someone else\u2019s fault. With Gaara being fully healed, it was time for him to start missions again, and with his change in mind, he would not go crazy against his own team mates like he did when he was younger. With the Kazekage dead, Sunagakure was placed under temporary leadership, and Gaara was starting or trying to show that he was starting to change. While he was waiting for the chance to truly show that he had change, the time to step up came first, when some ninjas from the Village Hidden in the Rain were seen in the vicinity of the Country of Wind. Gaara was put in charge to go and see what and why they were doing in the Country. If he couldn\u2019t make them leave by talking it out, then he would have no choice but to use drastic measures. Gaara decided to go by himself on this mission because it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to fulfill it, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara left Sunagakure\u2019s walls and headed out in the desert, in the midst of a huge sand storm, but he was dressed for the part in a black hood to cover his eyes from the incoming sand.  When he finally came upon the ninjas for the Rain Village, they were very far to the south of the Wind Country, located near the ocean. The ninjas had shovels in their hands and they looked to be digging for something. Gaara hid himself, the best he could, turning his body into sand and snuck close to get a hear from the ninjas and try to gather information on what they were doing. \u2018\u2019It has to be here, around here somewhere.\u2019\u2019 One of the ninjas said as he leaned against his shovel. \u2018\u2019The rumors said that the temple was buried somewhere near the ocean and the sand, so it has to be around here somewhere.\u2019\u2019 Another one said in a huff. Gaara reformed behind one of the diggers with his arms crossed and stripped of his desert cloak. He glared at the ninjas and ask, \u2018\u2019what are you guys doing here?\u2019\u2019 He asked them, causing the ninja he was behind to drop his shovel and fall forward in fear. He crawled backwards to his friend. \u2018\u2019Y-you\u2019re G-gaara of the sand. We\u2019re supposed to watch out for you.\u2019\u2019 One of the ninjas said in fear and Gaara just kept glaring at them both. \u2018\u2019Let\u2019s get out here! Now!\u2019\u2019 The male ninjas said as they quickly disappeared into the water of the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara watched them disappear and rolled his eyes, that was too easy, and what the heck were they looking for? The male walked over to one of the shovels and looked it over, just a normal shovel, same as the other one. If there was something there, Gaara could definitely find it. He threw the shovel to the side and stepped back a few feet from where the men were digging. He closed his eyes, focused his chakra, and lifted his arms, moving a huge portion of sand below him to the sides. From what he did move, he started to see something buried in the sand. \u2018\u2019\u2026..\u2019\u2019 He walked over to it and moves a huge portion again from around the building. When he moved enough, Gaara could see what it was, a huge temple that had figures of what looked like winged lizards outside the huge double door building. ''Guess this was what they were looking for.'' Gaara said to himself, trying to decide what to do next. </span></div></div>",

She was REALLY going to hate herself for this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did as she'd told him, Ino pounced on Naruto and sat on his face, His nose sticking in her rear. That was when What Ino intended to do for him to prove she could trust him struck Naruto: seeing if he'd willingly go along with this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sniffy sniffy Naruto!\" Ino laughed.

She gripped his cheeks with her paws and leaned in close to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your such a darling, Naruto.

Her hands and feet were much more pawlike, complete with pads, She had a long skunk tail as well, and her nose and mouth were even a muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed in a purple bra, a golden neck choker, two golden armbands with matching cuffs on the wrist with a ruby in the middle of them and lavender, see-through, baggy pants while her feet were bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's jaw dropped. INO?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic skunk-girl Ino rubbed her eyes, giving Naruto the opertunity to dive down to the bottom of the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk-Ino then blinked when she noticed something on the table and picked it up. Huh? Clothes? Tiny clothes? They looked like doll clothes, almost. But why would...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes landed on the bowl of Miso Ramen she'd been about to eat. She might not know what the tiny thing was, but she did know where to look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know where you are, little thing!\" She thought, grinning deviously. She picked up the bowl in both hands before opening her mouth and slirpping. Gulping down large amounts of noodles and broth, when she drank up the last of it, that was when she felt something else land on her tounge and quickly closed her mouth, trapping her \"prize\" inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk-Ino then giggled as she felt whatever was in her ramen move around inside her mouth, and decided to play with it with her tongue flipping it around until she felt something hard press against her tongue and she then realized that whatever is in her mouth was a male and she was loving every second of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Ino's mouth, Naruto was terrified as he was no in the Skunk-girl giantess' mouth and he wrapped his naked body around her tongue as the muscle moved all around her mouth.

He was battered against her large teeth and hard ridges, swished between her cheeks, and of course, sucked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her room and locking it, the girl decided to finally see what she was toying with and held out a hand before spitting into it. But when she saw the tiny creature in it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeewwww!\" She cried, flinging Naruto away, \"Gross! A bug was in my mouth?!\" Then she glared at him, lifting up her foot and filling Naruto's vision with the paw pads of her toes and sole,  \"Why you little...I'll smash you good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped, then dodged as the massive foot slammed down where he had been seconds prior. He ran, desprite to avoide the skunk-girl's big feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get back here! I just want to make you go pop under my soles!\" The skunk-girl laughed, seeing the tiny creature's obvious terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, Naruto kept his gaze behind him in order to avoide the big feet out to kill him, but as a result, he failed to look where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crash, Naruto collided with the wall and dazed himself. When it cleared, Naruto let out a scream at the two black-furred, bare feet resting menacingly in front of him before one raised in the air and hovered over him, ominous as a guillotine blade, the toes wiggling as if waving goodbye to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Got you! Don't worry bug; this won't hurt a bit! Here comes the FOOO~OOOT!\" the giantess sing-songed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giantess slowly lowered her foot over him, in blind panic, Naruto began rubbing his hands in small circles against the warm, silky soft pads on the foot, and even nuzzling his own face against it for good measure, regardless of how demeaning it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surprised gasp escaped Ino's mouth, her face turning to the side as an eye closed and lips twitched at the sides; desperate not to burst out laughing. \"Huh? H-h-hey! C-c-cut that out...it tickles! Still...it feels....really good.\" she moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of the little thing making her feel good, Ino (reluctantly) pulled her foot away from the bug, then snatched it between her thumb and index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as the gigantic, skunk-girl version of Ino carried him to her desk, took out a magnifying glass and then used it to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You're no bug...\" she muttered, studying him closely, then she smirked. \"Cute, though...not a bad body either.\" she nodded as she looked over Naruto's frame. \"Hm, eight, eight and a half out of ten. At least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped as Ino smirked down as him, then took a tiny jewelry box off the dresser and placing it right below him! Naruto didn't get much time to scream, before she released her grip, dropping him into the tiny box and pressed down on him with her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, Ino stroked her cheek. Odd little thing...but she swore there was something familir about it. Her eyes lit up and she rushed over to her closet and pulled out an old, illustrated children's book she hadn't even bothered with in years and opened it up It'a a before her eyes widened.\"I knew it!\" She said excitedly. \"I thought they were only in little kid fantasy stories but...it's a Human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno walked back over and grinned down at Naruto,  \"Oh...I'm gonna have <u><i><b>LOTS</b></i></u> of fun with you!\"</span></div></div>",

Like your policy buddy.\" the toad said with a grin when Ino walked up to Gamakichi and handed him the note to her mom and dad. The orange amphibian gaped at the site of the skunk-girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...what's with her?\" Gamakichi asked  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Naruto gave the toad a quick bonk on the head to get his attention back so Ino wouldn't feel self-conscious over what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know yet. That note's to her fokes to let them know what's going on so they don't worry.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe son of Gamabunta nodded, realizing that being sure to keep this quiet was also part of why he was getting paid up front. He took the letter and hopped off as Naruto opened the bunker again so they could get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok Ino?\" Naruto asked as he handed Ino a hooded cloak and she put it on. She nodded and affectionatly rubbed his cheek with her paw. As soon as the two left the bunker, Naruto closed it again, leaving no trace of the intrence as it melded seemlessly with the alleyway wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. Secret Passageway-expert, where to now?\" Ino asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to you. between how well I know the back alleys and passageways hidden all over the village and the maditory parkour training they give in the accademy, we can head anywhere you want Ino.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere I want huh?\" Ino mulled over before she grinned at him \"Alright. if its anywhere I want...take me to your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i><u>\"HUH?!\"</u></i></b> Naruto cried, his face going red from embaressment and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno laughed \"You heard me Darling, I. Want. To. Go. To. Your. Place.\" she said with a smile on her muzzle, he was too cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-well if you want to...\" Naruto pulled at his jumpsuit's collar and gulped \"F-f-f-fallow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at how flusterd he was, Ino followed him and they soon made it to his apartment. Ino had to hold Naruto's hands to keep them steady as they were shaking too bad for him to get his key in the lock. Once the door was open, Ino stepped into the small apartment, her first reaction to the room was that of surprise. She had expected that Naruto lived in a pigsty or something, but the apartment room was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6almost cozy. Sure, the floor needed to be swept and there was a picture of Sasuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head that had a couple of kunai stabbed into it, but otherwise it seemed like a normal house. She slipped out of her ninja sandals. She couldn't see anything from the hallway, so she slowly walked a little further until she came to a large door on her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my room,\" he said. Nodding, she opened the door and flipped on the light. Immediately, her eyes were met with the sight of dozens of scrolls, books, and wadded up pieces of paper on his bed and on the ground. A few ramen cups sat on the floor, and it was painfully obvious that he hadn't done any cleaning in at least a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked at him. \"I didn't know you studied,\" she teased, causing him to scratch the back of his head sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I was just reading up on seals and stuff. Ero-sennin said if I learned the basics, he'd teach me how to do the cool stuff later. It kind of come natrually to me for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond girl glanced back at the scrolls and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Seals, huh?' she thought, scratching her head slightly. She'd learned how to seal small things like weapons and clothing from her dad, but anything larger than a meter was out of the question. She briefly considered teaching him how to do it but decided to take a look at the rest of the apartment first. Ino turned around and walked the rest of the way down the hall until she came to another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in here?\" Naruto looked up to side as Ino opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the bathroom. It's not that dirty, I don't think...\" She turned on the light and smiled. While it certainly wasn't the cleanest bathroom in the world, it was definitely better than what she expected. She turned around and walked towards the final opening at the end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis room was easily the biggest in the entire house, being both the kitchen and the living room. A small stove and refrigerator sat in the corner closest to them, and a small table with a large basket on top was set up right in the middle. Numerous plants sat on a shelf next to the icebox, causing her to raise an eyebrow at the genin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardening?\" she asked, motioning towards the pots. He crossed his arms across his chest defensively and shrugged, his cheeks pink from embarrassment. Ino had to admit, he'd done a good job with the plants, mabye she could convince her parents to give him a part-time job at the Yamanaka flower shop... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, she turned back to finish her investigation of the room. There wasn't much left; a couch sat against the opposite corner of the wall, and a small TV rested on a black apple crate. \"Not bad. I don't mind crashing here until I'm normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b><i><u>\"HUH?!\"</u></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno giggled, \"I said I want to stay with you.\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned as red as that weird super-chakra she'd seen him use in the Chunin exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a-are you s-s-sure...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, why do you ask? Hiding something from me?\" Ino teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not that, I just...its the first time I've had anyone be here with me, much less a goddes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno giggled. Naruto really was too much of aa sweetie for his own good. She sat on the couch and pat the spot next to her, clearly wanting him to join her. Still blushing enough to put any shade of red Hinata had ever turned to utter shame, Naruto sat down next to her. Once he had, Ino leaned against him and sighed blissfully. If being a skunk-girl was the price for such a sweet-heart to be with her, then she'd accept being this way forever.  While she DID want to be normal again, the thought of what her and Naruto's kids would look like if she was still a humanoid she-skunk made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You alright Ino?\" Naruto asked, his blush having faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno just smiled happily, brushing his face gently with her tail, her fur tickling his nose and teesing him with the threat of a sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to worry about...its just you're a good guy and I'm feeling happy right now.\" Then she kissed him gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto found the whole thing pleasant. Ino's fur didn't get in the way, it actually made the hot kiss even warmer. The jinchuuriki then kissed her back, wrapping his arms around her furry body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right then that Ino decided, she was going to keep Naruto. Either as a pet, a posession, or as a person...she wasn't going to let him be taken from her. She breafly wondered if she could combind her skunk-spray with jutsus to see if that was possable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<i>Dear mon and Dad,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust wanted to let you know I've got a bit of an issue going on for me right now and a friend is helping me through it, so I won't be home for a while, don't worry, I'm NOT running away or anything like that but...well...you'd flip if you saw my problem, you can tell what it is just from looking at me. And given how the village has a history of \"shoot first, ask later\" thanks to Danz\u014d Shimura, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, I don't want to be a problem for you. Don't worry, I trust the friend who's helping me through the situation I'm in and they're too much of a good person to let anything happen to me. Don't flip out...I PROMISE I'll be back home and expalin EVERYTHING when what I'm going through is over with so you don't need to call in every ANBU agent in the village to look for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove you now and forever,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did have Ino's parents concerned. What was wrong with their daughter? As the toad poofed away, They wondered where their little girl could be. They knew the only two toad-summoners in the village since the Forth Hokaage's death were Jiraya and Naruto...and Ino would never go near the Sanin unless it was to castrate him.</span></div></div>",

The clone nodded and rushed off to go greet Konohamaru, keeping the grandson of the late third hokage busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Ino sighed and let go of Naruto  \"Thanks Naruto...I'd just die if anyone saw me like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded in sympathy, he had times when he wanted to avoid people himself due to his Jinchuriki status, but Ino didn't need to know that. He glnced at Ino. Her hair and eyes were the same, but her body was covered in black and white fur. Her hands and feet were much more pawlike, complete with pads, She had a long skunk tail as well, and her nose and mouth even became a muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Ino...to tell the truth, your fur's pretty soft. Come on, use a transformation jutsu to get your own appearance back, and don't worry...I promise I'll help you get back to normal no matter what!\" Naruto told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno felt a blush rise under her fur. He promises? She knew Naruto took his oaths seriously, the only way to keep him from seeing one through no matter how long it took him to do so was if he was dead. She smiled, knowing she was in good hands. She took the time to let her eyes trail over his form and had to confess he was as good looking as the fourth hokage. As a frequent shopper herself, Ino knew how much a new outfit could change the way a person looked...but this...with how the two-and-a-half years had been good to him added onto his new look, he made the Sasuke Ino had always envisioned look drab. His body truly bulked up, a thing that was the first noticeable thing to see when you look at him now, Naruto still wore the same ninja sandals and headband, but he now he wore black turtle neck shirt with a flak jacket that resembled a Jounin jacket colored in black and outlined in orange trimmings; black pants that had kunai pouch strapped onto his right leg with the back hip pouch still on the right backside of his hip, which was colored dark orange with leaf symbol stitched on the flap; and over the jacket and turtle neck was a trench coat that resembled that worn by the fourth hokage, Namikaze Minato, but this one was dark orange with black flames rising from the bottom with the swirl symbol in the middle of his back with his turtle neck shirt's sleeves coming out the short sleeve of the trench coat and were strapped at the top and bottom of his forearms with a pair of metal knuckled black fingerless gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Naruto had turned around, Ino quickly wrapped her tail around Naruto like a furry boa constrictor and used it to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Naruto...and I'm sorry for the spray...\" she said as she let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, water under the bridge. now come on, where was the place you got that perfume? We find that place, we know just where to start looking to change you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was told they were going out of business today when I got the perfume yesterday, but I do remember the woman who recomended the perfume I bought. Said after I used it that I'd never worry about smelling bad again...gotta say, she was right, it'll be hard to care about my smell once I get changed back after being a skunk-girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman?\" Naruto asked incredulously before his eyes narrowed suspitiously \"Describe her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had power, a lot of it, it was actually frightening how much I could feel comming off her, she was almost Sanin-level. She wore a pink dress that was over a green kimono top. It was a dress that was for battle as well as everyday uses, she actually pulled the look off so well I was jelouse. She had real unique hair, spiked backwards, cyan in color. Her ears were almost like an elf's, only they were rounded at the end. Her face was really beautiful and her eyes were yellow in color...they were slitted, like a cat's Added on to that, she gave off this feeling of being as much as a prankster as you are. Said her name was Ayeka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ran a hand down his face and moaned. He knew that description. \"Ino...don't say anymore...I know who it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do? How?\" Ino asked before her eyes narrowed in accusation \"Did you set this up so Sakura would be seen as my better?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was, would I hve been surprised to find out you were this way? Knowing that imp, your just the test subject...And I know who the real target is already.\" Naruto said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno had to confess that was a good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better hurry...the one who gave you that perfume's real name is Ryoko, a former pirate I'd met. She's got a hobby that could cause a REAL problem, there's this princess named Ayeka she loves messing with. Their BOTH stying in the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno paled, that was bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick coating of chakra, Ino hid her skunk trates and took on her human form again, even if it was just through the use of a ninjutsu and not actually being returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go!\" Naruto said as they dashed along the rooftops.</span></div></div>",

A guy by the name of Nuishi had filed for someone to find his lost dog, a golden retriever named Oshii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Ino whined about being given such a trivial mission, especially all by herself, but in the end orders were orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno headed towards the old man's house, where she found him sitting and drinking tea. He was a bald old man, he had a somewhat wrinkly face, but friendly gray eyes. He wore a man's kimono, colored orange and white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, are you the one they sent to get my precious Oshii?\" Nuishi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, could you tell me the last time you saw her?\" Ino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three weeks ago. She was digging in the backyard and I sent her to her doghouse for messing up the garden, she never did leave, and I called her plenty.\" he said sadly, starting to ramble. \"She was such a young thing two, barely two years old, fourteen in dog years. She was one of the litter my old dog Nanashi had before she passed, had her since I was your age, as a matter of fact she was a strange stray, had this old collar that dissapeared once she died, but she had it with her before I found her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno sighed impatiently. \"Well, I'll check it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright young lady, I'll just lay down for a nap.\" He said, shuffling inside. Ino headed out back to find  what would've been a well kept yard, aside from various half dug holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were fruit bearing trees, tall, healthy, and well kept, as well as some cosmos plants, and multiple patches of brown land, with cabbage, carrots, and the occasional melon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what Oshii was trying to find...\" Ino said, when she went near the doghouse, which was large enough for her to enter on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ino did enter, she found herself falling from great heights into a giant hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like hours later, Ino awoke. She opened  her eyes and found herself looking at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I fall down a hole? Ino thought to herself, when she noticed a terrible scent. Ino looked and discovered she had fallen on a pile of garbage. \u201cEEW!\u201d Ino yelled, standing as quickly as she could, when she noticed\u2026</span></div></div>",

The girl looked almost exactly like Ino, but her hair was longer, with bangs in the front, and her expression was too carefree, as if she didn't have a worry in the world. Soon, Ino read the wanted poster more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'WANTED: Oshii Inuko, 80,000 Oyr reward' It doesn't say why though, and what are Oyr?

Not only that, but her nails were blackened and her palm was padded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Ino screamed, accidentaly waking someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a drag!

It was a giant sloth that wore a small vest and had its hair done up in a ponytail at the top of its skull. Strangely enough, it sounded and looked just like Shikamaru!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind keeping the noise down, dog? I don't mind you trespassing in my home but at least let me get my sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno feel flat on her butt. \"Y-you're a talking sloth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very observant. Is it my turn now? You must be...a talking rat. No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's happening!? Where a-am I and why am I like this!?\" She started pulling on the yellow fur, it wouldn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sloth sighed. \"You aren't very bright are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno growled at the sloth and yelled at the top of her lungs. \"Shut up! I think I have a right to be confused, you garbage dwelling monkey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sloth put a finger to its lips. \"Alright, alright! Shhh! If you make anymore noise they're gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on over here!?\" Yelled an approaching voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you've done it! Get under some trash, quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall human in traditional samurai armor approached the half asleep sloth. He pointed the large sword he was wielding at the lazy animal as it gave a huge yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again with the noise, Kanji? Me and the other soldiers are tired of investigating every single happening here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not may fault. You jerks just had to have your battle right near my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human glared at Kanji. \"Watch it, beast. What was it this time? Get a nasty bed sore? Fell asleep on a fork?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji looked at the soldier with dazed eyes. \"I saw a mouse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a big mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier knew he was being mocked and jabbed a finger at the sloth-man. \"You listen to me, you animal. You're lucky the commander was kind enough to let you stay here, considering our battle with the rebels. Show some gratitude or we'll beat it into you. Got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir...\" Saluted the sloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier spat on the ground and turned to leave. Kanji waited until he was out of sight before whispering to the trash pile next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the coast is clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your name is Kanji?\" Asked Ino as the two of them walked down the broken back-alleys of an abandoned city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see how dogs got their reputation for hearing well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him angry look but continued. \"Okay then...Where am I exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ushi, or what's left of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ruins around them were vast and maybe once well built. Chipped away stone and blood splattered on the walls suggested that the reason it was abandoned was due to a terrible battle not long ago. The area was dry, like it was sitting right on the edge of a desert. Kanji sighed and started rummaging through some trashcans, eating scraps of remaining food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Muttered the sloth with a half eaten chicken bone in his mouth. \"Want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not! I just want to get out of this place! You still haven't told me where I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, you're in Ushi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell is Ushi!? And why is everything destroyed!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji sighed again. \"You know...this is why I hate women. They ask too many questions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis guy was every bit like Shikamaru! The only difference was he didn't seem to know her at all. Did she fall through some kind of portal where the world was ruled by animals? No that wouldn't make sense...that soldier was human for some reason. Maybe she'd have better luck explaining what her situation was to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look! Let me explain something to you Kanji...\"</span></div></div>",

What the-!?\" She yelled to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the surface of the water, she found that she was entirely alone. There were no animals or people for that matter in sight. With that in mind she decided to brave another look into the murky depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw in the water was her own face...except not quite! Her mouth had gotten more bulbous and wider. Her nose was also flatter, her nostrils were clearly visible now. Strangest of all, her ears had somehow extended slightly and were peaking out of her blond hair. In fact her entire body seemed to have gained 50 pounds of fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what's happening to me!?\" Ino shrieked, grabbing her ears in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was no mere trick of reflection on the rippling water, these changes were real. Ino was able to look down with her eyes and see her new \"snout\" slowly expanding before her eyes! She was actually changing by the second, into what she didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear gripped her, nothing but pure panic jolted through her mind. What the hell was happening to her? Was she going insane!? Was it something she ate!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...Perhaps it wasn't something she ate but something she......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tea!\" Exclaimed Ino, realizing now what must have happened. \"Why that no good fat little bi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cursing was interrupted by the sounds of ripping. Her now massive butt had ripped through the back of her pants. The changes were not slowing down at all! Coming to the quick conclusion that time was running out, Ino turned and waddled back to Lady Abura's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faster Ino tried to run, the faster the changes seem to take hold. Her overall body fat seemed to increase like air being blown into a balloon. As her hands and feet plumped up, her fingers and toes almost merged together into one massive entity. But it was her stomach and chest area that seemed to be taking the most damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes after starting her sprint her, she felt her blue shirt begin to rip in several places. Plus, her pants weren't doing well in the fight to hold together either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the house was now just a few yards away. Ino was doubly lucky in the fact that the others had already went home for the day. Ino pounded at the front door with her pudgy \"fist\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Came an almost sickening sweet voice on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know darn well who it is, you fat old cow! Open up!\" Replied Ino, as her pants finally snapped off her legs. The insult only seemed to speed the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Abura opened the door and did her best to be surprised. She clearly was enjoying every moment of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Ino! I dismissed your teammates for the day already. You don't have to be here until tomorrow...Oh, I see you got my gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno could feel her shirt strain under the building pressure of her body's added girth. She had to weight at least 300 pounds by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasted no time in barking her command. \"Fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fix what, exactly?\" Smirked the lady. \"You have a big mouth, this only proves it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah! I'd be careful if I were you. You see that flavor of tea was a special brand your teammates found while doing the work YOU earned for them. Can you guess what it does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know!\" Yelled Ino as her shirt finally ripped into pieces, leaving her big and naked. \"Just please, fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Abura sighed. \"Let me give you a hint then...If a person tended to be stubborn and rude, they would probably transform into a donkey. While if a person were gluttonous and greedy, they might become a pig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what has that got to do with me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbura finally realized she would have to spell it out for the girl. \"I told you before...You have a big mouth. Therefore, you're becoming a hippo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno felt around her new snout, noticed that it had extended a good six inches from her face. That's when she realized that old woman was probably telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Make it stop! You can do that can't you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, the tea will run it's course until you come to terms with your faults. There is, however, a way to return to normal temporarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting harder to stand on two feet. \"I'll do anything! Just please tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologize to me for your earlier comment.\" Answered Lady Abura with a \"matter of fact\" tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then...I suppose you'll wallow around like a hippo for weeks until you learn your lesson...\" The old woman turned to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! I'm....I'm sorry, okay!? I didn't mean it! It was just a joke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, in an instant Ino felt the changes all over her body begin to reverse. The mountains of fat on her just were suddenly absorbed. Her mouth receded and her ears returned to normal. Of course, she was still standing naked on the front doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now...That's better isn't it?\" Abura folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened?\" Asked Ino staring at her old form, it was as if nothing had happened at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You apologized, therefore the effects reversed themselves. You see each time you insult someone or 'open that big mouth of yours', you'll begin reverting into the form of a massive hippo. It won't stop until you apologize for your actions to the person DIRECTLY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's so unfair!\" Whined Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have been more mindful of what you said then...Toodle-O.\" Replied Abura, closing her front door on the still naked Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, she tried knocking on the door. But the woman pretended to not hear Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back! Fix this, please! At least can I have some clothes or something!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow Miss. Yaminaka\" Came the woman's final farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno huffed and began her trip home, it would be dark soon and hopefully no one would see her..</span></div></div>",

Who were they to do something like that to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When I see them I'm gonna let them  have it!' the enraged, nude pre-teen thought murderously, imagining herself dealing a 16-hit combo to each and every one of them, save Sasuke and Choji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ino arrived at the modest guest home. It was a bit smaller than a normal house, but the interior more than compensated. It was quite luxurious, with most of the extravagances one could imagine. It was a marvel that half of the things inside even fit through the slim doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, home at last.\" The blonde exhaled, opening the door. No one seemed to be around. Quickly, she dashed upstairs to her room and found her spare outfit. She redressed herself and looked to be certain that no traces of her transformation remained. After she was done, her stomach rumbled none too quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I may as well go and get something to eat.\" Ino said to herself, when there was a knock on her door. \"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest was none other than Sakura Haruno, who looked a bit smug. \"Hello Ino, I see you finally made it home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ino's rage returned, upon her seeing Sakura, she was among the teammates who made that dumb tea! With incredible speed, Ino grabbed the front of Sakura's dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks to you idiots, especially you billboard brow! Why the hell would you and those lame brains Shikamaru and Naruto do something like that to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ino's tirade went on, her body changed back to it's previous form, albeit even more massive, nearly 450 lbs. Not only that, but now she could feel a tail growing near her immense butt. Once again, her clothes were tattered on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn!\" Ino cursed.</span></div></div>",

This little prank was totally worth watching the look on Ino contort in a mixture of disgust and discomfort. The hippo girl quickly tried to cover herself up after the remnants of her new outfit lay sprawled all over the ground. As much as she could watch this all day, she was already late for her plans for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ino.\" Laughed Sakura. \"If you have nothing else to say, I'm due for dinner with the rest of the team at the local ramen bar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno panicked, still hunched over trying to cover herself. \"W-wait! Sakura-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeees?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like trying to cough up a bowling ball, Ino never had to apologize to billboard brow before.

But nothing happened. Sakura had to bite her lower lip to hold in the howling laughter building up in her throat. Ino looked down at her still changing form, her nose was still expanding out in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!?\" Ino cried out in confusion. \"W-why the...? Why isn't it working!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't what working...?\" Snorted Sakura, still trying her hardest not to roll on the floor laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tea! That stupid tea you guys gave me, you-\" Ino caught herself in mid thought of an insult for Sakura. \"J-just never mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno turned and waddled out of the room to be with herself. Sakura couldn't handle it anymore and just collapsed against the wall, filling the room with the sounds of chuckles and snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't it work!?\" Yelled Ino to herself as she continued to run down the path as fast as she could. It was becoming harder and harder to walk by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped to think for a moment. \"Lady Abura SAID it would change me back if I just apologized to the person directly! Why does this have to be so freaking difficult!? Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno suddenly recalled what it was she said exactly. <i>\"Why the hell would you and those lame brains Shikamaru and Naruto do something like that to me?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you...You gotta be kidding me!\" Shouted Ino as she felt her ears slowly travel to the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, Ino realized that she didn't have a lot of time left.

It had been the tenth time she had read this passage in the scroll, the tenth time she thought she had comprehended it, and the tenth time she realized she didn't hold onto a word of it. This had been going on for the past four hours, an entire beautiful spring afternoon wasted because she had to study for the Ninja Academy mid term exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGGGH! I've had it with this stupid thing!\" she yelled and threw the scroll across the room. It collided hard against the wall of her bedroom before collapsing into a heap on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno didn't bother to pick it up, she was in no mood after this constant fruitless studying. She loudly stomped across her floor and slammed her head into the pillows on her bed. To the casual observer, one might assume she was angry. But if one really got to know her better, they'd understand that she was scared. Terrified even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do...?\" she whispered to herself under the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a good reason for her to be afraid. These mid terms weren't just a big exam, they counted for fifty percent of their total grades. If Ino didn't pass there was a chance that she wouldn't graduate or worse end up in a cell with the class idiots like Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door snapped her back out of her nightmarish daydreaming. \"Ino? Is everything alright in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father looked in the room with a worried face. Ino didn't even bother to take her head out of the pillows. \"I'm going to fail and not become a ninja, that's the problem daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on now. You've been in your room for four hours now. Surely that time hasn't been wasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bloodshot and annoyed looking eye glared at her father from under the pillows. He knew his daughter well enough that talking to her right now was just going to cause them to go in circles. So he just shook his head and gently closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do fine. Just don't stomp around like that, you sound like an elephant from downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the raging blond girl was left alone to her horrible studying. But something her father said had sparked a memory within her mind. She could not tell if he had chosen his words carefully or not to provoke such a memory, secrets of the mind were her clan's specialty after all. Something about one word in particular such to her thoughts like glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Elephant.</i>\" she repeated several times, as if trying to get the memory to materialize right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she sat up in an instant. \"Of course! Elephants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to her bookshelf and began to dig around it's contents, looking for something very specific she had remembered seeing. It was something that she was sure was going to help her with her exam...</span></div></div>",

What she had been looking, an old scroll from her family's archives, had seen better days especially after Ino had looked at it. A single character was painted on the cover \"\u8133\". Brain. Or in this case, memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay dirt,\" she whispered with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further hesitation, she undid the binding and pulled open the parchment. The inside was even more decrepit then the scoffed and scratched outside. Mold and dust blanketed the soggy pages, this scroll hadn't seen the light of day for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading through it and brushing the paper clean at the same time, Ino scanned for the passage she was looking for. \"Elephants...Elephants...Ah, here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Section 3. Article B:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElephants are among the world's most intelligent yet underestimated creatures. It wasn't until recently during studies did humanity discover the untapped potential of an elephant's memory in particular. The process in which they did so involved...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blah, blah, blah...\" she muttered, skimming on ahead with careless disregard. \"Skip to the jutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral paragraphs down from the initial text, she came across what seemed to be instructions. In a heading it read \"To Gain an Elephant's Memory\" or \"To Be More Like an Elephant\", the translation could have meant either. She prayed in thanks to whatever gods were watching over her now as most of the instructions were shown through pictures, but even so this ritual seemed very odd and complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta do it...This is the only way I'm going to be able to pass that test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first steps showed the proper hand signs for completing the ritual. Simple enough, though most academy students couldn't perform complex jutsu Ino had to try. Thankfully each hand sign was shown in its own picture. Monkey. Tiger. Dragon. Tiger. Horse. And finally Ram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an odd release of chakra Ino felt flow through her body as a slight breeze filled the room, scattering some loose papers on the floor. Other then that though, nothing happened. Ino looked at the scroll for what was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headline read \"Physical Ritual\" in what appeared to be the next section of the rite. What was odd about the pictures in it though was that they had the person in the drawings acting out in an unusual manner. The first one, for example, had the person grabbing their nose then in the second the person's nose stretching out in front of their face like a giant tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd...\" thought Ino as she tried to mimic the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinched hard but for some reason her nose didn't have any feeling of it. Humoring the picture, Ino gave her nose a slight tug if just so she'd feel a little resistance from her nose. No such opposition occurred, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ino pulled forward on her nose, it stretched while still remaining in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelped and quickly let go, hoping that her nose would somehow snap back into place like a rubber band. Instead it flopped down in front of her face, resting comfortably on her chin. A sudden chill made Ino realize what the \"Physical Ritual\" had entailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.\" she kept chanting as she stumbled for a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith teary eyes she looked at herself in the reflection. Her nose had comically stretched out like a tube and covered her mouth. In fact if she didn't know any better, her nose looked a lot like an...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Elephant's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno...</span></div></div>",

This time, however, instead of surging forward like a pulled rubberband, her nose was gently collapsing in on itself like clay. It felt as if she were molding it back into its original form. She was worried that she'd somehow make a mistake at first and her nose would look deformed but it seemed to almost have a mind of it's own. It was reshaping itself back to normal, it only seemed to need Ino's hand as general guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the clay-like feel disappeared from Ino's nose and it felt relatively normal again, if a bit stretched like it had been put through a wringer. She tapped it a few times while looking in a mirror, inspecting every physical detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks okay...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief she sat down next to the open scroll. She then grab it and immediately tossed it into the trashcan, resisting the urge to spit on it for good measure. Never before had she wanted to burn something so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid thing. I could have ended up as some disfigured freak of nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing at some old scroll wasn't going to get her anywhere though. Deep down she knew it was her own fault for skimming the pages and not reading carefully what the ritual was supposed to do. Iruka-sensei had always told them of the dangers of reading unknown spells and jutsu. Still, Ino felt she was well within her rights to be angry at the scroll. You'd think that they'd mention somewhere in bold print that the purpose of the ritual was to actually turn the user into an elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the excitement had died down, the sinking realization set in as to why she had dug up the scroll to begin with. \"...How was that supposed to help me with my memory problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of books from school was beginning to look more and more daunting now that her ace in the hole had proven to not really be much of an asset at all. Staring at them with the time she had until Monday slowly ticking away wasn't exactly being productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...It's still Saturday. I'll come up with something by tomorrow...I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA walk through Konoha seemed to take Ino's mind off the impending problem she was going to have to soon face. But soon it settled in just how late in the day it was already. The time was already three in the afternoon, everyone in the village seemed to be winding down to enjoy their Saturday evening. Ino would no doubt be spending it locked in her room again struggling with the monumental task she faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe envied the little kids that ran around the streets, enjoying the last few hours of sunlight before turning in for the night. They were so carefree, but soon enough they would be in the same boat she was. Ino suddenly felt very old just thinking about it despite being only age twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ino!\" called a voice, breaking up her internal contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno put on a forced smile and turned to see a head of pink hair. It was Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's studying going?\" she asked, as if reading the blond girl's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she lied. Still trying to sound as pleasant as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked, knowing full well that written tests were not her friend's strong suite. \"You know this is an important exam, right? Depending on how well we do here determines what teams we'll be on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. Iruka-sensei has told us a thousand times already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you're caught cheating, you'll be ejected from the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that annoyed outburst from Ino, the pink haired girl felt she had accomplished what she had set out to do. Still keeping a cheery tone, she waved good bye to Ino and set off in her own direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your weekend, <i>Ino</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno glared at Sakura as she strutted away, half hoping that a meteorite would fall from the sky and crush her and her smug attitude.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Never before had there been a moment where Ino's pride had gotten in the way of progress. Given that it was already Saturday, there was no realistic way that Ino would be able to remember every single topic for their big test on Monday. And Ino needed to pass if she wanted to be on a team with Sasuke. Unfortunately, her desire to utterly crush Sakura's smug attitude was clouding her logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought, Ino took off back to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even say hello to her father and whizzed past him straight into her room where the vile scroll which contained the jutsu still remained stretched out on her bed. This time, rather than breeze dangerously through it like before, Ino was actually going to take her time and read through the step of the jutsu. She spent about an hour translating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said aloud to herself, putting the scroll down. \"So basically this spell is so powerful that it actually changes the user into the desired form instead of like the Transformation jutsu which is basically a controlled illusions. Makes sense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno suddenly realized that this was an intense jutsu that shouldn't have been able to be accomplished by a novice like her. Yet, for some strange reason, it came strangely naturally to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two parts of the jutsu,\" she continued to herself. \"The jutsu and the physical ritual. I did the jutsu which allowed me to attempt the physical ritual...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno remembered pulling her nose out and how clay-like it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But the jutsu lasts for twenty four hours. You can mold yourself as much as you want within that time, but you have to return to normal else you will lack the human parts to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about what it would be like to morph into an elephant. Certainly the big hooves would make casting a jutsu difficult, so that rule made sense. The physical ritual also didn't sound limited to elephant transformation only, which was something she'd have to keep in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The physical ritual actually isn't complex at all. It only has three steps: the nose, the ears, and then the body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno pointed to the three pictures that depicted these steps and all them were very strange. Besides the nose one, the Ears picture had the figure in the drawing pulling out their ears in a manner similar to an elephant's. Most strangest of all, the Body drawing had the figure taking their elongated nose into their mouth and blowing. This action seemed to be expanding the figure into gigantic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that explains the \"Body\" part of the jutsu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Ino felt she was in way over her head with this. But now wasn't the time to back down. She had to pass that exam and she was willing to give anything, even her own body, to succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her breath in determination, Ino gripped her nose and pulled. Like before, the puddy-esc feeling returned followed by a slight numbness until the tip of her nostril was tickling the bottom of her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy enough,\" she said to herself as she gave it one last good yank, her nose was now over a foot long and looked very much like an elephant's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the new step. with both hands, Ino pinched the tips of her ears and pulled. Somehow, despite there barely being a handful of flesh for her to work with, her ears expanded in her grasp. It wasn't long before they felt like two massive pancake she was molding with her fingertips. Eventually, the grew so large that they could no longer stand up straight and flopped down, brushing her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno went for her mirror and gasped at the image that greeted her. \"I look ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt indeed very much looked like someone had taken exaggerated prosthetics and attached them to her head. After taking a moment to let the changes in, Ino...</span></div></div>",

Hinata gasped in fright at the sudden appearance of the two. Of course Tenten looked normal to her, but Temari looked like a giant ferret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tenten? Y-you scared me. W-what is t-that thing behind you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari chuckled and cast her arms out at Hinata. The same dust that had appeared for Tenten now covered Hinata. She was shrinking at an alarming rate. Black fur sprouted all over her body and her nose expanded outwards while her hands and feet shriveled into cute little paws. Hinata the ferret stood in a pile of her old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am what are you now my servant. A noble ferret girl of our mistress.\" smirked Temari, \"Now it's time you learned your place...I command you to shrink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hinata ferret dwindled in size even further, looking ever more frightened.

Temari, you shall be my trusty stead, a mule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a twinge of fear in Temari's eyes as her already long snout expanded. Her neck lengthened to bizarre proportions. Even her tail was changing; thinning and growing black hairs at the end. Hooves began to take shape on both her hands and feet, Temari was forced to drop to all fours in order to balance. Bones in her body shifted and cracked, reshaping her form into a horse-like one. Her once long stomach shrink inwards, all the length went to her arms and legs. Conveniently, a large saddle formed on her back. Temari was a complete mule, while maintaining her hairstyle and yellow fur color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Temari,\" Smirked Tenten. \"You've certainly made an ass of yourself, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one mistress...\" Grunted Temari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, mules don't talk.

I said I'd change you back, I didn't say anything about letting you speak again though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret girl trio went into the inn and had dinner. No one seemed to bother them, on the outside they were believed to be an average ninja team probably on a mission. In fact, even several males started flirting with them. Of course they had to decline in any 'sexual' activities, least their secret get out. Besides, all of them were exhausted at the end of the day.

All was quiet, save for the clock ticking away in parallel to her life wasting away in this boring office. She wished something exciting would happen for once. Wish granted; a giant slug materialized landing right on her desk in a sticky mess. It looked like one of her familiars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade you must come with me please! It is my mistress Katsuyu! She is deathly ill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuyu was the slug leader Tsunade had made a contract with. She had saved many comrades in the past and was a strong ally. She was also adept with medicine, even more so than Tsunade herself. If she was as ill as the messenger slug said, there would probably be little Tsunade could do for her. Still Tsunade grab hold of the slug and was teleported to their realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slug realm was an ideal place for the creatures. A dark and wet swamp like land with plenty of green grass. There were ancient tablets all around them, each with secrets to hidden medical jutsu. The slug lead Tsunade to a large clearing in the swamps with a giant stone altar nearly a mile long. On this altar lay the leader of the slugs Katsuyu, who looked extremely pale. Her mouth was dripping green mucus and her eye stalks were red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lady T-Tsunade.\" spoke Katsuyu,\"I-I am sorry for the short notice in summoning you b-but I am in dire need of your help. I-it might be dangerous though and you could forever b-be altered in the process...d-do you still wish to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous Katsuyu, you and I have been through thick and thin together. Whatever it is I'll help you in any way I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-very well, listen to my tale. E-every one thousand years we slugs must die. H-however, rather than forever perish we can choose to inhabit t-the body of a human and share their life force. This h-human becomes our avatar and will take the shape o-of one of us over time. A-after one month, if the rebirth is successful, we leave the body of the human and both of us return to o-our normal forms. But t-there is sometimes a-a problem that occurs. O-our bodies can sometimes become too intermingled and w-we become one. I-I myself was once a w-woman like yourself who offered m-my body to the l-last slug queen. I-It is a gamble but I must find someone binded to us or I-I will surely perish. I c-can understand if you don't want to take such a risk my lady. But I-I feel you are the only one I can trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade didn't have to give it any thought if it meant saving her friend, \"Katsuyu, if it will save you, you may use my body. I will just have to explain to Shizune the situation. When will this transfusion begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right now.\"</span></div></div>",

By the time Tsunade had reached her, she was the size of a watermelon. At last she stopped shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I must be eaten by you my lady. There is no ritual. J-just bring me to your mouth and I can enter you body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grabbed the shrunken slug and did as she was told. She was wet and slimy with mucus but Tsunade didn't mind. She opened her mouth as wide as she could and Katsuyu poked her head inside. It felt like Tsunade was chewing a very wet and wide piece of gum as the slug worked its way down her gullet. Despite her throat being clogged by a giant mollusk she could still breathe, and Katsuyu created a huge bulge in her skin as the rest of her body wiggled its way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It almost tastes like chicken...\" Tsunade thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime of Katsuyu made the transfusion extremely easily as she slipped down into Tsunade's belly. Her tail was all that was outside Tsunade's body as it shook to wedge itself in. Tsunade helped by pushing it in. She gave a huge gulp and feel the slug plop down in her stomach. Katsuyu curled up inside of her, Tsunade's stomach stuck out a good foot almost. She would have looked pregnant to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade,\" spoke one of the other slugs, \"Lady Katsuyu and you are now one. You may call on us at any time through will alone. We can teleport you back here whenever you wish as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Tsunade, still trying to comprehend the fact she just swallowed a giant slug, \"I-I think I'll return back to work now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a flash of smoke, Tsunade was back in her office.</span></div></div>",

Whatever the reason she could not keep her eyes open much longer, she sat down in her comfy office chair and collapsed on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had strange dreams during her nap. She saw herself eating piles of pink and yellow pantries without care of gaining weight. There was even a dream where she was rubbed her eyes and they popped out of their sockets, she had to go around holding them up to see where she was going. By the time she woke up, it was well past midnight. No one had entered her office yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good nap...\", said Tsunade stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade felt different. She looked down at her body and saw that it looked like she had gained tons of weight just like in her dream! Aside her slug filled belly, her arms and breasts were wider and bigger. Even her face felt fatter. She must have weighed over 200 pounds now, it was just like her dream! This didn't feel like normal fat though, it felt liquidy and slimy in a way. The changes to her body Katasuyu was talking about must have taken effect during her rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade felt her eye view was higher too. Could she have gotten taller as well? Her clothes weren't going up her legs or arms like she had grown, maybe it was just her imagination. She turned to the mirror and nearly screamed. Her eyes, if they could even be called eyes now, were stuck in two long skin colored tubes. Both stalks had grown over her head, they were just like a slug's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so much for being able to go out in public now.\"</span></div></div>",

The golden fur was carpeting her entire chest and moving on to her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade began to tear off her clothes in some desperate attempt to make the spreading cease. There was no such luck as the fur wrapped itself around her hands, which were being to look like paws now. From her thighs to her feet she was completely covered in the same yellow hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is happening to me?\" said Tsunade, her voice was getting deeper almost like a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur showed no signs of slowing down as it made it's way up to her face. But Tsunade felt a strange pressure residing in her jaw. Her mouth and nose lengthened a good few inches forward, she felt her nose flattened and turn black. The fur covered her entire head besides her mouth and nose, and pushed her ears to the top of her skull. Her old hairstyle remained, but she stood there naked and shivering wondering what was happening to her.</span></div></div>",

She was able to push herself up with almost no effort and struggled to balance on two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders were broadening outwards and her spine and limbs were lengthening. Tsunade shot up almost a foot in height in a matter of seconds. Every bone in her body was thickening and becoming much stronger. She felt the fat in her stomach spread over her body, making her larger limbs look even more massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to speak the words, \"Someone help me!\", but all that came out of throat was a series of mournful roars. She couldn't speak. She felt her hands shrinking and form soft pads in the middle of her palms.

She tried to sit up only to be stopped by the drooling head of Naruto who asleep on her naked body. Tsunade's face twitched and she let out an ear piercing scream that woke up the entire street. Naruto fell on the floor completely dazed from what just happened and stared half asleep at Tsunade as she quickly covered herself with his bed sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what? Granny? What the heck are you doing in my room naked? And where's Tsuna?\", asked Naruto as he looked around the room for his new pet bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sweated furiously as she struggled to remember what she had been doing up until this point. She remembered being VERY hungry, then fur and claws sprouted all over her body, and she found Naruto who offered her fish and took her to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Granny? Are you hungover or something? Where the hell's my pet bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto,\" said the Hokage with as much dignity as she could muster, \"I think I was...the bear.

And I followed you home...you said something about a landlord. Then we went here and fell asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you weren't just following me last night. Come on enough jokes now, I need to get to my mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade tried to think of more proof but something lingered in the air. There was a sweet smell coming from Naruto's cupboard. Ignoring Naruto completely Tsunade's appetite clouded her mind again as she fumbled through the cabinet looking for the source of the tasty smell. It was HONEY! Licking her chops, she quickly unscrewed the cap of the giant jar and began to messily eat away at the sweat syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh Granny...why are you eating my honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to ask even more pointless questions until he noticed something funny was happening to Tsunade's ears. They were moving to the top of her head! Not only that but Tsunade's stomach was bloating outwards like a balloon. Her hands began to look more like paws as she remained blissfully unaware at her changes. She grew right out of her bedsheet and rose off the ground a good foot as the blubber worked it's way to her butt again. Patches of yellow fur were appearing all over her body and her mouth grew longer and wider so she could fit it in the jar to get the last drops of honey. Tsunade looked like a swollen blow up doll as she snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! It's happening *grr* again...Please help me!\" said Tsunade in a much deeper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cute stubby tail poked from her backside. She felt bloated and warm as the fur mercilessly covered her body. Within seconds Naruto's pet bear Tsuna had returned. Naruto put two and two together and asked the bear some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny, can you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna growled sadly and shock her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I know why you transformed like that. It's the honey! I'll bet every time you eat bear food like honey or fish you turn into Tsuna! And maybe if you fall asleep like you did last night, you return to normal. Of course I don't know why it's like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was distraught. How could she be Hokage of her grandfather's village as a bear? She had to find out why this was happening.</span></div></div>",

You'll become like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what those dust ninja said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to have someone to chat to at least, it also provided a window into Naruto's personal life. She became well acquainted with Naruto's teammates asking them about themselves to pass the time. Sakura did most of the talking. Sasuke was far too busy trying to master flying, Tsunade could swear his beak was becoming dented after slamming into a tree too many times. They both seemed to be handling their changes better than she had, recalling when she first became a bear in her office. She was sure to lure them away from questions about herself though, trying her best to not give away her cover. Eventually Naruto came back with fresh fish and they ate.</span></div></div>",

Tsunade and Sakura found it uncomfortable to sleep normally again without a large mass of fur to keep them warm, but they managed through the restless night. It wasn't until the next day in mid afternoon did they finally have any luck with their information hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jees.\" said Naruto, panting heavily, 'I'm exhausted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're maintaining a jutsu miles away while talking a country long walk. I'd be surprised if you weren't fool...\" muttered Sasuke, who had returned to human form for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd punch you in the face bastard...but that would take too much work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura detected something up ahead and gave a sharp \"Shhh\" to allow the others to hear it too. They all quickly hid themselves up in trees above the pathway, waiting for whatever was up ahead to move towards them. Seconds ticked by as they all held their breathe, praying it wasn't the Dust Ninjas. An old man with a long white beard, dressed in rags was humming his way down the path. He had a small squirrel that was chewing on a large acorn while sitting on his shoulder. Though he did not seem hostile, the group did not reveal themselves to him. Deciding it would be best if they allowed him to continue on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my.\" the old man said to himself, pausing at the tree Tsunade was in. \"It certainly is a wonderful day today, wouldn't you agree Mr.Donguri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade had a much look at his face. He was very old indeed, many wrinkles covered his face. Though his glasses did a good job of distracting people from them. They could do nothing, however, to hide the three giant scars going down his right eye all the way to his neck. His white beard was yellow around the mouth, suggesting he smoked often. But he had such a kind and trusting face, harmonious to nature itself. He opened his gray eyes. It was almost like he could detect Tsuande's stares, and he glanced up exactly where she was hidden in the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr.Donguri says he could smell you four people from miles away. Why don't you come on down? I am but an old man, and you are clearly traveling ninjas. You have me outnumbered and overpowered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others turned to Tsunade, awaiting orders. She sighed and jumped down from her hiding place, she hadn't been caught in the arts of stealth since she was a child. This old man was no ordinary person, possibly a great retired ninja. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura jumped behind him, preparing for any sign of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why don't you tell me who you four are? Sneaking around in the tops of trees like a bunch of birds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down his nose directly at Tsuande. It was almost like he could see right through her. Any lie she said would be detected. She decided it would be wise to be honest to a man with such a powerful presence. \"My name is Tsunade, and I am the Hokage of Konoha. We have come to find out about a particular type of dust that is native to this area. It is vital for the safety of the village...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed...\" replied the old man with a stern look on his face. His eyes were surveying Tsunade's every motion, he was reading her like an open book. There was a giant pause of silence that seemed never ending. The wind howled in the background. And the atmosphere was so thick you could cut it with a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the old man busted out laughing. \"Hohohahahaha! That's far too serious for me to hold a straight face! Sorry to scare you youngsters!\" They all sweat dropped, wanting to punch the old hermit for creating such unnecessary suspense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's fist quivered and she asked through gritted teeth. \"Now...would you mind telling me your name, PLEASE!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why I don't have a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke had to both comically hold back Tsunade from tearing the man's head off, as he stood there laughing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man wiped tears from his eyes. \"Ohohahaha...Sorry...I haven't laughed that hard in ages...I don't have a name, but I am know as the Animal Hermit. Most folks just call be Hermit for short though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Animal Hermit?\" asked Sakura, \"Why do they call you that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well take Mr.Donguri here.\" the old man pointed to the squirrel on his shoulder, \"I can communicate with any animal and have them help me in return for reward. I suppose to have it make sense to you ninja folk, you could call it summoning without the obligation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke could release Tsunade who had gotten over her blood lust. The old man took out a cane from his backpack and leaned on it. \"I'm sorry for causing you trouble. Why don't I make it up to you four? You can to my hut and we'll have a cup of tea. Maybe I can help you with your quest...or mission...or whatever it is you're on.\"</span></div></div>",

He's obviously a very talented old ninja master. Following him could be extremely dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" spoke Sasuke, \"But he could have valuable information. I doubt he could be able to handle both the Hokage and a ninja squad alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll follow him...I trust something about him...\" muttered Tsunade. The three genin nodded and ran to catch up to the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hermit led them to a run down hut near a gushing waterfall. It looked like it had been put together with sticks and moss, hay and animal droppings were all over the floor. Of course the latter came from the sheer number of animals inside the small building. Where a dinning table would stood a large cow, birds of all sorts sat up in the rafters of the ceiling. On every single piece of furniture was some manner of four legged creature. The group understood why the geezer had been called the Animal Hermit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hermit hummed the same merry tone as he gathered cups for the hot tea. A flock of birds laid a table cloth over the log that would serve as a coffee table and a large dog gathered the boiling teapot with it's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then my friends from Konoha.\" said the old man sipping the tea given to him by a raccoon, \"Tell me what it is you people are searching for here in the Land of Dust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grabbed the tea cup handed to her by a bouncing monkey. \"Well Mister...err...Hermit. We have come looking for information on something a ninja from this land had on his person. He called it...Animal Dust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man seized up between a sip of tea, causing a few raised eyebrows. The hermit slowly lowered his glass with a shaking fist before producing a goofy smile saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Animal Dust? Why I've never heard of it! Hohohahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR!\" the four Konoha ninjas said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed for several seconds before calming down. \"Heheh...You four mustn't mention such a thing so openly. Animal Dust is an extremely rare bit of material in this country. Usually any name connected to it is involved in dark arts or assassination. You're saying a ninja from our country left such a thing with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...not so much left.\" said Tsunade, \"More so dropped. He tried to use it on some of our ninjas but escaped, leaving it behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hermit played with his beard. \"Answer me this. Would those ninjas happen to be you? And he inflicted it's curse on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade winced and he laughed again. \"Hohohaha, I'd say that's a bulls-eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura asked. \"You know what it does then? And is there a cure?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"I'm sorry my girl but there is no cure for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all felt like they had just swallowed a rock. No cure? They'd be stuck like this forever! Sakura was nearing tears. Sasuke looked like he had just been punched in the gut. Tsunade shivered in her chair. Never before had she felt so afraid and unsure of the future. This was probably the worse than any of them could imagine. The old man took another sip of his tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the down in the dumps look? You should consider this a blessing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is there like a potion or jutsu?\" Asked Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there are no such things. The animal dust taps into your deepest primal aspects. When you lose yourself, you lose to your inner animal and it manifests itself using your body. Don't any of you recall that when eating the food of your designated animals? Food...Gluttony, it is one of the most savage and primitive desires in our human soul. You all felt the animal within feed off of your hunger and you lost the battle of dominance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there a special ritual to beating the inner animal?\" Asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is only one way to beat your inner beast. You must have the will of a human being. You must want to be human. It is a mere test of self control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade would have preferred a complicated jutsu to learn over this. She wasn't nicknamed the Legendary Loser for nothing. In the past she would gamble and drink for hours until she ran out of money. To her knowledge, she probably had the worst self control out of any ninja ever. But this was the only way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best way to do this,\" said the hermit, breaking Tsunade from her thoughts. \"Is like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers at a nearby owl who flew over to an open cupboard in what could only be described as a kitchen. After noise of rummaging, the bird swooped over the table and dropped a piece of a large fish in the center. Tsunade could feel her mouth salivating at the fresh salted salmon lying in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have our Miss.

And our Lady Hokage can try her first test again. Come, I have beds in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade felt embarrassed. Mere genin had passed a test that she, of Hokage level could not complete. She needed to learn to control herself. The fate of the village depended on it. She sat out the remains of her fish and curled into bed next to Naruto again. Despite falling asleep instantly, her mind did not rest the entire night.</span></div></div>",

Curious, she leaned outside the open portal to find Naruto yelling to himself outside, stuck in a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto,\" she groaned. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow ninja yelped in surprise and slowly looked back up at the sleepy Hokage. \"U-Uh, h-h-hi, Granny. I was just, u-um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade narrowed her eyes. \"What did you do, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing, just, um, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleepy and hungry, why? Should I feel differently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not itchy in the slightest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto,\" she said, with a much more serious tone. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that he was caught and about to get into a load of trouble unless he came clean, the young ninja gulped and said. \"I may have...Covered you in itching powder while you were asleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade lowered her hand out the window. \"Let me see what you used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto untied the pouch around his waist and tossed it up to Tsunade. She expertly caught it and read the package, expecting to see \"Itching Powder\" but instead reading in big letters \"Sleeping Powder.\" That explained why she was so drowsy all of a sudden. \"Naruto, you didn't read what you bought from the joke shop, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy said it was Itching Powder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sleeping Powder, you idiot!\" Tsunade angrily threw the pouch down and all over Naruto. \"Naruto, I have work to doing today and I don't need to be falling asleep thanks to your stupid tricks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a fist in Naruto's direction, causing him to squeal and scramble out of the tree. Tsunade sighed as she watched the prankster gather the dust in the pouch and run for it. \"Great...Now I need a pick-me-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon nap she took had made Tsunade extremely hungry and she wandered down into the office's cafeteria to find something to fill the void in her belly. It being far after lunch, there was practically no one in the lunchroom when Tsunade arrived, only a few off-duty ninja and the workers cleaning up any mess left by the lunch crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shuffled over to the lunch lady, an elderly woman who was in charge of serving food to the workers in the main offices of Konoha. She perked up from her off-duty as Tsunade approached. \"Lady Tsunade, what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" she groaned, rubbing her eyes in response. \"Do you have anything that can wake me up so I can focus on some paperwork?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman thought for a moment. \"Would coffee work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, no. Coffee mixes horribly with sake. How about something like comfort food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I might have a new order like that. Here, it just came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman fiddled around with some crates behind her and pulled out a glass jar with a yellow substance in it. Looking closer at it, Tsunade noticed that it had a logo with a happy-looking bear on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All-Natural honey gathered by the bears from the Land of Fire. They say that there's no taste like it and it goes with anything. Plus it's packed with all sorts of vitamins and is sure to get you right awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know a lot about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady chuckled. \"I've heard...Stories. Trust me, my lady, if you need to relax there's no comfort food better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shrugged, feeling the strain of her position and dealing with Naruto's constant pranks. Since she had become Hokage, she hadn't gotten a moment's rest of peace and quiet. Maybe a little comfort food was just what she needed to ease her into the late-night ahead of her with no breaks from her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I'll take the honey and maybe some bananas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA healthy meal for an aging woman with not-so-healthy vices, maybe it was time to jump start a change to get her body used to the workload of being Hokage. But little did Tsunade know, there was a great change coming with something that had happened to her earlier that day. That something strange came from...</span></div></div>",

It tasted like gutter water to her, and she found herself longing for her freedom just to get a decent drink for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night while taking a wake around the village Tsunade's luck changed. A traveling cart vendor who sold exotic drinks found her. Needless to say this poked his curiosity and she browsed his wares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything in particular you're looking for ma'am? I have many unheard brands?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired of the same old drinks they sell here in the village. Do you happen to have anything really really foreign?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I most certainly do. Take a whiff of this. This sake is made from the tribes of the deep south. They call it Hippo's Milk. Mind you it's extremely expensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh money will not be an issue. Will still be in town in case I would like to purchase more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, for another week. Then I must head out, here you are ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drink came in a tiny vial about the size of her palm. But the smell was extremely sweat and strong, just one sniff of it even made her feel a little tipsy. She placed the sake in her pocket and paid the vendor before returning home.</span></div></div>",

Finally, with all her work done she could relax and break out the booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's miller time.\" she said, licking her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touch the vial out of her jacket and popped open the cork. The same fruity smell as yesterday filled the entire room making her drool. She brought the open bottle to her lips before saying \"Cheers\" and sipped the whole thing in one gulp. At first she thought there was an earthquake, the office seemed to shake violently causing her to fall from her chair while clutching the desk. The smell was nothing compared to the taste of the sake. It was like every good sake she had before in one convenient drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying with her back on the floor, she saw colors of all sorts dance before her eyes. She heard chanting being whispered in her ears. Every breathe of wind was felt across her body. She had never felt more alive in her entire life.

It seems that Sakura and Tenten were already adjusting to their pig forms and seemingly enjoying it too much.

It wasn't long before the others noticed the scent as well. It was coming from one of the nearby restaurants in the village.

A little worried of what might've happened to them, Naruto asked for the help of Hinata, Ino and Hana to locate where they would've went. Following a lead to an unfamiliar location, the three walked down a path as they got closer to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know why we have to go looking for them,\" Ino grumbled, \"Sakura thinks she's so special to head out on her own....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana just ignored her while Hinata was blushing, feeling happy about going on a mission from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived, they were taken back by the odd appearance. Mud holes, big farms and truffle spots were abundant. Very unusual compared to their homes, but they continued on. While walking through town, they heard grunting and oinking sounds coming from a restaurant. Taking a look to see what it was, they were astonished by four big pigs munching out in a big trough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww, it smells in here,\" Ino groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... do these piggies have clothes...?\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it seems that.... OH MY GOD!\" Hana gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls soon realized that these \"pigs\" were their friends!

Hinata, Hana and Ino all quickly took notice of thier changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno in particular began to change rapidly into a pig first her ears became pig ears, then her rear grew a pig tail made unconfortable by being constrained by her tight clothes.  The next major change was her nose turned into a pigs snout but this change brought to Ino many delicous new smells including those from the slop inside that the other girls were eating.  Once the smell of the slop reached Ino it caused a pleasurable reation in Ino mind and Ino wanted to experince more such pleasure.  So she rushed inside the building and joined the other pig girls in eating the slop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was for the briefest of moments disgusted with herself for eating the slop but her pig instincts quickly took over after the slop hit her taste buds and she couldnt get enough of the delicous food, and thus she began scarffing the slop down like a true hog would.  As she countinued to eat more and more of the slop her changes happened rapidly first she began to rapidly expand first her gut then thighs and then the rest of her quickly grew to porkine proportions.  As her body expanded she became more and more pig like in rapid order.  First her skin turned pink, and one after another she grew extra breast like Tsunade they started as small numbs but grew into great big breast all six of them.  Then finally after eating a huge amount of slop she burst of her constricting outfit and all her new changes were free for the world to see, Ino had become a Pig girl second to Shizune in pigishniss.  Ino do to all of these changes just accepted them and begane to roll in a mud puddle nearby do to changes to her mind all the while she was SQWEEEEing like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Hana the changes were much less rapid for she first started to develop extra breast very rapidly 2 extra set of breast were growing under Hanas original pair, but her three pet dogs realize what is happening to a limited extent and decide to bite Hana in order to stop the changes progress.  What they did was insert dog dna into the pig transformation disease and they also got infected with the pig disease what effects this will have on Hana and the triplets remains to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata for her part suffered the same changes as Hana at first but she wanted to stop it because naruto would never like a pig girl do to him being so fox like.  So Hinata did everything in her power to stop the changes but she still grew 2 extra pair of breast like Hana.  Realizing that she couldnt stop the changes she decided to try to alter them.  So she quickly brought out a seal of containing naruto and the fox kyubi chakra in it and applied it to the disease hoping to change the disease enough so that if she cant stop the changes she can at least be a cute fox girl for her naruto kun and have cute kitsune kits with and hunt rabbits together.  And if she does become a pig girl she will  make naruto her boar to make love with and eat slop together forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will be the fate of Hinata and Hana?   And when will Naruto reapear to be infeccted himself.</span></div></div>",

The black high heel sandals she normally wore were gone, probably lost at sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso she was hungry. Very, very hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she wanted to walk around an explore the island, her stomach was being difficult in the matter. It demanded food. Now.

All there was was the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fruit...\" She mumbled, tongue sticking out in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that she hated fruit, it was just that the condition her stomach was in she was hoping for a three course meal. Or at least something solid, like meat. Beggars couldn't be choosers though and Tsunade was in no position to be picky. Unless she wanted to try her luck by swimming all the way to the forest in the distance and spend all day hunting, fruit was going to be the only thing on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she walked over to the nearest tree, kicking the sand with her bare feet slightly. One of the green fruits lay particularly buried in the white sand. It seemed ripe enough to eat, it certainly wasn't rotten. She picked it up, it was surprisingly heavier then it looked, but it fit comfortably in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first bite sunk into the crisp layer of the lime-like fruit. A tangy yet sweet flavor overpowered the senses in her mouth, this wasn't half bad. Satisfied, and still half starved, she goggled the rest of the fruit in three bites, stem and all. At least this would be her a little strength to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she licked her fingers clean, a slight tug contorted itself around in her stomach. Tsunade ignored it for a few seconds, but the feeling quickly escalated into a full blown stomach ache. She doubled over in pain. </span></div></div>",

In this elephant graveyard, their bodies become part of the ground and fertilize the surrounding land, including the plants. This caused the local rice fields to grow to enormous size. According to the tales, it just so happened that one day a traveling sake maker came across the gigantic monocot plants. Amazed, he collected as much rice he could carry and brought it back to his home, where he created a barrel of the strongest sake he had ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, shortly after creating the drink, he disappeared without a trace. He left no recipe or location on where to find the rice, so \"The Elephant Sake\" as it was dubbed was his last and greatest work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyths surrounded the barrel of sake. Some said it was a cursed drink because of the sake maker's defilement of the elephant graveyard. Any who tasted its sweet nectar simply disappeared. So it was sealed away and erased from history, never to be drunk by man again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was on thing Tsunade remembered about her grandfather it was that he looked forward to his vacations. After spending a year as Hokage, she completely understood why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade,\" said Sakura as she carried their medical supplies. \"Where should I put the equipment for the training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so it wasn't a complete vacation. But that was one good thing about having a new apprentice, you could take them anywhere under the guise of 'training.' Truth be told, this trip to the world famous Elephant Hotsprings wasn't about studying the longevity of the local inhabitants, which is what Tsunade gave as a flimsy reason. This was about spending as much time as she could in the hotsprings, taking a wonderful mudbath, and drinking as much sake as her body could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sakura. We will have our own room in the inn to store everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't be staying out in the fields?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the rice fields? Of course not! Why would we ever do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Because in my last exercise you said a medical-nin should adapt to any environment, no matter how uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade mentally kicked herself and her overburdening methods of training. \"Oh poosh. This training is more a...mental exercise. Just trust me, Sakura, you needn't worry about the details. Just try to have fun with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura furrowed her brow, but shrugged. She had probably been worked so hard lately that she was willing to accept any excuse. As they approached the inn along the dirt road, Tsunade closed her eyes and made a mental list of everything she was going to do this week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"First, I'm going to take that twelve hour nap I've been meaning to take...Then I'll hit the bar and blow the rest of that inheritance money...Then I'm going straight straight to the hotsprings where I'll enjoy a great big bowl of--\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" asked Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade snapped back to reality and, sure enough, there was the hyperactive ninja following his perverted sensei, Jiraiya, along the same dirt road. The two groups met exactly in front of the inn. Both men noticed the girls and Jiraiya was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo, this is a surprise. What are you doing here, Tsunade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade felt her nose flare. The reason she hadn't brought Shizune along was because she knew she'd be a wet blanket during the trip. Tsunade wanted to have a relaxing vacation and not have to worry about work or, in the case of Jiraiya, perverts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what a surprise. We're here for the same reason too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me any of that,\" lectured Tsunade. \"We both know you're just here to spy on the woman's springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya's face blushed but he admitted nothing. \"And you're no doubt here for the sake, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sensei's shared a long glare between each other while their students looked on, dumbfoundedly. With a huff, Tsunade stomped into the inn to get their room. Sakura tagged along, struggling to drag their baggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade had been looking forward to a week without headaches, but thanks to two perverted ninjas that was most likely not going to happen. She needed something to take her mind off things, so she...</span></div></div>",

Drop off the baggage then do whatever you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gave a worried look, but obeyed. She was probably just happy to see that Naruto was at least doing alright with his training and didn't see what the problem was with sharing a hotel with those two. She didn't know that they were going to have to spend the whole week worrying that someone might be watching them in the bath or checking their underwear drawers to make sure nothing had been stolen in the night. Jiraiya had always been a pain on trips when they were part of a team, Tsunade could only imagine how badly he had taught Naruto in the subtle arts of perviness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsunade returned to the lobby, she was tempted to visit the bar but decided that getting hammered and then waking up with a hangover would only add to her frustrations. A walk around the complex would be a better way to cool off, followed by a trip to the spring baths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped outside. It was a beautiful summer night, though a bit muggy and hot. This quickly became a factor after she walked down the path for a few minutes, as Tsunade found herself growing parched. She tired to distract her thirst by looking around and marveling at the sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place was in no way like Konoha in that there weren't a forest of trees around for miles. It was just a flat valley with dozens of rice fields and a few huts scattered around for storage or escape from the sun. Everything looked to be very well maintained, except for one rice farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stopped as she passed it. It was a rundown place, the rice fields were all turned over with rocks and couldn't grow anything. The house which stood on the property was rotting with the wood planks falling off. Generally it looked abandoned, save for the candlelight coming from the window. Curiosity took the best of Tsunade and she went up to the door and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anyone home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the knock at the flimsy wooden door caused it to fall right off it's hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" said a voice from within the hovel. \"We haven't had guests in ages. Come in, dearie, come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitant, but wanting to make amends for breaking the door, Tsunade reluctantly stepped into the home. It was just as bad as it looked on the outside, with most of the furniture neglected and rotting. In the center of the house was a giant pot over a fire and a small old woman cooking something in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just boiling the stew, darling. Be with you in a couple of minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Hello,\" said Tsunade as she sheepishly stepped into the light. \"Sorry about the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What door?\" asked the old woman. \"Oh, what are beautiful young lady you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smirked, knowing full well in the back of her mind that she was probably looked like the old woman in her true form. \"The door I busted. I didn't mean to break it when I knocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman scanned for what Tsunade was talking about. She shrugged. \"I don't see any broken doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one right behind--\" But when Tsunade turned around to point it out, she saw that the door had somehow repaired itself. \"...Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning lights went on immediately in Tsunade's head. This old woman was clearly not what she seemed but for some reason Tsunade found herself drawn to stay there. The old woman smiled as her cauldron continued to boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem like a kind girl, a lot like our daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't live alone?\" perhaps there was someone normal she could talk to, Tsunade thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do know. He disappeared so long ago thanks to that...\" the old woman stopped suddenly and shuddered. \"But I hid it, you see. No one will ever find it so long as I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hid what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at Tsunade. The mood of the hovel changed instantly. \"Don't you ask of it. You don't believe me, do you? Just like the others. It caused him to disappear! I just know it, but could never prove it. He grew and then vanished. They said I was insane. You think I'm crazy, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar! shrieked the woman. She threw her stirring wand at Tsunade, but it somehow missed. \"You think I'm crazy! I'm not! Get out! Get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade wasted no time in leaving. She hurried out the door, only for it to fall off its hinges again, and didn't stop walking until she was on the dirt road again. Feeling guilty about just fleeing like that, she turned to yell an apology to the old woman but was shocked to discover the house had just completely vanished. In its place was what seemed to be a smoldering ruins with charred earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the...\" Tsunade said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ruins looked eerily similar in layout to the house she had just been in. It couldn't have been, perhaps, a ghost she had seen. Tsunade...</span></div></div>",

But Tsunade was sure that what she had seen not a few minutes ago was very real. To leave now seemed wrong, like she might be missing out on finding something huge. She walked to the frame where the door had once been and looked around the ground. Everything had turned to ash, gone was the wooden floor from a few moments ago. The very dirt itself had been blackened by the past fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsunade walked along the soft turf, she felt her high heels click on something hard. Surprised, she knelt down and ran her hands over the surface she had kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something buried here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing away the ashes and the dirt, she was proven correct. A few inches under the ground was a heavily sealed barrel. The top was covered with dozens of paper seals that would require a master to disarm. Whatever was in it, it looked extremely heavy. Thankfully, it just happened to be found by the strongest woman in the world. Tsunade gripped two sides of the barrel and took a preparatory stance to lift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, easy does it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy Tsunade's estimates, it had to literally weigh a ton. But it wasn't anything she couldn't handle. She hoisted it straight into the air, juggling it with one arm, before gently placing it back down on the ground. She wondered what could be inside, knowing it to be a liquid by the way it sloshed around inside, until she read the writing burned into the side of the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elephant Sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never heard of such a thing before, but sake was sake. This had probably been a part of the storage to an old brewery that existed here in the past. To find a huge barrel like this was a blessing, it was probably worth a good fortune. Besides, she had been meaning to find herself a good drink, this might be exactly what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scanned around the ruins some more before returning to the barrel, finding nothing else buried just beneath the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who on earth would seal sake to this extent. This is some powerful ninjutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was too powerful for her to unseal the cask. Unfortunately, there was only one person she knew whom she could trust to open her delicious prize. The mega-pervert. Of course, she could always just try opening the barrel herself, though with the extension sealing that might end with disastrous results. She decided...</span></div></div>",

Tsunade had brought it to his room shortly after she had returned from her walk, hoping to convince him to break the seals on it safely. He seemed more interested in giving her a hard time after she insulted him in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends. Removing the seals will be no trouble for a master like me. However, I can do nothing about any other protective measures that may be inside the barrel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? There's only sake in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a complete fool would believe what is labeled on a heavily sealed cask such as this. This could be boobytrapped or hold a curse of some kind. It's obvious someone doesn't want anyone to open this and that name Elephant Sake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You've heard of it somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya shook his head. \"Only a legend...But look, Tsunade. If you want a drink, I'll buy you one at the bar. I just don't think opening this will be a good idea. You're being reckless and coming from me that's saying something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiraiya, I am the Hokage. I know what I'm doing. And right now, the Hokage wants a good, strong drink. Now, for the last time, open the cask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya rolled his eyes and sighed. He then performed a few hand signs and pressed his palm at the top of the barrel. The paper seals that covered the lid instantly went up in flames, but left the cask completely unharmed. Jiraiya then released the barrel, smoke trailed from his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, it's done. Now kindly do me the favor of allowing me to get a safe distance away from you before you open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade said thank you and waited a few minutes for him to get up and leave before approaching the sake barrel. The wait had only increased her thirst and she was about ready to get smashed after listening to Jiraiya's lectures. Without giving it another thought, she popped open the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Nothing happened at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade chuckled to herself. \"See Jiraiya. It's only some old sake that some brewer wanted no one else to find out about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed a cup in the room and poured herself a glass. Raising it to her nose, she determined that there was nothing off about the smell. Even the color was normal. It just looked like a typical cup of sake. She brought it to her mouth and stopped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...This is the best sake I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe downed the entire cup and, against her better judgement, went straight for another cup. And then another. And another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she couldn't even remember what she had been drinking or how many glasses she had. Jiraiya's room began to spin and all she could think about was having more and more sake. Strangely enough, despite having more than any human being should consume in one sitting, the barrel never grew emptier. Eventually, like all good things, the fun came to an end. Tsunade blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

Their parents had told them how dangerous some of the giant holes could be. Huge lizards and pitfalls were all told in the children stories to keep them at bay from adventure. But these troublemakers were too smart to listen to the elders. They descended down the slopes of one of the bigger craters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Akihiko!\" said the smaller boy, \"Are you sure we should be down here like this? This place is supposed to be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be a wuss Mitsuo.\" replied Akihiko. \"Those old geezers just like to scare us with tales of boobytraps and giant monsters. Besides we didn't sneak away for nothing did we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuo grumbled as they continued to walk on the floor of the crater. The red sand shifted in the gusts of air, it was almost blinding and they had a hard time seeing where they were going. Eventually they made their way to the center of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Mitsuo. What did I tell you? There's nothing here but a giant hoOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLEEEEEAAAAHH!\" The ground had collapsed right where Akihiko was standing and he fell into a black abyss. Mitsuo screamed and ran to the cracked floor. He tried to call for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akihiko! Are you alright!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an eternity of silence making Mitsuo fear the worst. But to his relief Akihiko's voice called out from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea! I'm fine! Mitsuo you gotta see this! There are a bunch of bones down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari yawned sleepily while sitting on a bunch of crates for the expedition. This was one of the most boring missions she had ever been on, but it was for the good of the village...she supposed. Apparently some brats escaped from their parents after dark and ran away from the village to this huge crater in the desert. One of the stupid kids felled through the floor of the crater and landed in an underground cavern below. Inside was hundreds of very rare fossils of dinosaurs in perfect condition. This of course attracted the attention of the big wigs in the village and they ordered an expedition to be made to safely uncover the priceless artifacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari, being on the best team in the village, was chosen to guard the site from greedy vagabonds and enemy ninjas. Of course, who the hell would WANT a bunch of dirty old bones that seemed to do nothing but take up space was a question the village elders conveniently neglected to answer. All Temari knew was that she and her two brothers were assigned the guard the the bones and the diggers. But it wasn't all that bad. Digging was only estimated to take only six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddammit, this was boring. Gaara at least was able to practice his jutsu with the massive amount of sand around them. And even Kankur\u014d was hard at work creating a new puppet with the supplies he brought. The diggers didn't even want their help, and instead used the excuse \"These bones are too delicate for rampaging ninjas to be uncovering!\" Temari was the only person on the entire site who had nothing better to do than clean the sand out of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I've had it!\" she finally said, \"I'm going to go take a walk around the site, it's better than sitting around here doing nothing!\"</span></div></div>",

There was just nothing interesting to do around the site, and once you saw one old bone you've seen them all. She found herself going further into the caverns in hopes of finding something of interest. Her wandering took her to a small cave opening which she had not seen when they scouted the site. It was like it had magically appeared. Curiosity got the better of Temari and she made her way to the black opening until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey brat! Where do you think you're going?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA balding man with a construction hat tied around his neck and a massive gut yelled at her. Temari glared at him, she didn't take too kindly of being called a brat during her already bad mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's wise to insult a heavily armed ninja do you? But to answer your merger question, I'm going to see where this tunnel leads. It wasn't in our initial scout of the site and I have every right to see where it leads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go in there! Our team just finished constructing one of the skeletons we found and the joints need to harden before it's safe to move! If you go messing around in there the whole thing could collapse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I were someone of YOUR size it would.\", she said gesturing to his stomach, \"We ninjas don't train for days in subtly and grace for nothing, fatass. I'm not so stupid that I would break the first thing I'd see. Now kindly go away, I'm already not in a cheery mood right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bald man gritted his teeth and spat on the ground. \"Know what brat? I don't even care. Go ahead and break the damn thing. See if I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stormed off back to the main site. At least spreading her bad mood cheered Temari up some. She continued down the tunnel to find a large shaft with an opening in the ceiling, which gave off a beam of light. In the sun's light was the biggest skeleton she had seen on the whole trip. It towered over her, grinning down at her with it's massive jaws and sharp teeth. It's tail could probably crush a body in half, it seemed so large and powerful. This was a creature of power and strength, and it's frightening appearance alone made Temari's mouth hang open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooow. Talk about huge...I thought these were boring old bones but this thing is just monstrous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking she reached out to touch the 2 foot long shin bone of the fossil. After which it shook wildly before snapping in half. This of course caused the weight it was supporting to tumble down to the ground. Followed by the large tail falling before breaking into a million little pieces. The skull fell in a heap right in front of Temari. The dust settled, and the carefully constructed skeleton was now a pile of jigsaw pieces on the ground. Temari could not believe what just happened and still her arm in the same position as when she touched the skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um....wow....I...I think I'd better go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, she turned and dashed back out the tunnel.</span></div></div>",

That's when her alarm clock woke her up and she realized that her mouth was filled with blood. She spat as much of it out as she could. Apparently she had bitten her tongue very badly while asleep. She quickly went to a nearby mirror and opened her mouth to see how bad the bite was. When she opened her mouth, she nearly screamed in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this!?!?\" Her teeth were now gigantic sharp knives lining her jaw. That wasn't all. Her tongue, still red with blood, had become longer and pointed like a lizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced in pain and felt more blood filled her mouth. More sharp teeth were growing in the back of her mouth! And worse, to fit them all her jaw surged forward inch by inch. It felt like someone had taken her jawbone and was trying to rip it off her skull. Even her upper row of teeth were extending outwards, making it look like she had a snout. She hadn't noticed yet, but a bony appendage was sticking out of her lower back as well. She was growing a tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" She cried. It was becoming too difficult to talk now. Her mouth was becoming heavy and harder to hold up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIIIIP\" Something had torn out of her socks. Temari tried to look around her new giant muzzle to see what happened. Her feet were growing as were her toenails! The nails were sharp like her teeth, and had a blackish hue to them. That's when she noticed that her fingernails too were looking the same way. Right before her eyes, her fingers were fusing together like they were made out of clay. Her hands were now menacing three fingered claws!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRASH\" The sound of broken glass filled the air. She spun around only to hear a loud BANG. This time, she titled her head around and finally noticed the giant tail growing out of her posterior! It was swinging around, batting things in her tent. Her feet were now fusing together as well, forming into a leaf-like shape. Her nose had long ago sunk into her protruding mouth, now nothing more than two dark holes at the tip. The tail allowed her to balance herself better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something else wrong now. Her legs felt different. More powerful, stronger. Like she could run a five hundred mile marathon and not lose, similar to in her dream. Her height was increasing as her legs grew in muscle and bone. The muscle seemed to spread to her tail, chest, and neck as well, for they too grew in size. Strangely enough, the only body parts that didn't grow were her arms. In fact they seemed to shrivel away into her chest as the rest of her grew. Despite the increased muscle, her head was difficult to hold up like a normal human would. It was much easier to bend over, almost making her body parallel to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the only thing left of Temari the human ninja was her hairstyle perched atop of her massive head. Her skin had become rough and scaly. Streaks of colors went down her spine, her skin had shifted from a peach color to dark green. This was exactly like her dream! She roared with new found energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent was becoming less and less roomier by the second. Her body swelled with muscle and strong bones. She was towering over trees and buildings at this point. When her head bumped the top of the tent, she violently ripped it out of the ground. Terrified archeologists ran away in fear at the sight of her. She could almost laugh at the pathetic men, fleeing for their lives. Bloodlust filled her.</span></div></div>",

Only he seemed much smaller, like everything else around her. He was laughing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well.\" he spoke, \"Unsubtle, loud, and all the finesse of a bull. I would say this is a fitting form for you my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari gave a questioned look. To much the man laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You did not know? Well let me tell you...you are now a....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not hear what the man had said. The last word was mumbled and her eyesight was becoming foggy. A bright light appeared and Temari could only see whiteness. \"Temari!\" a voice called out. She tried to see who it was but only saw the old man's face laughing at her. \"TEMARI!\" came the voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temari! Wake up!\" said Kankur\u014d, \"It's almost noon already! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari slowly opened her eyes. She wasn't monstrous like she was in her dream, and the old man was no where in sight. Instead the painted face of her brother loomed over her with an annoyed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Temari? I never have to wake you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up...I was having a bad dream...\" she replied rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well listen. Someone destroyed one of the skeleton the expedition put together so they're all in a bad mood. It's your turn to scout around the site, I've had enough of the angry glares from them. They all seem to think WE did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari laughed nervously. \"Yea...how about that...Just let me get changed alright Kankur\u014d?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puppeteer left the tent to give his sister privacy. Oddly enough though, when she tried putting her sandals on they wouldn't fit. She didn't even notice that her feet were bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I just get these fitted for me? Oww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her tongue on something sharp in her mouth. Her felt around and it was her teeth, she were all sharper than usual. But Temari just dismissed these changes as tricks of her mind. This boring mission must have been going to her head. She left the tent and began her scouting barefoot, which was much more comfortable than walking around in shrunken shoes. During her patrol she came across... <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Temari kicked sand around with her giant feet, which did little to relief her from the heat. Being midday, the sun was unforgiving to all at the site. Objects in the distance flickered and danced, mocking those forced to work outside. Temari groaned and pulled her jacket over her sweating head. As she passed a dune she noticed something in the distance. A mirage perhaps? No this seemed very real. In one of the larger dunes there was a big door. Temari rubbed her eyes but the door did not disappear as she expected it to. She started walking over to it, expecting it to vanish. But instead it only grew larger and cleared the closer she came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why in the world is there a door in the middle of the desert?\" she asked to no on in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a stone brown door and looked almost like it belonged in some ruined temple. There was a large hand print in the center. Temari blinked. The hand in the center was glowing! It was calling her. She felt a desire to press her hand against and feel it's warmth. Slowly she reached her hand out until she made contact. The door exploded with a bright light and she was thrown aback, landing in the soft sand. The door had disappeared and instead had a gaping maw of darkness in it's place. It was a black entrance way. Without thinking for the second time in a row, she decided to step inside. However where she expected to be solid ground was a slippery ramp like surface, and she fell screaming down a giant slide leading to the depths of the dark below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cries of Temari drifted further away from hearing, someone approached the doorway. The old man Temari had yelled at earlier stood there shaking his head at the sight of the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So unsubtle and brute-like...I'm beginning to wonder if I made a mistake choosing this one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari had finally stopped screaming as she descended further down. Particularly because there was no hope of anyone outside hearing her now. But mostly because opening her mouth resulted in several mouthfuls of sand that filled the air. With a thump and another mouthful of the stuff, Temari had finally stopped sliding and landed face first into a mountain of sand. Spitting and coughing madly, she looked around to try to piece together where she was. It appeared to be an underground tomb, filled to the brim with dusty old pillars and piles of sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose trying to get back up would be a waste of time...\" she said to herself. The slide was far too slippery to even step on, despite being down here for what appeared to be ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari noticed a shaft of light coming from the ceiling. At least there was an opening somewhere. At the bottom of the beam stood an alter holding two large tablets. Temari sighed. This would be the THIRD time curiosity would get the better of her but she had to see what those tablets said. She made her way down the stone path to the alter. The entire place seemed incredibility durable. The altar hardly looked aged at all. Perhaps this place was still in use...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" she thought, \"That means at least someone will find me down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tablets had no words, only pictures divided into four parts between the two slabs of stone. The first picture looked like a man holding a skull much like the one on the dinosaur skeleton she had broken yesterday. The second had seemed to be the man, only quite a there were major differences in his appearance. He seemed to have adapted a large tail, his feet and legs were greatly larger as well. But the biggest change was his head, which had almost taken the form of the skull itself. The third picture seemed to be the man again completely changed into the likeness of the skeleton. The final one showed the former man with a shield in front of him. There appeared to be a temple in the background as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this exactly...?\" Sweat dropped from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will find out in time.\" spoke a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari felt a pain in the back of her head before everything went black.</span></div></div>",

What stood in the clearing was perhaps one of the most unusual animals she had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly a bird, judging by its big black father and beak. There was an impression of wings but the animal seemed too large to fly. Its neck and legs were elongated to almost bizarre proportions, which threw her off the most. It was also huge, much taller then she was by a good two feet or so. The bird was almost intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection, Hanabi noticed that one of its long legs was being lifted off the ground in a cradled position.

I'll take a look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird looked at her with eyes of understanding and cooed slightly. Sensing Hanabi's intent, it rested its legs and sat softly on the ground, sticking its bad leg out from under its feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a close look, Hanabi was able to see just how severe the injuries on the bird were. A giant gash at the base of the top of its legs suggested that the bird was probably in pain from walking. Though Hanabi knew a little bit of medical training, there was no way she could fix something like this. Something was bugging her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was this strange bird all the way out here in the middle of a clear field?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was quickly answered when she stepped over the tall grass next to the animal. To its side was a large mound covering a oval like object which was as white as snow. It was a giant egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi got momentarily distracted. \"Whoa...Look at the size of that thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't so much as turned her attention away from the bird fro five seconds, before looking bad and seeing that it was gone. It wasn't dead. It had simply vanished into thin air. There was no trace of it even being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Hanabi called out for the bird. \"Hello!? Birdie? Where did you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was long gone. Hanabi could just stand there, dumbfounded. Not even her Byakugan could see where it went. Then, she remembered the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still in the mound of sand and dirt, a white blemish amongst the drab and course ground. Something was drawing about the egg; its simple perfection and shape, its humongous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't just leave it there in the middle oft he field. Maybe that was the bird's intent all along. Hanabi reached down and scooped up the white orb, it was heavier then it looked. With as much tenderness as she could muster, she slid it into her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home.\" Muttered Hanabi to no one in particular as she stepped into the Hyuga mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emptiness of the house was not to be unexpected. Her father had left for an important meeting with the clan leaders of Konoha and another village, the other members apparently all had missions to take care of, and Hinata was of course still on her date with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, at least now she had something to do. The egg she had collected gave a warm glow from inside her backpack, but she'd have to build an incubator for it before it cooled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to kitchen, Hanabi began to gather the necessary materials needed for her little construction project. A light bulb, a large box, some soft cloth, she quickly found everything she needed. She turned to leave, with the items in hand, but paused when she noticed a small note on the side of the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hanabi, There's a nice tray of food in the oven that I made for you if you'd like. All you have to do is heat it up for ten minutes. I know you're training, but please try to remember to keep your strength up. You'll need all the help you can get. Love, your sister. Hinata.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi grunted and ripped the letter off the fridge, crumpling it up in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. I'm not weak like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of diligent planning and construction, the incubator was finally complete. Hanabi removed the large egg from her backpack and rested it in the box. She turned on the light and watched it glow off the egg shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, that was something captivating about the egg. It was like a little voice inside her head had told her to take it home with her and care for it. Then waste her entire afternoon making a nest for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she realized just how late it now was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven O'clock? Great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now everyone was probably home and had finished dinner, but it was too late in the day to start doing anything new. Plus, even though she did almost nothing today, Hanabi felt exhausted. She was about to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting one last look at the egg, she laid her head down on her pillow. Her stomach growled several times, angry with her because she hadn't eaten her meal her sister had made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Hinata...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

It didn't burn, but it was strangely warm and left a residing tingle in the palm of Hanabi's hand. Nothing hurt though, it just felt weird, almost numbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" She flexed her fingers slightly, making the strange feeling disappear. \"Odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to the egg again. It had to be the size of a basketball now and was pushing the walls of the cardboard box apart. She'd have to go get a new one to contain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left headed downstairs into the kitchen once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause it was still pretty early in the day, there still was no one up yet. The kitchen was still and tidy, as always. Hanabi had used a small box from some new appliance the family had bought for the first incubator, but clearly she'd have to find something bigger this time. Without hesitation, she began snooping around the garage for something useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanabi, what are you doing?\" Said a soft voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Hanabi jumped up in surprise, hitting her head on the counter over the garage can. She hadn't been expecting someone to catch her digging through trash, especially at this hour in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her head, she turned and looked at who had caught her. \"Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer older sister was still in her night clothes, she had a worried look on her face as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you lose something in the trash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi paused and tried to think of a quick excuse. \"I-I was just looking for a box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...It's for a project in the academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata thought for a moment. \"Well, there's an apple crate in the storage room. Would that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as it's big enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi stood up and brushed herself off, her older sister continued to give her a strange look making Hanabi nervous somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you staring at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something...wrong Hanabi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lied. \"No, it's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you know...You can tell me if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi snapped for a brief moment. Mostly out of irritation but somewhat because of something else. \"I'm fine! Nothing's wrong, okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stomped out of the kitchen heading for the storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not mom, Hinata! She's gone already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi didn't know if she should feel bad about lashing out at her sister like that. In fact, she didn't know why she felt like keeping the egg a secret anyway. It just seemed like a natural response for her, she felt strangely protective about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the box Hinata had told her about, it was a perfect size with plenty of room to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi used the excuse of being in a bad mood to justify snapping like that. She wasn't normally the emotional type, while she wasn't afraid to give her opinion on something she'd be mostly quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably because she hated being treated like a kid, especially by her older sister. Especially after their mother had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted her way up the stairs with the bulky box getting jammed through the hallway. If no one was up at this point in the morning, they'd sure to be now with all the noise she was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she managed to squeeze into her room with her prize. The egg was still sitting in the same spot she had left it in, looking no different then before save for its abnormal size. She placed the crate on the desk next to it and grabbed the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike last time, there was no strange tingling feeling when she touched it this time. Maybe it had cooled down somewhat since earlier. She scooped it in one arm and laid the towels from the old box into the new one with her free hand. At last, with everything in place, she gently placed the egg back into its protective nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could relax again now. Hanabi wiped her forehead clean of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand brushed against something odd in her hair though. Puzzled, she parted her long black hair and pulled the obstruction out, holding it in the light for her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short black feather.</span></div></div>",

Of course, fall was a still a far season from the freezing cold month of January. It was the first day of October in fact; the air still smelled faintly of pumpkin pie and wet leaves and the ground looked aflame with all the colors of the dying trees. Sakura sighed as she stared out of her window, waking from sleep on this fine autumn morning in Konoha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFall just meant more work. Plain and simple. People needed to get their houses mended for the upcoming winter, people needed leaves raked and gathered, people needed to gather food in the fields before winter's frost came. Grunt work. Dull work. If she were Naruto she'd be angrily voicing her opinions to anyone with the bad fortune to possess ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another day...Another yen...\" She muttered to herself, stretching her legs out and placing them barefoot on the cold floor. Complaining about everything wasn't going to get it done any faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the picture of her two teammates and their sensei, that was all the motivation she needed to get the day started. Like a jolt of electricity, she jumped into place. Ready for the daily grind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Sakura had eaten breakfast, gotten dressed, and combed her hair. She was presently walking along the streets of Konoha, humming merrily and trying not to think about what sort of mission they would have to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers seemed different today than they normally would be. Cheerier and happy. Maybe it was the bright cloudless sky contrasting with the colors of the leaves that brightened everyone's mood. That's when Sakura noticed them setting up decorations. Colorful figures and designs of bright orange and midnight black aligned the buildings and store windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...Is there a party going on or something?\" Sakura asked to herself, stopping from her walk to her team's meeting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had been paying attention, she would have noticed the large container of pumpkin slowly backing up towards her. The driver hadn't seen her and continued in his attempt to pull into the street corner Sakura was standing in front of. Just as he was inches away from running into her, a quick black blur swooped her up and pulled her out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Was the only thing she had time to say, only just releasing she had been so close to being run over. She looked up at her rescuer. \"S-Sasuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven haired boy huffed a breath of air. \"You're usually at least a little bit more alert than this in the morning Sakura...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put her down on the ground again, Sakura started blushing madly. Sasuke had actually HELD her! She continued to absentmindedly stare at him until he seemed to get annoyed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" He said gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...nothing. Sorry. Wh-what's with all these decorations? Is there some sort of event going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke sighed. \"You're as bad as Naruto...Don't tell me you two forgot about the talk with Kakashi yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halloween!\" Shouted Lady Tsunade to Team Seven as they stared blankly at the over-excited Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Said Naruto, with a look on his face that said he just woke up. \"What is Hollow e'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade cleared her throat. \"Well, HALLOWEEN, is a tradition created in some other countries. It's the day where ghosts and other horrors are rumored to become intertwined with our own world for just one night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the sound of that.\" Said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing to be worried about. Those are just stories. Really, it's a holiday that celebrates autumn. Its a giant celebration of the mysteries of the night, with carving pumpkins, wearing costumes, and eating candies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating candies?\" Said Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wearing costumes?\" Asked Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Muttered Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi spoke up from behind the group. \"Perhaps it would be wise to explain why it is you're telling us about this Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just getting to it. Basically, this is our attempt to assimilate an outside culture's traditions into our own for the benefit of the village, possibly resulting in a boost in trade and outside income.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked like his brain short circuited. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed. \"We're trying to become familiar with the holiday so we can attract other country's business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade continued and pointed at Naruto, \"And I need young folks like you to be on top of things, making sure all goes well. This holiday generally focuses on kids your age and younger. I'm depending on the younger genin to make this a smashing success. That includes getting involved with it yourselves.\" She stared at Sasuke who grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else is working with us?\" Asked Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...I asked all of the Rookie Nine so far...I thought that would be enough by Guy INSISTED that his team was youthful enough to be put up to the challenge, so there's Lee, Tenten and Neji too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want us to do, exactly?\" Sasuke reluctantly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help around. There will be events during the month that I'd like you to attend. Plus you'll need costumes.\" Grinned Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked over her teammates, Naruto seemed generally excited with doing something new for once. Though anyone could tell Sasuke was not enjoying the idea of dressing up in costume, nor being involved with these activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and before I forget. I need you three to head over to the local abandoned inn for starters. You'll meet the others there and you can starting setting it up for the first event. The Pumpkin Ball...\"</span></div></div>",

Many of the proud village's structures seemed decrepit, all of the old timbers now warped and rotting, with ancient paint chipping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was only noon, the sole blonde of the group began to shiver. This fact was noticed by both of his peers as they trod on, demolishing numerous dead leaves with their sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Naruto, it isn't that chilly out,\" Sakura said peevishly, her breath slightly visible now, \"so you really shouldn't be shaking like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's not the cold, it's this part of the village,\" Naruto explained, looking at his surroundings fearfully, \"It's just so old and creepy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, what's the matter you big chicken?\" Sasuke taunted, more out of boredom than true malice, \"Do a few broken down houses and shops scare really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up you jerk!\" Naruto yelled at his onyx haired rival, his aqua eyes showing anger. \"I bet your scared too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if.\" The avenger of the Uchiha clan stated evenly. \"Let's just get to the Inn already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with those words spoken, the group's lone wolf jumped from the ground to a nearby roof, and hopped into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sasuke, wait for us!\" Sakura called out, not wanting to be abandoned by her object of affection, before she imitated his actions, she called out to the trio's wild card, \"Hurry up Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I'm comin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, the three young teens found themselves before an immense building. Before it, there was an archaic sign that read 'Fright Inn', the words freshly painted onto faded timber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it's glory days, the place might've been a quality lodging, but in it's current and ruined form, it seemed far from hospitable...like a spirit it housed within.</span></div></div>",

The way up was draped with an old velvet red carpeting that looked like moths had been at it. The waiting room had plenty of furniture, old and decrepit just like hotel. The other team members had made themselves comfortable on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the last team arrives, finally.\" Said Neji who was leaning against the rock wall fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee had run up to Sakura, taken her hand and kissed it. \"Hello Sakura, my sweet! Fear not, we would have waited months for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura frowned in disgust, wiping her 'contaminated' hand on her shirt. \"It's good to see you too Lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke looked around, everyone was there. Neji, Lee, Tenten, Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, Hinata, and Shino. All perched in or near a couch gathered around the fireplace with a decapitated moose head overlooking the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really needed this many people for this?\" Said Kiba with an annoyed tone as Akamaru barked in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone has to do it...As tiresome as it is...\" Muttered Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do we have to be here? This place gives me the creeps...\" Asked Naruto as he shuddered. The air seemed...haunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same...\" Replied Choji as he shivered. \"I can't even eat...It feels like we're being watched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop it please.\" Tenten said trying to act tough, but in truth she had the same bad feeling as both of them. \"What are we waiting for anyway? Shouldn't we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji took the role of leader. \"Agreed. I believe Lady Tsuande mentioned Kakashi will be coming here with supplies to decorate the building. In the meantime, we should split up and start cleaning the inn. Let's go in groups of two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja shuffled around the room trying to find partners. Naruto went to go with Sakura but she had already chosen Sasuke, much to the raven haired boy's dismay. Hinata, however, worked up the courage to ask Naruto to go with her to which the blonde happily agreed to. After cursing at Sakura for several minutes, Ino reluctantly chose to go with Shikamaru. Choji was stuck with Lee, as Neji and Tenten already partnered up. Lastly, Kiba and Shino decided to go together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's take time to look around, meet back here in an hour. Don't touch anything that looks dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you a-alright Naruto?\" Asked Hinata as the pair traveled through the halls of the inn. The place was like a maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had bundled up in his jacket, he was freezing for some reason. \"I just can't shake the feeling that...something's wrong about this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay...I feel the s-same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's comforting...\" Said Naruto as he poked a small fancy vase facing a window. \"You try using your eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...I couldn't find anything a-abnormal about the house...We're c-completely alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just the nine-tailed fox, but it felt like there was a heavy presence hanging over the entire area. Like someone had left the window open, causing a draft. It was a chilly sensation. The kind of feeling that shook you to the bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's head back to the entrance hall. Maybe it's been an hour already.\" Shuddered Naruto, knowing full-well it had only been 15 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they hastily walked back to the meeting place, a small dark figure peaked a tiny red out out of the vase Naruto had been poking moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shikamaru, I swear! I'm more of a man than anyone else on my team!\" Yelled Ino, as Shikamaru stopped to grab his head from a sudden pain. \"Don't tell me you're falling for this 'bad feeling' crap too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not...just...have a sudden headache...Troublesome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever! When you feel more like a man, you can catch up!\" Ino still seemed pretty peeved about missing the chance to be alone with Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know what's scarier...Ghosts...or Women...\" Muttered Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having the time alone with her lover, like she desired, Sakura couldn't help but not feel any joy at all. Maybe the others were right. Maybe there WAS something here, something watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides Sasuke wasn't much for conversation at the moment. He seemed too interested in getting this mission done and over with so he could move on to more important things, like training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed and they continued their search through the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, they all met back in the main hall. Somewhere along their search, each of them felt something off about the hotel, though none of them said a word about it. Again, Neji took charge of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Anyone find anything out of the ordinary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba said. \"Nothing at all, just a really creepy old house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creepy is an understatement.\" Replied Tenten. \"Look! We can actually see our breathes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji stopped the conversation. \"Enough. I've already used Byakugan at every inch of the house. There's nine trained ninjas in this place, if anything WAS here we'd know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn't get cliched enough, right after Neji's outburst loud thunder was heard out, followed by the pelting of raindrops on the roof. Lee walked over to the window and looked up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd...There wasn't a cloud in the sky when we came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is haunted.\" Muttered Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's not haunted for the last time.\" Said Neji, getting angry. \"We've clearly all had a long day. Kakashi should be here at any moment. Let's just get a fire going and try to find some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group collected some firewood and lit up a roaring flame under the moose head. Even the bright fire was not enough to cheer the ninja's spirits. Most of them kept to themselves, eating some hardened ramen they found in the storehouse of the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door of the inn. Kakashi was standing there dripping wet with two giant backpacks full of what was presumably decorations. He plopped down the massive containers and greeted the teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey. Good to see everyone made it. Sorry I'm late, I was stopped by some robbers and-\" He paused and looked in the distance as if sensing something. He then turned pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...Kakashi-sensei? Are you alright?\" Asked Sakura with increasing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?...Oh...Yes...Apologizes Sakura...I...I think I need to sit down for a moment. We'll start work on the inn tomorrow, everyone pick a room and get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he walked off to the upper rooms, leaving the rest of the team looking at each other nervously. Like any of them could sleep now.</span></div></div>",
