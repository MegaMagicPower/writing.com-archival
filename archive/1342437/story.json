The fact they were completely non-fertile meant no litters of kids, which was also a plus, cause while Kant loved sex, he wasn't really keen on fatherhood yet. The thought of what she could do with an entire town of tiny, living toys started to tighten his pants. Amy noted the reaction, and smiled, \"Then what are we waiting for, dear?

Smaller and smaller the settlement became, until it was hardly twenty feet long at the longest. Kant reached for his radio to report the success of the second shot, then turned to Amy, \"Go have some fun until I hear back from them. Knowing them, they'll want a third shot so we can pick up their little town there and hand-deliver it to Supreme Command.\" He smiled as her eyes lit up, and she kissed him, then stripped down to the bikini she was wearing when he said they were going to the lake. Kant watched as she sauntered her way over to the incredibly tiny Lupin settlement, with its population of Lupins hardly the size of ants, and couldn't help but for a moment want to be in their position...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Lupin settlement, things had been definately interesting. Over the course of the past few minutes there had been two disturbances in the sky, though since the Prime Alpha had informed the pupulace that they would be conducting some aerial testing, though when the ground shook, that was something new. There hadn't been a quake in this region for years, decades even. Though, it happened again, and then the sky grew dark, and then the screaming. Lupins looked up, and up, and up at the sight before them. Looming over their proud settlement was a female figure, one of the erminoids, though she was impossibly enormous. The tallest buildings came up to about her ankles, and while the sensation of fear crept through the entire city, the ermine was putting out her scent of arousal, and at this size, it choked the air, causing most of the males to simply stand and gawk at this colossal titan of a mink. That air of arousal and desire turned to fear as the titanic mink stepped over their city, her massive paw obliterating dozens of city blocks, though that was nothing compared to the damage she caused when she knelt down, straddling the center of their city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood before the shrunken Lupin settlement, her breathing heavy with the thoughts of what she and Kant were going to do to the people here. No, they weren't people, not anymore. They were insects, toys for her amusement and pleasure. From the top of one of their taller buildings, she saw a flash of light and smiled. \"Oooo, one of them is trying to get my attention.\" She smirked, and stepped over the building that was shining at her, and placed her dainty feet on either side of it, then slowly kneeled down, straddling the building. She looked down along the length of her body to the tiny skyscraper. \"Well, sweetie, you got my attention. Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the roof of the skyscraper was a lone Lupin with a high-powered spot-light, hoping that he could signal this massive mink for help. He then was struck speechless as she moved across their city and soon his view was nothing less of heavenly. On either side of the building he was standing on were her beautiful thighs. Craning his neck up, he saw the rest of her curved figure, though the site before him was spectacular... a bikini bottom that could easily double as the site of the next Olympic games. When her voice boomed down like thunder, it snapped him out of his trance, and he took the light and shined it back up towards her, hoping she knew Morse Code...</span></div></div>",

It's nothing but a bug not even worth giving a gender. A few shouts are heard from behind and it seems more are coming to examine the village, many species did, after all, want to see the wolves reduced to nothing, they were a threat. Amy seems to ignore this, and instead she brings the skyscraper towards her massive breasts, turning it on its side so that the little wolf is forced into a free fall towards her chest, destined to be lost or crushed between two massive furry globes of flesh or if he's lucky, he'll simply land atop one and have to hang on for dear life.</span></div></div>",

Upwards he traveled, his ears popping once or twice during the ascent until he stood in the presence of her beautiful face. She was lovely, despite being hundreds of times his size. He stood and marveled at her features, her lovely eyes, her adorable smile, and he chanced a look over the side of the skyscraper to see a pair of massive breasts jutting from her chest, each the size of several city blocks, each! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he marveled, he heard her giggle lightly, and then the skyscraper began to tilt, and he found himself plummeting towards those lovely, city-scaled breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy held her breath as the tiny speck of a Lupin fell from the top of the skyscraper, and watched as he fell and fell, then landed with a nearly unfelt thump upon the fur and flesh of her barely clothed breast, and she shivered. She watched him as he was swallowed by the short fur of her breast, and smiled in anticipation of what awaited the tiny fur. She plucked up a few sections of an overland train with a smirk, and slowly stood to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred held on for dear life as he stood up to his chest in the fine and short fur of her breast, holding tighter as she rose to her full height, and then stepped out of their city. He looked over and saw who was yelling, it was a female mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mice! Damn them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts of vengeance were cut short when he remembered all too well his current predicament. Hardly a tenth of an inch tall, holding onto the fur of a mink's breast for dear life, the mouse would literally make short work of him, pun or no pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did everything work?\" The Mouse asked Kant and Amy. Kant smiled, motioning to the city, \"Sure did. Headquarters is going to want to give them pups another shot, though, just to drive the point home.\" to which the mouse nodded, then looked at Amy, \"Then hold onto your's, sweetie. Those Lupin are about to become collector's items.\" She took a few steps back, \"Okay Kant, tell your people to fire when ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKant and Amy hurried back to the line of bushes, and Kant noticed the tiny speck on Amy's breast. He lowered himself down to be eye level with it, and smirked, \"Not such hot shit now, are you? Well, prepare to be a giant among your people, you little flea. Headquarters is going maximum reduction on this shot, so your entire city should fit in the palm of my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred was horrified at the prospect of that, and though he shouted out to the gargantuan Felin to stop, he watched the giant cat rise to his full height, and while staring at the speck on his girlfriend's breast, call in the strike. \"We're all clear, command. Fire when ready.\" and within seconds, a beam of energy arced overhead, towards the Lupin city.</span></div></div>",

He screamed and shook, careful not to lose his grip, cause if he died now, it would all be in vain. Though, when the Mouse confirmed that the city was still there, it made him feel a little better. At least they didn't shrink out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lupins in the city were terrified. First they saw a gigantic mink walk in and ruin their city merely by kneeling in it, then they watched a Mouse appear on scene. Now, the Mice were among the most technologically advanced peoples on Beldor, though they were also known for serving both sides of a war. Though, they watched another beam of light envelope their city, and watched the Mouse grow larger, and larger, until the very blades of grass around the city blocked out the view from the inside. The entire city was shrinking, though the people in the city were powerless to stop it. Soon, it all ended. Well, the shrinking at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mouse walked over to the tiny tiny city, and with the most careful approach she could, she dug her hand under the city, and picked up the plot of dirt that held the tiny, six inch long city. \"Here you go, completely intact.\" She giggled, holding the city at about chest level for Kant and Amy to see. They came over and were in shock. \"Tha.. That's the city?!\" Amy exclaimed, and Kant smiled, \"Yup, Amy, there it is... Just the right size for those miserable Lupins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mouse girl smirked, \"Don't I get to have any fun first?\" the Felin just smiled and nodded, \"Sure thing. This is all because of you and your people, so what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mouse smiled, saying nothing, and brought the city up to her face, peering down at the dust-sized Lupin swarming all over. Utter chaos and panic were filling the streets, but not as much as when the Mouse dealt out her punishment. It was simple really, and Amy got a little weak in the knees as she watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mouse breathed in through her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lupins in the city panicked as the earth shook, watching the titanic mouse girl grow closer and closer. She leaned down, and did the unthinkable: She picked up their entire city with one hand! They held a conversation that shook the city like thunder, and then the city rose up to meet the face of the mouse girl. She smiled, a smile that almost was as wide as the entire city, then a force five hurricane wind pulled hundreds of Lupins up off the street and into her flared nostrils. Lupins screamed and held on for dear life as their fellow man flew upwards, and then disappeared inside the muzzle of a Mouse, either tangled up in her sinuses, or if they were unlucky, they made it down into her lungs, where they'd most likely never escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled, this was her kind of mouse. \"Kant, sweetie, you can take the city back to your commander, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKant was just in shock, after watching this five foot nothing mouse girl literally snort a few hundred Lupin up her nose. He snapped out of it and nodded with a stupid grin, \"Y.. Yeah, I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled, and sauntered her way over to the Mouse, purring, \"Good, cause I think I want to turn our relationship into a three-way.\" Kant took a look at the mouse girl and realized that for a nerdy mouse, she was pretty damn attractive. The glasses even added to the appeal, that and the way she casually snorted up those Lupin was having an effect on him. The girls giggled in unison, with the mouse speaking up first, \"Name's Cindy, and if it helps you make a decision, Kant, I can always arrange for you to accidentally suffer the Scaler's effects. Six inches tall for a weekend with the two of us...\" She smirked as she handed over the tiny Lupin city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKant was aroused enough to explode, though managed to keep his cool when he was handed the Lupin city. \"T... Tell you what ladies... Meet you at Amy's place in a few hours?\" The girl's nodded, \"See you there, shortie.\" Cindy said, and Kant headed off to hand-deliver ultimate victory to his supreme commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now, Amy?\" Cindy said, nudging the mink with her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled, and held up the train, then pointed to the tiny speck on her breast, \"I say we have ourselves some fun. Kant'll be gone for hours, so let's get to know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred looked up in worry as both of these enormous females looked down at him simultaneously. Cindy giggled, running a hand over her nose, then her chest, \"I can feel them squirming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyplace else you want to feel them squirm?\" Amy purred as she led Cindy to her car.</span></div></div>",

At the same moment, hundreds of other Lupine cities were being similarly shrunken and carried off as prizes of war. In effect, the entire Lupine species had been reduced to the size of ants, and were to be stripped of all rights. Some Feline extremists advocated that the Lupines should be completely exterminated, but fortunately the voice of more moderate elements carried the day and it was instead decided the Lupines would be kept around as slaves and snacks for the Felines and their allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKant's orders had been merely to deliver the city to General Fashra intact, but already these orders have been violated by the interruption of his girlfriend and the mouse girl who had snorted hundreds up her nostrils. Kant was still horny from the flirting of the girls, and the feeling of immense power he now held over millions of specks did not help to keep his boner down. As he gazed at the tiny city with his enormous green eyes he decided it wouldn't hurt to have a little taste. Kant's mouth watered in anticipation as he raised the tiny city to his waiting maw and took a tiny nibble off the outer edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire city was in an uproar as millions of wolves screamed and panicked over their new shrunken dilemma. All over the city wolves scrambled every which way in a futile attempt to escape, but there was no where to go except for a drop of hundreds of miles to their death. The Wolves had always been a predator species, and had never known a situation such as this where they were now not only the prey, but such a small and insignificant prey that their entire city wouldn't even fill the stomach of their new Feline overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kant only wanted a \"taste\". His enormous fanged maw gently nibbled off a tiny section of the city which he eagerly snatched up with his rough tongue. This section of the city was so small that it was doubtful General Fashra would notice it was missing, and this way Kant could find be the very first of his species to find out what shrunken wolf meat tasted like. Still, this \"tiny\" section of the city encompassed about two blocks full of houses and apartment buildings with about 100,000 lupine men, women, and children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKant felt as powerful as a god as he rolled the buildings around inside of his salivating mouth, drenching the concrete and metal structures in feline saliva. He could taste the fear and sense the screams of his unnatural prey. </span></div></div>",

She only stares for a moment, enjoying the pleasure, the aesthetics of the tiny wolf, moving her finger after a moment to press into his body lightly and make circular motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the wolf it's almost like an elephant sat on his body, the massive finger inescapable and easily pinning and rolling his form around the warm, sweet smelling palm of the giantess. Needless to say he's a bit bruised up after the simplistic motions and after that huge finger lifts again and a couple of rumbles that could only be giggles are heard, he realizes just how hopeless this situation is. Still, he felt it best to ask.. \"W-why?\" He asks, swallowing as he gains the attention of the two who somehow understand. Amy is first to speak,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were becoming too powerful, almost as technologically advanced as us. We had to make sure you wouldn't begin to think of yourselves as a true power. Truthfully you've done nothing wrong other than set out on a quest for knowledge, doesn't that suck?\" She says with a smile that struck fear and despair into his chest. \"W-what about the felines?\" He asks, Amy grinning and answering this one, \"What about them? Think you're better just because your a wolf?\" She asks. Jarred shakes his head quickly, \"N-no! But why do only we deserve this?\" Cindy speaks up again, \"we've had the scaler pointing down their throats the entire time. They're leader is obedient to us and because of this we get to kill two birds with one stone. No more technological threat, and the felines get rid of an age old enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this revelation Jarred can only whine, ears pressed to his head as he stares at the menacing figures, \"Oops, we're home..\" Amy says, and the wolf has to cling to the fur of the breast again, the force of the turn almost knocking him off the massive breast. \"I think we'll have alot of fun with our little Lupin friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's nose twitches, \"Mrf, my nose itches.\" She grins widely down at Jarred before getting out of the car.</span></div></div>",

Two incredibly attractive females were making out, on a scale that boggled the imagination. When they start hugging each other tighter, the landscape of Amy's bosom rises, making it harder for Jarred to continue to stare up at the two of them, though he keeps his balance throughout the ordeal. Once the two break their kiss, Cindy lowers herself to be level with Amy's breast, and gives the tiny Lupin clinging to her breast-fur a smile, then starts to lean closer to her massive breast. Jarred screams as the massive pink tongue of the titanic mouse begins to drag over the fur surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CINDY! NOOO!\" Jarred yells, holding up his hands as though his insignificant strength would stop the tongue of this massive mouse. Though, the tongue never draws him into her gaping maw, but it does come very close on more then one occasion. \"She... She's playing with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy purrs, running her hand through Cindy's hair as the mouse drags her tongue along her breast. \"Careful not to... \" she really can't finish, though she thought she heard a scream from her breast, and she shivered. \"Cindy.\" She looked at the mouse who looked up from her cleavage. \"Yes, Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bedroom.\" She breathed out, \"You've got an itch? Well I've got one too.\" she grabs her handbag that has the Lupin trains in it, and leads the mouse to her bedroom. Meanwhile, on the mink's breast, Jarred has avoided disaster, though all around him there's the matted landscape of recently-licked fur. He holds on tighter as his world begins to bob and bounce as the stunning minkette and her new mouse girlfriend arrive in her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls sit on the bed, and Amy hands Cindy one of the trains. \"Here, you should definitely get yourself a Lupin boyfriend. They're awesome, and obedient, and they'll probably fit in all the right places.\" Amy smiles, then looks down at Jarred with a grin, \"Hope you don't mind me saying we're an item, shortie?\" and Jarred weighed his options. Were he normal size, this minkette offering herself to him would be accepted with hardly a second thought, though the fact that he was currently a tenth of an inch tall and standing on the swell of her bikini-clad breast changed the issue. Never-the-less, he yells back up, \"Given the circumstances, do I have a choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy purred, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy took the train and held it between her fingers. \"Honestly, Amy... I prefer girls.\" and she smiled over at the minkette, who returned the grin. Ideas ran through her head as she took her free hand and slid her panties off, then held a fingertip up to the doorway of the train, \"Alright, I want the prettiest girl in this train on my finger in fifteen seconds. Otherwise, well, the train may make an unscheduled stop...\"</span></div></div>",

Why not put him in the train?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiles over at Amy, \"Because I was thinking of putting the train in you.\" The mink blinked, then purred and started to spread her legs. Cindy stopped her with a gentle paw on her thigh, \"We need to put Jarred someplace where he won't get away, and won't get hurt... hmmm..\" Cindy thought, then smiled, plucking up her panties with a foot. \"Amy, take off your bikini briefs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled, and slowly slid the green bikini briefs down off of her, careful not to dislodge the tiny tiny Lupin clinging to her breast. Soon, she was holding the garment in her hand with a smirk, \"Okay Cindy, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred watched from his perch on Amy's magnificent furred breast as she removed her bikini briefs with a grace that such a massive creature shouldn't have. He needed to keep reminding himself that he was tiny, rather then her being huge. Cindy's plan worried him, though the next few instructions terrified him, and aroused him to no end. The thumb and finger of Amy's hand snatched him up off of her chest as Cindy instructed her to pluck him up, then the fingers holding him hovered over the crotch of Amy's recently removed bikini bottom, and slowly they started to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred knew that struggling was useless, since the minkette's finger-pad was larger then he was, though there was another reason he wasn't struggling, in that he really didn't mind his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled lightly as the fingers that held the tiny tiny Lupin got closer and closer to her bikini bottoms. \"He's not even fighting.\" to which Cindy giggled, \"He must really want to get in your pants then.\" Amy brought her hand holding Jarred closer to her bikini bottom, then let go, and let the tiny wolf plummet into the soft and arousal-soaked moistness of her undergarment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred fell for what felt like a dozen stories, before landing on the soft material with a wet squish. At first he was curious as to what he landed in, then he took a sniff of the air and immediately realized that he was literally soaking in the dampness of Amy's arousal. His entire predicament and powerlessness in her hands was the ultimate turn on for her, and now here he was, a tiny ant-sized wolf, laying on his back in her bikini briefs. She must be horny enough to fuck a tree, or as the conversation was going, fuck a train at this point. Though, the face of the Mouse girl came into view over the edge of the bikini, and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so tiny! Well, let's make sure he can't get out, or rather, let's make sure he doesn't *want* to get out.\" And with that, Cindy took her own discarded and damp panties, turned them inside out, and placed them over Amy's bikini briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world turned from a wide open sky to a dull pink sky as Cindy placed her panties over Jarred's world. The scent of the mouse's arousal mixed with the scents that minks were legendary for, and he almost lost control right there. The air was thick with the smell of sex, and he was starving for attention. The fabric surrounding him on the ground was so soft, and thick with the giantess mink's scent, while the sky above him was such a lovely shade of pink, and silken by the looks of it. He felt his world being laid down, and while a tiny voice in his mind said that now was the time to try to escape, he honestly didn't want to be anywhere else in the world right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, except maybe on the U-7 Train...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy put the 'prison' of panties on the side of her bed, and smiled at Cindy who was sitting between her thighs, licking the length of one of the Lupin trains. \"Now, about what you said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, about putting this train in you? Oh absolutely.\" Cindy smirked, lowering the bullet-train to Amy's awaiting sex, sliding the metal craft along her aroused lips. Amy sighed, sliding her hands along her thighs, \"Will it... make it through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled, \"These trains are practically indestructible. As long as the little Lupins don't want a lesson in Minkette anatomy, and stay in the train, they'll be fine. Ready?\" Amy sighed, and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lupins aboard the train panicked as they saw their destination. They slammed their hands against the doors, but with the titanic mouse holding the doors shut, they were trapped. Some panicked and cried, others ran to a seat and buckled their safety belt. They braced for the inevitable, and then they were pushed back against their seats, the view from the front of the train zooming through, from the lips and the very edges of the minkette's sex, to a thick slimy tunnel of darkness as their train was plunged deep within her. Over the distant heartbeat of the mammoth minkette, they heard the voice of the mouse, and those that were still conscious knew they'd be in here for a long, long time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy pushed the train into Amy as deep as she could, then pulled back empty fingers. Amy moaned in ecstasy as the train plunged deep into her, the sensation of all those Lupins trapped within her intoxicating to the minkette. Cindy smiled, and lay her head against Amy's crotch, speaking as though to the inhabitants of the train, \"Last stop, Amy's Tunnel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside a prison made of bikinis and panties, Jarred shuddered. Sure, he was ashamed of himself a little, and while being held captive in a pair of football stadium sized panties wasn't erotic enough, listening to the two of them drove him to the brink. Besides, no one would even notice the stain.</span></div></div>",

Cindy's hands upon her chest and her tongue halfway in her mouth didn't hurt the situation either. Amy's hands roamed along Cindy's form, sliding under her shirt and along the curve of her naked hip as the two titanic females enjoyed each others physical attributes. Each motion Amy made shook the tiny train within her, shaking the inhabitants filling that train, and their echoing screams of terror echoed within her darkest depths, and she swore that she could hear them inbetween moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot more then two feet from the mingling lovers was a pair of panties laid over a pair of bikini bottoms, and nestled within said undergarments was a tiny tiny male Lupin, who has since become completely covered in the thick goop of Amy's excitement that soaked the garment landscape he was in. Though the silken haze of the pink sky, he could watch Amy and Cindy make out on a scale that only increased his arousal. He had already tended to himself a number of times, and was becoming less and less ashamed of the act. The smell of sex surrounded him, it was soaked into his fur, in every dripping drop of goo that soaked him, and in the sky above was another pair of undergarments similarly filling the air with arousal. The moans of the two titanesses didn't help either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy lay in Amy's arms as the mink gently rolled her hips, milking every bit of pleasure she could from the shrunken transit vehicle within her. The two of them shared a smile and another quick kiss, then Cindy reached for the pile of undergarments. \"I want to play with Jarred for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy couldn't move she was so spent, \"Wait, play how?\" she smiled. Cindy replied, \"Well, play, as in I may take my scaler, and make him a little bigger, then mistake him for a handsome train...\" she giggles, \"Or... make him even smaller, and just lose him in me for a half hour or so, or just keep him as is, and let him go spelunking.\" She grinned. \"Short answer, Amy... I want Jarred inside. Though maybe...\" Cindy turned her attention to the other train they had, then plucked it up and held it up to eye level, \"Anyone in there looking for a good time with some really handsome wolf and lil' ole me?\" </span></div></div>",

When the Felines were going to hit their city with the Scaler, I was actually on my way to make sure he made it out okay. So, in a way, thanks for having that huge soft chest of your's.\" She smiled, and then put the train back in Amy's bag. \"Looks like it's just you and me, Jarred.\" she giggled as she reached for the pantie prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred looked up fondly as Cindy's face came into view through the pink sky, then the pink sky was lifted, and her face was all he saw. \"Heya tiny.\" She smiled down at him, \"Feel like getting lost somewhere?\" She slowly reached down with her thumb and forefinger, and plucked the tiny Lupin up out of Amy's bikini. She placed him in the center of her other palm, and then brought that palm up to eye level for both the girls. \"Okay, honestly... is it really that bad being as small as you are, around us girls?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred weighed his options, and then considered that if Amy's boyfriend were here, his situation would probably be much much worse. These girls were not only beautiful, but were more playful then angry. Hell, he just spent the past half hour in their panties watching them make out. It wasn't really all that bad, at least for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, not really.\" Jarred's response came. Cindy and Amy smiled down at him, then Cindy spoke up, \"Finally got you where I want you, cutie. Here's the plan, I want you inside me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred looked up at Cindy, curiously terrified, \"Wait, what?\" then it hit him, \"Cindy, I don't know about that. I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled, and shook her head, \"Relax, you'll be fine. Besides, part of me says to use my portable scaler to either make you bigger, for well... a better fit, or smaller, just for the feeling of you getting lost inside me.\" Cindy reaches into her handbag, and pulls out a deceptively simple-looking hand weapon. \"Before you get your hopes up, shortie, it's temporary. A shot from this would only last you like a half hour, in either direction, so if you're looking to use this to get revenge, then you better be able to kick every Feline's ass in half an hour.\" Cindy smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred nodded in her palm, \"I probably could...\" he smirked, though he wasn't sure if the titanic mouse could see it. Cindy smiled, \"You always were a joker. Alright then, Jarred, for old time's sake, this choice is yours.\" Cindy then lowered the palm with Jarred on it down between her smooth thighs, presenting Jarred with a sight he had seen before, ages ago it seems, and certainly not this huge... Cindy's womanhood. It glistened with her arousal, mostly Amy's fault, but it was definitely hungry and Lupin was on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The choice, Jarred, is whether or not I use the scaler on you first. It'll be my call if you get bigger or smaller though, so watch out. Otherwise, you're going in, just as you are.\" Cindy purred though her excitement. Jarred weighed the options of the choice, which was a tough thing considering he could hardly think through the musk of Cindy's arousal. Finally, he made his choice, and called up...</span></div></div>",

He chanced a glance up at Cindy, then to Amy, both of which were in their own forms of ecstasy. Amy had an entire train parked inside of her, while Cindy was just anxious to start up an old fling. The only trick now was that she was the dominant one, and he was just a toy for her, and food for her needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't sound half bad, the wolf thought as he made it to her finger pad. Cindy smiled over at Amy, then put the scaler back in her handbag, and then leaned back and got into a more comfortable position. She spread her thighs, giving Amy a nice show as she spread open her womanhood with her now free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, how adorable.\" Amy cooed, still shivering as she felt the train inside her. The Lupins inside the train were shouting and cursing and screaming, though she thought she heard some rational discussions in there, but it was hard to really focus. Cindy smiled, \"Thanks. Kinda makes me wish the folks on your train had cameras.\" then she got an idea... \"Hey Jarred, do you have a camera on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the mouse's fingertip, the tiny tiny Lupin nodded, \"I have a cell phone!\" he called out. Cindy smiled, and brought the finger with the Lupin on it down the length of her body to her open and waiting sex. \"Then take plenty of pictures while I let some light in.\" and slowly she slid the finger with Jarred on it into her waiting and hungry depths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred watched as the world around him became a pink glistening tunnel. Slick goo covered the walls and clung to the fingers that held it open as the finger he was on slid deeper and deeper into the mouse girl. He took out his cell phone, and took as many pictures as the phone's storage would allow, then secured the phone and waited. He knew Cindy wanted him, and not just to take pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy giggled through a moan of pleasure. \"Okay Jarred, that should be enough time for a shutterbug like you. Jump off my finger. I'll fish you out in a while.\" She smiled at Amy, and then a tiny shudder went through her as she felt Jarred jump off her fingertip and land on the slick, sensative flesh within her. Carefully, she withdrew her finger, then let herself close up, and showed off the barren finger to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How deep in is he, Cindy?\" Amy asked as she watched Cindy shudder. Cindy smiled back, \"Deep enough to not come out until I want him too.\" Amy got a little worried, \"Will he be okay in there? I mean, my little toys have a train to play in, he's got...\" and Cindy put a smile on, \"Scaler does weird things to you when you go to extremes. Giants don't crush themselves when they stand up, and tinies don't explode due to air pressure. We never really figured it out, all I know is that Jarred'll be fine for a while. Though, I may want to take him out before he never wants to come out.\" She giggles, and lay against her mink girlfriend, feeling her tiny new boyfriend slip and stumble around her inner depths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jarred, it was dark, hot, wet, and slimy, and he could hardly see the nose on his muzzle, but every move he made made Cindy shudder, so it felt good to be in control of something again.  </span></div></div>",

He enjoys the feeling of the tight muscular tunnel around his fingers while he feels around for the little train, eventually catching it between two fingers and, just as slowly as he entered, exiting the vagina.

Though, he smiled, and placed the jar on the bed next to him. \"First Amy, we need to get you in a better position to receive your guests.\" he said as he reached down to lift her legs up, putting her ankles on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now sweetie, spread 'em.\" He smiled as he reached for the jar again, almost barely could he hear the screams of the tiny tiny motes of the Lupins within as those who could see outside saw the most horrifying and arousing thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath them, like a gaping maw, was Amy's spread vagina, glistening and gleaming, and miles deep. The owner of said gaping maw, the minkette Amy, had a look on her face of utter and complete arousal and anticipation, almost begging Kant to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy, meanwhile, was watching with intense interest. She sat down near the two of them on a nightstand, her hips slowly rocking as her tiny charge, the miniscule Lupin named Jarred, moved around within her. Though, her bliss was broken when her cell phone rang. She smiled, though as she saw the name on the ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Jarred. How is it in there?\" Cindy smirked, and gave her hips a shake for good measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirked at Cindy, then turned to Kant. \"Kant, sweetie.... I need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKant smirked, then smiled at the tiny specks in the jar. \"Have fun in her.\" He mocked, then brought the lip of the jar in direct contact with the lips of Amy's spread open womanhood, and then continued to tip the jar, literally pouring the tiny Lupin dust-specks into her eager womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally thousands of super-tiny Lupins fell for what seemed like miles as they fell deeper and deeper into Amy's vaginal cavity. Some were spared the long fall, and were stuck to the walls of her depths. Others weren't so lucky, and landed all the way at the bottom, some dying on impact, others surviving to watch the truly unlucky ones that landed on the muscular wall of her cervix. The minkette's howls of ecstasy could be easily heard from those within her, and the slight roll of her immense hips shook the world that the tiny Lupins now found themselves in, though the most terrifying part of this new horrible experience was how those who landed on the edges of her womanhood watched as her cervix quivered, and swallowed up those who landed on the massive muscle, leaving nothing behind. Tiny Lupin females and males cried as those they were separated from were consumed by Amy's massive organ as her immeasurable cervix swallowed up hundreds of Lupins with every gulp. They looked to the sky for salvation, though saw nothing but the two massive digits of the minkette, holding herself open, and further up, they saw the face of Kant, the Felin, large enough to be a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKant poured a decent amount of the Lupins into his eager girlfriend, then uprighted the jar and set it aside, watching with increasing arousal as his girlfriend's vagina simply accomidated easily a few thousand Lupins. Though, the true intensity started when he watched Amy's cervix quiver, the tiny muscle opening slightly, and he watched as the Lupins that had landed upon that sensative muscle weren't there anymore when it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, Amy. I think you just swallowed them.\" Kant commented, and Amy moaned softly, \"Kant... I can feel every single one of them. They're so deep inside me...\" She slowly slid her fingers out of her, leaving the thousands of tiny Lupins within her, sealed in her body, trapped in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was breathless throughout the entire relocation, though Jarred's voice on her phone brought her back. \"Oh... sorry about that, I just watched Kant pour like a few thousand Lupins inside Amy's cunt. Second hottest thing I've ever seen or experienced.\" She smiled as Jarred asked a question. \"Hottest thing? Well, I've got my old boyfriend about a tenth of an inch tall, inside my body, roaming around the depths of my womanhood, and we're having a conversation about it. How's that sound for the hottest thing ever?\" She giggled, squirming slightly, \"That tickled, Jarred. Stop that. Or, on second thought.... don't stop that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy squirmed on the bed, feeling thousands of tiny Lupins squirm within her, while those Lupins on the train that was removed from Amy's depths simply watch in silent horror, knowing full well the fate that awaits those within the massive minkette.</span></div></div>",

A tense moment passed before Cindy lowered the weapon with a giggle, patting the barrel and explaining, \"We don't just have scalers sized for shrinking entire cities, you know. This personal one is perfect for--<i>Ah-choo!</i>\" The sneeze caught her almost completely off guard, whipping her free hand up to her nose to cover the spray of mucus--thank goodness her finger was wisely off the trigger of the scaler. While the sneeze was mostly dry, Cindy glanced down at her palm, thinly splashed with snot, and she squinted when she made out the smallest glimpse of a red speck amidst the pools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWren Sofia's life was like an inspirational fairytale--at least until today. From lower-class origins, the brown-furred wolfess simply did her best to survive, graduating high school with no special honors while working part-time--and then full-time afterwards--to support her struggling family. She was always a beautiful woman, with striking red hair and a stunning figure, prime target growing up on the mean streets of the city, but her older brothers kept her safe, preserving her innocence against the cruelty of the world. Still, she had been forced to watch others be victimized, and she developed a strong sense of empathy for the oppressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Prime Alpha chose her to be his wife like the Prince in Cinderella, she owed it to her family to accept immediately, and she felt she owed it to the world to do her part in making it a better place. And she did. As the Prime Alphaess, Wren conducted diplomatic missions to all of the nations of Beldor, forging peace with many age-old enemies of the Lupin through her sincere heart and simple beauty. Even many of the people of Beldor who hated the Lupin had to respect and love the woman who strove for peace. On this very day, she had been on her way to give an address to her people, pleading for their support as they try to end the war with the Feline nation. For the cats, it was too little too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth shook, and Wren leaned out the window of her limo to see the most enormous mink that ever existed looming over her and thousands of other Lupin in the city center. She was fortunate enough to be on the opposite side of the skyscraper that caught the giantess's interest, watching as knees thicker and longer than any man-made construct crashed down at both ends of the street where she was, sending her limo bouncing nearly a dozen feet into the air. Everyone within was tossed around, but Wren knew it was not safe to remain inside as she watched the mink easily lift one of the tallest buildings in the city, and she leapt out the door just as a car-sized chunk of concrete crushed the limo behind her. Wren hoped her faithful aides and driver had escaped the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing the high heels and long, red dress she had chosen to give her address in made running a fruitless task--assuming she even had a chance to escape if the giant minkess had singled her out. Thankfully, it appeared she had not, and the sky was empty and silent for a time, leaving panic and chaos in the streets until, and even more when, the sky glimmered unnaturally once again. When she saw the mouse woman, incomprehensibly massive, reaching down to dig the capital city of the Lupin people out of the ground, all rational thought was gone. There was nowhere to run, but Wren ran, as did most of the rest of the dust-sized Lupin--anyone else huddled down sobbing or gibbering incoherently. Running as fast as she could, however, the beautiful wolfess could not outpace the hurricane-force winds that began to pull her back, and up, lifting her and thousands of others from the city streets into the gargantuan mouse's nostrils. While she watched others die on impact with the unyielding nasal hairs--each hundreds of times longer than any of them was tall--Wren was lucky enough to land in a deposit of mucus, her back to the pool of viscous fluid that trapped her arms and legs, leaving her squirming helplessly in the mouse's nose. Her panicked mind screamed at the rational part to shut up as it grimly informed her that, eventually, the snot would slide down the mouse's throat and carry her and her kin to the stomach, but in the meantime she could do nothing to escape her prison while rumbling voices shook all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came in an instant. Powerful winds again sucked past her, before a gale, the likes of which put the breeze that brought her here to shame, ejected Wren and mountains of snot out from the cavernous nose and onto a vast plane of tan ridges. Again she survived simply because of the mucus taking the brunt of the momentum, but this time she was face-down, and if nothing came to save her, the beautiful diplomat and Prime Alphaess would drown in a droplet of a mouse girl's snot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy squinted at the almost-unseeable speck of red amidst her nasal residue, her other paw feeling the scaler's handle she had squeezed while sneezing.</span></div></div>",

The city wasn't getting bigger after all. Kant himself was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't supposed to happen! There must have been some residual energy from when the weapon fired!

His equipment, it was too small to have enough range to call back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlades of grass soon towered above Kant. In moments he was smaller than an insect... And then soon even smaller than that. The city was no longer a speck, it was a city again. Other than the giant grass reaching into the heavens above it looked normal. That was bad, very bad. Kant was now tiny and alone in enemy territory. Maybe the rest of the cats wouldn't have any trouble since they were still normal sized...

The little wolves on her skin tried to rubbed her sensitive spot and even try to move her tree-like fur to be aware of them still on here. If she grew more, they would be on a planet on the unaware kitten but maybe if she grew, they grew too and that means they could be normal size if it effects them too. That is if it will work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n For the felines on the bottom, they heard her words of the word \"growth\" and that means if she grew then it might be possibly for them to get on her and able to grow with her. They would probably back to normal size but the kitten would be huge compare to them if she grew too much that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitten was still thinking about this through and while she just stands there for a moment and think, the military base felines decided to head to her massive paws and get on her before she grew herself. Some were very closed indeed that it took them serveral minutes to get on before the destruction begins again. They move into the vehicles that wasn't flipped over or anything and drive really fast to get on her and grabbed on her tree-like fur and hold on tight as she begins to moved again. Most didn't make it since they were trying to help their fellow felines and that running to her for miles seem impossible at their size. It was really a few inch to her but to them it was miles. Lucky for some of them they made it just in time before she move agains and position herself to fire the gun at her and as it did...</span></div></div>",

The village was only a speck but better safe than sorry ruled the day, especially given how easily such a tiny thing could be damaged and destroyed. Flex one wrong muscle and the little civilization would end up a splat on a shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group prepared to move and conceal the village, they noticed something: tiny, but bigger than the village, creatures. A quick examination revealed that some people had been just a bit too close and wound up shrunken. Oddly, it wasn't everyone in close proximity to the little speck. Four or five small, but not infiniteismal creatures were around the speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, a plan was formed, mostly through gestures and magnifying glasses. Two teenage lynx's provided transportation, twins a guy and a girl. Their massive feet sat right at the around around the speck and below, the five not-quite micro creatures divided the city and in two groups headed to a giant. Two wolf guys going to the girl lost any ego they'd ever had when they looked up to see that the furry wall eclipsed the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the little creatures, it was difficult and messy work. These barefoot giants were a mess with mud and dirt and being smaller than fleas meant that the only way through was to go around. On the giant boy it was especially bad, he made kid-quakes every-second, unable to sit completely still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was worst on the villages, being carried by one giant, onto another giant, and of course all the while work continued to get the shrink-ray turned into a growth ray. It could only really be a source of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the tiny creatures had themselves in some sort of position where they would be able to hold out. They were still on gigantic feet, but it was among the safer places, given that people usually didn't touch other's paws and it was safer if for some reason the giant's had to be abandoned. The only question now was wether to run or wait on the military...</span></div></div>",

In a snap, that thought, combined with the radiation they just got, caused them to shrink! In an instant, two humans and two wolves were staring up at their friends' toes and beyond them, their upper bodies. Of all the giants, the barefoot five year old seemed the most menacing, coated in mud this low, he seemed more like a machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the tiny things saw that, their thoughts reversed, they wanted to be big! As before, the effect reversed itself, but they had to concentrate harder, growing was uphill plus doing it often burned a lot of energy. Their friends had only started to notice the absence when they grew back to normal size. For the tiny ones, it was amazing to see everything getting smaller, their horizon moving off and away, all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the woods, around the edge of the shrink zone, the other humans and various species of cubs watched in awe as they saw this. It was sort of like the super-heroes from their comic books and cartoons. Numerous ideas of good, evil and neutral came through their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the village, the spectacle was watched, but the low perspective made them think the people either walked away or had shrunken. It was a very contested thing. One was pessimism the other optimism.

So if it wasn't a random malfunction then that left the possibility of sabotage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a scary possibility. Who would sabotage it? An enemy spy? A traitor without the cat's own ranks? A third party? You quickly licked a paw and attempted to pat your bristled fur down to try and appear more calm. As soon as you arrived at your destination the engineers spread out and began checking various pieces of machinery and computers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange.\" One of the engineers speaks up.

The display read 'Ready to Fire' on it as if the cats upstairs hadn't attempted to fire the ray again. You tapped a few buttons on the machine to determine if it was working. The computer didn't react, and instead the 'Ready to Fire' message continued to blink on the screen. You looked for a power button seeing if you could restart the computer. There was none. You tried removing the front panels to see if you could disconnect the wires manually. Your tail went limp at what you saw inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting inside the the panel was a mess of wires which you expected. However all these wires for for some reason connected to an acorn. An acorn? What kind of insane cat would attempt to run their super weapon off an acorn! No cat that's who! There was only one group insane enough to do something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh... Oh no. Realization dawned. It was sabotage, and you knew who was behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the computer screen updated to display 'Firing in 10.' It started to slowly count down the seconds. You weren't sure what would happen if it fired off, but you knew the cats upstairs hadn't started this and there was no time to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9<br>\r\n8<br>\r\n7<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempted to rip the acorn out from the panel beneath the computer.

What kind of material were these made of? Sure your claws weren't going to do anything absurd like slice through metal but they should have at least been able to cut through these wires like paper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3<br>\r\n2<br>\r\n1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were out of time.

More squirrels appeared from behind the door and soon swarmed into the room. Now you had to worry about not just trying to stay hidden, but trying to avoid being stepped on. You ran for the crates you had dove behind earlier, trying to get underneath them to hide yourself from the squirrels. Other cats were running as well, but squirrels were scooping them up and dropping them into what looked like test tubes then jamming a cork into them leaving the felines trapped inside. just what kind of insane experiment were they planning. You forced your body flat against the floor as you wedged your way under the crate.

She was dressed in only a lab coat and goggles as she observed the other squirrels round up your remaining cat allies. \"Everything has gone according to plan.\" She looked down at you. \"Oh you really should consider yourselves lucky, today you're helping further the cause of science!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" For a brief moment you forgot to be afraid and just managed to cock an eyebrow at her as you stared through the glass of the test tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you cats and your little enemies the wolves have always been so silly!\" The squirrel said. \"But your petty wars served as the perfect grounds for experiments! Did you know the plans for your little pet project were stolen? I bet you didn't! The cats thought they had stolen the blueprints from the wolves! The wolves found an almost identical set of blueprints they thought they had stolen from the cats! In reality, it was all from us! Both weapons fired off and worked exactly as they're supposed to!\" The squirrel grinned. \"Does that give you solace? Knowing that just like you now at their own headquarters all the wolves have been similarly shrunken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou banged your hands on the side of the test tube. Okay, sure it was nice to know the wolves got what was coming to them, but not even a wolf deserved to be a prisoner of war to the squirrels! And cats certainly didn't deserve it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I bet you're wondering how we got here so fast without risking being shrunk ourselves.\" The squirrel continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really.\" You muttered. \"But I don't think you can actually hear me and I suspect you're the type that likes to hear themselves talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weapons can target someone based on their genetic coding.\" The squirrel explained. \"That means when it went off only cats shrunk. Any squirrels, other animals or even inanimate objects in range of its effects were completely unaffected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" You looked down at your naked body and then out across the room where your discarded clothing was. \"I suppose that explains some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now, every single cat and wolf on this entire planet, shrunk to the size of insects in an instant! And they all did it to themselves! And now want to know what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably some kind of crazy experiment...\" You muttered to yourself as you sat down in the test tube with your legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next we're going to!-\"</span></div></div>",

There was nothing you could do. You and the other felines trapped in test tubes were carefully packed away into padded bags to ensure the test tubes wouldn't break or come loose. As the backpack was closed everything went dark. Luckily felines could see in pretty well in the dark, but there wasn't much to see other than the other shrunken cats each trying to cope with the situation. You saw some from the command center, and others that you were sure were civilians. It seemed likely there wasn't a single cat in the world who had escaped this shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, but you weren't sure how much. You could feel the bag jostle every now and then. You knew the squirrels were transporting all of you somewhere but you had no idea where. Probably some kind of secret lab. Every now and then everything would go still and the squirrels would remove the test tubes from the backpack. You always seemed to be outdoors when this happened, and would be released from the test tube, but surrounded but in an area surrounded by a small barrier the squirrels could easily step over but seemed inescapable to you. Even on the other side you could see blades of grass as tall as trees so wouldn't get far if you escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring these times you were given food as well as time to answer the call of nature before you would be forced back into the test tube then placed back in the backpack. Well at least the squirrels didn't intend on letting the cats starve to death anytime soon, but the fact they wanted all of you alive was even more worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how many days had passed before you finally reached your destination. Trapped inside that backpack you had lost all sense of direction or time. This time when they opened the bag you were inside a building. You couldn't make out much more than the ceiling from the roof unfortunately, but they started removing the test tubes from the bag three at a time. Your turn came and you and two other felines were dumped cylinder shaped box before a lid was snapped over it leaving you in the dark again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the other two felines with you, a lioness and a panther. You were the only house cat in this group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... at least we can walk around in here.\" The lioness said stretching as she did. \"Been trapped in those tubes so long I was worried my legs were going to stop working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get what you mean.\" The panther dropped to all fours to stretch out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your own chance to stretch and get used to moving around again. By this point you were starting to get used to being so small if only because it had been several days now. You didn't even feel awkward about the fact all three of you were standing here naked. After being stuck this way for awhile the edge of being in your bare fur tended to dull down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... any idea what they have planned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None.\" The lioness said. \"Are intel on the squirrels has always been spotty at best.Half of it is intentionally made up just to throw us off and all of it sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory. There is nothing at this point I'd put beyond them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you got you answer. The box you were in fell apart on the walls leaving you standing on a colorful table with neon red and white lights surrounding it. Not far from your table was a second one with blue and white lights. On this table there was another box, that like yours had fallen apart. Standing inside of it were three wolves that had been shrunken to the same tiny size as you and your cat allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the actual hell?\" You heard the panther mutter under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentleman!\" A squirrel popped up between the two tables towering over both cats and wolves. \"Welcome to the grand event you've all been waiting for! Welcome to the first episode of War of the Species! Here! We find different species that are at war, capture them and bring them here to compete in a series of head to head contest for your entertainment! At the end of the day! The winning side goes free! Maybe... And the losing side, I don't know maybe we'll shrink them even smaller we'll get to that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've got to be kidding... A TV show?\" You asked. \"That's what this is about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" The lionness watched the squirrel and then the wolves. \"Squirrels are eccentric, this is not out of character for them. Best option for now might be just to play along until we can come up with an escape plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then!\" The squirrel hosting the show you were trapped on shouted. \"It's time for our first event! Shall we open with a team challenge! Or make this one on one!\"</span></div></div>",

The jump behind the pile of boxes you made stretched on forever, then your clothes began to come loose and finally you hit the ground. Not on hard floor, but on something soft. The bright light the weapon had emitted was dying down and was replaced with darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot complete darkness, though. You could still see some faint light coming from the turns and folds of the fabric-like material that was now surrounding you. It was certainly alarming but you pressed on, crawling forward and upward until you breached the surface. Your fur bristled when took stock of your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything looked huge. The boxes you jumped behind now looked  as tall as a building and looking down at your paws you also realized with a jolt that the material you were standing on were actually all your clothes. You had shrunk! As for the others, you couldn't hear a thing except the ambient hum of machinery. The likely explanation was that they too were all shrunk and were too far away to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaulting down the mountain of clothes your paws hit cold ground. Having a look around, the room the weapon was in seemed monolithic and the ceiling might as well have been another sky. Unfortunately you had no time to sight-see, something terrible had happened and now you could hear rhythmic footsteps flooding the room. Running to the closest box, you peaked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the brief second you poked your whiskers out you saw what looked to be a bunch of rodents storming the room and the first extremely obvious fact you picked up on was that they weren't shrunk. While they were still small in comparison to all the equipment in the room, they looked to be of just about your size, if not bigger. Even their guns which were once considered laughable peashooters to the cats now looked like deadly killing machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisking another peak out at the invading rodents, you could see some of them run up to multiple piles of clothes scattered around the weapon with their firearms drawn. The tiger lady from before as well as many others were forced to put their hands up and surrender, any weapons they might have been carrying now rendered useless due to their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped looking again, scared they might see you. Even the exact species of the invading force was still lost on you but right now you had to make a decision; try and hide or surrender.</span></div></div>",

Down and down you fell, the pitch black pit between the boxes swallowing you up in moments before, just as quickly, you hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oowww...\" you groaned quietly, laying there on your chest, gently rolling over and cupping your sheathed crotch, not exactly a stellar landing.  Laying there in pain, you were glad that no bones were broken, what with being smaller and lighter dealing with the square-cube law, gravity, and acceleration.  Looking up from you position, there was a small glimmer of light, so tiny that you would've missed it had you landed just a little bit to either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling as quietly as possible, you managed to peak through the crack between the boxes, and quickly brought a hand to your mouth.  Half of the researchers were dead, their bodies riddled with what were once ineffective jokes, now the head researcher had almost been cut in half by the amount of gunfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid fur balls.\"  You heard one of the rodent soldiers say, massive bushy tail behind him, definitely a squirrel.  \"You'd think they'd understand their new pecking order on the food chain, but I guess they were just too stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they's ain't the wolves.\"  Another voice said, its accent reminding you of a mouses, \"Cluny and Mercurio of the rats brought their swarms down on them... hard.  Don't know how many'll be left come morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chuckled as you stared, paralyzed with fear as the dead eyes of the tigress scientist, Linda, gazed unblinkingly at you.  When the two rodents left, you backed away from the gap in the boxes, curled up as far away from the hole a second possible, and cried behind your hand.  You're not sure how long you sat there crying, but you know that the random bursts of gunfire you'd occasionally hear echo down the halls had diminished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are cheetah, you decide, rage overtaking sorrow as you stand up to your new full height, <i>barely</i> coming up to the chest of a mouse.  Shimmying yourself back up the boxes, you climb, intent on finding any others who hadn't been captured and starting a resistance, from the glance at the now gutted and damaged shrink ray, you realize that you have to bid on the wolves machine being still operationa if you want to return things to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there proudly, naked as the day you were born and tiny, you had decided to fight back, but first you needed friends, and weapons.</span></div></div>",

The machine was too damaged to be of use and to add on top of that, a bunch of squirrels had started disassembling the wreckage. From your vantage point you could also see some rodents ransacking drawers and cupboards, snatching up any documents and papers before throwing them in a pile. The jerry can to the side of it makie it obvious that they planned on burning them. It was clear they wanted the existence of the weapon to be completely removed, lest it be used to reverse the shrinking that effected all the other species of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered to think that the rats might be doing the same thing to the wolves weapon but on the slight chance that they weren't, it became your only option. But first things first, you had to get out of the lab. Impatiently flicking your tail, you waited for a good time to flee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mouse soldier came over and investigated your clothing for a while but left in a huff when he couldn't find you. Thankfully he didn't bother checking between the boxes. The mouse walked up to a squirrel who you assumed was the superior officer and reported to him. \"Can't find any more cats in the lab, sir. Some of them might have fled outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement annoyed the squirrel. \"We'll find them soon enough. Bring any escapees to the designated holding area outside the base and separate them, I want to make an example of them so they learn quickly what inconveniencing their new masters gets them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words made your ears fold back, not in fear but in anger. Quietly seething, you waited for them to leave until there were only a few rodents left in the lab and considering they were busy dismantling the weapon, you saw an opportunity to leave. Leaving the safety of the boxes, you began to exfiltrate the room. Going behind the desk and slinking alongside the wall you got out surprisingly easy, but as you looked down the gigantic hallway you realized your journey had only just started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt even more naked than you already were as you trotted through the empty corridor, keeping a keen ear out for any footsteps. More than once you nearly walked right into some soldiers before making a quick turn down another hallway but slowly but surely, you were getting closer to the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you suddenly saw a group of three mice turn a corner walking right towards you. Your fur fluffed up in fright and you shoved yourself against a door, dearly hoping they didn't see you. The doorway itself was enough to conceal you but if they walked past they were definitely going to spot you. For a moment you thought your journey was already about to come to an end but as you leaned against the door, it moved slightly. It was open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing with all your might, you somehow managed to open it just enough to get inside. The room was dark and full of metal drawers, probably acting as a place to store documents and files. Other than that, you noticed there was nowhere to hide. You waited behind the door, dearly hoping the mice would leave.</span></div></div>",

A lynx and a mountain lion (both male) you didn't know but did recognize, and a cute female cheetah who was the secretary for the science division, Linda, if memory was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr.?\"  Linda asked nervously, \"W-what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok first, technician, not a doctor.\" You said as calmly as possible, \"Second, the rodents sabotaged it, and apparently the wolves had the same thing, ended up the same as us.\"  You sit down a dhold your head in your hands, \"They're all dead!  Dead!\"  You start quietly sobbing, still having the presence of mind to keep it quiet, but finally being able to talk about the deaths of your coworkers was too much an emotional release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda crouched down and started hugging you, the feeling of bare fur on fur felt odd, but nice, you noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to get out of here.\"  The lynx said, \"My platoon should be putting up as much a fight as they can, we just gotta find them and hook up.\"  He looked at you, \"Name's Sgt.

The nerd who organized this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you looked around, \"The mice patrols thin the closer you get to the exit, so we can use that to our advantage, but we have to be careful.  Once outside, we've got o make for the forest for cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlud nodded, \"Makes sense to me, since we can't fight, we hide until we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying your face, you stood up, and the small group (heh, pun) started their way to the door, looking outside, you didn't see any patrols, and you held Linda's hand as the group ran for the big glass double doors.</span></div></div>",

From the steps of the front door you had a clear view of the area surrounding the building. The barracks were to the front, sitting behind a packed parking lot while a road stretched to the left and right. What was alarming was the amount of rodents running about, either working hard to set up their temporary base or herding cats at gunpoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, all of you dashed to the side of the building and hid behind a bush. \"Looks like they're making themselves at home,\" Sgt. Blud growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda's tail curled around her leg as she groaned. \"How are we going to get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good question. Mice and squirrels were everywhere and from the amount of soldiers that were combing through every nook and cranny about the base getting found seemed inevitable. Poking further out from the bush you scanned around for a possible path you all could take but instead your eyes came across something else, a small jeep. It was sitting unattended next to another larger jeep that the cats would normally use, making the rodent-sized vehicle look like a toy car in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing towards it, you ask the group their opinion about it. \"How about we use that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unattended,\" Dave pointed out. \"Do you think we can just drive out, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lynx scratched his whiskers in thought. \"It might work, I doubt they're expecting us to simply drive out of here. We can meet up with my platoon in the forest quicker to boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, it was decided. \"Let's go,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the coast was clear, all of you ran as fast as you could to the jeep. Blud hopped in the drivers seat and thankfully whoever left this vehicle unattended forgot to take their keys out. They were still in the ignition. On the back seat, however, was something better. Two loaded assault rifles and a few magazines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave picked one up and looked at it. \"Woah. Now we can fight back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was inspecting it you noticed he was absentmindedly pointing it at you, but thankfully Blud pushed the muzzle up and gave him a stern look. \"We'll be needing a lot more of those if we really want to fight back. For now, we have to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting in the back seat with Linda while Dave took the front passenger seat, Blud wasted no time in started the jeep and driving off. It was nerve-wracking as the lynx took the vehicle through the base at a leisurely pace to not attract attention. Linda herself was shaking and couldn't stop herself from nervously looking at all the rodents they were passing by so you held her hand and gave her a reassuring smile to help calm her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all you could do right now. You just had to hope they didn't notice that one of their jeeps was packed full of cats.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those who ran, ran into 'caves', climbed grass, made a run at the trees for shelter or one of a million other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing underground wasn't exactly a smart idea, a kitten's toes made huge impressions, well clear of 100 feet deep while walking, not to mention the tonnage of sweat dropped in. If they ran, they'd be tearing at the ground and easily crush a wolf underneath them without ever even realizing it. On top of that, the kitten's claws were larger than any wolf structure and would easily pierce the ground, so even those deep enough to be safe from the pad's wouldn't be safe from claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up a stalk of grass was potentially the second dumbest idea, not only were you exposed to more force from paws being picked up, but you were more exposed to your environment.

A wolf could go inside parts of the massive plant and go up it higher than most kittens. There was one big problem though, the trees were miles away and miles tall; it would take hours to reach what one kitten gets to in ten seconds or so. On top of that, all sorts of now titanic bugs filled the trees and at the upper altitudes the winds would be hurricane force or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only advantage the wolves had was their size made them harder to detect, though any wolf would gladly trade that to be as big as one of those kittenly forces of destruction.

By cat standards, he was the closest thing to a mouse that they had at just over three feet tall for a six year old. The others were closer to the four foot mark, but not quite there, though on the new wolf-scale, four and a half feet was a mile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'mouse' ran across the open grass, trampling numerous of the formerly destructive wolves and unknowlingly bringing others along for the ride on his feet or stuck under them. Then, a cat came from the side and tackled the titan to the ground, things immediately dissolved into a rolling mess across the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ground under them, wolves scattered to clear the miles that had now become the kitten's wrestling rink as they devastated a landscape the wolves were just getting used to. Twist that made immeasurably strong bridges were snapped by an instant's force of the fight, craters were dug out all over, towering grass as strong as skyscrapers was felled as easily as toppling a pin; fur, bits of sweat and dirt flung off the fighters forming new obstacles, lakes and in some cases even bridges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolves caught in the battle were helpless as they were either trampled, spared, or found themselves somehow on some part of the massive structures they new as kittens. For the tiny creatures, a single strand of fur towered a hundred feet tall, an arm was a forest of fur. Others with less luck got stuck between the titans' mountainous toes, filled with all sorts of dirt, sweat and things so heavy the wolve's stood no chance against it. Those below of course had less chance of survival. Of course a few wound up either under or in the enormous clothes of the giants, minimal as they were. The last common occurance was to be eaten, a single tooth was anywhere from 50 to 200 hundred feet in length and plenty round, a tongue was a massive laviathon with skyscrapers all its own and the throat was a bottomless tunnel hundreds of feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould these massive titan's end this city of wolves in just one little game?</span></div></div>",

It had been an intimidating sight at first, but by now most tinys around giants had gotten used to these sorts of sights. This was just one more thing that had grown into another part of every-day life, though there was still fear, just fear people had gotten used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little wolf, on a bed of his own on the floor slept away, despite his brother's booming voice trying to wake him up. Then the titan banged a toe against the wooden ground by Dan's bed and it shook things more than enough for the little Lieutenant to wake up. He came to on the floor after the earthquake had thrown him several feet from his bed, in a 'safety corner.' Every tiny wolf had a small corner rigged to be free of vibrations from the rest of the house and be in a relatively safe spot, so this meant that someone had just stepped on his little area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lets go\" Tom boomed, \"you know we've got a lot to do today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stared up at his 'little' brother's mud-caked toes, it was one of the things that annoyed him the most. Everytime he got stepped on, he got covered in that dirt coating Tom's pads, claws and the space between his toes and even covering a decent amount of fur. At this size, most of that looped far overhead anyway; on a flat surface a pad was 1/4 inch or fifty feet tall before it went to fur for a good three or four hundred feet until the top of the toes. Of course, on top of that, it stank, especially all the sweat from the pads and it only increased as the kid grew each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get up little foot\" Tom prodded, a joke going back to the early days of being partnered. Dan had yelled at Tom a lot to watch what he did with his big feet and now that had gotten turned around on the smaller wolf. He continued to look down, through a special optical lens and sound amplifier built to help the partner's find their smaller friends and see them in excellent clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan sat up and held his right foot, remembering how he used to have to look out for stepping on his little brother's little feet around the house. In a wolf's young days, their feet aren't rough and therfore easily hurt. Reluctantly he got up, got dressed and came back ready to go, ascending a massive screw that was used as his 'pick up' point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom held a hand down and Dan boarded the tip of the claw to be dropped into his brother's forest of fur around his shoulders. It was a bumpy ride, but at least the fur often held off the wind of the high-speed movement. The instant 'little foot' was down, the giant wolf took off at a fast jog towards and then out the door towards the duo's work with the SCO, Size Central Operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on his perch, Dan waited until they had reached his now military-ordered job, much as he'd rather stick to special operations. He felt his brother's massive muscles moving under the skin and bobbed up and down with them as they easily moved his almost zero weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnward to work...</span></div></div>",

Of course it was always easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Tom's shoulder, Dan sat waiting for word he'd spotted something. The pre-teen titan was the only one who could spot the creatures as the smaller one's eyes weren't good enough at this distance and on the little lupine's scale it'd take days to cover the same empty ground that the giant made in minutes. On his scale, the little one had a 2-3ft stride, the enormous brother had a 7200ft stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom found himself amidst something strange, it took him a seeming eternity to notice it.

So, twenty-four hours and seven days on duty, Tom headed right for today's assignment; contact with a colony of tiny's outside the city. This group had decided they were safest as far from civilization as they could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom continued his jog out of the city and into the woods for a while until he came to a tree surrounded by a small ditch and with a thin, narrow pipe running down from its top. The giant stopped right in front of the pipe and put a hand up to let Dan down on the ground, the pipe was an elevator and supply line to the top and bottom of the tree, it connected several cities in the colony running from underground to the top. For today, that was the way of making contact with the steadily growing group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stepped onto the claw and held tight as he was taken to the ground and then jumped down into the hills of dirt and mud between him and the pipe. Being a tiny speck, a single piece of dirt was an obstacle, but eventually he reached an path beaten down an eighth of an inch that lead to the pipe a short distance away. It would take him a bit of walking to get there, but he'd get there eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, titan Tom would get all the fun of sitting around and doing nothing, aka sitting around on one's rear end with a thumb up it.

A seemingly harmless sound like even a pin dropping was almost complete bass and deafening to a little wolf, their ears already ultra sensitive just for their species connections. Ears being much smaller only made it worse. The sight of a titan from down herewas perhaps the only thing that could touch the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was on a bed in a marked off section of the floor reserved for him and such that none of the giants were supposed to come in. He opened his eyes to 500 feet or so of his \"little\" brother's toes as a mountain range overhead. They were coated in mud and dirt, which only made things worse for a tiny creature. At this size, the smell a normal wolf could easily ignore despite a  sensitive nose was over-powering as it hardly seemed to drop over-range. This was a problem numerous times after having been stepped on, one was nothing but the mud, dirt and sweat from paws, toes and the immense pads. Rather than face another day of that, the LIeutenant closed his eyes and pretended to sleep. Until the titan got out his site-scope, he'd never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpatient, Tom slammed a toe against the ground inside the safety area, which created an Earthquake nothing could've slept through and launched the 'big' brother clear out of the bed and perhaps as far as 100 feet in the air. Once he landed, he quickly got ready for the day's problems and tortures of his reduced stature. In minutes he'd reached a another marked area for pickup and ascended onto the tip of Tom's claw, which felt more like a flying piece of countryside. In minutes, the mach-speed flight ended at the forest of fur by an enormous ear. The huge space came to a tip around 750 feet overhead and seemed to go on unendingly into the wolf's head. Dan proabably could fit all the way in and come out the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok lil' bro, ready!\" Tom said, seemingly running forward and making a hurican grade blast of wind wash through his fur. It felt good to him while the 32nd of an inch tall wolf felt like he was going to be blown clear off. In reality, the kid was just walking to the door.</span></div></div>",

Before the shrinking, this would not have worked, however, following it the war of the species took many odd turns, among them some cities being blasted and stuck small like the few wolves from earlier in. This city was one of them, blasted by an altered ray of the cats, wolf efforts to restore it had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeurobia, one of the first great casualties of the war was now perched in a tree along the border with the cats, used as a recon post like all the other shrunken cities. Smaller shrunken cities and villages were in the area as well, relying on this one for supplies, hence the need of dockboys. The entirety of the city may well have been just an inch long, but the main area was a quarter of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious 'small' creatures filled the woods, but were on the wolf's side as they were not the prey of wolves, but of cats. These creatures carried supplies to the distribution cities, its not like they had a large load to carry out, especially when the thing they supplied was smaller than the things they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where dockboys came in.

Then the entire area was suddenly drowned in shady from several massive objects towering into the sky. Two columns started at the ground, met in the sky and continued up and then two more came off at the sides ending in five titanic spires each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kittens had grown! The 'little' kids stretched into the sky and no knew it, but not why. Trees that had once towered over them were now shorter than a single pad. Immediately they started searching for the source of their sudden titanly status, two of the giants had back-packs on and dropped them to the ground, leveling a mile of forest and creating a massive depression. Miles of ground were covered in a few steps as they tried to close in on a light they'd seen just before this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, wolves reverted to fleeing for some sort of cover, but now there was a lot less that they could do. Most of them ran for the woods or to caves they knew of in the area, afterall the cats were big but there's no way they could crush a rock like those of a cave, right? The last group stayed in the city, arming up or working on the shrink ray to blast the kittens down to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course for those still tiny, doom was the only likely occurance; they were too small to be seen by the feline giants and could still be easily killed by them, their own people and bugs. Many were already being killed under their own people's massive paws or surviving on them as best they can. A unique few were working with their 'normal' sized friends to survive the gigantic wolves and felinoid continents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Dan was among those trapped tiny, to add insult to injury, the act that had fixed the other wolves had left the small ones gradually shrinking. At the moment he was trying to reach his house, which he shared with his little brother, hoping he'd find him alright and that he'd even get there alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were filled with the massive feet of wolves running everywhere and it was just about impossible to dodge them all, hard to believe that earlier today he could have knocked em' flat with a single kick and now he couldn't stop them with anything and whatever he did felt like hitting a solid wall. The massive toes, claws, and pads were all covered with caked on and even wet mud and dirt of all sorts, even a few stains of blood or remnants of the city that hadn't grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one came along that Dan couldn't dodge, a larger than life five year old. His feet were walking piles of mud and sweat, he stomped down and the Lieutenant was stuck to the dirt between his toes as he ran. The massive creature continued on, unknowing of his passenger below. At least he was headed in the general direction of the troop's house and covering miles every few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lieutenant struggled to free himself from the sticky and slimy gunk around him, his view ahead consisted of massive mountains on either side with enough strength to hurl him into the stars without a thought. He fought more each instant, knowing he was getting smaller and weaker by the second, at last he got free and found himself clinging to a 'pebble' just in front of his last prison, to avoid being hurtled into the sky and certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan leaped thousands of feet in the air, came to a stop and suddenly Dan was standing on the wall of slime he'd been in minutes ago. It seemed his shrinking had slowed, but his pawprint in the wall was now bigger than his head. The world twisted as the foot was brought up towards the kid's head, blood oozing from the toe little Dan was clinging to. Massive walls moved in as the kid tried to squeeze the pain of a deep cut away, luckily the tiny trooper survived, but barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all wounds, the cut began to itch and Dan found an immense spire and wall of dirt coming at him, seconds later he was climbing down from a mountain of dirt and mud on the ground. He looked around and saw what appeared to be his house not far away, a titan sitting on the front step seeming clearly upset about something. A massive, furry tail was on the ground and made a potential bridge up.</span></div></div>",

Screw the questions, its time for some action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan ran up to the massive jungle vines of fur and started climbing in the hopes it was Tom or at least someone helpful. From here he saw that the fur was the right color and pattern, but there weren't too many ways to be sure when you were a spec smaller than most known bugs. So, he jumped up at the fur, but the tip of the tail was just off the ground to tease the little wolf about his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to build a mound of dirt up towards the tail. It probably would not be wise to question where it came from though, just as long as it got the job done. At last, he jumped, reached, and started to climb a strand of hair thicker around than most buildings and far taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the strand of fur rocked, shook and vibrated with a massive force, Dan had to stop and hold on for his very life to avoid the couple hundred foot drop to the ground. Dan looked down and saw an ant putting its second leg onto another piece of fur and it all shook again. As the creature pulled itself all the way on, its last leg on the ground leveled the dirt pile, which was just about as big as Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step of the creature rocked the fur and when it was right on Dan he could see it was far, far larger than he was; one of its legs was thicker than he was tall. The millions of hairs on it were longer than Dan and spaced farther apart than he was tall, as it stepped over him, he saw its armor was also thicker than a tank's. Thinking quickly, he jumped on and started to scale the creatures legs as it moved, once on its back it was clear that this thing could have carried his whole street and probably much more. On its back, he clung onto that giant hair as a handhold so he didn't fall in the vertical climb, and bit by bit he worked his way towards the head where he would bet he was safest.</span></div></div>",

They retreated as a massive toe just missed turning them into microscopic bloodstains amongs a black, brown and red wall of many more. The kids were backed into a corner and now drenched in the dirt and sweat of a pad that had just missed them.

For each of the tiny wolves, a giant was more closely related to a continent or a planet in terms of size, though from their point of view, they couldn't see anything but black wall; the fingerprint grooves of pads, which to the tinies were miles wide, miles tall and infinitely long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bullies finished shrinking, they looked around at a world of cells, round and black objects that were roughly their size, but some were bigger. This put them somewhere between bacteria and virus, neither of which would survive inside the body for very long anyway. Of course, the tiny creatures didn't stand much chance on the outside either, especially in the pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Ridowy, the head bully was walking around his new prison, round black things making squishing sounds every time his little feet walked over them. He wanted, badly wanted to kick or hit something but was still quite a difference from the walls and the last object he'd passed was a normal bug, which had nearly trampled him. He eventually did reach the wall and immediately began kicking it, but suceeded in only injuring his microscopic pads, once stern enough to break solid cinderblocks and legs in martial arts classes, now they couldn't harm a fly; though a fly could finish him and never even sea the blood splatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden roar coming from far down the immense passageway, Rick looked and saw a tsuanmi of sweat coming his way, miles tall. At the center of it was a charm anklet he had stolen as a piece of good luck. He looked down at his toes and saw no sign of the anklet there. The immense piece of leather was his first act of bullying today and then he realized he'd taken it from this very kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Flash Back]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the return to normalcy, the bullies were right next to the now titanic, formerly bullied. As he had grown, Rick bent down and took the object from the current titan, the object had grown just enough to fit on the tip of one of his claws. One of the things he'd been taught was that for a bully to take something from a permanent victim was a measure of good luck, a connection to them. It was silly of course, but he'd played along just to test it out. The rotten thing must have come off when he shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Present]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ring closed in, it was apparent that it clearly dwarfed the wolf city, at least if it was on Rick's level. As it closed the miles, he found he was clearly smaller than most tiny wolves and that he was missing a claw. He looked up to see his own, mud caked, torn up, rough claw right behind the titanic ring and still sized to fit in like a glove. That massive spire had earlier formed a wall for the now titanic and killed two of them, right through the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claw and ring closed in, Rick found himself drowning in sweat at about the center of the band before his claw approached and through in his own victims blood, pinning him against the tiny, formerly toe-size ring with a force found nowhere else in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, the flood had leveled out to become an ocean instead. Rick was still pinned and the ring stood upright, holding him just above the flood waters. He hacked up salty sweat, gallons of dirt some of which was from his own body, and plenty of blood from his victims; at present height those bloodstains themselves were of giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles overhead, maybe something bigger, Jack, the leader looked down at his paw pad along with the others in their group, unknowing of the challenges the bullies were facing. What he did know was that they were better off without these bullies still around, so he put his hand to his mouth, licked and sucked as hard as he could to ensure the bullie would meet a demise. The other titans followed suit, though they wished they could see their bullies to give them some of the torture they deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Jack's mouth, the ring and claw remained as they were, passing through as specs against the teeth and tongue of the enormous wolf. Rick took in gallons of saliva, but managed to get enough air to stay alive. Meanwhile, Jack's massive lungs had no problem surviving and the worst he tasted was a 'little' dirt and a 'little' sweat.</span></div></div>",

Tree's were mowed over like nothing, claws dug in deep, and then before the cats had a second to react, the canines charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles of ground were covered and several canines and felines in the woods wound up on the giants in someway or another. The normal and tiny people were nothing to the macroscopic wolves at the moment, their city was at stake. Even if a single pad could level the city and leave no trace of it, it was still gonna get the best defense they could bring to bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cats turned just in time to see the dogs coming, but not react. The wolves tackled and miles of forest were obliterated by the enormous back's of the titans, their shoulders dug trenches down deep enough to form lakes. Soon the fight broke up into a bunch of 'smaller' ones as each wolf took on a cat, trading shots in the force of mega tons. Tsunamis of blood, huricanes of fur, and claws flew off of everyone in the fight as blow was traded for blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, a cat was right at the city, his toes made a huge crater right in front of the city; a single twitch would take out the entire place. Down in the city, the little lupines were staring up at the foot and mostly a single toe of a cat cub who earlier would've easily been handled by any wolf. No one could see much past the tops of the toe, not even to the ankle or part way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later the enormous foot was sent skyward as the cat flew backward. At the opposite end of the city a narrower, but taller paw of a cub was stretching skyward. As the wolf walked past the city, a few pieces of fur fell and nearly toppled several skyscrapers, but luckily did not. As the fight wore on, the land around the city was torn up, fur flew, and the ground shook with force that defied all scales of measurement.</span></div></div>",

The cats all stepped forward to get a good look at the threat diminishing by the second as they soon became the supreme power of the world. The only thing to oppose them now was the scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, however, the shrinking lupines had to be handled. The wolves were around chest level with their counterparts and getting lower by the second. Soon they were craning their necks up to see the heads of their foes and struggling to come up with some strategy to win this fight, even when they were quite clearly at a massive disadvantage. Most of the wolves though were frozen in fear at the strength of their enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne wolf ran forward and leapt at the outstretched arm of his opponent, trying to bring him down. The cat didn't budge and soon the dog was standing on top of the cats arm and bit by bit coming to be surrounded by fur. He was about normal size now and smaller than a single muscle of his enemy, he had no chance of winning this war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo cats reached down and picked up their shrinking 'friends', pulling them out of their own footprints while they were still big enough to even be seen. The wolves were stored somewhere safe on the cats' person, in wrinkled pad or pocket, from their perspective it was really hard to tell as both were surrounded by black-walled pads as they were moved. The last of the little lupine group son found themselves swimming in lakes of their own sweat, in their own footprints; the gaps between where their toes had been looked like little mountains and the walls of the craters were impossibly high, it was hard to believe this was all caused by their very presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolves floated there, a few felt sharp pokes at their feet and moved around to look. Some trees, now the smaller than ordinary thorns had managed to get worked around and poke the little wolf cubs. So, anything they'd been in contact with while shrinking had shrunken with them, even all the wolves that'd been stuck on them. But one thing seemed out of place, the trees appeared even smaller than when the wolves were giants, then it hit them; they'd continued to grow, so the cats were still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining cats looked down at the impressions in front of them, now not even as deep as a pad and shriveling each instant....</span></div></div>",

Large lynx watched, and after irritating boredom took a swipe at the dirt with his tail, nearly crushing the tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other places, the cats gave their friends in aid in escaping the craters and lakes.

The twerp must have been out playing with his friends, probably those low-life humans; the species that'd been holding the wolves and cats back from all out war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA footstep later, the Lieutenant was shaken out of his thought as Tom's immense wait shook the ground enough to launch him into the air and onto the foot. \"Nowhere to go but up\" Dan said, moving through the forest of fur for his brother's head, from down here there was no way he'd be heard; otherwise the kid would've noticed everyone else's screams of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd experience to go through your own brother's fur, the kid who had been half your hieght and now had 50ft. tall fur on your scale. Then, suddenly rather than climbing up from branch of fur to branch of fur, the Lieutenant found himself walking as the giant laid down against a tree not too far from the city. The kid had nearly stepped on it, but likely stepped over it; the whole place would barely be larger than one or two of his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he had seen other giants in the distance, perhaps on the same mission as Tom, find home.

He was glad though that he was now walking across the giant's stomach, despite its up and down moving making it hard to walk. A bit later things moved up hill again as he was forced to climb the enormous chest, a single muscle dwarfed him, the city and about everything on an exponential scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom felt an insect or something crawling along his bare-chest, he looked down but couldn't see anything under his fur.

That of course, couldn't have been, the other kids not five steps away were still just as short as a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked closer, and the closer he got, the bigger the distance seemed to get. When he stopped, he was on a stone over 100 meters up and ahead of him, fur-filled titans took up his view. A tigress's toes spread out on his right with pink painted spires making mine shafts in the ground and on the left a rather large lupine blocked out the sun with the tip of his claws. Elsewhere, all around, miniatures of each were scrambling over the rocks, through the dirt and everywhere else playing, a few were even scrambling up the titan's toes and onto their bodily forests of fur.</span></div></div>",

Dan's 'little' brother, one of the reasons he'd taken this post here and done so much to ensure he'd get it, to defend the lil' bro. Of course, now, lil' bro wasn't so little anymore and there wasn't so much Dan could do to defend him given that anything big enough to threaten Tom could finish Dan off with a simple twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the titan bent down and was on all fours, sniffing and searching the ground for his now all but microscopic friends. His breathing and sniffing though was creating winds that'd put the strongest of hurricanes and storms to shame, leaving Dan and others to cling on to whatever was round them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked up at the spire-scaled teeth, enormous nasel passages, and monumental power that hung over him. Minutes ago, that was a little head, small nose and lots of baby's teeth, or at least comparatively. Hard to believe he had thrown that kid, beaten him up and scared him out of his fur, right now the tables were turned. If Tom tried any of that, well, anything this small wouldn't survive, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground rocked and rolled with some massive force, yet the stones didn't seem to so much as move a nanometer, Dan's little pads under his tiny feet still felt the movement just before he was sent to the ground. Well, wound up flat on his face on the stone. Off in the distance he saw a huge, white blur followed by an orange blur and many others shooting across the ground behind Tom. As they shot by, a gust beyond all gusts sweapt through along the explosions of impacts and collisions that'd deafen anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it got Dan's attention, he stood up, turned around to look and then turned back for just a second to step forward. The movement seemed to show off a want to stay and look, but a powerful urge to follow the action; moving away was like trying to resist the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Dan, it set him with a better idea of his and Tom's size, and showed one place where he didn't want to end up, under Tom's pads. The couple steps rattled Dan's bones to their cores and scared him beyond belief as he saw tons of dirt and sweat drop from the pads overhead. The dark bulges were clearly tougher than anything he'd ever seen and would crush him or trap him without ever giving the boy any notice, like his own, they were hard from carrying such weight over time. The Lieutenant rubbed his feet on the rock and like Tom, didn't feel much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could react, the mountains ahead tipped forward and whipped towards Dan like a curtain of destruction. Getting bigger and bigger as soon the horizon was blocked out to be replaced by furry toes....</span></div></div>",

Normally microscopic particles of dirt dwarfed Dan and filled his vision as he made his descent towards the foot and as it moved up towards him. It seemed big enough to cover countries and maybe it could, so far, no clear measuring comparisons had been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, the Lieutenant was shooting through miles of fur and finally hit warm, but unyielding flesh. For a few seconds he was out cold, but came to as the titan continued to move, but at this size, Tom had his own gravity and it was defeating the planet's. Behind him, a forest of fur stretched into the sky, each strand larger around than a city. However, in front of him, there was a huge drop leading down to a valley-filled, black shiny surface. Things hit home, the black thing was a single toe-nail and it stretched beyond sight, seemed flat instead of round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who'd been shrunken must still have been shrinking, and now they were microscopic.  To either side, grass shot by unimaginably tall and trees couldn't be fathomed, heck these toes couldn't be imagined or quantified in any sane way. For now the little lupine would just have to survive on his little stretch of land, found on the toes of his possibly planet sized, 'little' brother. To entertain him while he formulated escape and getting normal again, he had the world's greatest display of power as dirt and rock shot by along with 'little' particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom meanwhile, was pursuing some friends going off to play soccer or maybe wrestle, he didn't care which. A few minutes ago, he could've sworn he saw his brother shrinking, but that was absurd. So, he instead covered the maybe 300 meters to the sports fields, intent on enjoying a good game with some friends, even a few cats. </span></div></div>",

What could do this? Fleas and bugs didn't talk, or at least had never been proven to, though they would be large enough to make just this level of noise. Not bugs, not giants, and there weren't any other people in sight, what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an enormous object, just as big around as a city or in this case, a strand of fur. Whatever it was, it stretched into the sky beyond sight miles and miles away, too far for Dan to reach any time soon. It seemed though, he wouldn't have to, as more moved, one after the other as the laughing continued. They covered miles in every movement, whatever they were, they were huge and there were quite a few of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creatures closed, the Lieutenant took cover by a piece of fur, the imperfections in it formed caves and for a few seconds he considered taking cover in one. In the end that was a bad idea and it was not to be put into use at the moment, aside from getting lost there was the possiblitly of the fur being shedded, stranding Dan in a potentially worse situation. Of course, it was hard to come up with things worse than being on your little brother's foot, at a size so small his padded toes would level countries with ease, when he was so large that your tiny form stuck to him from a gravitational pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadow blocked out what light there was to be had, as a huge object with five black surfaces on a sea of orange passed over head, then one similar but in a sea of grey. It was soon clear that these were shrunken cats and wolves, but they dwarfed Daniel by miles, they were probably ten meters away on their scale when they first became visible and that wasn't anything above their toes. This meant Dan was a rare case, and he envied them their size, big enough that Tom's gravity didn't effect them, as they were each clinging on to the fur to avoid getting thrown off.</span></div></div>",

For most of them, the light looked cool, pretty and had to be a part of some ultra-awesome-amazing game. It wasn't too far to the village either, a couple miles but even for kids, animals were pretty fast runners. Pretty quickly, footprints of barefoot kids filled the mud, four toes and one center pad holding all the weight and claws to dig in and make traction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spec ops team, charged with the defensive role, followed the kids from the shadows. Any threats would end up neutralized with deadly force and on top of that, they did need recon on that bright flash, whatever it was. Quiet as mice, but not their targets, the wolves moved on in the back of the pack and in places where no one would ever see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids had a blast, racing to where the village should have been, their short legs and little feet propelling them as absolutely fast as they could. It wasn't far now until they would reach the edge of the village to see what was up. They were already near-by and already a few felines were recieving shocks when they saw what looked like four mountains slam into the ground near-by and another five in the distance before taking off to hit again farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the village, the shrinking had taken the whole place and packed it into a spot that was barely a spec. When it receded, the grass and trees were sucked into the void left by the receding buildings. It made it seem that the village had never existed. In the village, four hundred thousand cats looked out of their city at stalks of grass that didn't reach their digitigrade ankles minutes ago now passed into the sky far over their home.</span></div></div>",

An object of a few ounces was more like a few hundred tons, and things had not yet reached the large objects barreling this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhesk and S'tie lead the pack, charging through grass still wet with dew and through little stretches of mud without worry of the cleaning it'd take to get the mud off them later. At the back of the pack, the kids more worried for their looks or cleanliness were going around all these areas as widely as they could. A whole lot of girls were able to keep their claws painted nice and clean, while the male cats got to say their hind claws were sharper than needles and all the shinier for it. In between there were others who just simply were slower than the leaders, but of similar mind-set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the cats were looking up at the muddy feet of the two sole biggest things they had ever seen. Water and dirt dripped off their claws and fur, both now darkened back to the ankle and knees. The view was not liked and made the felines wish they'd had more grass around so the city wouldn't be surrounded by spotty areas of coverage. It was sure that the wolf would drive a single claw through the city and end it, or that if that failed, the cat would accidentally level it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it, this should be the city center\" S'tie said, she just couldn't figure this one out. There wasn't a sign of home anywhere, and it should be right here where she was standing, skyscrapers, houses, the works of modern infrastructure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the grass\" Khesk said, \"it never used to be here and look at the pattern, it gets thinner as it comes to this point.\" He made a mark in the ground with his foot, creating five new lakes for the cats, with a miles drop until there was any water, where they just barely missed the city. \"Perhaps they were sucked underground, something had to pull this inward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" S'tie said as she and Khesk got low to the ground, on all fours to see if there was any sign of civilization. Particularly, they were looking for any signs of movement downward or a hole from the center spire of the city poking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhesk's white hands, the match to his formerly white feet combed over the ground, many times nearly hitting the city. Down below, it was whiping the cats into a frozen frenzy, not daring to move even the slightest of inches.

The mice have become tired of this treatment, and rigged the shrink cannon, which the mice had exchanged for rights against being mistreated, to backfire on the cats, effectively bringing the cats to their knees before the mice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cats were about one foot high compared to the mice now, the perfect size to be dominated, humiliated, and enslaved at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the \"massive\" rodents enjoyed terrorizing the felines into submission, the feeble cats were forced into high-tech containment jars, which could be easily transported to the mouse HQ.  With almost all of the felines into their containers, the few cats that were stupid enough to attempt to run away were hit with tranquilizers and dragged to the execution area, outside of the city.  The executioner was a rat.  Rats were usually in conflict with mice, but they both shared a common enemy: the now-pathetic cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonus, the leader of the felines, called his bodyguard force and tried to make it to a vehicle bay, where several evacuation vehicles were held.  Alas, a mouse saw his escape attempt.  This mouse, by the name of Lorus, smashed the bodyguard and dragged Leonus to the Execution area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe execution, Drastar, smiled when he saw the cat approaching.  Drastrar spat in the face of Leonus as Lorus left, leaving the cat at the mercy of a rat who has been waiting for the moment to have the oh-so-mighty Leonus under his foot.  The cat spouted some nonsense about how he would be avenged and the such.  Drastar was annoyed by this and wanted to shut him up.  He hadn't been to the bathroom for a while, so he simply raised his tail above the tied-up Leonus' face, and squeezed a turd into his mouth.  Drastar felt good, knowing that he had just declared the cats only worthy of his feces, but he would also probably get a promotion, as his job was more humiliation than execution.  \"taste good, you pathetic cat?\" he mocked Leonus.  Drastar then used his claw to slice through the rope that was bonding the cat, and flipped the cat over with his belly exposed.  The rat then stomped his foot down on Leonus so hard, the piece of feces in his mouth went soaring out along with a screech from the cat.  Leonus set his foot on<br>\r\nthe weak Leonus.  \"Do you know what we do with the cats that wander in our territory?\" Drastar said.  Leonus weakly shook his head.  \"We eat 'em!\" Drastar whispered to Leonus.  Drastar then hoisted the cat in the air.  He noticed Leonus' erection as he was lifted up, which Drastar chuckled at.  The rat then shoved Leonus onto his tongue, face-first to humiliate him further.  Leonus, being tossed around the rat's mouth, then realized that he wasn't going to have the luxury of being swalloed.  He realized that was about to be chewed up.  The cat was eventually raised on a tooth, and whimpered as he was brutally shoved deeper into the tooth.  The next bite was from a sharper tooth, and Leonus had a large puncture in his abdomin, and each bite  made more cuts and scars.  Then, one bite made a massive gap in his abdomin, dwarfing the other deformities.  Much to drastar's enjoyment, blood started oozing out the rat's mouth.  After more bites, Leonus was in horrible pain as he was a bloody mess now.  Drastar squished the remnant of Leonus between his mollars one more time before he swalloed the bloody mess, and licked the yummy cat blood and guts off his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeverl hours later, after many entertaining beheadings of cats, Drastar felt the need to do his<br>\r\nbusiness again.  He slowly squeezed out a large turd, which he squished underfoot, declaring Leonus nothing but dirt that he trampled underfoot.  With Leonus' humiliation and Delicious execution complete, he got onboard a transport, headed for the mouse HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was truly the day that marked the cats' fall underfoot of their enemies.  With their main city dealt with by the mice, the rest of the cats' enemies would move in on their weak and humiliated enemy.  The cats' arch enemy, the canine, rodent's of all kind, birds, and even zebras were now ready to bring their enemy to it's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all desired to spit in the face of the defeated felines, and that was know possible. </span></div></div>",

Soon he was in a pit deep enough to be some kid's splashing pool and later, deep enough to be turned into a fair-sized fox-hole.

He saw something shocking, the titan was just a ten year old kid, which explained his inaction and why he'd yet to make the wolf into a stain on his paws. That put the kid, on his own scale at four feet tall or so, which meant the wolf was smaller than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhead, the enormous form of the cat started to move, whatever fear had held him there was now wearing off. He lifted a foot a few inches on his scale and brought it down, just shifting his weight as the trance wore off. The Earthquake that followed shook Khesk to the bone and launched him into the air. He wound up directly in front of the cat's toes, and was now so short he could've walked under them. There was a short distance out here where the pad's kept a fair amount of each toe off the ground, and to Kehsk that space was like a cavern with no end. Each pad towered overhead to a sky-scrape tall ceiling of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the titanic toes suddenly shot toward Khesk, it was a small movement normally but seemed hyper-sonic. He ran and just barely avoided it as it moved and then shot into the air, wiggling in a way, the kid testing his limbs that they worked. After that, sweat bombed off the pad overhead, a single drop could fill a lake. As the little lupine ran ever farther, the bombardment only increased, the kid was in a major cold sweat and a major terror to the troop. He'd kill the little lupine with ease and never know it was his toe that did it from a few milimeters off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, the rain ceased as it was replaced by the enormous space of a toe coming down instead. It pressed down into the dirt rather than sit over it as earlier and almost did end Khesk. The wolf survived, caught in a tiny space left open by the fur. When the weight lifted from him though, it was in the wrong place. A sea of sweat had turned mud clung to the toe into goop and clung to the wolf, or more accurately barely held to the cat and held a nanoparticle to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above, the pre-teen titan Horack was shaking off the sudden fear of death he'd had and his memories of shrinking. One minute he was chasing a soccerball through the grass, the next he was walking through the grass like a field. Normally small bugs were like moderate sized animals. He at first had just stomped on them like a larger than normal bug, their slime had coated his feet up toward the ankle but that was just that. Gradually, the bugs got bigger. He had to start kicking them, and then it was a fist-fight with a club, then he was looking up at the bugs, now small enough for them to kick or crush underfoot. Not much later, he'd found a huge drop, he stretched forever and was soon discovered to be a rut left from him kicking that soccerball earlier. He perhaps stood a chance against only a flea now. Everything had shattered when he looked up at a creature which would kill him for sure, a Wolf, and was so many times lower than the claws came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shock wore off, he put one microscopic foot in front of the other and walked on through the forest of grass. He remembered very vaguely the wolf shrinking and then a bug to him showing up, but that was all. The only solution was to walk this off.</span></div></div>",

When he was at last on top, the hole made by the pads under one of his toes was eight times his height, 50 ft. deep. His form at the start of the climb was now a giant in its own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat was standing in the same place as before, small enough now that a normal sized anything would never have seen it. He still fit under the lupine's claws, so at the least the creature was not a threat, though he could potentially be of assistance. Khesk bent down and carefully got the little feline on one of the pads of his hand and held him there while he fished for anything to put him in, eventually coming up with a plaster container full of cotton for treating wounds. It had no holes, but for a creature the size of the cat, it had enough air for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, T'ornai, the feline, found himself in a sea of white. Beams of it criscrossed through the whole skyscraper of a container and seemed to defy gravity as it held upright with ease despite its softness in places. He was still in shock about his size, but isolation from the world and just how huge things were had started to weaken its grip on him. At least it would until he realized what he was in and standing on. For now though, he found himself in a glass building with weird white guts that were comfortable and soft under his pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Khesk walked through a macroforest of grass, watching it grow every minute, but at the same time, more gradually as his reduction in size came to a steady halt.</span></div></div>",

As soon as one of the quakes was gone, the others filled in for its disappated force. Khesk couldn't keep his footing and fell. On the ground, he held still and just tried to keep from getting thrown around, but that was nearly impossible. It was as if the ground were a storm on the seas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive wall of green struck the ground, dug under, moved forward and then kicked up with a million billion tons of force. It hit dead-in where Khesk was and when it moved up sent him into the sky like some particle of dust or maybe even something smaller than that. Either way, the Lupine's three hundred pounds of weight, at least to him, didn't have much effect on how things went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he soared skyward, Khesk found himself passing the grass and was to him, incomprehensibly high up. From there, he peered around and saw the lat thing he had expected; kids! The entire area was filled with the titanous cubs of the major species: human, lupine, feline and there may even have been a mouse or two. There was just one question though, where had they come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, there came an answer as the little lupine saw a very clear symbol where he'd just come from. The huge green wall was some 'little' girl's enormous flip-flop. On the white canvas of her skin, there was a continetal image painted on with text reading \"Camp Halliday-Play.\" The naming and odd spelling of course attracted kids, apparently just as much as the bright light from the shrink-ray. Today was Saturday, the camp counselor's day off, so the minimal staff couldn't hold the kids in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Khesk was seven inches up by normal standards, but had moved forward three and was still going strong. As he looked around, he saw kids unleashing power he had only dreamed of and it was horrifying him to think he could end up in their targeting sights. Their toes spanned miles, even for the lupines known for having the tiniest toes of everyone except for the mice, had the trooper been that size, he'd have been unbeatable.</span></div></div>",

For one thing, at the start you had to start with someone holding the ball up and then it would get kicked far into the sky towards the other goal. This wolf did things differently, usually you laid down and held it with your hands, well he'd been kicked a few too many times in the head that way so he'd hold it with his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhesk saw a huge white and black sphere suddenly fill his vision, it was like a planet. Before he got a chance to reach it though, he saw it suddenly disappear and then he found an enormous surface coming up under him, so fast he barely even noticed it. All around him was an enormous forest, he could barely see outside its canopy, it was just that thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, mud, dirt and water rained down from the sky, the huge branchless trees were the only shelter. At times though, even they seemed to fail. Khesk held on though, he needed to find out where he was and somehow get home, he'd promised his brother Vad'rie he would when last he left home. Too many promises had been broken before and he wouldn't be breaking this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVad'rie had followed his friends here, some said they found tiny wolves and cats, but he didn't believe them. If there were, they were no threat to him and he'd just crush the felines; as for lupines, he doubted a wolf would ever stand it. So, here he was, playing soccer. He'd kicked the ball off and was now running after it, his feet dipped into mud and then came right back out again or in some cases just tore it up. The most annoying thing though was getting them wet with the dew on the grass, he hated wet fur.</span></div></div>",

This made the big picture much easier, one shot of the shrink ray and the enemy would dwindle in stature and keep doing so until who knew when. This thing had long-lasting effects, if the same thing carried to the wolve's shrink ray, then they could end any enemy with a single shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhesk looked down at the ever dwindling cat, now small enough that he had to  his neck up to see where the toe-nails emerged from the foot. It all added to the creature's shock down below and cold though the wolf was, he began to consider helping this one cat and maybe another. Then came the last straw when the titanic lupine noticed that the thing in front of him was a young cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the enemies were supposed to be accounted for, but there were going to be felines getting eaten and meddled with, why couldn't one still innocent be saved? Slowly, the foot that had held firm in front of the cat drew back and the enormous creature came to a crouch, holding out a single claw on his fingers to scoop up the tiny thing. Seconds later, it was riding in a tin stuffed with cotton, inside the breast pocket over the dog's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT'ornai had his world turned upside down today. Everything had suddenly gotten bigger except his house and friends, then the giants came and it all turned upside down. He had been as tall as the grass, but as he ran he found himself getting smaller and smaller. Finally, tiny T'ornai came undone when when a bug had nearly squashed him. Cat's ate and trampled bugs. He still had bug-cuts on his pads and between his toes from stomping on a few this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing he knew, there was this huge wolf's foot in front of him, if he jumped he might be able to get on top and climb to the top. The shrinking thouch continued, the wolf's toes were titans in their own right and then, for some reason T'ornai was moving off the ground and into some weird soft container that seemed to hold a bulding made of soft stuff. It closed and then wound up in some other container, the temperature was comfortable and light was non-existent, but it was comfortable and an odd rythmic boom in the background made a sense of calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the land of giants, Khesk kept moving on, eventually he found another cat, it was bigger than the last, but then the last was a very young cub. It was also quite daring, the creature charged at the wolf's foot, but did no harm, the titan didn't notice the slightest sensation. All the while though, he had wondered what a cat tasted like, despite the little one he had just adopted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the creature was attacking, the wolf bent down, grabbed him and through him in his mouth. The feline was smaller than any of the lupine's teeth, but there was still enough of him there for there to be a taste of chicken. On his tongue, the creater barely registered to be there and then went down the back, falling down a hole thousands of  feet wide.</span></div></div>",

As he sat there, he closed his eyes and let his head lay back as he soaked up the afternoon sun in the shadless, treeless clearing that had once held a city. Here, he had no boss to worry about as spec ops ran their own chain of command and he was the only spec ops troop here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below, a creature just about microscopic from his size was charging the wolf. He had seen his little brother get picked up by the giant and had been following him ever since. He left little footprints leading to and around those of the larger lupine, which to D'rie were bottomless pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the titan sat down and D'rie leapt up his sides as he climbed, and climbed and climbed to the pocket he'd seen his brother in. Tiny paw prints of dirt were left on each thread as he went and after about two hours, he reached his goal, but then there was something special about him that so far, no one knew and would not know for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe side of the pocket was a cathederal, the flap that closed it left a normally small gap but currently huge for the cub to slip through. He got in just as Khesk got up, which made it a challenge to reach his brother's prison, but in the end, he did.</span></div></div>",

His bed was a very carefully constructed object of cotton and wood fragments with blankets made of materials retrieved from the shrunken city on return trips. He oddly never found a bed, so he had his current one, when it was built it was too small for him but a month later he'd shrunken to the point that it was ten times the size needed. Nowadays, his shrinking had pretty much stopped, with an occurance every now and then, but they were pretty minor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little feline's 'room' consisted of a four inch area marked off by tape on his 'big', but younger adopted brother's night-stand. As a result, there was an enormous wall in the distance, but his little feet had scaled it many times, as size was not enough to stop him from living life. This cat was just as mobile as one of the giants, though his little and only true person smaller than him was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to wake-up little bro\" Jack boomed from above, you looked up to see his enormous head looking around the night-stand. He put a hand down on the tape and like that, D'rie was off and running for it, a minute later, he was surrounded by towers of fur miles tall and miles around sitting on muscles the size of techtonic plates. Everything zoomed around as the arm was lifted and twisted, but it had no effect on the feline, he was so small now that the warm surface under his pads had a gravitational force more than adequeate to hold him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he walked on to his usual perch, he'd get there and spend the whole day sitting or goofing off. He'd pulled some odd pranks but at his size, no one had ever seen or known of them. Of course, only the family knew he existed in the first place.</span></div></div>",

When the continent caught itself on the way down to sort of stop in a push-up, the force hurtled the feline loose of gravity and towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur was gone in an instant and then off in the distance, the giant's muzzle passed by slowly like a planet going by out in space. Hundreds of miles off to the sides, huge mountains stretched to the ground and out into a mountain range covered in forest. It was a bit scary how big things truly were now, though if things were swapped, the cat would be even bigger than the canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'rie looked down at the solid wooden floor below approached. At this point he was just passing his brother's toes as the giant got up and moved on, without even noticing his missing passenger. Finally, it was time to land, whatever had shrunken the cats had done it with a few advantages; their molecular structure was a very good shock absorber, if you land right, you can survive scratch-free. Limbs downward and spread wide, the cat hit like an artillery shell and rolled with the force until he was at a dead stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood, looking around, but could see no sign of Jack, who no doubt was thousands of miles away by now. Then, the floor rocked with another booming, and this was a bad boom, this was trouble, it was always trouble.

The shrinking had happened though and right now, that giant was coming this way as a mechination of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ranie, big buddy, could you back up!\" D'rie yelled, the splayed toes of the titan covered miles and miles of ground each, not to mention  the large amounts of mud, water and filth dripping off, which was only a crush-risk. Of course, sometimes being heard was a bigger risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's enormous ears swiveled around for a second or two, the sound waves coming at him were smaller than even the tinniest insect's buzzing but all canids had remarkable hearing. He didn't understand it though, his head was too far off the ground to hear something that little, that low. So, he went about his business, continuing towards his little brother, leaving oceans of water and mud with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf D'rie was scared before, he was going through horror right now. Somehow, he could cover immense distances despite micorscopic feet and legs, but even the walk of a 5 year old was faster than him. His smallest pad alone stretched 18 miles, and that wasn't even the whole toe. Figure then, the kid's stride at being 300 miles or more given the miles and miles of legs compared against the two microns covered by the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the feline, there was nothing to do, the kid couldn't be outrun and the toes were too wide to get out of their path if he knew where that was. Not to mention if not for the gravity of the wood, the cat would've been launched into the air.

The dog was standing there in shock as things that were once dwarfs to him were now taller than any mountain. Near-by, a bouncy ball sat in the mud, filling a large part of the horizon even from here. It was small on a normal scale of course, not even close to reaching the young lupine's toes minutes ago. He knew, as he'd picked it up with his feet and thrown it while laying down, just to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro, welcome to the world of the microscopic\" D'rie said as he stopped in front of the canid, towering over him. \"I guess little bro now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hh-h-how small am I?\" Ralie asked, though he was sure he didn't want to know the answer, it'd only do more to scare him. \"And how did I get this small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore an answer could be given, the ground shook with an earthquake's force and more as what had been the smallest wolf walked out towards the couch behind which the tiny siblings were standing. The approaching creature towered into the sky and walked with a slight waddle going from foot to foot. In minutes, he was even messier than his mud-loving brother had been<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\" D'rie yelled, grabbing Ralie and shoving him along, but he just wasn't fast enough, the three year old's stride was a few hundred miles, the lupine's was a few nanometers or less and he wasn't moving fast enough to make up for that. \"I did this, maybe I can undo it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yelling, while near non-existent to the titan was still there and it got his attention. It seemed to be just a few steps ahead of him, whatever it was. Eventually, he stopped when his wet and muddy toes were about to crush it, at least by his best guess. For a second or two, he considered getting on his belly, but that would mean another bath, which he didn't want. It'd be easier to just crush these things, they were probably bugs or fleas anyway.</span></div></div>",

Mud and water rained down in clumps the size of cities at the smallest, just barely missing the two tiny creatures, but not by much. In another fraction of a second, the little brother would prove he was the biggest even at his smallest part and in doing so, leave his siblings in a crater to them, miles deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'rie focused on stealing mass from the dirt beneath his feet and putting it in himself, growing himself. In seconds, the dirt was sinking into non-existence or at the least smaller existence and at the same time, the feline was rapidly expanding, to him the world was shrinking. He was an amazon against the dog next to him, soon that little lupine was at his waist, his knees, his ankles and only kept getting smaller. This was no major height, but he felt like a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalie saw his brother growing and growing in size as the dirt disappeared. At the same time, it was all enough to make his 'little' brother over-head back up a step or two. As the formerly tiny creature grew to a titan, the lupine noticed something was wrong though; even as he stood there, the world was growing, not just the cat. More than dirt was losing its mass, it seemed anything tiny enough to blend in with it was going to go too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, the wolf was looking up at the splayed toes of the cat, already four times his height. The mud and water at the sides made climbing there impossible, but there was another possibility. Somewhere, the mountainous digits had to connect and there it would be easiest to climb up and get away from the shrinking, maybe even grow. Ralie then ran forward, making some head-way even as the distances grew, soon the fur and flesh to either side surrounded him and left him in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis route though, was not as easy as it had seemed. Pebbles turned boulders were everywhere, pinned between the toes, caught in the fur and so on. Making matters worse, there was mud everywhere which lead only to slipping, sliding and general mess with loss of grip. Eventually, the little lupine, a ball of mud and toe-jam started to climb the rocks on the walls to either side of him, he was so small now or perhaps D'rie so large, that he was in something more like a valley or ravine than the space between someone's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'rie himself was just now coming on-level with the 3 year old wolf's toes, but was growing faster and faster.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't quite connecting that his 'little' adopted brother had now grown and was bigger in size and still in years as before hand. The young lupine had several older brothers now to play with, at least he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little buddy!\" the cat said, picking up the wolf, now incredibly light and spinning him about, \"nice to finally see you from here rather than down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wee he hee he hee!\" loughed the lupine as he was spun around in circles, being tickled by the centrifigal forces involved. He was having an absolute blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRallie on the other hand, the now little lupine brother, was caught by the gravity made just by the toes of the feline. He could see quite far, but the distances were just huge, beyond imagining. He'd made it close to the top while he was larger, but the distance now would take days to cover, and this was just a short section of the toes, let alone the entire body. Far overhead, he saw the pads and toes of his 'little' brother as the titan feline hauled a billion, billion tons skyward with absolute ease. The young wolf was bigger than most countries, if the shrunken wolf made it across a pad that'd be like crossing Florida, if the chest, it'd be like crossing the whole of Europe.

A bike was pretty much a continental steam-roller that broke the sound barrier and challenged the speed of light, a ball was a model planet or asteroid projectile, a skate board was a forest of black spikes and an easy way to drown, a locker room was just an easy place to get killed by one of many species, a book was a country scaled building, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where to start\" the feline asked himself as he put the young wolf down, he had a lot on his list of things to do. At last it came to him: he'd never stopped running, but he had lost the scenery and parts to enjoy, but not now. \"Hey little buddy, lets head out for a run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid couldn't help but bounce around, he loved to play and now he could chase someone. For him it was almost as good as chasing that thing he'd heard on the floor earlier. Though that mystery was nagging him in the back of his mind, there was fun to be had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, they were out and running. Meanwhile, Rallie, was climbing, running and jumping to avoid an onslaught of dirt, grass and more getting flung at him. It was like climbing through moving mountains of spires stretching skyward and through it all having to dodge immense cities falling from the sky. The only advantage to being so small right now as the cat's toes were so massive, their gravity easily held the wolf down through the millions of G's of the running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, D'rie came up on an old friend, but fear for years; mud. The stuff was hard to find in a way safe for him on his old scale of size. A puddle was an ocean covered planet, the pressure on one's foot at the bottom was enough to crush a creature that size like a tin-can, making it off-limits to him. Now though, he could jump and splash around in it like he used to as a cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dead ahead, up, splash and in the feline went. He loved the cooling water over his hot pads and the squishy mud between his pads and toes. His feet were only at the deep end for a few seconds, then it was all only about as tall as the toes, he kept going through that and then stopped at the end to wait on his little lupine friend following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'rie was soaked, he was coated in caked on dry grime one minute and the next it was soaking wet muck. He grabbed on tight to a piece of rock that was thoroughly caught on the toe as the water negated gravity and ripped at him to suck him off. For a second all he tasted was mud and sweat in his mouth, then air and then it repeated several times before at last he was in the air. All around, the spires were soaked and starting to sag downward with their weight and the effect of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lupine cub caught up a few seconds later, sloshing through the water and stopping right in front of the cat. He bounced time after time after time yelling, \"more, more!\" Then he changed the plan and bouncing up and down on the feline's feet yelled \"uppy! uppy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sets of pads splayed wide and for a second the lupines slipped through the cats, his claws were doing a good job of scratching as they went up and down at the back of each toe. For Rallie though, it was like trying to dodge a hammer the size of Texas coming in and wreaking destruction every second. Boulders fell from the sky, spires, mud and more, not to mention the claws which were barely missing him. Eventually one enormous toe got him on the way back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'rie calmed the kid down and got him to stop jumping while he thought about what to do next. For the little lupine, this was a relief as he got himself on a stable cliff between the titan's toes. He was now between the toes of his 'little' brother, they had been at the most, three inches long if you counted the whole bottom part of the foot. Rallie had once broken two of these mountains with his formerly five inch long foot, right now though, he wasn't able to even move anything, let alone break a couple hundred miles thick bone with his foot. Of course, the older brother had once had to look down to see his brother's ears, now he could look anywhere to see giant and his brother would have to get out a microscope to find him.</span></div></div>",

Then he remembered that the wolf hadn't been grown and was still microscopic or smaller. A rescue was needed, and it was quite likely the tiny creature was still among them, Tarsi, the three year old wolf was right by his now little brother. He was likely somewhere on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a new game buddy\" D'rie said, he needed the soon to be large lupine to stay still so he could do this and not die. Running around, jumping and playing would just make it harder and more dangerous. Of course, the idea of getting small again wasn't too appealing either. \"There's something hiding on  you and we're gonna find it. I need you to hold still and I'll look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I can see more of me than you can\" Tarsi asked, how was someone bigger than him, a relative amazon gonna find something small on his own body. It seemed the odds were in his favor more than the cat's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll have to get smaller\" D'rie said, leading the little lupine to a tree and forcing him to sit down in the brown/red dirt that surrounded it. \"If you don't move, I might take you with me next time. There's all sorts of cool places we could go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarsi believed it all, he hadn't yet learned some things were normally impossible. So, there he sat with his legs stretched in front of him, heels on the ground and toes way up in the air. He was resolved that he wouldn't move a single inch, not the slightest bit in any direction. It'd be cool to be small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'rie stood there thinking of what to put his mass in, it had to be something small so it wouldnt' get too big. To prove his abilites, the feline bent over and pulled a tiny piece of solidified mud off the fur of the lupine. He concentrated and thought of the pebble, himself and shrinking. Instantly the world began to expand all around, the pebble moved grew even faster, soon it was too heavy to hold and thudded to the ground with a bang. Soon, the wolf's feet were overhead as they reached into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf couldn't believe what he was seeing, something so big getting so small and vice versa for the pebble. When it disappeared behind his feet, he parted them just enough to see the formerly bigger brother stand shorter than his toes, but big enough to see. It appeared the cat was barely as big as a bug, and maybe he really wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start at the ground up was D'rie's method. To pull it off he had to get on the lupine's toes which wouldn't be doable as far as he understood his powers. So, he'd shrink in bits as he moved and explored. Now a quarter inch tall, he walk to the enormous ankles and climbed up,grabbing the rung like furs as a ladder. At the top, he climbed along the foot to the toes and noticed how now his weight was just enough to make them dip. He pushed a toe down with his foot, all his weight just to experiment. Then standing on the middle digit, he repeated the shrinking process, the fur laying flat soon towered overhead, the enormous lupine eyes stared down at the toes as the cat disappeared amidst them, getting so small the toes were like states.</span></div></div>",

The mud was all over, but drying more and more into huge mountains, making enormous obstacles in the land-scape, if everyone were this size, the dirt from the toes back to the ankle on this foot alone would make enough houses to hold a good many billion people. This was all just the mess on a little kid's little foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no where to go now but forward to find the shrunken wolf. Not long after getting started, though it was a good three hundred miles later, a huge canyon cut off the feline from his path. Truthfully, he'd yet to reach actual skin, besides fur, everything was dried or drying mud. At this scale, a layer of mud was extremely thick, earlier at a quarter inch tall this stuff was just thicker than the cat's foot was tall but now that even ammounted to many miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solid, rock-hard dirt caught on the fur though provided an excellent means of climbing and D'rie used that to get a view of the area. Upward he shot and when he looked down there were five distinct holes, one for a center pad and four for the toes, this was where he'd pushed down to see if the giant limit could be moved. On the 'ground' the large hole seemed to go beyond the horizon, from up here, the four smaller holes went there and there was no sign of marks from the claws.</span></div></div>",

The roof stretched into the sky and the immense tunnel stretched back towards the piece of fur it was formed around, who knew where it went? The mud was miles deep and covered a country, one may end up at the pads, between the toes or all the way back at the ankle. Soon though, this would just be another little kid again, his foot something measured in inches again rather than miles, only a threat to bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are\" D'rie said, \"come on lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared stiff, Rallie didn't waste time in rushing out to the cat and hanging on while they would hopefully grow, but then things went bad.

At last, there was no chance to avoid the brother's finger, it carved a trench through dead skin and hurled the little creatures over the side. The force toppled any scale and knocked the two out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarsi found his itch and slammed his foot down with it now resolved. The near nano sized creatures were rammed into by the downward force and wound up under the foot caught to a pad.

They were in a 'valley' of the grooves so the ground was no threat, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the little creatures came to. They floated on the ocean of sweat and saw under them specks of dust from the dirt path measuring in miles and little pebbles that filled their visions.

The cub's foot was too large to be affected by them and their was no way quite to escape yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above in the world of titans, Tarsi picked up the pace to keep up with his brother.

A five hundred foot tall hyena was staring down at them, it's cock and balls simply hanging over a building. It's sheer size terrified him. The male in question was butt naked and gave him and the rest of his men a twisted smile. The commander looked past the hyena and saw a trail of destruction in it's wake. Toppled buildings. rubble lining the street and large masses of bloody broken bodies in deep paw prints. A chuckle escaped the giant's lips. A toothy smile greeted the now shaken cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", he said. \"Little bugs should have gotten out the way.\" He gave a small laugh. As if the deaths of so many did little more then amuse him. The commander was about to shout up at the cruel giant but as if sensing his frustration the hyena held up a finger and waved it in front of his face. \"Now, now, little bugs should be careful what they say to giants\", he teased. \"Other wise stuff like this happens\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena turned away from the commander and faced a skyscraper that stood only two heads taller then the hyena. Then the ground cracked at the hyena shifted his weight jumped up in the air and maneuvered through the air and delivered an unnecessary and flashy round house kick through the building's middle. Glass exploded outwards as metal bent and broke. Cats screamed as several of them flew through the air and even more died upon impact. Half the building was sent flying across the city colliding through several smaller structures before coming to a grinding halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom half of the skyscraper stood where it was even s the giant landed gracefully and heavily on the street below. The hyena walked up to admire his work smiling nastily down at the surviving workers before stepping back and delivering three kicks in rapid succession knocking the other half of the tower to the ground. Satisfied with his work the giant never losing his evil grin turned back to the shocked Commander and onlookers. He leaned over the balcony that began to crack under his weight. \"Consider your words carefully, bug\", he said as his hot breath washed over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander could only glare up in fury and fear at the hyena. That skyscraper was the crowning technological achievement of the cats. And in seconds this monster had destroyed it and several other building all while killing thousands of lives. The cat calmly tried to collect himself before addressing the hyena. This wasn't easy to do. But the commander was a lion and lions aren't cowards. \"He took a shaky breath as the giant's breath played with his mane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyena, what do you\", he started to ask only for the dog to interrupt him mid sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyena, so informal. Is that how you address all your guests by their species?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\", the commander replied. \"What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena somehow managed to widen his grin. 'Do you think a little bug like you has the right to ask me for my name?\" He asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I call you then\", the commander asked starting to loose his temper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you call someone as great as me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few words sprang to mind but the lion stifled those insults out of fear for his city. \"Your Grace\", he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better\", the hyena agreed. \"What do you want to ask little bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, your grace?\" The commander asked through barely contained anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why little bug\", the hyena started. \"We want to do to you what were going to do the other species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is, your grace?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hyenas have always been very few. It's not easy to survive where we are from, but we have a dream. A dream to one day rise above the other species and play with them.

The mice were always very small and their cites not much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when you say play, my grace you mean...\" the commander trailed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean wreck your little cities, squish you little bugs, convince you that serving us as our slaves and food, oh and as our toys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander went pale at this news. \"But first\", the hyena pushed himself up and broke part of the balcony off, and began walking around the facility. Then without any warning he struck his arm though the ceiling of the lab and began rooting around for something. Then giving a small aha pulled out the shrink ray and moved back around to the front of the building showing his prize to the cats. Then without any warning he closed his fist and crushed the shrink ray in his hand. The sound of crunching metal filled the air, when the hyena opened his hand and showed a small crumpled ball to the cats. Then turning around he winded up his arm and chucked the ball as hard as he could until it went plop into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cats looked up at the hyena in absolute fear now. \"Always best to crush an enemy's final hope before you seal their fate. Now then...\"</span></div></div>",

The horse population that was so woefully underdeveloped experienced a massive surge of size and set about conquering the other smaller races.  The technology, tactics, and knowledge of the more developed races proved all but useless against their gargantuan invaders turned overlords. Lupines were quickly defeated, their alpha being beaten and eaten by the chief of the horses. The cats fared no better. The mice while managing to put up more of a fight could only annoy the titanic horses and were quickly defeated. In the battle their so called shrink ray was crushed and any hope of fixing this problem vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the mice, the other races realizing what they were up against quickly surrendered and abandoned any hope of fighting back. The horses though small in numbers wasted no time in establishing their rule. The knowledge and technology used to give the now mortals and upper hand over the horses superior muscle and size were now being used to service the gods in what ever way they pleased. They still had no desire to use this technology as it became known as the mortal way. And instead focused their time being pampered, waited on hand  and hoof and stomping out the occasional resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood what was at first a major problem. Due to the size of the horses it took a lot to feed them. The mortals resources were nearly picked dry. But thankfully a few horses had seeds on them and successfully manage to plant them. It took a few years but eventually giant sized fruits and vegetables popped up. Turning the very continent into essentially a garden. However the horses made it very clear that lowly mortals were not allowed to eat these plants. They were allowed to clean and feed their gods but never eat the same food as them. Horses however were allowed to eat both their and their mortals plants. When one anthro told the chief that was unfair and asked why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief replied by stating. \"Because I'm a god, mortal. I could wipe your pathetic little race off this planet if I wanted to. You only live because we deem it so. You should feel honored that your puny existences are finally being put use.\" And that was the end of that. The fact that horses literally controlled weather they lived or died terrified millions. Eventually the cities and species with in them began to realize their was no waking from this nightmare and served their gods to the best of their abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were accidents of course. A village would be destroyed, when a horse wasn't being careful. Citizen's would go hungry when one of their deties was feeling peckish and ravaged their fields. And the occasional servant was crushed or eaten but slowly but surely the mortals were accepting the the horses as their gods. No of them of course were happy. But their gods cared not for their suffering only for their obedience. However that didn't stop their gods from having the ossionaly fun with the tinies.

He was once a chief but now he was a king. King of the gods and ruler of lupine city. The city whose very buildings paled in comparison to him. His back rested against the former alpha's house. A nice sturdy building that while failed as a throne but made a very comparable place to lie back against. He closed his eyes and thought back to the day he invaded the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir puny forces were nothing compared to him. He flattened the army and easily made his way to the center of town. The king boomed out his challenge to the alpha who was little more then a bug compared to him. The look on the wolf's face when he arrived. The alpha of wolves could never deny a challenge even if said challenge was made from an outsider. The chief remembered how the wovles would raid his village and dissmiss them as savages but now, now he was a god and the alpha was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant stallion gave a booming chuckle that spooked the citizens of the city far below him. He remembered the once proud warrior wrestle his finger as he played with the little bug. Knocking his body around squeezing him, laughing at his puny efforts Then the chief decided to end it. He remembers reaching down and plucking the alpha between two fingers and slowly bringing him towards his face. But not before doing a few size comparisons to show just how puny the wolf really was compared to him. Then very gently throwing him into his mouth and sucking on the alpha's  body for a bit. Just long enough to heal the little wolf beg him to stop. Then tilting his head backwards the chief easily swallowed the little pup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god king licked his lips remembering the taste. Others challenged him of course but he humiliated them thee same way he humiliated their alpha. He even remembers killing one of the challengers with a fart. After that resistance died down and the wolves served their new rightful ruler. Maybe no loyally but he could fix that if he wanted to, but it was much more fun to remind them who was in charge the old fashioned way. Speaking of which. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe God king looked at his massively ripped chest as two tiny wolves carried a grape across his vast bulk over to him. They couldn't drop the grape. The chief absolutely refused to eat food that touched the ground. He was a god after all, he ha high standards. They had been struggling to get that grape to him for over half an hour. He wasn't even hungry he just wanted to see his servants suffer. The Giant gently reached out and plucked the grape from them. They watched as he brought it to his massive mouth and easily popped it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief sucked and chewed on it for a bit before leaning down to the wolves and spat the chewed mess out a them. The force knocked them to to ground as they were covered in spit and grape residue. \"I'm not hungry.\" The chief boomed. The two wolves seethed with anger but forced it down as they got on their hands and knees and bowed low to him. the first raised his head and spoke trying to keep his voice even. \"May we serve you in any other way, our god.\" The giant rubbed his chin and looked down at the wolves. \"Actually yes, I would like you to</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"My testicles are full of my royal seed, and I feel I could use a good milking, right about now\", declared the Horse chief, as he cradled his engorged sack with one hoof. The tiny wolves shuddered in horror at the thought of having to \"milk\" this foreign tyrant that now ruled over them, but they also knew that to refuse this demand would result in them being reduced to a gooey mess, not unlike the chewed up grape that the Horse god had just spat out before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at their former normal size, a Horse's cock is enormous when compared to that of most species, but now that the Horses had been grown into towering colossus, their penises were as large or larger than the largest buildings of the Lupines. Of all the Horses, the Horse chief had the largest penis, and with the balls to match. It would take the hard work of all the Lupines present in his court to work his shaft, and \"milk\" him of his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter defeating the former Lupine alpha, the Horse chief had not only inherited the title of alpha of the wolves, but also the harem of bitches (a term to refer to female canines) that had belonged to the now deceased Lupine alpha. This harem consisted of the most beautiful and pure bred Wolf Maidens in all the land. Every Lupine male coveted these beautiful bitches, but now they were in the hands (or hoof) of a giant Horse Lord. The concept of harems was something completely new to the Horses. By tradition, the Horses were monogamous, with just a single mate for life. This was true even for the Horse nobility, and even the Horse chieftain himself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after becoming the undisputed Gods of this world, the Horses inherited many new institutions and ideas from their subject races, including the idea of harems. Of course, it was still expected that each Horse would have only one Horse mate for life, but there were no pre-existing rules regarding the subject races, who now more or less were stripped of their rights, and lived or died solely at the whims of their Horse overlords. Even the lowest ranking horses could have their own harems from the conquered subject races, because even the lowest ranking horse was still superior in rank compared to the inferior races. The only real rule in effect was that the Horse chieftain got priority on whomever he wished, and by the laws of the Wolves he now owned a harem of royal wolf bitches. The wolves for their part hated and were disgusted by this, but nevertheless, he had defeated the former alpha, so even by their own rules, the bitches were now his by right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring out my harem!\" roared the horse king, as he clapped his fore-hooves together in a thunderous sound like that of a gavel. The two tiny wolves that had carried the grape, fled in terror to retrieve the King's new harem of wolf maidens. They did not have to go very far, because as it turned out, the royal harem resided within the very same palace that the giant Horse King now used as a semi-throne. Within minutes, they returned along with a few dozen female Lupines of exquisite beauty. These royal bitches were clad in the finest silks and gems, befitting of their noble rank. Though they were far too small for the giant Horse King's nose to discern, they were also covered in the most alluring perfumes and musks, that would entice any male. Of course, even if the Horse King could inhale their musk, it might not have any effect on him, being that he was of a completely different species, and their pheromones might be incompatible with his nasal receptors. But nevertheless, the beauty of these royal Wolf Maidens was undeniable, regardless of what species looked upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolves took great pride in the beauty of their females, and being a dominant military power, these ladies were heavily guarded to outside races. Males of other races could only dream of being with a Lupine female. That was what made the Horse King's possession of the royal harem bitches so unbearably painful for the Wolves to bear. It used to be that a male of another race would be killed for so much as looking at a Wolf lady with lust, but now the Wolves have been completely emasculated and were powerless to do anything to stop this male of a \"lesser\" race from having his way with the best and most beautiful of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Horse King's always enormous penis began to swell to even larger proportions, as he hungrily eyed over the royal wolf maidens and began to think of things he would like to do with them. These Wolfesses hailed from every corner of the globe, and came in various exotic flavors that enticed his imaginations. There were Northern Wolves, with blonde fur and blue eyes; Wolves, with Red fur and Green eyes; Ebony Wolves with black fur and caramel eyes; Oriental wolves, from the distant far east of the world, and so many other varieties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking them over, the Horse King thought that maybe these royal maidens deserved something greater than the role of \"milk maids\". Perhaps he should attempt to breed these tiny Wolves with his royal Horse seed and create a new Wolf-Horse hybrid race? Would such a thing even be possible? These two species were very different, and Wolf Bitches have always been strictly off limits to Horse males like him. Such matings have never been attempted in the past. Would the DNA be incompatible? There is only one way to find out, but of course, this could have some long lasting implications that could cause problems in the long run. Would the hybrids inherit the enormous size of their Horse Fathers, or would they be tiny like the Wolves? Or something in between? Maybe this would not be a good idea at all....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That you shouldn't question the natural order, that the big and strong should be in charge while the small and weak obey. Never developing , never inventing never tampering with the earth other then gathering food and sowing seeds and just let nature take it's course. Of course they also believe that they stand at the very top of the pecking order and that all others should follow their example and serve under them, happily, and that they and they alone should prosper, and all others should be grateful for their continued exsitances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being primitive and without weapons or armor other then their loin clothes it is a difficult message to get across to the more technological species, especially the territorial horses, or the war mongering elephants, and even approaching the wolves or cats was out of the question. Indeed so much as approaching them has led to many deaths and many more enslavements. Now there are only a few handful of tribes left. Many have gone into hiding and have abandoned their belief but the largest group continues their crusade. But even the are starting to feel like it is hopeless, or at least it was until the \"beam form the sky\" as they called it made them all two hundred feet tall giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden growth spooked them at first, but their chief, a battle hardened bull, with a voice of steel, quieted the ruckus. All paid attention to what the chief had to say next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow kin,\" his voice boomed across the plains. \"I am sure many of you have many questions as to why we now stand as giants among this world.\" A wave whispers passed over the crowd. \"But fear not, for I have the answer. The earth has answered our prayers and has determined that we our now worthy of realizing our belief. Our growth is a sign that we are the rulers of this world and most educate the lesser beings of their place in it. We must make haste and establish our rule so that all the mortals will learn their place it. Over now is the reign of our inferiors and now and forever is the bovine's time to rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouts of glee erupted from the tribe as at long last their dream would be realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the other clans of our people\", a warrior bravely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief gave a dismissive snort. \"Those traitors abandoned or way of life they, will only have the honor of gazing up at us and lamenting their folly as they serve with all the others. Now enough talk it i time to claim what is rightfully ours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, The Cows began stamping out their authority over their world. The horses and elephants tried their best to fight back against the giants. but they were little more then insects compared to their new \"gods\". And as mighty as the cats, wolves, and mice were, they were no match for their oppressive overlords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore it was discovered that the size ray had an added effect. When one was shrunk with it their lifespan was reduced to little more then an average insect depending on how small the target was. This was to make the wolves obedience and servitude achievable in a mater of months.  But when something was grown with the ray that life span would drastically increase making said individual retain their youth and vigor for hundreds if of thousands of years. Sadly the exact amount of time a lifeform had could not be tested as both the size ray and a vast majority of the mice were crushed beneath bovine hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin two months of the onslaught that took place most of the civilizations that the developed species had built had been destroyed. And in a hundred years life without their gods was but a fleeting story. But it still inspired hope among the lesser species and some even tried revolting. Only to be laughed at and treated as toys by the cows. Still while it was a fruitless uphill battle the lesser beings fought it in the vain hope that they could be free from their cruel gods. None believed this more then the traitors and non believers of the bovine race. As they had often suffered harsh treatment and impossible challenges by their dismissive actions in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut centuries had passed and the cows had decided the mortals were allowed their illusions. After all the gods had made sure the that their servants understood that only they could create and invent the rest were stuck using nothing but their hands and small rocks. While the gods did make stone weapons they kept to their primate ways, seeing no point in fixing what wasn't broken. Now how will the mortals live in an unfair life alongside their gods and how do their gods deal with them. Take control of one of them and find out how they deal with every day life.

They didn't notice at first but when one of them exclaimed that the grass was growing around their village, the others quickly took note. People began to notice that the crops they tilled now towered above them. A few claimed to have to fight off giant worms and spiders. Pandemonium hit the village as several of the horses were panicking over what was going on. The chief of the horses tried to maintain order but it was to hectic. Then the ground began to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies stood stock still as if to make sure what they just heard was their imagination. Then it happened again and again. The horses looked towards the sound and watched as a hulking and massive figure moved towards their tiny home. The monstrous being's shadow blotted out the sun as it moved closer and closer to them. With each step the giant made sent bigger and bigger quakes through the ground. Thankfully the giant stopped just before their little village so at least the horses weren't going to be crushed by this giant. They watched as it looked down at them. \"Now what do we have\", it asked. Few had been too scared to look up at the titan but those that did realized it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Elephants were by far the largest species. As with the Horses, the Elephants were not technologically advanced. In fact, they were the most primitive. This may have been due to their immense size, which made them naturally so powerful that they did not need any technology to defend themselves. However, where the Elephants did differ from the Horses was in their warlike nature. The Horses were relatively peaceful agrarians which tended to keep to themselves in their own vast lands, but the Elephants (despite being Herbivores) desired to have supremacy over the other species, and would frequently invade the lands of neighboring species to raid them of food, resources, or even slaves. On occasion, the Elephants would invade a land just for the sake of owning the land itself, and they would annex this land into their growing empire, much to the dismay of the species that lived in these lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elephants had an enormous need for food to sustain their massive bodies, which tended to have a devastating effect on the lands they conquered. Though they possessed little technology, they had no problem tearing apart entire forests using the incredible strength of their massive trunks which could easily rip a full grown tree out of the ground. Lands which had been forests, were converted into Savannas by the Elephants as they devoured everything in sight. Many species which favored life in the forests came to hate the Elephants for this reason. But no one could do anything to stop them, because the Elephants were too large and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the species who came to hate and fear the Elephants, there was none who despised them more than the species of Mice. The Mice were the opposite of the Elephants in almost every way. The Mice were the smallest species, in contrast to the Elephants who were the largest. An entire village of Mice could be squished under an Elephant's foot, and the Elephant would barely even notice. Mice farmers would store their grain in massive (to the Mice) silos, but hungry Elephants who came upon these grain silos would greedily devour them in one massive gulp. Even though the Elephants were Herbivores, they would not stop their gorging to make sure there wasn't any mice inside of the food they were eating. Unknown numbers of Mice were inadvertently chewed up or swallowed alive to digest inside of Elephants massive bloated bellies as the Elephants helped themselves to the bounty of the Mice's lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, most Mice lived in cities, which the Elephants tended to ignore because there was very little food there. Many Mice cities were technically annexed and part of Elephant territory now, but in practice the Elephant rulers tended to leave them alone. The Mice were far too small to make for good slaves to labor in the fields, but the Mice could help the Elephants in another way by providing them with advanced technology. Specifically, technology pertaining to Agriculture. The Elephants were too arrogant to do the work of growing their own crops themselves, but they were more than happy to share this technology with their slaves. It was a common sight in Elephant lands to see Wolves, Horses, Cats, and all the other species toiling in the fields to provide food for their Elephant masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas the Elephants were the most primitive of all the species, the Mice were by far the most scientifically advanced. Though it was other species which worked in the Elephant's fields, they often did so using technology such as advanced fertilizer formulas, genetically modified seeds, Mice tractors (scaled up in size to be used by non-Mice species), and so on. The Elephants would not allow these technologies to leave their lands. The Mice were considered to be the property of the Elephant empire, so any technology that the Mice invented was likewise considered to be Elephant property. The Elephants didn't use the technology themselves or know how to, but it was for their slaves to use for the benefit of the Elephants and no other purpose. The Elephants made this clear in their diplomacy with the independent realms that if they found out there was Mice technology being used, they would go to war with whoever was using it, and this threat was enough to keep everyone else in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo somewhat paradoxically, the Elephants were the most primitive species living at a stone age level, but at the same time their empire possessed the world's most advanced technologies, because of the Mice being part of their empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what the Elephants did not see coming was that the scientifically advanced Mice slaves have been secretly working on a secret technology to liberate themselves and turn the tables on their Elephant masters, by taking away the one advantage the Elephants had over them: their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge Tesla coils began to be constructed in the Mice cities, and the Elephants just shrugged at the sight of this, assuming it was some new agricultural technology that would help boost the crop yields even further. They never saw it coming when these huge Tesla coils came to life all of a sudden one night and there was a loud explosion as lightning lit up the sky in all directions for thousands of miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, when the sun rose, the Elephants were horrified to discover that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though similar to thunder and lightning, it was somehow eerily different, and there was no doubt it had something to do with those crazy Mice scientists and their wacky experiments. There were times Dumbina considered squishing the whole lot of them under her feet, but they were just far too useful with the advanced technology they provided that was far beyond anything her species could ever produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbina was the Matriarch of the Elephant empire, the largest and more powerful empire the world had ever known. She inherited the empire about 20 years earlier when her mother made the great journey to the ancient Elephant boneyard, where all Royal elephants go when their time has come. Being so large and powerful, it was almost unheard of for an Elephant to die from anything other than natural causes, so an Elephant always knew when their time was coming to an end, and they would make their way to the graveyard to die. Dumbina felt like she was on top of the world. She knew that her reign would last for many years to come. During the time of her reign, the Elephant empire has grown to become the largest in the world. She began to dream of total world conquest, and becoming the Matriarch of the entire planet. She had no doubt in her mind that one day this would become reality. She was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud rumble in her huge belly turned her attention away from thoughts of world domination towards the more immediate matter of breakfast. She rolled over on her side, expecting her feet to touch the floor of her royal bedchamber and then make her way to the dining hall just as she had done every morning... but something was strangely very wrong. Dumbina opened her eyes to find that her bed now stretched far and wide in a massive distance, as if her bed had been swapped with the bed of a giant. But... she was the largest giant in the world. How could this be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards! Servants!\" Dumbina shouted. She then raised her trunk upwards and blasted it as loudly as she could, like the sound of a great Trumpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments past, and then ground began to shake, and she heard the door of her bedchamber creak open, except the sound was magnified to an impossible level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mi'lady? Is everything allright? I thought I heard you call out, but the sound was very faint...\" boomed the voice of a massive form that poked its head inside of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpress Dumbina recognized that voice. It was the voice of...</span></div></div>",
