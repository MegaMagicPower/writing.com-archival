But he had definitely made your childhood interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only daughter of your single parent mother, Prisha Laghari (a second generation Indian-Canadian), nobody ever explained to you why you were christened with the name Bethany Anne Simmons. It definitely sounds something you name a blonde hair blue eyed girl. Not someone with your brown eyes, black hair and olive complexion,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt age four, you were introduced to your \"Uncle\" Seymour, who ensured that over the next fourteen years,you had an extensive, if eclectic, education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour visitations with your uncle Seymour were sporadic, and each time he suggested a different familial relationship with you. This includes you being his half-sister or his illegitimate daughter. You were never sure what to believe, but whatever your real relationship was with Seymour Simmons, you definitely benefited from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was totally disinterested in you, allowing a long line of tutors, instructors and private teachers to raise you. This suited you just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was more interested in her seemingly unending string of boyfriends. None of these boyfriends ever gave you any trouble, though. They actually seemed to be afraid of you. It appeared that even when he wasn't there, your \"uncle\" was never far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, at age eighteen, with the publication of his book  <i><b>Code-Name Hero: How Seymour Simmons &amp; the Aliens Saved the World</b></i>, you learned a lot more about your uncle than you ever knew. You still didn't know the exact nature of your relationship with him, but at least some of your questions had been answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour adventure begins a couple of days after your eighteenth birthday, when you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
