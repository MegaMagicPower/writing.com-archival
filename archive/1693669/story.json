Now you are a newly commissioned second lieutenant, riding on a C130 to your first assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was probably not how your parents saw your life turning out, a fact for which you are truly thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty two years ago, you were born on a hippy commune in Eastern Tennessee, where the highlights of your education was learning that mathematics and physics propagate racism, there are a hundred and sixty-noun pronouns (according to the elders of your commune) which every enlightened person should know by heart, and the number of ways in which kale can be prepared approaches infinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up, you time was pretty much your own. Your clothes were made primarily of hemp, scraps, or some combination thereof. By age ten, you were used to being paraded around as a potential victim of the country's immigration policies (even though you were born in this country, and your maternal grandmother, who was born in Mexico, was a legally naturalized citizen), At age eleven, you were helping people in your commune fill out forms for government subsidies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt age twelve. when you were told one of the elders would help you escape western expectations of your femininity by taking your virginity on your fourteenth birthday, you decided to take steps to prevent that from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was said earlier, a lot of your time was your own. So on sunny days, you made the five mile trek to the county library and its internet connected computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt age thirteen, you filed to become emancipated. You told your parents it was because you could not be a willing puppet of hierarchical neoEurocentric nuclear traditions. So your parents proudly signed the papers giving you freedom from their parental authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day later, your widowed maternal grandfather, retired Marine Colonel Daniel Fields (whom your mother was rebelling against, and whom you had contacted by email once you discovered him) came to pick you up and take you to his mountain cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents were furious, but they had given you the keys to your freedom, and you ran with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fought it, of course, and even took the surprisingly radical step of hiring someone to try to kidnap you back to the commune. Your grandfather was in his fifties, and the three kidnappers were in their twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandfather kicked their collective asses without even breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandfather was strict but loving, and you flourished under his guidance. By the time you were eighteen, you had overcome all the non-education of the first twelve years of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told your grandfather you wanted to be a Marine officer, just like him. So he got you a MCROTC Scholarship to Western Alabama. It was a little podunk college, but it did have a kickass electronic engineering department. By the time you graduated, you were a witch at anything electronic, whether it was hacking, flying a drone, repairing or assessing any device...you name it, you could fix it. Which is why If someone at Western Alabama needed something fixed, they called for you, the Green Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you wanted to make sure everyone knew you weren't just a techie. You were a hard driving Marine. You worked hard to get an incredibly fit body. You thought your looks were a little against you (many people thought you looked like a younger, Latina Demi Moore, with a softer voice and facial features), but wherever they sent you, you were going to make sure that everyone knew you were lean, green and mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently repeated this mantra to yourself as the C130 you were riding to you to your first posting<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're not sure where you are, as nobody is answering questions. All the passengers are confused, and there's a lot of speculation about what's happening. Looking outside, you see you've landed somewhere in the middle of a desert, but besides your airplane and a depilated looking hanger and a couple of abandoned buildings, there is nothing in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by an air force major and a dark haired civilian in a suit boarding the plane. They exchange a few words with the flight crew, and the civilian reaches into his jacket and produces some kind of leather encased identification. Whatever the civilian shows them, it makes the crew immediately come to attention and even from your seat, you can hear the torrent of \"yes sirs and no sirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air force major addresses the passengers collectively, telling all of you that there is an emergency, and they need your help. There are some politely offered complaints, as one or two of the passengers were heading toward Pendleton for their final discharge, while a handful of others have time sensitive appointments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe major says there is no choice, and anyway, the plane isn't going anywhere soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn air force tech sergeant comes on board and presents a manifest of all the passengers on the C130 to the major. The major says he will read off the list of names, directing each person called to either follow the major, the tech sergeant, or the civilian, to a building where they will be fully briefed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your name is called, you are directed to with the group following<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The finger that had been stroking your hand felt like very soft, supple leather. There was nothing hard or metallic about it. You're not sure if this is what every Transformer's touch would feel like, or just Nightingale's, since he's a medically oriented Autobot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So any idea about where we might be?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue,\" Nightingale responded. \"My flight and transformation capabilities seem to be malfunctioning, although the rest of my systems are functioning at optimum performance. I'm unable to communicate or broadcast with any autobots, and I'm unable to establish an uplink with any satellites. The island we're on doesn't match the topographical details of any known island in my database.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you listening, surprised that you're not panicking. Perhaps it's the fact that you're reclining in Nightingale's hand that is keeping you calm. You're concerned, of course, but somehow you're managing to keep your cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nightingale finishes his analysis of the situation, you suggest</span></div></div>",

But he had definitely made your childhood interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only daughter of your single parent mother, Prisha Laghari (a second generation Indian-Canadian), nobody ever explained to you why you were christened with the name Bethany Anne Simmons. It definitely sounds something you name a blonde hair blue eyed girl. Not someone with your brown eyes, black hair and olive complexion,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt age four, you were introduced to your \"Uncle\" Seymour, who ensured that over the next fourteen years,you had an extensive, if eclectic, education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour visitations with your uncle Seymour were sporadic, and each time he suggested a different familial relationship with you. This includes you being his half-sister or his illegitimate daughter. You were never sure what to believe, but whatever your real relationship was with Seymour Simmons, you definitely benefited from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was totally disinterested in you, allowing a long line of tutors, instructors and private teachers to raise you. This suited you just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was more interested in her seemingly unending string of boyfriends. None of these boyfriends ever gave you any trouble, though. They actually seemed to be afraid of you. It appeared that even when he wasn't there, your \"uncle\" was never far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, at age eighteen, with the publication of his book  <i><b>Code-Name Hero: How Seymour Simmons &amp; the Aliens Saved the World</b></i>, you learned a lot more about your uncle than you ever knew. You still didn't know the exact nature of your relationship with him, but at least some of your questions had been answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour adventure begins a couple of days after your eighteenth birthday, when you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
