            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As far back as anyone can remember there have always been anthros and humans. Sadly times between the two have not always been peaceful, bigots on both sides inciting their respective kin to hatred and violence yet that was millennia ago. After peace was brokered humans and anthros played off each others strengths, working together they've built a near-utopian society where all may live in relative happiness. This is of course the world we now know today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the greatest advantages of this new world is the level of acceptance contained within. At one time love between a human and a furry would have been seen as vile or evil just like the love between two men or two women, however this isn't no more. Relationships between genders, and species flourish and thrive be they open-ended or closed relationships many find peace and solace in the ones they've come to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpportunities abound no matter the tastes of the individual, and if you look hard enough you're sure to find what you're looking for. In this new world many of the old social taboos are much more laid-back, nudity in public is allowed except when the weather makes it too cold for humans to do anything but cover up (not fair for the anthros to be walking around nude simply due to fur). Many businesses allow and even encourage nudity whether you be the executive of a company or something like a stripper. Science has advanced greatly in the last few decades and there are whispers that \"magic\" has been discovered although they can't be confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will you live your life? What type of relationship will you have? It's all up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters pick your race (human/furry) and sexuality.</span></div></div>",

It been like that for decades. While humans and anthros are all different on the inside, every species had a potential for good and evil. This was something that one young police detective transferred to the Van Nuys knew very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Jim Davidson, a young cop who as he watched from the bullet train that brought him into town, saw all sorts of sin, fear and wickedness covering the town. Slums, graveyards, crime scenes. It made him shiver as he saw what was going on. He even heard a few gun shots. For the neighborhood right out of Hollywood, things had really gone to hell and they were still going. From his window, Jim could see a mugging take place and it made him shake his head. \"What happened to this city?\" he asked. \"L.A. has really let itself go. What could've possibly gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stopped and Jim stepped out. There were humans and anthros walking down the street. Jim could even spot a drunk tortoise man stumbling down the street but hiding to the side as Jim entered the station. It was dark and from the sound of it, it was underneath the railing with the bullet trains. \"The mayor of this city is insane.\" Said Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim walked into the room and saw that the entire police force was made up of anthros. It was dark enough that he could barely tell what kind of anthros they were, but what he did know from their shadows that they were anything but human. He had no time to question because he was walking into the chief's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're finally here, Detective Davidson,\" said the chief. \"Sorry about the lights. The power is out.\" From Jim's perspective, he couldn't tell whether or not the chief was a human or an anthro. \"I didn't like what I saw of L.A., Chief.\" The chief let out a sigh. \"I'm sorry, Detective. But crime is running more rampant than ever before. Which is why we've had to outsource. Your partner will be joining you. She's a detective just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partner?\" asked Jim in surprise. Before Jim could say anything else, he heard a door opening and saw his new partner. She was...</span></div></div>",

It's kinda hard navigating this place without any lights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief introduces Jim to his new partner. \"This is Abi your new partner, she'll accompany you on your investigations and patrols from now. You can't be too careful with the city as it is\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir I...\" Jim was cut off by Abi as he tried to lodge a complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this going to be the whole \"sir I work alone \" business. Really??? I thought you'd be the first one to take up a partner in such a dangerous city.\" Abi states incredulously, surprise at his lack of foresight evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right.\" The chief pitches in trying to smooth out their relationship before it started on the wrong foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I'll go on patrol with her.\" Jim walks out to the garage and waits for Abi near his cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waits he starts to realise that it would help having someone else. Regardless of this fact he still thinks that she'll only get in the way. After a few minutes Abi finds the car. \"There you are detective. What the hell you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting to go on patrol, get in if you're joining.\" Abi gets in once prompted, though reluctantly. Once she's buckled up he starts the car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frazone was lonely.  Lack of social skills had left him with no close friends since moving away from home.  It was very disheartening especially since one of the reasons he left was to find a girlfriend. After expressing his frustrations with his co workers, Frazone was recommended to get a pet.  A pet in this instance being a small anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDud keeping a small anthro has a pet is wrong?\u201d. Frazone objected to his coworkers statement.  Has they cataloged samples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no it's not like that\u201d Joal the anthro cat besides him replied.  \u201cPet is not a legal term in this instance.  They keep all their rights and freedoms.  They just choose to live in the home of a larger person, so they are called pets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would someone do that?\u201d. Frazone shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn't they?\u201d Joel exclaimed.  \u201cMost pets don't even work, at all.  And in places like this it's hard being small.  It's just not built to accommodate them.  I have three little mice at my place.  It's great\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like it would be awkward to me\u201d.  Although Frazone didn't look up he was no longer working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's less awkward than dating trust me.\u201d Joel laughed.  \u201cFrom my experience both parties are much more open about telling each other what they want and expect.  It's kinda like a business deal except people are actually happy.\u201d. Frazone didn't respond so Joel continued.  \u201cThis website Takemehome.com is the best place to meet a pet if you are interested\".  Frazone didn't respond but for the rest of the day he couldn't stop thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Frazone checked out the website.  The front page depicted a blue humanoid shape holding a smaller pink humanoid in its arm standing besides the words Take Me Home with some more small blue and pink humanoid shapes on and in the words in various ways.  After thoroughly reading all the new users page Frazone finally made an account before going to bed.  Having to wait for a pet to take interest in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning from work the next day Frazone immediately checked his profile.  He found a list of new contacts and two messages.  The first was a generic message from the website itself.  The second was titled \u201cyou may be who I'm looking for.\u201d. Frazone was surprised to see this.  The way the website usually works is that each pet is regularly given a list of hosts based on their defined criteria which they then approve or not.  Once approved the pet is made a contact of the host for them to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Frazone Dracaoo.  This message was actually structured like a letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have had the pleasure of reading your profile and you seem like such a sweet person.  Truth is i never actually wanted to be a pet, but maintaining a job, my own place and college has become too much for me too handle on my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been very anxious for me looking for a host close enough for me to continue my studies, that will also respect my personal space.  I will still share affection.  It has been rather lonely, and the way you described how you feel was very touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are interested please contact me and we can arrange  a face to face meeting.  I sincerely hope you will consider me.  Love Pangea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrazone hurried to check Pangea\u2019s profile.  She was a light green Nimbat, with purple eyes.  She was simply adorable.  Likes video games parties, and pizza.  Looking for someone to feed and shelter her while she completes college.  Physicality occasional petting and cuddling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was tall and muscular but still had a curvy form, with large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other, on the left, was more on the chubby and short side. She was a fox-like animal with creamy-yellow fur, supporting long, pointy ears, wearing a black and yellow swimming suit, her bushy tail swaying majestically behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson could feel blood rushing to his member, but he did his best to suppress it in order to avoid embarrassment and public indecency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, due to her misjudgment of direction, the fox accidentally knocked the ball to far to her left, sending it flying in Jackson's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball crashed into the ground, rolling over the rough sand, quickly losing velocity and coming to a complete halt when it bumped into the wolf's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over, Jackson picked up the ball just when the fox came running up to him, wanting to retrieve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go, cutie,\" he said, attempting a smile but unfortunately ending up as a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox blushed, taking the ball from him, saying, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and ran back, and Jackson had the privilege to watch how her plumb bottom working to do this. The fox went back to the net, but it took a while before they start playing again, for the cat stopped her, exchanging a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked towards Jackson for a few moments, and the cat raised an eyebrow, but they went back playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what that was all about,\" thought Jackson.</span></div></div>",

One was black, which would match his dark fur on his back, but the the other was white, which would bring out the fur on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to decide, and he had to decide quickly, or he would be late for his very first date! It was hard to believe but scoring a girl was a lot easier than William thought. His older brother, Kevin, always made it sound like it was a professional's job, where lots of rules, tricks, a regulations were required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also informed that the best spot to practice this was at some random bar. William always envied how Kevin brought one women after another to their house, almost convinced to give his brother's advice a try, but he soon learned that all of Kevin's dates were only one-nigh-stands, that they were only there to have \"fun\" with him before they leave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam didn't want that. He wanted a genuine relationship, a relationship based on love, not sex. He finally found such a relationship at his own workplace, and all he had to do is be himself and ask. It was really that simple!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one finale decision, he chose the black shirt, throwing it over his shoulders and fastening his buttons. He casted one last look in the mirror, making sure his complexion was glossy enough. When he was satisfied, William popped a breath-mint into his maw and headed towards the house's garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam stared at the red mustang before him, a beautiful and powerful piece of machine that was upgraded throughout the years. It was the perfect car to impress a few ladies. It was such a shame that it did not belong to William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his brother's car, and Kevin would be damed if he loaned the thing for him. And even if he managed to convince him through some miracle, William would still not be able to drive it, for it had been going through some technical difficulties lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this very moment the car was jacked-up, and his brother was under it and fixing the problem, tools scattered all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this would not be his ride for tonight. Instead, his own transportation was hidden in a dark corner: a yellow motor scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was pulling the vehicle out towards the open garage door, which revealed the fading twilight outside, a helmet on his head, Kevin slid out from under the car, a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, going out to meet your girl, hey?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam nodded, saying: \"Yeah. I'll be home in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, Will, what taught you,\" he said, his grin growing wider, \"it's sure to get you in bed with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam rolled his eyes at his brother's vulgar joke. \"Whatever,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started the engine and drove off.</span></div></div>",

Ones loose, he gave his stomach a angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike his hair on his head, face, and chest, the sphere was covered in bright orange hair, running all the way to his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it a slap, watching it jiggle, he said to himself: \"Dame thing keeps getting bigger everyday. I really need to lay it off the snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just hope that his date would not notice his new gain; she had quite a sharp eye. Twisting the knobs, water began to flow out of the shower head, and he washed himself thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out, he wrapped a towel around his waist and headed towards his room. Throwing open his wardrobe, he began to look through his clothing until he found the right outfit: a white shirt, a black pair of pants and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to look my best,\" he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began to prepare dinner; a nice stake with a few vegetables and spices, nothing too complex. While the stakes roasted in the oven, he set up his round table with a few candles, plates, wine glasses, knives and forks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was busy switching off his stove, attempting to pull out the stakes, Boris suddenly heard a knock on the door, and he knew very well who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no, not now!\" he thought, \"Everything's not ready yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting her to knock again (for he felt that it would mean that he rude), he quickly went and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was a Doberman with black and brown fur, who had short and sleek her, which she always allowed to droop over her left eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a red dress and shoes, smelling of fresh roses, Boris had to admit that she looked a little strange. It was not that she looked ugly in it. In fact, her sleek and tall body looked very good in a dress, ten spite her muscular form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was her personality that didn't fit her clothing: Rachel was a mechanic, a typical tomboy that wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her dressed in such a prissy way was rather weird for Boris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you, Rachel,\" the warthog said, \"You look great, but I wasn't expected you so early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel lifted an eyebrow. \"What?\" she said, ''Did you expect us girls to take forever to get our business done? Horrible stereotyping. So, are you going to invite me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, sorry,\" said Boris, smiling sheepishly, stepping aside, spreading out one strong arm. \"Right this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped inside while he closed the door behind her. She looked around, her eyes everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place you got here,\" Rachel complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris's apartment was a cheap rent, but it was rather spacious and was in a decent neighborhood. Usually there would pizza boxes, food packets, and clothing laying around, a sign that he was letting himself go, but he cleaned it up for this occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not much, but I'm glad you like it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you got everything ready for us,\" Rachel said when she saw the decked table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried my best,\" Boris said with a grin, blushing, one hand scratching behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind suddenly reminded him of something, and he said: \"Oops, forgot about the food. Excuse me while I go get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moved towards his kitchen, Boris' still kept talking, his voice dwindling but still audible. \"I'm sorry about this. I would have have gotten this sooner out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" called Rachel, who was now sitting at the dinner table. \"Take your time; I'm in no hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Boris came back, holding a deep tray of steaming steak and vegetables, setting it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate heartily that evening, drinking wine, focusing more on each other than their food, chatting, making jokes, discussing their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their dinner, Boris was taking away their plates, eating utensils, and wine glasses, putting it in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was still sitting at the table, eying in a way that made him feel uncomfortable, her legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing back the feeling, he said: \"Thanks for coming over. It gets kinda lonely here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that I should go home already?\" Rachel asked, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...\" began Boris nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was cut off when Rachel continued, smiling this time: \"We haven't had desert yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert?\" the warthog said, growing confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up walking towards in a strut, swinging her hips. Boris grew nervous, and he found himself blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel leaned so close to him, standing on her toes, that he could smell her minty-fresh breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, \"Use your imagination and you'll know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed his shirt and pulled him into his room.</span></div></div>",

Blushing such a deep shade of red that it was giving his fur a red tint, the warthog pulled down Rachel's zipper on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling a little, it fell down towards the ground, pooling around her feet. Boris was expecting to do her underwear next, but to his surprising he discovered that she wore none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have sworn that he heard angels singing as she turned around, her ample breasts in both hands, squashing them together, revealing all her glorious body had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn now,\" she said, stepping closer, pulling the warthog's shirt out of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel began to undo Boris' buttons, beginning from his neck and ending at the bottom. He pulled off his shirt, waiting for her to do the rest, but it would seem that she had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were focused on Boris' overhanging belly, looking at it with curiosity. She took it in her hands, squeezing the ball of fat like she was kneading dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris sighed. \"I know,\" he said, \" It keeps getting bigger and bigger. I've been making plans to go to a gym. I hope it doesn't disgust you in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and looked at Boris. \"Not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood on her toes again, leaning forward and giving his flat snout a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" Rachel continued, \"I like a guy with a little meat on them. I heard they're the ones that are best in bed. More to hold on to, they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris could feel how the pressure from his bulging member was relieved as Rachel unfastened his belt, pulling down his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said Boris, \"I have something in these pants of mine that's almost as big as me belly, and you'll like it even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I know, big boy,\" said Rachel, pulling down his underwear, \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was filled with passion Boris could not begin to describe. He filled every hole on Rachel's body with seed; her mouth, her anus, her vagina. She proved to be even more durable than Boris, going on for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while, when the hours were dragging into the early morning, did they finally stop. Laying fast asleep in his arms, Boris watched Rachel sleep, feeling a great need to protect and love her to the end of his days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a feeling that there was a bright future ahead of him.</span></div></div>",

She cradled it in her paws and walked towards the window, staring out from her apartment at the beach only a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her keen eyes she could spot small shapes moving across the sand and swimming in the water. The beach was packed today, which came as no surprise to her. It was Saturday, and everyone goes to the beach on that day...except for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette could never go to major social gatherings without the help of her friends. She was too shy and awkward when she went alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the beach with a longing expression. How she wished she could talk more easily, make new friends, and get herself a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang. Jeanette quickly rushed to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jeanette,\" a cheery voice came from the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that voice well; it belonged to her friend Helen, an anthro cheetah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of coming over to you today,\" Helen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course you can,\" Jeanette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" was the last word Helen said before the fox putted the phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a knock came upon Jeanette's door.

It was crowded, just like Jeanette expected, and there were men everywhere: some were fat, some were sticks, some were complete studs, and others were average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men, as expected, shot Helen and Jeanette looks, obviously attracted to them. But the fox didn't like the attention and huddled closely to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went swimming in the ocean for a while, then went to get something to eat at a hotdog stand before the went sun-bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette was slipping into her comfort zone, enjoying the heat of the sun on her fur, when she heard the thick, masculine voice of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, babe,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and beheld a muscular man staring down at her, wearing dark glasses and red shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, hello,\" she said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna take a walk with me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette panicked, looking over to her friend for help, but, alas, Helen was too preoccupied bathing in the sun to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo polite to say no, she excepted the man's offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, names Jack,\" he said, flashing her a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeanette,\" the foxgirl offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walked for a while, exchanging stories about themselves, and Jeanette discovered that talking to someone wasn't that hard after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe came to a stop at a gazebo, and Jeanette saw that there were other men there as well, grilling, drinking, and having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a little bit afraid, being the only girl in the group, but she calmed down and joined Jack's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there...</span></div></div>",

But before she climbed into the shower, she could not help but stop and examine herself in the full-length mirror in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout her life, Rina was a big girl, more in girth than height, with D-cup breasts with two coin-sized, brown nipples, a small potbelly, and a ample rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden between her thighs was her tender, pink feminine lips, a black heart-shaped birthmark just above it. Rina never knew why it was there. It was odd, but she had a feeling that it meant something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed into the shower, opening the water and adjusting its flow until the heat of the water was just right. Rina enjoyed the liquid cascading down her body, washing away the sticky sweat. She felt like a new cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she cleaned herself, she was unaware of the looming figure approaching the shower. A hand reached out, slowly opening the curtain and stepping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina's ears perked up, becoming aware that she was not alone. Her first instinct was to whirl around and find out who was it, but when Rina caught a whiff if a familiar scent, she smiled, pretending not to notice the bull walking up to her. Her horrible day was about to get so much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo brown arm, thick with muscle, inched its way between her arms, the left cupping and squeezing her left breast while the right reached down towards her cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe his hot breath rolling down her neck, and he whispered into her ear with his typical thick voice: \"Surprise, gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina turned around, coming face-to-face with her Fianc\u00e9, Martin, a very well-built brown bull, his shadow falling over her. He was tall, at least six feet, a head taller than her. Her breasts squished against his large pecs, her belly against his six abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muzzle, the tip black, was closing the gap between his and hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon, handsome,\" said Rina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed, savoring the feeling of each other's tongs wrestling with one another, warm water running down their figures. Rina felt how his large hands were creeping down her back, finally coming to a halt and resting on her two round buttcheeks, kneading the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the lack of air, they broke the kiss, and Rina asked: \"How was your day, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he replied, \"Being a new CEO at my dad's company wasn't so bad as I though it to be. So, how was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina turned away, her face becoming weary, which concerned Martin. \"Horrible!\" she exclaimed, \"Got a flat tire and arrived late at work and got scolded by my boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin eyebrows raised slightly. \"Terrible day,\" he said, \"You should have allowed me to give you a ride. Anyway, let's forget about our troubles and enjoy each, you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was becoming seductive, and Rina knew what that meant, pulling away, she saw her partner's manhood was erect, the length with a flat top bobbing in the air, his swollen testicles hanging below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina felt her nipples go erect, her clitoris hardening and labial lips swell, as her arousal grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually Martin had a creative way to instigate their sexual intercourses, and he had one now in mind. Picking up the soap that was on a glass holder, he squeezed the slippery blue bar until it slipped and flew out of his hand, landing behind Rina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, how clumsy of me,\" he said, \"Would you mind picking up the soap for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina grinned, knowing what he was planning. \"Would do, honey,\" she said, turning around, slowly bending over, her moons spreading open, revealing her anus and love-tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his chops, Martin rested his hands on her thighs, bringing his thick wang and slowly penetrating her womanhood. Rina moaned, forgetting her task in an instant, pressing her hands against the tile walls of the shower to steady herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin slowly but steadily began to increase his thrusts, his dick inching further into her cunt. Whatever juices, from him or her, was washed away the moment it seeped out of her vagina, making this a very clean sexual intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin grunted while Rina moaned loudly, the bull thrusting rapidly, his hips slapping against her ass, the two blubbery mounds jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Martin reached his climax, his member shooting his loud into her womb, filling it with potent seed, soon to fertilize it and bring forth new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little exhausted from the ordeal, the two sat down on the wet floor, panting. Martin folded his arms around her, bringing her close to his chest in a loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was fun,\" said Rina, snuggling into her partner's wet fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Martin said, \"You...always had a...skilled way with this...stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for us to get out,\" said Rina, \"We're kinda wasting water here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin grinned sheepishly. \"I guess we should,\" he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, the duo climbed out.</span></div></div>",

But she had dyed for this occasion, and now a blue strip, which complimented her eyes nicely, ran from the top of her head all the way down to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Claudine's sister agreed next to her, \"We promise that we'll have the best night of our lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaud was the twin sister of Claudine, and, as expected, they were both identical in appearance, but the only thing separating them in looks were their eyes; while Claudine's were a soft baby blue, Maud's was a sharp acid green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her sister, Maud had also dyed her fur in a similar fashion, but the strip was green instead of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" I murmured to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe climbed out of the car, and Claudine and Maud strolled confidently to the the club's entrance. I slithered behind them, my long, yellow Naga body trailing behind me. I eyed my surroundings cautiously, as if something was going to jump out of the shadows of the night. I clutch my handbag tightly to my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer at the entrance was a wall of muscle, a eight foot tall ape dressed in a casual shirt and jeans. Leaning against the wall, he watched us approach with a bored expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudine walked up to him and said: \"We have a reservation here, V.I.P, I believe. You'll find it under Claudine Westwall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer's face seemed to light up at what she said. \"Just a moment,\" he said with a voice that seemed to rumble the very ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to type something with his big fingers on the tablet held in his huge hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking a smile, which I found rather frightening, he said, \"Found it. Follow me ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did as he asked, following him into the club. As we followed the bouncer down the dark hallway, the sound of electronic music became louder and louder, up until the point when it was deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally emerged into a cavernous room, which was packed full with women, and a few men here and there, of many species. They were all sipping on some alcoholic drink, watching half-naked to completely naked men dance on poles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange seeing the roles reversed. The women cheered as loudly as males with muscles as hard as diamond dance before them, throwing away their garments until they stood before them with their junk hanging freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed hard at the sight of this. But we weren't going down their tonight. O no. We were getting our own private show. Instead, we were being led across the room to another hallway. The noise of the music grew muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe came to a big red door. The bouncer opened it and ushered us in. The room inside, like the door, was completely red: the walls had red wallpaper, with pictures of black flowers dotting it, the large, soft sofa was red, and the well-vacuumed carpet was red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a stage opposite to the sofa, and a few poles were mounted on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable, ladies,\" the bouncer said, still giving us that frightening grin, \"I'll just get the boys ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, he quickly left. We made ourselves, like requested, comfortable on the big red sofa.</span></div></div>",

I studied myself in the mirror and couldn't help but groan; dressed in a yellow hammock suite, which was designed to fit me poorly and leave very little for the imagination, I looked ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit! I couldn't believe Jim and Tim was able to talk me into doing this. Me and them are going to have a little talk about this shit...No, I was blame-shifting again. It wasn't his fault that I was in this mess. The real culprit here was the failing economy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks ago I lost my job after the factory closed down where I worked at, and a unemployed person that was about to be kicked out of his house due to outstanding payments grew pretty desperate. Hell, he might even consider becoming a striper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tore my gaze away from and glanced at my co-workers beside me. Tim (who was a tiger) and Jim (who was a orca) were admiring themselves in the mirrors, completely in their element. The tight speedos they wore, which emphasized their privates, didn't seem to bother them at all, and they flexed their impressive forms, making typical remarks about how well they looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused me to study myself as well. To tell you the truth I was just as muscular as them, but a good deal of fat covered my muscular figure. Most of it, unfortunately, settled in my midsection, which resulted in me having a solid gut about the size of a beach ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had the infamous ability to draw any one's attention away from my other muscular assets. Perhaps it was the reason why I hadn't found a girl yet. I promised myself, when this charade was over, hit I'll hit the gym and stop snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Harvey, you ready for this?\" I heard Tim ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snapped from my trance. \"I-I guess so,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim noticed the slight nervous tone in my voice, and he said, \"Relax, buddy. They're only women. They don't bite...at least not often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes at the orca's remark, and said, \"It's not that. It's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trailed off, for the ground began to shake, and we knew who was coming. The door opened and Brutus came lumbering in to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys ready?\" he asked with that thick voice of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe told him that we were ready. He nodded, but before he left we pulled him aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, bud,\" I said in a whisper, \"Is it really necessary that we do this? It makes me feel uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Harvey, don't chicken out out on us now,\" he said, \"A little nudity never killed anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that!\" I snapped, \"I mean what we have to do afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrutus shook his head in annoyance. \"Listen here, gator boy,\" he said, his face hardening, \"the clients payed a full amount and they will get the full treatment in return. That's how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrank back a little. Brutus had that ability to intimidate almost anyone with his demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but still,\" I said, rubbing my thick arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrutus' face softened a bit, and he said, \"Look, I know you're new here and this thing we do might make you uncomfortable. Hell, I know a few guys who have done this for years and still feel uncomfortable. But remember that you're being payed good money for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. I was glad that the salary for doing this job wasn't small. It was almost twice the amount I earned at the factory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, go get them tiger,\" Brutus said, flashing me that terrifying smile which, besides his size, he was known for around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a alligator,\" I corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" he said with a flick of his huge hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Tim and Jim to the stage.</span></div></div>",

Her parents are still growing like all kangaroo anthros just really slowly and slower as they age, but Hannah's parents didn't reach 9ft tall until they were middle aged, and Hannah's will probably reach 10 feet before fall break, or sooner depending on the pacing of the story's separating branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo ready to make a slow-growth or faster slice of story of Hannah the fast growing Kangaroo?</span></div></div>",

It's basically like the modern day world, but there is the possibility for science/magic that would allow for most people's dreams to come true. Due to the combination of cultures the world is much more \"accepting\" and things such as nudity are much more acceptable in most places, relationships between humans and anthros is obviously okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Any person may be used, 1st, 2nd, 3rd...etc<br>\r\n2. Any type of relationship is allowed, human on furry, furry on human, gay, straight, multiple partners...go wild.<br>\r\n3. Herm characters, both as the MC and to have a relationship with are allowed.<br>\r\n4. Any type of character can be used, scalie, avian, furry, marine heck if you want to use game/comic/anime characters go ahead.<br>\r\n5. There is a 3 paragraph minimum for any chapter, and while choice chapters may be as small as one sentence, I encourage writing more.<br>\r\n6. Any fetish except toilet (including farting), vore, weight gain, and death are allowed.<br>\r\n7. Once you've chosen your race and sexuality you're free to start, just leave an other option as the last one in case someone want to make their own story<br>\r\n8. Have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an added bonus, any chapter that is decent and meets the paragraph minimum gets 1000GPs.</td>",
