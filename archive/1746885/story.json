He'd been working on this project for months and he didn't want a careless mistake to ruin it. The final product had the potential to change the world forever. His lab partner, Mark, looked on anxiously. The two of them had spent untold sleepless nights debating over which chemical equations would work best, and how unknown constants could potentially drastically alter the formula's effect. But they had finally come to the conclusion that they had the perfect balance of chemicals. Their superiors had scoffed at the idea. They had told them that it was impossible, but John and Mark went on anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been working on an experimental drug that could potentially cure numerous diseases. It had the potential to be a bona fide panacea - diseases that had plagued humanity for years would be no more. If anything were to go wrong... Well, at least they had tried. It wouldn't be the first time a drug had failed. And it certainly wouldn't be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Five. Six. Seven,\" John counted the drops falling into the solution. \"Eight. Done. Now we bring it to the centrifuge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, so as not to spill the solution, John brought it to the centrifuge and spun it for five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there, Mark,\" John commented, his excitement visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing. I never thought we'd actually be seeing this... But, wow. I just don't have words for this,\" Mark responded. They waited the remainder of the time in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ding</i> The timer on the centrifuge went off. Carefully, Mark reached in and brought out the container. He poured the liquid into a separate container, and placed the precipitate on the table. He brought the liquid over to the lab mice, and poured it into its water dispenser. The would observe the cancerous mouse for a month, noting it's effects each day, hoping the cancer would go away. In the meantime, they would be making more of the solution, to test on mice with other diseases. It's use had to proven...</span></div></div>",
