You stand still, nerves in your stomach. \"We have little to no information. Do you think you can handle it ?\" \"Only if you think I can.\" you say. \"I do Officer. Now, we know the killer is striking right after the vows are being said. Here are a couple of pictures.\" The chief throws three pictures on the desk. They are all of a woman, slender, and dressed in all white. A veil covers her face. \"Suspects?\" you ask. \"None, we cannot catch this serial killer. The newspapers are all on it. If we don't catch this murderer soon, Sheriff will have my hide.\" \"Do we have anything besides this?\" you asked worriedly. \"We know she is using a pistol, but have not properly figured out what bullet it is. Will you accept the case?\"</span></div></div>",

You know you made the right decision. \"Look, Officer Dan will be helping you.\" \"What do you mean?\" you ask angrily. \"I know there is some bad blood between the two of you, but he is the only other person who would work on this case.\" \"He is lazy and sloppy. He will just get in my way.\" you whine. \"Officer, control yourself. Officer Dan is already interviewing a man at the last crime scene. You have no time to lose, remember the mayor is breathing down my throat.\" You walk out of the office and sigh. This is going to be a tough case, might as well meet up with your partner.</span></div></div>",
