A rather regular one that him and his arwing had taken many a time, giving him time to just gaze out at all of the stars. Some of them might have meant something, others still shrouded in mystery. They very well might. But Fox was preoccupied with other things. Other thoughts.<br>\r\n     \"Why... does this bother me so much?\" He thought to himself, images flashing before his eyes of what many presumed was his fated to be lover Krystal... though his own feelings on that were undecided. But these weren't fond memories... these were ones that sparked pure envy, the chances he got to get a glimpse at the derriere she had, though somewhat modest, it was so much more than what he had... and he couldn't stand it.<br>\r\n    He ran a hand down to feel his own, privacy was one thing that the vastness of space could provide well, sighing as he felt naughty but the flat, boney behind he had always had. Suddenly, a ping shone on his radar. Two actually. One in the direction of a star he'd never explored, and curiously, the other resonating from The Great Fox. Which does he choose to answer?</span></div></div>",

He'd rather keep them focused on the matter at hand while he handled this himself.<br>\r\nSoon, the fox approached the star system, two binary stars that orbited rather close together. A spectacular sight to be sure, but that wasn't the main focus... because the signal was defininitely not coming from those stars. His scanners went to identify planets, maybe even planetoids in the system, finding 3 planets and a moon for each one, the signal being identified as he approached.<br>\r\nIt was no mystery what he was getting into, the clear signs of civilization all upon the surface of the planet, visible even from space with the cities that dotted the landscape of the actually rather large, green planet. But just as things seemed to go well, the loud blaring of his alarms sounded suddenly, the fox jumping from his seat and gazing around frantically. \"Wha-!\" was all he could make out, a sudden asteroid colliding with his vehicle and sending him spiralling into the atmosphere of the planet, and it seemed he was going to land...</span></div></div>",
