She has red hair, golden eyes with vertical slit pupils and pale human skin, and her snake part has copper scales with a pinkish-cream underbelly .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)\t<b>Papi, the Harpy:</b><br>\r\nPapi is a harpy and is the second housemate. She is petite and physically appears to be much younger than the other girls, even though she is the same age as they are.<br>\r\nShe has a human body, but halfway down her upper arms they turn into feather-covered wings. Her wings and hair are light blue, and her eyes are brown.  Her legs start to get covered with light brown scales by mid-thigh and her elongated feet have only three toes that end in rather impressive talons like a bird's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)\t<b>Centorea \u2018Cerea\u2019 Shianus, the Centauress:</b><br>\r\nCentorea Shianus is a centaur and the third girl to join the household, and allows only those people closest to her to call her by the nickname \"Cerea\". She is the stereotype of a Nordic person: she has yellow-blonde hair, pale blue eyes, and a very large bust which is a complete norm among the females of her species. Her \"horse part\" appears to be the size of a small horse or a large pony, with an even, light chestnut coat, no mane and small hooves <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)\t<b>Suu, the Slime girl:</b><br>\r\nSuu is a Slime, an amoeba-like creature that can change shape and color without effort, and the fourth to join the group. Her basic shape is a glob with two dark eyespots that tend to glow like cat's eyes when backlit, and with a single pseudopod on top, which she can use to read peoples' thoughts and feelings on contact.<br>\r\nIt is impossible to determine her age or if gender actually applies to her. <br>\r\nSuu usually wears a yellow rubberized raincoat and boots out of necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5)\t<b>More choices...<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was yet another normal looking day, within the house of Kimihito. As normal as it could get in a house chokingly full of Monster girls, at least. The owner of the place, Kimihito, was currently busy at the stove, preparing the breakfast for the girls living with him, which were under his tutelage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, the girls in question were each keeping themselves busy within the main lounging room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia, the lamia, was slithering in place, trying as hard as she could to get near the stove, hoping to master her, dreadful, cooking abilities, while held back by Kimihito, strenuously defending the stove from her destructive capabilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, glued to the screen, Papi the harpy and Suu, the slime girl, were busy playing on a videogame attached to the television, moving from side to side as they played one against the other at their game. Lounging on the sofa, Lala sat in peace, holding her head in her lap as she slowly poured the tea she so loved directly down her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, stalking her, Rachnera prepared her web to ensnare the Dullahan within her grasp, always more than ready to try her bondage techniques on the always so measured girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMero, the mermaid, was sitting in her wheelchair, nearby the Dullahan, chatting with her, as she waited to the Arachne to make her move, wanting nothing else than observe the technique of the spider girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down, near a window, polishing her fake sword, Centorea the centauress, simply waited, while keeping an eye out on the others, preparing herself to settle down any arguments that, surely, was going to emerge from each of the many girls around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was rebuked once more from the stoves, Miia moved away and sat in a heap of coils on the couch, seemingly pissed that her Darling would refuse to let her prepare a meal. As she sat there, she looked at the other girls, evaluating her possibilities against each of them, trying to figure out which of those could be the more difficult adversary in her conquest to the heart of her Darling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she eliminated from her list both Papi and Suu, as much as the two were of age, they were both too childish to really understand and so, weren\u2019t a major threat. She quickly crossed also Mero, from her list, knowing that the mermaid wanted only a tragic love story out of Her Darling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe major players that remained were Lala, of which she didn\u2019t know the motivations, Rachnera, which was a pretty dangerous adversary and, finally, Centorea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Cerea\u2026</i>\u2019 Miia thought \u2018<i>Cerea might be the most troublesome of all of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already has a crush on Darling, and she is totally servile and obedient to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to get her out of the picture\u2026but how?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more the lamia thought about it, the more she felt at loss. So, focused she was, that she noticed too late that a couple of heads had come inching closer to hers. As she opened her eyes, she almost shrieked as she found both Rachnera and Mero, inches from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arachne though, was quick and silenced her with a strand of web, as then she began whispering to her in a conspiratorial way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really have to start to learn to keep your thoughts to yourself, Miia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019ve heard about it and while, flattering that you consider myself a threat\u2026 both me and Mero believes that you are correct on your assumptions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentorea has to be slowed down, somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three girls quickly left the room, retreating into Mero\u2019s room so that they could talk in private, Cerea stared at the three with a questioning glance. Still, she remained where she was, polishing her sword as she kept thinking about her Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the lamia, the Arachne and the mermaid, where in the mermaid\u2019s room, discussing on how they could put a stop to Centorea\u2019s advance. While they talked, exposing each other one idea more absurd than the other, a sudden comment from the mermaid made Rachnera clap her hands in enlightenment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta remember to swim more often\u2026I\u2019m starting to get a bit too soft\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! Mero you\u2019re a genious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is? Rachnera, what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up girls, for I\u2019ve got the solution to our worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll we need to do is make sure that Cerea get fat. Kimihito has a fetish for long, slender legs, so that rules out a fat body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf we manage to get Centorea to pile up a ton of weight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia, catching up the though, finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarling will ignore her! But\u2026how do we do that? That horse eats mostly vegetables\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it was Mero who smiled in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not entirely true\u2026 She also enjoy her sweet treats. We just have to make sure she gets plenty of those\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 that she gets lazier in her activities\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she will grow rounder than a boulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMero, Miia, We need to fatten up Centorea. <br>\r\nThe perfect occasion is also upon us too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mero and Miia, turned and inquisitive glance at the Arachne, as they asked aloud why timing was so right for their newly hatched plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. Don\u2019t forget that Kimihito is going to travel to his family in a month or so. We will be stuck in the house, true, but that only works at our advantage. Moreover, Miia? You need to make a call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh? A call? And to whom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to call Polt, the gym trainer, remember? You\u2019ll need to ask her how a centaur might gain weight naturally. Don\u2019t say its for Cerea, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI Can\u2019t do it. That kobold would surely get suspicious of me, since I\u2019m so\u2026 \u2018Evil\u2019. <br>\r\nMero doesn\u2019t know, nor can know any centaur, given her background. The only land type, beside me, is you. So\u2026 \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026I will. I\u2019ll manage, somehow. When should we start, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMero took the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs soon as Kimihito leaves, naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s prepare ourselves and as soon as he\u2019s out of here, we bring the plan forward. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Replied the other two, being surprised with each other of having found a reason to cooperate with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has pale human skin and blue eyes, her hair and tail are pink with yellow fins, and in private she tends to wear a skimpy two-piece bathing suit made of fabric that has been specially treated so it won't slide off her slippery skin. She's always polite and friendly, but sometimes can be unknowingly insensitive. To move around on dry land, she needs a wheelchair. In public, she uses a long dress with hat and frilly cuffs to hide her tail, webbed hands and spiny ears, giving her a Gothic Lolita appearance. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n2)Rachnera \u2018Rachnee\u2019 Arachnera, the Arachne/Dridder:</b><br>\r\nRachnera \"Rachnee\" Arachnera is an Arachne and the sixth girl, her top half is mostly human, while her bottom half is that of a gigantic spider, minus the head. She has lavender hair and has six red monochromatic eyes. Her spider parts, forearms and hands are black, covered in a chitinous exoskeleton, with a pale skull pattern on her secondary abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3)Lala, the Dullahan:</b><br>\r\nLala is a Dullahan and the seventh housemate. Her head is actually detachable from her body (which can act independently, suggesting a symbiotic relationship), which can be quite upsetting for other people when it accidentally falls off, and she has long pale blue/gray (almost light purple) hair, skin the same color as her hair and yellow eyes with black sclera. She carries a large scythe with a half-circle cutout and wears gauntlets and a mixture of schoolgirl clothes combined with a long dustcoat of the type used in the Spaghetti Western movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>4)Kuroko \u2018Ms. Smith\u2019 Smith, Human coordinator:</b><br>\r\nKuroko Smith, commonly referred to as \"Ms. Smith\" or just \"Smith\", is one of the coordinators of the exchange program. She is a caricature of a civil servant\u2014lazy and goofing off whenever possible, pushing her work/responsibilities onto others, making errors she never admits to. She is also in command of the \"MON\" (Monster Ops: Neutralization) SWAT team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5)Kimihito \u2018Darling\u2019 / All of them?:</b><br>\r\nKimihito Kurusu is a normal Japanese student living in Asaka, Saitama with a part-time job who lives in his parents' home, with all the dreams and feelings that young people have. His parents are temporarily away (working abroad), and he can only watch helplessly as Ms. Smith remodels their house over and over again to accommodate each newcomer. He seems to excel at certain household chores and activities. Kimihito's cooking is so good that the girls living with him put on weight and he proves to be quite skillful with needle, thread and sewing machine. The girls seem to fall in love with him simply because he is nice, friendly and modest, and because he treats the \"monster\" girls as ordinary, real people \u2014 not as exotic or dangerous monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe all the girls in the house in one massive pile of fattening goodness?</span></div></div>",

From that day, he had found himself suddenly being the caretaker for the \u201crelatively\u201d new sentient species that had been discovered in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the world had named as \u2018Liminals\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blue, as he had been just starting to see how things were proceeding around the world about these \u201cnew\u201d species, he found himself involved in all of this. Having soon in the same house, fortunately renovated at government expense, with seven of them living with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven of these Liminals which, although they were, for the most part, kind toward him,  where still massively protected by the law almost to the point where they could do whatever they wanted with him and he would be found guilty if he defended himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst was that if he ended up in a relationship of any kind, bar friendship, with them\u2026 they would go free while he would be sentenced as guilty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite all this, despite all the hardships that he had been through, as he had been living with them for quite some time, he couldn\u2019t honestly think of living with them all under the same roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was something that he had never revealed, nor even hinted, to them. Even under the \u2018torture\u2019 of one of the meanest of them (in a prankster way), he had managed to keep the secret from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side he had kept the secret in fear of being ridiculed by them, on the other hand, he couldn\u2019t have ever afforded it, what with his dwindling savings. But now, as he had recently learned, that he could have all expenses for food and lodgings paid by the government, he maybe had a shot at making this hidden secret to come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor he had always been an admirer of heavier girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if he wanted to have a shot at this, he had to be careful. It was true that, without really any effort toward this goal, the girls living with him had all gained weight, but for his dream he needed for them to reach much greater heights. And so, he had to be silent and quiet, making sure that no one of them would realize what he was aiming at. At first he had thought of taking only one of them and have her grow but, he quickly realized what would have happened if he took that path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others would immediately take notice, and anything could have happened. Which, in Kimihito\u2019s mind, would have concretized in being insulted and ridiculed by them, the same persons he was now thinking of as the closest friends he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No, he had to manage for all of them to gain weight.

Still, acting as normal as he could, he woke up, and after refreshing himself, always checking beforehand for a sudden ambush from one of his co-ed, he began cleaning up the house, while also doing a few minor jobs of common maintenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning passed uneventful, with some of the girls still in their rooms, or hanging/helping out with him as he worked, the morning passed in a jiffy, as lunch time began to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently sitting in the lounging room, chilling out as he drank a bit of tea with Miia, the lamia, and Centorea, the centauress, sitting nearby as they each, either stared at him or kept an eye out for any disturbances within the house. A bit away, occupied by the blaring screen on front of them, the young looking Papi, the harpy, and Suu, the slime girl, were currently busy playing some games on his Wii. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as he was sipping his tea, he felt a gentle hand tapping him on the head. Opening his eyes, he saw Rachnera, the Arachne, trying to get his attention, while under the heated stare of both Miia and Cerea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes, Rachnera?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, what were you thinking about, you little perv? You\u2019re getting red as a tomato.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked him with a teasing note in her voice, adding a little purring to it as she whispered the second part directly into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Er\u2026N-Nothing\u2026 Nothing\u2026But please, tell me\u2026\u201d and here he carefully chose his words for he knew how teasing Rachnera could be \u201c\u2026tell me what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arachne, losing her smile, although pouting jokingly, soon moved to sit beside him, as she looked at the clock on the wall, before turning again towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re no fun. Still, shouldn\u2019t you start preparing lunch? If you keep sitting there, we may start to grow hungry\u2026hungry for something else, beside food\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt himself being teased once again, he quickly stood and moved away from the Arachne, stammering a little as he replied to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well\u2026I\u2026I was thinking of ordering out, today. I\u2026I\u2019ve spent all morning cleaning and working and\u2026I\u2019m really in the mood for some take out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, all the girls in the room turned their head towards him, some, as Miia, even pouting a bit since they really liked his cooking. And yet, since it was such a novelty none of them rejected the idea. As the others then started to join them in the room, they soon started to discuss on what to order from outside, although some of them were starting to discuss things a bit too fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we order some Ramen! Just to see how Darling\u2019s prepares it better\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, Miia\u2026Why don\u2019t we order, instead, some nice salads for everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapi wants Icecreams! And Suu wants them too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSalads, Centorea? Really? Bah, I would prefer some Takoyaki. I\u2019m sure the little perv would enjoy seeing us eat it, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this comment Kurusu almost thought of having been found out but, in an instant he realized that Rachnera was just teasing him as she always did, and she wasn\u2019t aware of his real reasons. Still, as the other girls kept dishing out requests, upon requests, with Cerea and Miia starting to grow a bit too angry in their discussion, Kimihito lifted his hand stopping the chattering of the girls, taking the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate your suggestion and, slowly, we will try to satisfy each one of your proposals. For now, though, how would you feel with Pizza? As we order them we can have each one customized as per each of your preferences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea was soon accepted by all, as a compromise that would get each of them satisfied. Soon, though, Kimihito found himself calling the nearest place that made deliveries, preparing himself to hear an earful from the owner as he ordered some pizza\u2019s that, for a normal human being, could barely be considered as food. As soon as he made the order, he then tried to keep the girl busy by chatting a bit, although he was thankful when he heard the doorbell ringing, since he could distinctively hear their rumbling stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he distributed the food, each girl, although dubious, began tasting their dish, finding it delicious. Even Centorea, who usually didn\u2019t eat anything but salads and veggies, found herself growing enamored with the taste of her veggies and the melted cheese. Still, as Kurusu ate his own pie, he couldn\u2019t refrain from stealing some glances to the girls surrounding him as they looked like they were really enjoying the novelty, without taking notice of how greasy the pies were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one who didn\u2019t seem to be sharing the love for their food seemed to be Papi and Suu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although he could understand why Suu wasn\u2019t enjoying it, she hadn\u2019t any real taste buds(as far as he knew), he was rather shocked about the harpy. In any case, as each girl ate her meal, without taking great care in seeing the size difference between what had been their pies, and the smaller one that he had for himself, as they had been enjoying the taste way too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meal finished, each of them began to slowly move away toward their room for a well needed nap, being hit harder than they thought by how greasy the pies had been, leaving him alone in the room with Papi and Suu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was alone with them he then, tried to get their attention. If he really wanted to turn his secret dream in reality he had to make sure that each girl ate with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapi? Suu? Didn\u2019t you like the pies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy, which had started to preen herself for some time already, was the first who replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was tasty but\u2026Now Papi is all sticky with cheese\u2026and covered in sauce. It isn\u2019t easy for Papi to lift slices of pizza with no hands\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuu\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the case of the slime girl, instead, she used her slime feeler to show Kurusu that she liked the taste but, she couldn\u2019t really say she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith said clarifications in mind, he thanked the girls and began to plan in order to be better prepared for the next time. During the afternoon, though he suddenly noticed that the place was much more quiet than usual. As he made a quick round of the girls, he realized that, although each was living it differently, all of them shared a common feeling of sleepiness and of feeling tired without having done pretty much anything. <br>\r\nKurusu hypothesized that since the meal they had that morning, had been greasier than what the girl were used to, it had left them lethargic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was only a bonus in his quest to have them grow larger. As he passed the day planning, he decided that since the ball was rolling, he had better try to keep it rolling as much as he could, although he still had to see the reaction of the girls as soon as dinner time would be approaching.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon passed uneventful, although Papi and Suu weren\u2019t particularly affected by the meal, as all the others had, and had then forced Kimihito to spend the day with them playing at the videogames or chasing them around the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs evening approached, and with-it dinner time, he was suddenly approached by the rest of the girls who slowly moved into the main room, still feeling a bit slowed from their morning meal. As he approached them, he could see that there was no real sign of them having gained anything, not that he expected that as it would have been too soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he could see that both Miia and Mero were seemingly more asleep than awake. While Rachnera and Cerea were tying hard to fight back the sluggish sensation they were having. The one who looked the less affected was Lala, which expression was calm and awake, although he could see her body constantly massaging her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Girls, What would you like for dinner? I shall start preparing\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, each girl tried to speak at the same time, until they noticed and, with a silent agreement between them, one of them was chosen to act as representative of their own will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one that they chose, after a short internal discussion, was Miia, which raised her arm toward Kimihito, pointing a finger in his direction, smiling as she half-dazedly told him\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet, not everything is as good as \u2018Darling\u2019 believes to be, for something its going to change\u2026and greatly at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimihito\u2019s life is going to be changed though. As much as he may love it\u2026or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit added on the 25th of November 2020 (see bottom of the page.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome to this new interactive of mine, here we will have the girls from the anime Monster Musume changing and expanding in any way. Choices will be given, that could change each of the girls in a very unique kind of way. It will be up to you(and me ofc) to decide how these monster girls will react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as much as may not be liked, some ground rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tSex can happen (both ways at that, but not with the underaged), while the focus should be mainly on the girls, other characters can change as well. If in need you may use your own character but, keep them in line with the story and keep it PG, the interactive is 13+ after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tNo Scat/watersports or any related smelly, gassy, slobby activity related to feces. A general slobbiness can be accepted but no more than a mild presence of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tWeight gain, Expansion, Giantess, blueberry, these and many more fetishes can be included into the interactive as long as: 1) is clearly stated beforehand toward which the story is going;<br>\r\n                                                 2) there will always be an available choice to change<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tThere can be anything you may wish or desire (aliens, weird ray guns, magic, gremlins and even supernatural beings. The limit is your imagination!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tThere are no limits to the size of these beautiful girls can grow into. They can grow as big as the universe, if so, you wish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tNo single paragraph chapters unless needed to dish out choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tPut some effort into it. I\u2019m the first who like quantity over quality but gaining a million pounds in a minute just isn\u2019t fun at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tTry to always leave a choice, let\u2019s try to keep it rolling for as long as we can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t<u>Have fun and enjoy it, that is a must</u>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit_25/11/2020: <br>\r\nAs it was pointed out in one of the choosing chapters, I will clarify it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can make your own character/OC to be either one of the monster girls or the caretaker. Just try to keep it in line with the setting of the story (that means, don\u2019t start adding characters from other anime series just to see them in this setting. Same rules apply to OC\u2019s. If your OC is an elf of LOTR origins, don\u2019t have him prancing around in this setting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBase rule is \u201cNo part of Monster Musume? No participation.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere could be exceptions, as in having it \u201cmasked\u201d as a human impersonating one (following the example of the elf from LOTR) but it will have to be discussed through private message, first.<br>\r\n I will gladly answer any private message sent, if you\u2019re having any doubts  \ud83d\ude0a<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>In any case, I reserve the right to edit/delete posts, as creator of this interactive, but will always try to get in contact with you beforehand. It may happen (it has happened before) that I may have to delete your chapter first, and then contact you. If that happens it will be only due to the chapter having such a content that could have this interactive banned/deleted.<br>\r\nOtherwise, I\u2019ll always try to get in touch with you first, to see if said chapter can be revised instead.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for being here, even if only as a reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
