But there were few that held such interesting mysteries as the quaint little shop sitting between two massive buildings on the fringe of Central Savannah and the downtown area, owned by the strangest goat you'd ever seen. She was a collector of wares of all sorts, some of the strangest items that could exist in such a fascinating universe. She had traveled the world to collect them and wished to share all that she had found. So, she had opened the store, Stephanie's Store, under the guise of selling antiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if you had ever been inside the store and purchased something, you'd know just how much of an underestimate \"antiques\" was given what these items could do. Though that was part of the fun, Stephanie had decided. Letting her patrons discover the joy of what secrets the world held was why she had founded her place of business in the first place. Not out of any pursuit of money or wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow day for Stephanie as she sat waiting at the counter, drumming her hooves as she listened to the radio. A few of the regulars had stopped by that morning, but nothing much interesting had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all about to change, of course, as the bell at the door clanged out and someone walked in. Someone brand new, who had never stepped foot in Stephanie's Store. Someone who was entering the shop for a very particular reason as yet undecided. But to start, who was it that had discovered the quaint little antique store?</span></div></div>",

She was a cute little thing, wearing a police officer uniform and with fairly wide hips and big purple eyes. That's when it clicked who this was, as Stephanie had been listening to the news. This was Judy Hopps, the rather famous bunny cop who had taken care of all that Nighthowler business a ways back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real question was why Judy was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, honey,\" Stephanie chimed as she turned off the radio. \"How can I help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll patrons came into Stephanie's Store for one reason or another.

The bunny cop had official business in being here and she couldn't be distracted by such things. Besides, she was trying to work on her prejudice since the Nighthowler incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ma'am,\" she greeted. \"Officer Judy Hopps. I'm actually here to investigate a recent case we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, a case you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. We recently brought in a suspect who had a rather...Strange item on their person. When questioned about it, they pointed us in the direction of your shop. We don't mean to cause trouble, but would you be able to confirm their purchase as it might be a part of a larger case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'd be happy to help. Though it might do better if you described to me what the object was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...That's sort of the strange part, ma'am. The object broke upon our capture of the suspect so we were unable determine <i>what </i>it was, exactly. However, we did observe it had some...Rather bizarre incidents during the arrest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bizarre, you say?\" Stephanie repressed a smile. \"Can you elaborate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was finding it hard to get out exactly what she was trying to say as she recounted her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we had cornered the suspect who was involved in the case we were investigating.

Like a balloon. It was just the strangest thing. They took one sip of this...Whatever drink it was. Then their entire body just started expanding like they would do in the cartoons. Exaggerated features and all. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it with my own eyes. The Chief certainly didn't either. That's why I'm here, for proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proof, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy reached into her belt and pulled out the vial she had kept. Beyond the label was a little detail that noted it was a product sold at Stephanie's Shop, like all of her merchandise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guys in CIS examined it but couldn't even explain what it was. So, I figured I'd go to the source even if it got me laughed out of the station. I know what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Stephanie inspected the bottle and knew exactly what product it was. \"Very brave of you to stand by your beliefs. Though if it's this item you're after, you're going to have to pick out something more...Specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Specific? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie stepped out from behind her counter, showing off her full height to Judy as she towered over the tiny rabbit. Poor bunny didn't even come up to her knees as she gulped and followed Stephanie over to a cardboard display over in the corner of the store. Judy took a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bubblebeer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Named after rootbeer, of course. This is that product that I believe your suspect used. What I was getting at was there are quite a lot of options to choose from. Some use helium, some don't. There's also the shape or size you'd like. Is hourglass up your fancy? Pick a flavor, Officer Hopps. To show my cooperation with you, I'll even let you take one as a free sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie then smiled sweetly and wandered back behind her counter, though kept a close eye on Judy as she ran through her options. She was curious what the young rabbit would pick. And she knew that surely Judy wouldn't be able to resist the curious call of the product, hence the free sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Judy, she was definitely interesting in the strange brand of soda. She had already seen the effects firsthand, after all. And she would need to prove it to Bogo, perhaps by drinking it if she had to. Who could say? The task at hand was picking the right elixir and their flavor names all gave hints as to what the effects might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's paw landed on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For some reason, Judy's gaze continued to go back to the Buoyant Blimp Berry. The bottle looked very similar to the one she had confiscated from the suspect before they had gotten away. She could remember the sight of the kangaroo as she hopped along the alleyway, stopping to drink the bottle and dropping it on the ground as she began to grow. Her tummy bloated to a giant size before the rest of her caught up, growing bigger and bigger until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Hopps?\" asked Stephanie. \"Are you with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy jolted back into reality and felt a redness in her ears. \"Sorry! Uh, I think this one will work for the purposes of our investigation. Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Well, I hope it helps! And I look forward to seeing you again real soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy couldn't help but wonder what Stephanie meant by that as she left the store with her evidence in tow. But she had more important things on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had managed to determine exactly what she was looking for in the shop, there was still the matter of proving that it was actually responsible for this whole mess to begin with. Even though Judy was a witness, no one in the ZPD was actually taking her seriously. Not that she could blame them. Even after seeing it with her own, Judy still didn't know if she believed it or not. But now she at least had some sort of proof as she entered the station to find a handful of familiar faces waiting for her in the form of Nick and Clawhauser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Carrots,\" said Nick while he leaned against the front desk. \"Where have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just gathering something that will be useful for the chase yesterday. Take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy held up the blue vial to the pair of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's and all, Judy,\" said Clawhauser. \"But it sounds like Bogo is a little...Livid right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not happy that his top officer seems to believe in cartoons, apparently,\" Nick answered with his arms crossed. \"And then let a potential suspect escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you might want to explain that to him then if you're so confident in that assessment, Carrots. So, this is the little magic potion that turned our culprit into a blimp, quote unquote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! And I can prove it to you all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had an idea. The kind of bad idea that'd usually happen as a result of her being challenged by something. She looked down at the bottle in her paw. When all you have is a hammer...Everything looks like a nail. The only question was who was going to be the one to drink from the bottle?</span></div></div>",

It was thanks to Clawhauser that she had her reminder literally the morning of. And she desperately needed something to give to her best friend. It was the first Valentine's Day she'd have with Nick.

In fact, I think all you need to give him enough of a hint is a private moment alone with the two of you. Have a nice little confrontation about it, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy did. She had been trying many times these past few months when she had known her feelings to get Nick alone so she could blurt them out. But nothing seemed to work and with their job, they were so busy without a moment of privacy to really get into it. So she never really tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's my proposal,\" Stephanie said, bringing up a strange box. \"You take this for no charge. Call this a supplement. It's a special brand of tea that you can use to calm yourself and bring you down a level, in a manner of speaking. Take a bag of it and wait at a private place you know just the two of you will be. Have a drink and just let what happens happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wasn't sure how a brand of tea was going to solve all her problems. But there was something to the goat's voice that suggested she should trust her.

Don't cheese it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Judy know, it was Stephanie's intention to put Judy in a situation where she would be forced to confront Nick without any hope of escape. Judy was being too mousy about her feelings, so it was only fitting that she should be turned into a mouse. The only question was where Judy would choose to meet with Nick, if it was to be in a private setting or someplace a little more public and thus dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy would drink the tea...</span></div></div>",

And given she was on her way to work, it seemed like as good a time as any. Everyone preferred their morning coffee at the ZPD, so she would just help herself to a little herbal tea, completely unaware of what it would actually do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a special spot in the precinct that she went in to be alone in from time to time. It was one of the smaller offices on the upper floors, too small for most of the big mammals in the building to ever bother with. It was also the perfect place to plug in a Hot Shot water heater and boil up some water for her first bag. Judy set her things down and waited patiently for everything to be ready while she took a deep sniff of the tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough rabbit's weren't known for their noses, there was something heavenly about the aroma surrounding the tea. It was creamy in a strange way with hints of honey to it. And berries? Some sort of berries. The sort of drink that would leave any sweet tooth satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly tasted sweet as Judy drowned her first cup. It didn't even need any sugar or sweetener too it before Judy smacked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is really good,\" she said. \"I feel great! And full of energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tea settled in the pits of her stomach, it felt like it was warming her whole body. From her head to her toes, Judy felt a surge of heat pass over her and she was resisting the urge to bounce around the whole room. Was this why Stephanie wanted to give her this supplement tea? To give her a boost of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy definitely didn't want the moment to go to waste though and immediately dug out her phone to text Nick to meet her so she could speak with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she typed away, she failed to notice that the tea was doing something other than giving her body a boost of energy. Her right ear dipped slightly before it began to slowly shrink in height, becoming squatter and far less like a rabbit's. As it squashed down, it became fatter and rounder too until it resembled the ears of different animal, specifically a mouse. The tea was already starting to take effect and transforming parts of Judy's body as she took another sip. The only question was how the process would work, exactly?</span></div></div>",

It tugged downwards until it was snuggly in place with her other ear until they matched perfectly. No longer did Judy have tall, thin rabbit ears, but short, squat mouse ears. And unfortunately she didn't seem to notice, with her ears being on the top of her head. The only thing that she noticed was that the tea was making her feel great as she took yet another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time there was a tingle on the little ball of fluff atop her backside. Her small bunny tail twitched slightly before it suddenly surged forward a few inches, losing some of its poofiness along the way. Judy's new, longer tail flapped around excitedly as she took another sip. Almost like it had a mind of its own, it squashed itself down and then pushed itself forward a few more inches. Another sip and a few inches more. Before long, Judy had finished about half her cup of tea and was sporting a full mouse's tail, which was much longer and wirier than her bunny one as it wrapped itself around the table where Judy was drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been so engrossed with her drink that Judy had forgotten the reason for it in the first place or that she had texted Nick to come find her in the private office so they could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick walked into the room, his eyes widened in surprise as he saw his partner only she was very different. Her ears looked like they did not belong on her head but were more rodent-like. And her tail...It had grown out and wrapped itself around the table like a snake. Nick closed the door firmly behind him so that no one would see what he was witnessing. The sudden click of the door caused Judy to pause before she could take another sip and look up to smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick! You gotta try this stuff, it's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots,\" he started. \"What on earth is happening to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked before she took another sip. \"I'm just enjoying a cup of the best tea I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was about to point out her ears and tail when he noticed something about Judy's face. Three long strands of fur were sprouting on both of her cheeks, longer and whiter than any other hair on Judy's head. That's when he realized what he was looking at. Whiskers! Judy was growing noticeable whiskers! Only she didn't seem to notice at all as she put the mug from her mouth and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for him to put two and two together that the tea was definitely doing something to his partner, though he couldn't say exactly what yet.

Do you seriously not notice what's happening to you by drinking that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? I feel great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look ridiculous. Here, check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick offered Judy his phone with the camera on flip so that she could see her reflection. Judy reluctantly put the tea down as she accepted the camera to witness the changes that had been done. Her eyes widened as she saw herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Judy asked, putting the tea down. \"My face. My ears!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tail,\" Nick offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, this isn't funny! What on earth happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I was wondering until I read this,\" he offered the tea box back to her. \"Here, have a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nick had skimmed over the box's description, something she had neglected to do when first acquiring the tea. After all, who would expect a simple drink to do this to someone? Upon reading it fully, however, it slowly dawned on Judy exactly what she was putting in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mice Tea,\" she read aloud. \"This brand of herbal tea is the finest on the metamorphic market for providing the user a relaxing and enjoyable transformation. For those unfamiliar with our brand, the slow consumption of this tea will cause the user to <i>take on attributes of their chosen animal until they are fully a copy</i>. Oh my god, Nick. This tea is turning me into a mouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains a few things,\" Nick said. \"Does it say how to turn you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked at the thought she might be stuck with mouse ears and a tail forever, Judy continued reading on to discover that...</span></div></div>",

You'll be back to your old self in two to six hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, we have to go to work though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call in sick, Carrots,\" Nick shrugged. \"Seriously, I'll just go down to the Chief now and let him know you're feeling under the weather and you have to go home. There's a little thing called sick days, Carrots. I know you haven't heard of them given how hard you work, but you should use them sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy breathed a little easier.

Your face is less noticeable but you can always wear a scarf or face mask, right? Just do all that and hurry home then wait there for the effects of the tea to wear off. By then it will be past noon and I can swing by after work to make sure you're doing okay. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they put the plan in motion as Judy quietly left the station in her makeshift disguise. Thankfully, with everyone at bullpen, no one noticed her slipping out and no one on the bus paid her close enough attention to notice anything off about her. She made it back to her apartment with any incidents, the tea box still in paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, it had been an hour since Judy had consumed the tea and she pulled off her borrowed hoodie to notice that her ears, while still very mouseish, were looking a bit longer than they had when this mess all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness,\" Judy sighed in relief as her body reverted back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow and curious transformation as Judy lingered around her apartment, looking to pass the time with various activities. Now that she was focusing, she could feel the little changes in her body. Her ears felt like they were being tugged at every time they grew a centimeter longer. Her spine felt like it was pulling back her tail into her body, like a rope, as it receded further and further. Even her whiskers faded before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter noon, she looked in the mirror to find her old reflection especially as she remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy slumped into her chair and breathed out all the tension in her body as she looked at the tea box that had been waiting on her desk. Now that she knew these changes were all reversible, she had to admit she was a little curious. What might have happened if she went \"all the way?\" Could she pause somewhere in between, like she did before? What might happen to someone else if they drank it? Would they notice anything or ignore it like Judy had until Nick pointed it out to her? And why had Stephanie given this tea to her in particular?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll curious questions as Judy began to look at the box again, wondering especially what she was going to do with this tea since she had time to kill before Nick arrived from work to check on her.

She was really, <i>really </i>curious what might happen to her if she had drank a full cup. And besides all that, it was really good tea. So long as it was something she could control, she would be fine. It was like...An experiment in science class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy started up her kettle and grabbed her carrot pen with the recording device on it. She intended to detail her every experience this time and, at the very least, leave some sort of record for Nick if something were to happen to her. It might have been smarter to wait for him but then she wouldn't be Judy Hopps as she left the tea seep in the boiling water for a few minutes before hitting record on the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Judy Hopps beginning my experiment with the Mice Tea. After my first experience with the tea, waiting for around 3.2 hours allowed for full restoration to my old self as advertised. I am 100% bunny right now about to consume a full dose to observe the effects. This pen has about an hour of audio space on it, so I'll leave it running as I describe the process. Beginning now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy then put the pen down on the table as she took her first sip. Instantly the hints of honey and cream filled her mouth, as she fought from moaning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's very good,\" she said aloud as she looked into the mirror. \"And my right ear is getting smaller and wider. Taking another sip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did so and observed her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now both ears are shrinking down to look like mouse ears, the right one is almost done. It feels strange, like someone is tugging on them and manipulating them like clay. But it's also rather pleasant, though that might be the taste of the tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, now it feels like my spine is growing. My tail is getting longer though only by a couple of inches. Another sip...Even longer now and looking less fluffy too. It feels like something is pulling it out with a pair of pliers. Though it's strange to have complete control over it unlike my usual tail. Another sip and my tail is quite long now and seems to have a mind of its own almost. One more...And it's as long as it was the last time. It looks like a proper mouse tail and I can move it freely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sip was easier to take and Judy noted just how much left of the drink she still had to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is where I left off the last time before Nick interrupted. I'm growing longer whiskers. I barely felt a thing though I note that my senses are sharper now than before. Next sip is unknown territory...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took a breath before taking a big drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mouth...It's getting longer. It feels like there's some pressure in my skull pushing out my face as I...I can see my nose clearly now. I have a snout. All my teeth are surging forward too, including my front teeth. Another sip and my snout is just getting larger as my head is restructuring itself to match. Looking at the mirror and I could pass as a mouse now. A very large mouse. And there's so much of this drink left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took a small sip and felt a slight tingle through her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took a drink but nothing seems to have happened. Though I feel...Different. Taking another sip...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Judy felt it as she noticed a dip in her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, scratch that last update. Something did happen. My clothes are looser and the apartment looks a little bigger. Standing up now...Yup, I've shrunk. About two inches. That's quite a lot when you're two feet tall though, or were. Gonna take another sip now while standing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy drank, she felt her belt clanged to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my belt, it just fell off as I lost another two inches in height. I'm about 1/6th smaller than my usual size. The whole apartment is bigger and it feels like someone is pressing down on me. I'm wondering if I should continue because if the tea is accurate, I could become the size of a full mouse. That might make navigating my apartment a challenge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy stared at the bottom of her cup and noticed only a couple of sips left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck with it,\" she said taking a big drink. \"Whoa, my pants just fell to the floor and my shirt is huge. I must have lost six inches there and am almost half my size. It's weird but it feels kinda nice. Like someone is gently pressing down on me from above. I'm going to climb the chair now, which is proving to be quite difficult at this height. Omph. Okay, grabbing my tea again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one sip left in the cup, but at Judy's height, it was too large to finish in one gulp. She swallowed and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Woah, okay. I am really small now. And my voice...Wow, I sound really high pitched. I must be eight inches tall, I'm smaller than some dolls I own. My shirt doesn't fit at all, so I'm just leaving it on the chair and trying to climb up to the desk...Urmp, there. Got the cup which is looking huge now, like the size of a huge pot you'd use for cooking. Taking a drink...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just a little tea lining the edges of the cup as Judy found she could no longer hold it up and dropped it on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">The cup just doubled in size,</font>\" she squeaked. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Which means I halved in height. I'm about four inches tall now and definitely mouse-sized, though there's still a little drink in the cup. I'm going to squeeze in and go for it...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy crouched down and climbed into the cup, sipping the honey tea lining the rim. As she did, she felt the cup around her grow bigger and bigger until there was no drink left. Judy squeaked as she backed out of the cup and noticed that it was almost as big as she was now. She had shrunk down to less than two inches tall, making her one small mouse. She certainly looked the part now as she walked over the carrot pen which was taller than she was now and hit the record button to pause everything. Judy had to marvel at just how large her room was now, it felt like a canyon. She glanced over to the giant clock on her desk and realized that she still had several hours to kill before Nick got off of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do until then?</span></div></div>",

The tea had really and truly turned her completely into a mouse as she inspected her reflection in the clock's glass. Her new features, like her ears and tail, were going to take some getting used to. But nothing compared to the thought of how small she was now. It was like everything had gotten gigantic around her as she looked down from her desk at her discarded clothing. The view from above was like standing on top of a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder,\" she said to herself. \"Since I'm smaller, that means I have less mass. Which means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took a few steps back and charged to the edge of the table before throwing herself off and onto the chair. In many ways, it was like she was falling from a sky scraper but when she landed it, it didn't hurt at all as she rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can survive high falls!\" she cheered as she approached the edge of the chair and jumped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on the floor, Judy had an even greater impression of just how small she was at two inches tall. She was 1/12 of her usual height and that meant everything in the apartment was at least twelve times bigger than it normally was from her perspective. Even her belt was bigger than her as she wandered around enjoying the new perspective. It was all rather thrilling to be so tiny. She'd never have to worry about feeling cramped in her room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her musings were interrupted by a pounding noise that echoed through the whole apartment. Given Judy's smaller size, every noise sounded much bigger and deeper. Even the voice at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy? Are you there? Nick asked to check up on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy couldn't quite recognize the noise given how its pitch was deeper and changed from being small.

It just so happened that her mom was in the neighborhood and was hoping to surprise Judy. Nick had told her that Judy was feeling a little sick, so of course Bonnie was going to stop by. Nick, however, didn't tell her the truth about Judy's real condition.

Clearly Judy was reluctant to make the first move into whatever this person of interest of hers was. In fact, Stephanie wagered that the guy was perhaps waiting for some kind of sign that Judy was interested in a relationship. Judy needed to be bold. Confident. Loud. Big! Especially big. And Stephanie had just the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about elephants?\" Stephanie asked out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elephants?\" Judy replied. \"I suppose they're just like any other mammal. Folks of all sorts. Shades of grey, literally in their case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And how about your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" Judy thought for a moment. \"I think he likes elephants a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, outside of when we first met where one of them didn't have such nice things to say about foxes, I believe 'appreciates' is a better word. Elephants are...Well, they're quite large, you see. And my friend enjoys striking up a good bargain on deals, from furniture to food. Since elephants require so much more substance, they tend to have those items cheaper in bulk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...Your friend is quite the hustler, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blushed. \"Kinda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Stephanie wondered out loud. \"You know what you really need, girl? You don't need to get your fox any fancy items to coyly hint at your interest in him. What you need is a confidence booster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, uh, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie reached down below her counter and pulled up a glass bottle filled with a curious orange liquid and marked with a sticker that looked suspiciously like an elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is what your fox would probably appreciate it if you just up and asked him out on a date. Skip all this awkward dancing around the issue and take a sip of this. This is the Essence of Elephant. One skip and you'll feel as bold and as big as one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh. I dunno...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I stake so much claim on it that I'm willing to let you try this sample for free,\" Stephanie said with a wink. \"I promise, it ain't got nothing unnatural or any drugs in it. It's just a little boost to work up the nerves to talk to him. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was truthfully having a hard time saying no, especially if it was for free. She gingerly accepted the vial as Stephanie lowered it into her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why not?\" Judy finally relented. \"I've been trying to get his attention for months. Might as well, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, honey! Now, the elixir only lasts for twelve hours. Make sure you drink it in someplace that offers enough space for your new ego. Oh, and mind your clothes during the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were all odd details but Judy was a bit more preoccupied over other things. Like when she was going to approach Nick?

After work would be best and Nick's apartment was the closest to the station. It was a simple matter of mentioning that it had been a long time since they had a movie night together, something that was pretty ordinary for the pair. And so the friendly movie night was set, with Judy carefully patting the orange vial she kept hidden in the side pouch of her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork proceeded uneventfully and they headed straight to Nick's place on the same bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nick's apartment was certainly larger than Judy's cramped quarters, it was more a basement than anything else. Nick even slept in a dresser instead of a bed, with most of the furniture having been designed for elephants. Like Judy had mentioned to Stephanie, Nick appreciated a good deal and sometimes those drawers came with forgotten clothes from their previous owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they arrived, Nick offered to order and pizza and start up the movie while Judy excused herself to go the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror, Judy sighed and pulled out the elixir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she whispered. \"This is supposed to make me bold as an elephant? Well, let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uncorked the bottle and leaned back, guzzling it all down in one sitting. The mixture was surprisingly sticky and almost sweet. In fact, it was kind of like peanut butter, which Judy supposed was fitting. As it settled down in the pit of her stomach, she could feel her guts churn. The elixir was certainly doing something and Judy suddenly felt a little woozy as she stumbled out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there, Carrots?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just smiled while clenching her gut as it wriggled with butterflies. \"Oh yeah, I'm fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in reality, the potion was beginning to work its magic all over Judy's tiny body. Stephanie never did mention how the elixir was supposed to work. It could be a fast potion that happened almost instantly or perhaps a relative change, altering parts of her bit by bit. Then again, it might also change Judy based on her mood, the more bold and bigger she acted the bigger she'd get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of potion was this?</span></div></div>",

Her stomach had already settled into place and now the promise of pizza soon wasn't such a bad idea as a deep hunger took root. The potion was starting to do its work, making tiny changes about her biology beneath the surface so that neither Judy nor Nick would notice. It wouldn't be long before one of them did notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver worried for his friend's well being, Nick would occasionally break from watching the movie to have a look at Judy and make sure she was looking less green in the gills. Judy was so engrossed with the movies that she didn't even detect the stares from her foxy companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one of those glances, Nick did notice something though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere Judy's ears looking...Bigger? They were always kind of large, being a bunny. But strangely enough they seemed even larger than usual. Maybe not longer, persay. But wider and thicker. And it only became more and more noticeable as the movie went on that Nick afforded himself more looks at his companion. It came to the point that Nick had to admit that, yes, Judy's ears were getting bigger and strangely shaped, not like a rabbit's at all. But her ears weren't the only thing getting larger either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew,\" Judy said as she shifted around the couch and unzipped the neck of her uniform a little. \"I might have to cut back on the doughnuts Clawhauser keeps offering. This uniform is feeling a little tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick politely smiled and debated whether he should inform Judy that her ears had all but abandoned their typical bunny shape and showing no signs of slowing down. Though he had a healthy bit of curiosity. Surely whatever was happening to his friend wasn't hurting her, else she'd might notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould Nick reveal what's happening to Judy or would he let this play out more?

No, he was going to keep quiet and see how this played out before alerting Judy to what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to watch her ears get bigger and bigger before the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be the pizza,\" Nick said, rising from his seat and to the door. \"Hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starving!\" replied Judy as she hefted herself from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's smile hid his raised eye as he noticed that when Judy stood up, she came up quite a bit higher on him than usual. Was she getting taller as well? Her uniform was starting to look a little snug on her in all the right places. In fact, she looked curvier in general. Her butt had noticeably more omph to it as it jiggled about while she walked to the kitchen table. Her ears had gotten wider and wider, no longer did they look anything like a bunny's ears as their weight made it so that they flopped over. But Nick couldn't quite put his paw on what they reminded him of. Even her chest was getting bigger as Judy took off her vest just to breathe while sitting down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it,\" Judy said as Nick set the delivered pizza down in front of her. \"I feel swollen all of a sudden...Larger, but in a good way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well, let's work on that appetite then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick opened the pizza box for her, revealing Judy's favorite carrots and broccoli pie, she licked her lips. There was a strange hunger in her eyes as she chowed down, finishing half the pie before Nick could even put away his first slice.

She also took off her belt, dropping it on the floor as she began to turn her attention to finishing up her pie. Eating a whole pie on her own was something she had never done before, but on the last slice, she found that was still hungry like she had gone days without eating. Even though the chair began to creak under her weight. Though that wasn't the only thing changing about Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick watched her eat, he noticed that her two buckteeth that every rabbit had were starting to migrate as if clearing the way from Judy's consuming maw. They settled in opposite corners of her mouth before they changed again. The flat edges started to sharpen, almost like they were becoming canines. Only they were sticking themselves further out of Judy's more than any tooth usually would. That's when Nick realized exactly what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tusks</i>, he thought to himself. <i>And those ears. Is Judy...Turning into an elephant somehow?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn't even begin to explain how that was possible. Mammals didn't just up and change species like that on a whim. But the more he stared at Judy, the less distinct her features were as a rabbit and the more she reminded him of an elephant. This was especially true when the two of them rose to put away their dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could eat more,\" Judy said as she hoisted herself up. \"But I'm feeling a little fat right now so I shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's plenty of leftovers in my box if you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's voice trailed as he stood up next to Judy. Normally, she came up to his chest barely in height. Now she was coming up to his snout. She had grow almost half a foot in height over the course of the dinner. Her uniform was starting to look strained as it struggled to accommodate the increase in scale, both vertically and horizontally. Her limbs were much thicker. Her butt had gotten huge as there was an audible groan from the seat of her pants. She had even started to develop breasts as two mounds began to press against her tight shirt. Nick wagered it wouldn't be long before he was looking up at Judy, and she still hadn't noticed a thing. That was because certain attributes like her fur and face remained untouched.

Nick's attention had turned to Judy's butt which was in his face due to her leaning over as she became more and more engrossed with the food. There were a few threads snapping as Nick watched his partner's caboose inflate before his very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is good,\" said Judy as she smacked her lips. \"But not quite hitting the spot. Do you have anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Nick snapped back to reality. \"Oh. Well, I don't have much, Carrots. You know me, never in the apartment a lot anyway. I got a few things, I guess. Some cans of soup. Maybe some grilled cheese. Or if you want peanut butter sandwiches--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have peanut butter?\" Judy dropped the pizza box entirely as she sounded completely excited. \"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gulped as he made a startling discovery the moment Judy stood up. They were now standing nearly eye to eye, just short of three feet tall. Nick couldn't take his eyes off Judy as they shuffled into the kitchen together. Her uniform was quite snug as Nick could hear more and more threads snap under the pressure. Nick was so distracted by all this that he bumped into the counter and strained to reach up to the top shelf of his cabinet. The place where he kept the peanut butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy frowned at her friend struggling and gently pushed him aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy stood up on her tippy toes and reached up, coming just short of the jar just like Nick had. But she licked her lips and reached a little harder and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before his eyes, Nick watched as his friend's body stretched and elongated until the jar was in reach. Then she snagged it and dropped back down to the floor, unaware of the fact that Nick, formerly much bigger than her, now was at eye level with her mouth. Her uniform was on its last leg as Judy struggled with the peanut butter jar, not even noticing the differences done to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blasted thing,\" she said, her paws clumsier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Judy grew from eating, other changes were starting to be noticeable as Nick detected that...</span></div></div>",

Her fingers were starting to look stubbier making it harder for her to get a hold on anything. And her claws were becoming bigger and duller. It didn't take long for Nick to realize what was happening to her now. <i>Her paws are turning into elephant hooves...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Judy said as she managed to tug off the top with her misshapen paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet scent of peanut butter filled the air as Judy began to shovel it into her mouth. As she did, her paws only became more bulbous and less dexterous. She eventually had to put the jar on the counter because it kept slipping out of her grip. The peanut butter also seemed to accelerate her growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each mouthful, Judy only seemed to be getting larger and larger. Nick felt his heading tilting up and up as Judy began to consume more of his kitchen. Her stomach had grown as well as her hips and arms, making her look properly overweight. In fact, she just looked thicker in general, with her limbs growing to match the rest of her curves. Somehow, against all logic, her uniform was managing to hold onto her curvy body for dear life. Even her new breasts had gone from the size of apples to melons as Nick looked up at them. It occurred to him that he was now below her chest level, she had become a gigantic bunnyphant making Nick feel very small indeed as the growing showed no signs of slowing down. Her head was getting closer and closer to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was about halfway done with the jar when she stopped very suddenly.

Ahhhhhhhh. <b>CHOOO!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her increase in size, Judy's normally dainty sounding sneezes now echoed through the kitchen. When the dust settled, Nick looked up at her to discover that her nostrils were wider. Much wider. In fact, they had almost changed the shape of her face entirely, like the sneeze had caused her nose to explode almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots?\" Nicked repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh,\" Judy responded. \"<i><b>ACHOOOOO!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time her nose seemed to explode off of her face entirely from the sheer force of the sneeze. Then it dangled just above her chin, like it was broken only it wasn't. Nick should have expected this as it was the most distinct feature of an elephant besides their size. Judy was growing a trunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" Judy said one last time. \"AHHH. <b>AHHH...!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the final sense, there was no \"choo.\" Instead, the sound of a trumpet filled the kitchen as Nick covered his ears watching as Judy's tiny trunk extend to comical proportions before rest at Judy's neck. It no longer looked like someone had just pulled her nose off of her face, but it was thicker and bulky just like a real elephant's trunk. Albeit entirely covered in fur. In fact, Judy's whole body was still coated in her usual grey fur. Nick had to wonder if that was going to stay consistent or if Judy was going to start shedding in a massive way soon. There was still the matter of her tail too, which remained a fluffy white bunny tail. Not to mention Judy's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was getting pretty big as she rubbed at her trunk, unfazed as she brought her new appendage down into the jar and began sucking out the peanut butter. But as big as she looked to Nick, she made for a wimpy elephant. Nick did the math in his head real quick. Normally, Judy was around 60 centimeters tall while he stood at 90 in comparison. As she was now, he wagered that Judy stood at 130 centimeters or a little over twice her normal height and a great deal bigger than Nick. But the average female elephant in Zootopia were giants in comparison, with a mean of about 400 centimeters tall. Meaning that Nick's poor apartment was unlikely to hold her if she ever got to full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was what was going to change about Judy next as she finished up with the peanut butter?</span></div></div>",

She was behaving as if having a trunk was the most natural thing in the world, despite the fact that she had never been part elephant before. It was almost like even if Nick pointed out anything now, Judy still wouldn't notice what had happened to her body. And with each mouthful, she only seemed to be changing more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick could hardly believe that her uniform was keeping together through all this, yet somehow against all logic, it maintained its shape and form despite the cracks forming along the seams. Every gulp from the jar seemed to add another inch to Judy's already impressive stature as her head grew closer and closer to the ceiling and her uniform groaned more and more. Nick found himself now coming up to her belly in stature, making him feel quite small. He suddenly had the fear of what might happen if she got so large that she ended up breaking his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh Carrots,\" he said trying to get her attention. \"Maybe you should slow down a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy paused, putting down the jar as she looked past her belly and bosom to see Nick standing there significantly smaller than she remembered him being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" she asked somewhat confused. \"What happened? How did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Small?\" Nick had to laugh at that. \"Carrots, maybe you should look in a mirror right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mea--Oooh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy moaned as her insides churned. It felt like something was trying to push itself out from the base of her spine, where her fluffy white tail still was. Something that was causing a burning sensation. But try as she might, with her increased weight, Judy couldn't reach around to grab it with her clumsy, swollen pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick,\" she groaned. \"This is going to sound weird, but I need you to pull my tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need me to what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull my tail, as hard as you can. I can't reach it for some reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bizarre request as Nick had ever heard, but he didn't like seeing Judy in this kind of distress. He carefully sidestepped her bloated form and did as was asked, grabbing hold of the wiggling ball of fluff. With all his might, he pulled expecting to meet some sort of resistance. Instead, the tail came along with him like he was pulling it out of her body, though a glance told him it remained firmly attached, albeit much longer. That's when he realized what was going on as Judy's bunny tail was being stretched out into that of an elephant's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise of pleasure leaked out of Judy's mouth. \"Harder, Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit to see Judy in this kind of state was something he had never seen before. And it was a little arousing as he continued to pull with all his might. The tail was getting longer and longer as Judy ran her hooves all up and down her body. It was certainly the most sensual thing they had ever done together and the fun didn't stop there as Judy's trunk swirled around and settled in her mouth. She breathed in deep and blew out through her snout, causing her entire body to swell up like a balloon, growing both wider and taller. She was inflating herself bigger somehow, despite how illogical it was to physically do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her now distinctly elephant-tail in paw, Nick could only watch as Judy's growth accelerated and she took up more space in the kitchen. The only question was just how large she'd end up and if she'd wreck his apartment in the process. Judy would grow to...</span></div></div>",

She was standing at around 200 centimeters or 6'7, half the size of a typical elephant but more than twice as tall as Nick was. He didn't even come up to her waist anymore as he gulped at the sight of his partner, who just an hour ago was shorter than he was. With her big purple eyes glancing down to him, he suddenly felt like a toy to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Nick,\" Judy protested. \"I could get even <i>bigger</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" he said quietly, trying to envision what a fourteen foot tall Judy would look like. \"But here's not the place for that. You'll break my apartment and then what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked around, only seeming just to notice how small everything had gotten. Even her uniform was straining to remain attached, having stretched well beyond its limits almost magically. A smile formed under Judy's trunk as she eyed Nick again, who was tiny and small to her eyes. He gulped as her trunk began to snake around his hips as she leaned over to face him, eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she said. \"I suppose we don't want to crush my little fox. But you'll just have to make it up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah?\" Nick replied as Judy's grip tightened around him. \"How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" she giggled before hoisting him into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nick could almost certainly pry himself free from Judy's grasp and make a break for it, he actually didn't want to. It was a little exciting to be the little guy for a change and Judy was certainly making her intentions clear as she dragged him into the bedroom. She fell back on the bed as the entire mattress moaned under her extreme weight. She plopped Nick down right on top of her flabby belly as her trunk continued to coddle him while the two of them undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a night of the most bizarre and exotic passion Nick and Judy both had ever experienced. They were at it with each other into the late hours of the night, both thoroughly enjoying themselves and Judy's new form, before exhaustion finally set in and they both passed out, Nick still on top of Judy. Neither was quite sure what all this meant but that was a conversation to have in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as morning came and shined a light on the new sleeping couple, Nick opened his eyes to find that Judy...</span></div></div>",

He opened his eyes to find that Judy was snoring peacefully in his arms, only it wasn't the Judy he remembered going to bed with. Judy was back to being a bunny again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought for a moment. He was sure he could remember every detail up until the point of climax, but it could have been a dream. But then why was Judy in his bed? As he sat up, he saw more evidence of her transformation into part elephant. The legs of Nick's bed had all completely snapped off and the frame was on the floor. Judy's uniform had also been tossed to the side, only it had gotten completely stretched out to her previous shape and height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, she was an elephant,\" Nick muttered to himself. \"Or a bunnyphant. But that doesn't explain how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick sat up in the bed, Judy also stirred. Her purple eyes focused on Nick as she came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" Judy asked with a yawn. \"What are you doing in my room? And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes trailed down to see that Nick was sitting naked on his side of the bed. Her ears burned as she glanced downwards towards her own body and immediately covered up with the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nick, did we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Nick replied with a smile. \"You mean you don't remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I remember the movie,\" Judy said, rubbing at her head. \"And the dinner after that. But everything else...It's fuzzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything else?\" Nick asked with a raised eye. \"I thought elephants were supposed to never forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elephants? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots, I don't know how to say this without sounding crazy but, last night you turned into an elephant. Or part elephant. You were still fuzzy like a bunny, but you had all the other features of an elephant. Including the size and big personality to go with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy huffed a laugh. \"Come on, Nick. You're having me for a laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick reached out under the bed and hoisted up Judy's uniform. Only it was stretched out and torn in a bunch of areas. It looked as though something very large had tried to squeeze its way into it. Certainly much larger than her, almost four times as big in fact as it fell like a blanket on top of the bed. Judy inspected it and shook her head as she suddenly remembered another detail from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just no way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sheet wrapped around her body, Judy made her way to the bathroom. There she opened the trash can and found the orange vial that she had drunk before dinner. The one with an elephant sticker on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots?\" Nick asked from behind her. \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A confidence booster,\" she replied. \"The shopkeeper called it Essence of Elephant. Said it lasts for twelve hours and I should drink it someplace that offers a lot of space and mind my clothes. But I thought she was just joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it was a joke, Carrots...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my gosh! You mean I actually turned into an elephant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a bunnyphant, more accurately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, this isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say it was. But it was actually kind of fun being the smaller one for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick closed his mouth like he had let something slip out. Judy eyed him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...Are you saying you liked me as an elephant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nick admitted with his own blush. \"It was certainly different than anything else I've ever experienced. And it was kind of cool to watch you slowly transform like that. And the night together...Yeah that was kind of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's blush intensified as she stared down at her feet, unable to meet Nick's eyes. \"Do you...Want me to do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I don't want to force you into anything, Judy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say forced. I'm kinda...Curious myself. Now that I know this is a legitimate thing, maybe I can stop by that shop and...Purchase a few goods to have some fun together. You know, once and a while. Maybe soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's smile widened. \"I could be game for that. How soon were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, eager much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda,\" Judy's toes curled. \"I need to get home though. Get a change of clothes. And then we got work. But after our shift today, I'll stop by the shop and see...What I can find. Then meet back here, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Nick said with his arms crossed. \"Looking forward to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat whole day at the office, Nick and Judy both had a hard time meeting each other's eyes. They had a dirty little secret they were keeping and everyone in the precinct could tell that <i>something </i>had happened. No one was just quite sure what. Though Judy continued to work, she had a hard time focusing as she tried to imagine the exotic pleasures that awaited her that evening. Nick was also looking forward to what she could find at the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day finally ended and Nick raced home to try his paw in cooking. Just a little dinner to share in before their night together as he patiently watched the clock waiting for Judy to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the water boiled, there was a knock at his door. He casually leaned on the frame as he opened the way for Judy, dressed in less restrictive clothes this time and carrying a large wooden box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Nick said. \"Whatcha got there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was already blushing. \"Oh, I just got back from the store. Spent a small fortune on this and other, um, elixirs. She apparently has a bunch for different species, and I just couldn't resist. Take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy set the box down on the kitchen table and pulled out...</span></div></div>",

But still be pretty big, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see here,\" Nick said as he took the blue elixir this time and noted the logo. \"A hippo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've kinda been remembering last night a little better. We had to stop before I got too big. I figured we could save the elephant for when we had proper space. Maybe book an elephant-sized hotel somewhere when I get my next paycheck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the bottle back. \"Oh, fancy big spender there. First these little potions and now a hotel room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, I still have plenty of savings. Besides a new apartment, I can't think of anything to spend money on. And who knows? Maybe if we start to, um, like this arrangement of ours, we might be able to save living expenses in general in the future. Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Carrots. Are you asking to move into me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny felt herself blush as she fiddled with the cork on the bottle. \"I mean, it's still too early to even talk about that kind of thing. I get it. Right now we're just having fun. But if you ever want to make it official...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting,\" Nick gave a sly smile. \"Something to think about later. For now, I propose a toast to a fun evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Judy's ears were completely red at this point. \"A fun evening! One I'll hopefully remember this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did happen anyway?\" Nick asked as he pulled out two wine glasses. \"Did the shop keeper say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did ask. She explained to me that the first time is always a little intense, especially if you're going from one extreme to the other like I was. I was kind of suffering from sensory overload which simplified my thought process to base needs like food and...Intimacy. This time around, I should remember it better and be more aware of what's happening to me. And it should be easier with each elixir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know,\" Nick replied as he poured himself some wine while Judy filled her glass up with the blue hippo potion. \"I'll certainly be more helpful this time around now that I know you're into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking forward to this,\" Judy smiled as she sipped down the new concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick downed his own drink while he waited patiently for Judy to finish the elixir. The countdown had started and their evening was set, with no going back. Judy polished off her glass and smacked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one tastes like...Berries? It's making me feel a little intoxicated already but I don't seem any different otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was bit by bit the last night,\" Nick explained. \"We can sit down to have dinner in the meantime. It took you a couple of hours before you were fully transformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Huh, I wonder what will happen first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn't help with wonder that too as he kept a close eye on Judy for the first signs of any alterations.

Her ears were definitely shorter. If she focused, she could actually feel them recede into her head very, very slowly.

Does your friend happen to be a fan of those older B movies that used to run on the TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy thought for a moment and realized that something like that would be up Nick's alley, given his gaudy choice in outfits and personal taste in the old fashioned. Besides that, it certainly was a...Unique gift. It didn't quite say anything romantic but it was something different and special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie smiled as Judy slowly convinced herself that this might be a good option, unaware of the qualities of the gun that the shopkeeper neglected to mention. Such things were best left as a surprise, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I guess that will work,\" Judy decided at last, coming up with truly nothing else. \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, darling? Five bucks! Call it a friendly discount and perhaps I'll see you again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prop ray gun certainly looked more expensive with that, but for some reason Judy couldn't protest against the giant goat. Almost like there was a greater reason that she was selling the item so cheap to her. Instead, Judy quietly paid for her gift and bagged it up to head home, a chance to wrap it in some paper before she handed it over to Nick tomorrow on Valentine's Day. Judy thanked Stephanie and quickly went on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne long bus ride later and she eventually got home to her apartment and dropped the device on her desk, taking a moment to examine it more closely now that she was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all rather strange and heavy for something that was supposed to be a prop. The knob on the back wasn't labelled with anything other than an \"S\" on one end and a \"G\" on the other, with it set to the \"G.\" Judy continued to fiddle with the device before absentmindedly pressing the trigger, thinking it would do nothing.

It was like she had suddenly been hit by a spark of static shock before the light vanished in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid there on the bed for a moment, dazed and dumbfounded that the item she had once considered a prop was actually armed and capable of shooting...Whatever that was out.

They looked perfectly unharmed and she flexed them to confirm that they were still working just fine. It was odd though that they strangely seemed a size or two bigger than usual. Though that thought quickly turned to concern as she watched them begin to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bedroom was filled with the sound of what sounded like fabric being pulled out tightly, only it wasn't clothing but the skin of her feet being tugged out as that part of her body began to grow.

She could feel them getting larger as they surged forward into massive proportions, stopping only once they were double their normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was stunned as she stared down at her enormously sized feet, at least from her perspective. Cautiously, she lowered herself to the floor and found her balance had shifted as her feet took up much more space in her apartment.

It was like walking around with cement on her feet, something that she had the unfortunate experience of knowing firsthand. What had happened, she couldn't quite explain. Her feet had swollen to twice their usual size after being hit by the beam from the ray gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pieces weren't quite put together yet as Judy's fascination with her bigger additions turned to fear at the sudden knock at her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy jumped as she recognized the voice of the person that had come to her apartment, no doubt to check up on her after hearing her shriek and wonder aloud at her predicament.

I know it's a little early but...Happy Valentine's Day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had been doing her best to hide her gigantified feet from his sight by walking around her bed. She was having a tough time keeping her cool though when Nick revealed a large bouquet of violets, her favorite flowers. Though she still wanted to do her best to keep her plus-sized stompers away from Nick's glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nick...You shouldn't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just figured I'd save us the trouble of the awkward glances we'd probably get if I showed them to you at work,\" Nick said before noticing her discomfort and frowning. \"You don't like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, I love them. I just...Don't know if I have any place to put them in this tiny little apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about your desk then? I can go out and buy a vase. Here take them and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sighed as Nick looked a little hurt by her sudden rejection, knowing that he had probably come here to be considerate and she was blowing it. What was she being nervous for? This was just Nick, they had been through stranger places together. Surely he'd believe her if she told him what had just happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry, Nick. But you caught me at an awkward moment. You're not going to believe this but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy stepped out from behind her bed as her massive feet made the floorboards croak. Nick looked down as she wiggled her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is it just me or do your feet look a tad...Bigger, Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just you. See that gun there?\" Judy pointed at the dropped ray gun now next to Nick on the floor. \"I bought that at a weird thrift store this morning and was hoping to give it to you as a present. The lady there was really strange about it and it sounded like a good idea at the time. But I fired it by accident and a laser shot out and bounced off the mirror, hitting me in the feet. Then when I looked down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. It made your feet grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gingerly picked up the device and studied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're in luck, I think. If I'm half the detective Bogo thinks I am, this knob here can control if something grows or shrinks, depending on if it's over the 'G' or the 'S.' What do you say we put that little theory to the test, Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was too late to question him. The fox had that wild look in his eyes like whenever he was about to do something slightly naughty. He raised the gun and pointed it her, grinning as a beam of light came out and struck her again.

It was a red bolt this time, however, not green like before. She briefly wondered what that meant before something odd happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like her vision was being condensed somehow. She felt like she was falling into her uniform as the collar brushed against her cheeks and her ears felt unusually heavy on the top of her head. It was the strangest pressure all up and around her skull, like someone was pressing down on it from all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick,\" she squeaked out in a higher pitched voice that only seemed to get higher with each passing second. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">What did you do?</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow,\" he laughed. \"This thing actually works. Look in the mirror, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling awkwardly on her giant feet, Judy turned to the mirror on her wall and was aghast at the sight. Her ears had gotten gigantic! Only that wasn't quite it as she looked a little closer at herself. If she compared it to the size of the rest of her body, there was no denying it. Nick had shrunk her head to about half of its usual size! Bringing her now massive looking paw to the front of the face and gasping as she was now able to cover it entirely only confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Nick! You shrunk me!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with the voice there, Carrots. You'll give a chipmunk a run for it's money for impersonation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Nick, this isn't funny! You shrunk my entire face! My mouth! My brain!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hang on, a minute. This is all completely reversible if the gun has a growth option too that we proved with your feet. And you don't feel any stupider despite the smaller brain, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the strange thing. It was like her body parts had only resized and were functioning normally. Nothing scientifically about this made sense and yet there she was. The bunny with a pea-sized head and enormous feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">...No.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's there to worry about? You said you got this gun for me as a gift, right? What do you say we have a little fun with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy found it hard to object to that logic, especially since Nick was the one holding the ray gun as he played with the knob again and aimed at her. Surely there wasn't too much harm in messing around with this if it could all be reversed, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. What do we want to grow next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing danger, Judy immediately leapt into action trying to dodge the incoming blast as best she could. Her clumsy big feet, however, made it rather had to navigate her tiny apartment as Nick fired the gun again. The blinding flash of light traveled towards Judy's body just as she fell from tripping over her own two feet, striking her right in...</span></div></div>",

She yelped slightly as it felt like a particularly angry bee had stung her in the butt. Though there was certainly going to be some sort of swelling as she could already feel her cheeks begin to inflate as she landed hard on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gave a hearty laugh as her already toned bottom began to get bigger and bigger. Judy could feel her underwear start to ride up and the seat of her pants groan as they struggled to make room for her expanding asset. Eventually, they just couldn't take it and there was an audible rip in the apartment and followed by a breeze as Judy's crack was exposed to the world. Her giant ears reddened as her tiny head craned to look over her shoulder and watch as her butt continued to inflate until it was twice its usual size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that?\" Nick asked as he spun the gun around in his paws. \"Looks like the bolt doesn't affect clothes or inanimate objects. Only people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Nick, come on,</font>\" Judy whined as she attempted to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Carrots. Just teasing you a little.

I look like a freak!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you don't look like a freak, Carrots. You just look a little mismatched. Come on, this was supposed to be my Valentine's Day gift, right? Just one more little test, okay? I just want to see what happens when you fire it on the same spot twice. Then I'll turn you back to normal, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wasn't sure how she felt about being a further test subject to Nick's whims. But this ray gun <i>was </i>supposed to be her gift to him and as much as she felt like a weirdo with different sized body parts, Nick didn't seem to mind and that was all that mattered for her. Besides, they had already proven that both the shrink and the grow function on the gun worked just fine. So, they could just as easily turn her back to normal, no issues, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy gulped as she pulled herself up, struggling to cover her butt with both of her paws while her oversized feet shuffled in place. She suddenly realized that if Nick wanted to see what would happen if they fired at the same spot twice, then he only had three targets. Her feet, her butt or her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here,\" Nick said as he casually aimed the gun at the three body parts. \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last choice, he pulled the trigger as a bolt surged out and headed straight for...</span></div></div>",

Her head went from tiny to pea-sized as she looked at herself in the mirror. Her ears were like giant towers and felt quite heavy to keep raised with her muscles having also shrunk. She watched as her collar now blocked both sides of her vision as she sunk deeper into her shirt. She squeaked slightly as her neck now felt rather empty, when it reality it was just supporting a head that was 1/4th its usual size. Even her gasps of surprise sounded tiny as Judy brought up a paw to compare and found to her shock that she could fit the entirety of her head in the middle of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">...Okay,</font>\" she spoke in an even higher pitched voice. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">So, clearly it works on the same spot twice.

One more. Just one more, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, however, had had enough laughing at her expense and wasn't about to let the fox have his way, even if she was secretly enjoying this a little. With her big feet, she began to march over to him before tripping and pushing into Nick just as he fired the gun again. The bolt of green growing light flew past her head and struck the mirror again before bouncing on the wall behind them and careening straight towards both Nick and Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth tried to move out of the way but the bolt was destined to hit one of them.

Nick!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. The green beam struck Judy again right in the butt, growing her already sizeable caboose to monstrous proportions. Judy could feel what was left of her pants begin to rip and tear apart as the split in the seat widened to hold a bottom four times the size it was supposed to be. She was getting so big that her butt was beginning to make the bed rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nick was quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sly fox quickly slipped out from under the mattress and hopped atop of the bed, pressing down on it with his weight. Judy felt her butt press down as the weight of it and the bed wedged her against the floor. Nick had trapped her as he spun the ray around in his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" said Nick. \"Got you right where I want you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Nick, come on!

Watching Judy squirm beneath him, he had a full view of her inflated butt. And as strange of a sight as it was, he had to admit that he liked what he saw. And with Judy trapped underneath him, he could have all sorts of fun with her. Maybe he would see what would happen if he made her bottom even bigger, eight times its usual size would certainly be a sight. Then again there were other aspects of her he could enhance, with a little coaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe they should just call this quits before their relationship got harmed in the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Nick do?</span></div></div>",

Nick didn't, did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned as her already shredded pants were ripped completely apart as her butt exploded to impossible scales. Only her panties remained, as they somehow kept together and dug into her increasingly large crack.

Her butt looked like it would be more fitting on a hippo or an elephant, there was simply no way it could be natural on a bunny like her. And yet, there it was.

The red beam struck Judy right below her massive butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her pants already completely torn up and falling apart, it was rather bizarre to observe them suddenly becoming too small for her legs. Judy kicked and kicked her gigantic feet as they slowly grew too heavy to hold up. She had guessed what Nick had done as her oversized feet flopped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick continued to watch in delight as Judy's legs shriveled up into the mass of mass that was her bottom. Soon enough, all that remained were a few little ankles attaching her rump to her feet as Nick slipped off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I change my mind,\" said Nick as he played with the gun while Judy struggled. \"Why don't you try and stand up now, Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grunted and tried to move her legs, though that was now quite hard to do considering her butt now pretty much constituted her entire lower body not helped by her giant feet. She had to use her arms, which she found could almost reach her toes now without even stretching for them. She pushed off the ground with her paws, sitting on her supersized seat. She tried to stand but she couldn't as she realized her entire apartment suddenly looked a whole lot bigger than it had been moments ago. This was because with her legs halved in size, she had lost six inches in height, making her 3/4 her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked in the mirror and let out a squeaky gasp. She was basically a giant butt with big feet, barely any legs to speak of.

Judy tried to hold up her much bigger paw but lost the strength to do so for too long and let it dangle at her side. Her arm finished shrinking by then, leaving her with a stunted and lopsided appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" said Nick as he aimed the gun at her right this time. \"Let's even you out, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Nick...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her protest fell on deaf ears as her other arm went through the same process before limply falling to her side. Judy tried fruitlessly to reach up for the gun still but even when she could summon the strength to raise her arms, they didn't even reach past her ears now. The sleeves of her uniform were loose and empty.

As she balanced on her over-sized feet and adjusted to her new center of gravity, Nick offered up the ray gun to her. His finger off the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll play fair. I got you a bunch of times with it already, it's only fair that you get me. We'll alternate. And to prove I mean well, I give you one free shot against me.

He meant every thing he had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time Judy really had a chance to get a good look at the gun now that she knew what it did. Through all the craziness, she hadn't noticed that the G and S knob wasn't the only thing on the device. There were other details. One such thing was a switch of sorts with the overarching label of \"Focus.\" It seemed to be able to be flipped at various intervals with their own labels embedded into metal. Each seemed to read various degrees of whatever \"Focus\" meant, from \"very precise\" to \"precise\" to \"moderate\" to \"sectional\" to \"full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device was set in the middle at \"moderate.\" Judy was curious and Nick was willing to be her test subject, at least for one shot.

So, Judy switched the device's setting over in the opposite direction, one notch from \"moderate\" to \"precise.\" After that Judy had the choice of growing or shrinking. She looked up at Nick's oversized ears and almost thought he looked like a bunny, if she squinted. That's when she had an idea as she turned the dial to \"S\" before aiming the gun at Nick's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho, I see,\" he said, figuring out the trajectory of the gun. \"Getting a little revenge with the shrunken head thing, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Not exactly,</font>\" Judy replied as she fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red beam blasted from the gun and struck Nick right on the nose. The fox was known for his big mouth, so Judy figured cutting it down to size a little wouldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick expected to feel a sense of pressure all around his skull but was surprised when it was only his jaw that was feeling tingly. He watched as his nose began to recede into his face as his whole mouth was being pulled back into his head. His long fox muzzle no longer felt so long anymore, it could barely even be called a snout. Nick glanced to the mirror and saw his reflection with long ears and flatter face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see what you were going for,\" he said. \"Trying to make me feel like a bunny, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">More or less,</font>\" Judy grinned with her tiny head. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Turn around, I'll make your tail match.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wasn't in a hurry to make even more alterations to his body like this, but it was good to see Judy enjoying herself with it, so for her sake he did as was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike a rabbit's fluffy tail, Nick's fox tail was quite long. It took Judy four zaps of the gun to make it just about the right size. Nick watched in the mirror as it looked like his beautiful tail was getting sucked into the seat of his pants, getting smaller and smaller until it was a fraction of its old size. No bigger than a bunny's tail as he tried wiggling it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is certainly different,\" he said. \"Though I make a tall bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I can fix that.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hold on a minute, Carrots. I'd like to know how you managed to shrink my mouth and not my whole head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">There's a switch,</font>\" she held up the ray gun to him. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">See? I turned it to precise, so it must have let me focus more on specific parts of your body. I imagine 'very precise' would do that even more so.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what would the opposite do? This 'full' setting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I'd imagine the opposite. Maybe affect the whole body in one shot.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in too deep for Nick not to be persuaded. He grabbed the ray gun and fiddled with the settings until they were on full as he prepared to blast one of them. But who and with what? Nick aimed and shot...</span></div></div>",

He knew exactly what he was doing, having set the power to full and keeping it on shrink, as he felt his whole body tingle and the apartment looking a tiny bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick did a little math in his head. The last time he measured himself, he was 90.1 centimeters or just a hair under three feet tall. How the ray gun seemed to work is that it either doubled or halved the size of whatever it targeted. Therefore, it stood to reason that by by firing the shrink ray at himself for the full blast, his new height would be 45 centimeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow shrink as he had time to gently put the ray gun down on the desk before he could feel his clothes start to loosen. His pants were the first things to go as they fell limply at his waist. Nick turned to face Judy, who was watching him with surprise and not looking up at him nearly as much as she used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Carrots?\" Nick asked, his own voice a little higher now. \"I thought you said I made for a tall bunny. How about now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy stood back awestruck as the once towering fox went from bigger than her ears, to his chin at her head, to seeing him eye to eye. When he dropped an inch shorter than her, Judy couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Nick, it was like the world around him was slowly growing bigger, when he knew in his mind it was he who was getting smaller. After the initial shock from the ray gun, it felt like his whole body was getting compressed into a smaller and smaller box. Though it wasn't an unpleasant feeling, it was just like someone was putting a gentle pressure on his shoulder and squeezing him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing Judy's height, Nick finally let his pants drop to the floor as his green shirt covered him up. Though he wore a smile, he was actually starting to get a little worried. The shrinking didn't seem to be slowing down. After no longer coming up to Judy's tiny chin, he had to wonder just how small he'd get or if he had miscalculated the effects of a full shrink blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final result of the full blast would leave Nick...</span></div></div>",

The ray gun had done exactly what he expected it to, meaning it was predictable and safe to keep using. Though as he looked up at Judy, he noted that he barely came up her chest now, making the bunny look quite giant indeed. In fact the whole apartment looked significantly bigger as Nick adjusted to the fact that he was half his usual size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Don't suppose you'd have any clothes that fit?</font>\" Nick asked as he held up his shirt. \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Not sure that this is going to cut it.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Well, you do make a cute, little red bunny.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Hey now, don't call me cute.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy giggled as she glanced to the ray gun left on her desk.

Despite her tiny head, Nick seemed to enjoy making her bigger.

This time at her legs specifically. She knew with what was about to happen, she was going to destroy her pants but they had already been ruined at this point. And she was starting to not care at all, even at the prospect of being naked in front of Nick as she pulled the trigger and the room lit up with a green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was immediately overtaken by a rising sensation as it felt like her legs were being stretched out like clay. She could feel the ankle wraps of her leggings begin to strain before they snapped altogether. As Judy looked down, she watch as Nick shrunk smaller and smaller, when in reality it was her rising. By six inches, in fact. Which that didn't seem much that was actually about a quarter of her total body height as her legs lengthened and ripped apart her pants. They filled out enough that soon her feet didn't look so big on her anymore, though her butt was still a size bigger than it normally was and her tail remained small. At least Judy could move around more easily as she stomped around the room looking for the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Wow,</font>\" she laughed at her reflection. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I look like something out of a fun house mirror. Talk about being bottom heavy.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer torso, her arms, and especially her head all looked rather tiny on massive legs. But she was at least starting to even out. And looking very, very huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gulped as he stared up at Judy. Her legs were about as big as he was, making him below her waist level in height. As Judy kicked off her completely shredded pants, she was standing entirely in her uniform shirt and underwear which had remained intact through all the growth somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">What do you think, mister bunny fox?</font>\" she teased him with the gun. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Would you like to see more of me?</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then dropped the gun into Nick's tiny paws as he fumbled with it for a moment.

There was a knob with a number marked on it, presently set to \"2\" but it looked like that number could grow all the way up to \"99.\" There were also other settings like fractions too, which Nick guessed was for shrinking. But that wasn't what he or she wanted. Seeing Judy with such exaggerated proportions was certainly doing something for him. What about having her a little bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a rabbit, Judy had always been lacking somewhat in the chest department. She more than made up for it in the rear end, of course. But sometimes a fox just wanted a little more. With as steady a paw as he could manage, he carefully turned the dial up to \"8\" before aiming it squarely at Judy's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">You might want to take off your vest, Carrots.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy raised an eye but did as was asked, removing her black chestpiece so that only her blue uniform shirt remained underneath. When that was done, she splayed her arms out as her toes curled welcoming in the new change to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA more intense green beam struck her hard as she let out a gasp and her paws immediately went for her chest the moment the beam disappeared. She grabbed hold of something more fleshy than she was used to followed by the feeling of her shirt constricting as she looked down and saw two mounds growing out from her bosom. That's when she realized she was growing breasts and ones far larger than twice their usual size, like every shot they had done so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">What did you do?</font>\" Judy asked as she unzipped the collar of her shirt for more breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Oh, just played with the settings a little. I figured since you were always a bit flat I could up the dosage to eight times the size.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Eight?</font></b>\" Judy moaned. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Oh, cheese and crackers...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts surged forward with no cloth impeding them anymore. Soon they were so big that they didn't even fit in Judy's paws anymore. She looked down and saw cleavage. <i>Cleavage</i>. On a bunny. Though with her long legs, smaller head, and big butt/breasts she certainly didn't look much like a bunny anymore. Save for her ears and tail, of course. By the time her chest had stopped growing, her boobs were easily larger than her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick hungrily looked up at her. Watching Judy feel her new body up all over was certainly an arousing experience as he slowly lowered the gun. Judy looked down at him from beyond her new breasts. She bit at her lip as she leaned over, letting her boobs bounce freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">You like them?</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick realized he had been staring at her chest and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Want a closer look?</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy laughed as she decided to...</span></div></div>",

I just saw a, um, spider which is why I shrieked. What, uh, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said her dad. \"We were in the neighborhood with a local farmers convention, Jude.

The last thing she needed was them thinking this was some scary thing about the city, that it made a rabbit's feet grow twice their usual size. When really it was whatever this strange ray gun was that she had bought at the antique store. Judy didn't have much time to look at it with her parents waiting patiently outside for her, so she quickly snatched up and tucked it into her utility belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's bigger concern was her feet and how to hide them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went digging in her closet for something that might work before settling on the biggest pair of slippers she could find. Even so, with her feet doubled in their usual length and width, it was a great struggle to force them into the fuzzy pink slippers. It felt so cramped and Judy couldn't even wiggle her toes. Somehow she managed and though her feet still looked swollen, they didn't seem quite as big with the slippers covering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Judy said opening the door for her parents again. \"Sorry about that. So, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much, Jude,\" said her dad as he stepped inside the apartment. \"Like I said, we were in the neighborhood and though 'hey, might as well see how Judy's doing.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the job at the police department? Not leaping feet first into things, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, uh, not exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was the usual occurrence whenever her parents came to visit. They'd all sit around Judy's much too small apartment just talk about life on the farm. And Judy might have found it all terribly interesting if there wasn't a more concerning matter on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet were feeling cramped. Worse, she could detect that slipper was starting to fall apart at the seams just trying to hold it in. It wouldn't be long until her feet just bursted out in front of her parents. Besides all that, Judy really wanted to give the ray gun a better look, given it was what caused all this. Judy's paw continually brushed against it, trying to see if she could feel something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was bound to happen during this visit, it was only a matter of time. The only question was what?</span></div></div>",

I need to use the restroom for a sec. Do you mind, Jude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, not at all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Stu excused himself to the bathroom, Bonnie turned her attention to the mirror in Judy's room and began to apply some makeup for the dinner. This left Judy the briefest of moments to have a closer look at the ray gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't just the \"G\" and \"S\" switch on it, but other doodads now that Judy could get a brief examination of it. Other knobs and and elements made their home on device. One such knob was labeled curiously with numbers on it. Currently, it was set to \"1\" but there was a high range of numbers like that on a locker, though some of the numbers were fractions too like \"1/4\" or \"1/2.\" Without thinking, Judy set the device to \"1/2\" but also accidentally knocked the trigger in the process. The green beam from the fun surged forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie had her back to her daughter and wasn't paying any attention to what was happening behind her. What she did notice was the slight pinch in her bottom as the jeans she was wearing were suddenly feeling rather tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch,\" she said turning around. \"Jude, what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had already quickly hidden the gun under her bed sheets the moment she realized what she had done. She stared stunned at the fact that her mom's butt had swollen up just as her feet had, only not nearly as big in size. Perhaps that had to do with the setting of the knob set to \"1/2.\" At a glance, her mom's butt had grown a half of its previous size larger. While this made her mother's bottom big, it wasn't as noticeable as Judy's feet. Thinking quickly, Judy clapped the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Judy replied. \"Horsefly. Pesky things have been all over the building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie hummed and adjusted her pants. Why were they feeling so snug on her all of a sudden? She couldn't describe it but her bottom felt weightier than usual, but she didn't really notice anything. Nor did Stu as he finally exited the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, Jude. We're heading off unless you'd like to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy thought for a minute. This gun now had her curiosity and going out might give her more opportunities to test it out with people. But then again, that was more opportunities to get caught to. Nick might have an interest in whatever this was. But then it also might just be safer to stay at home and experiment on herself. Jude decided to...</span></div></div>",

Stu, let me ask you something. Do I look...Bigger to you in any department?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?\" Stu's eyes ran up and down his wife. \"Hmm, now that you mention it a little. Maybe too much of Gideon's pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shut the door closed behind them and slumped down in relief. She loved her parents to death, but they could be exhausting especially when she was trying to hide something. Now that she was alone, Judy kicked off her slippers and sighed in relief as her giant feet now had the opportunity to breathe again. Then she hopped over the bed and pulled out the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been nothing but trouble,\" she said to the device. \"Now, how do I fix my feet with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy first turned the knob so it was back to its original setting of \"1.\" Then she glanced over to the switch with the \"G\" and \"S\" labels. If her theory was correct then by alternating the settings, she could cause something to either shrink or grow. With the switch set to \"S\" Judy held her breath and aimed down at her gigantic feet to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time a red beam of light blasted out from the gun as Judy kept steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to watch her toes begin to recede back into her foot as her feet became smaller and smaller. She smiled, it was working! Within seconds, her feet were completely back to their original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief,\" she said. \"I'll have to give mom a zap of the gun later to shrink her butt back to normal then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Judy was reluctant to put the gun down as she looked at herself in the mirror. What she had here was a device that could grow and shrink body parts at will. In theory...She could change her appearance entirely and give herself any sort of enhancement she wanted. Judy gazed down at her chest. She had always been rather flat in that department and had always wondered what it might be like to have more...Generous proportions when it came to a bosom. Something like that certainly might make Nick notice. Though was it a wise thing to do? Surely a dangerous item like this should go to the ZPD for safe keeping immediately. Though it was meant to be a gift for Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy thought for a moment before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

She always wondered what it would be like to have breasts. Her paws moved on their own as they switched the gun's setting to \"G.\" It was just a temporary thing, right? As she had already proven with her feet, she could reverse the changes any time she wanted. Before she knew it, her finger had already pulled the trigger and a green beam fired from the gun straight into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy felt like the wind had been knocked out of her as she dropped the gun to the floor and clutched at her vest. The black vest she wore was designed to be form fitting and solid enough to protect from ballistics. Now it was beginning to feel a little <i>too </i>tight as Judy found it hard to breathe. She scrambled with the straps keeping the vest in place until she undid them and let the protective piece fall next to the ray gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment her chest escaped the vest, it flopped forward with no real resistance as two distinct mounds dangled down without a bra for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy gasped as she clasped her new additions while her toes curled. The process had left them very sensitive and large, though not too large. Given how small they previously were, Judy now looked like a bunny who happened to get lucky in the busty department. Each was big enough to fill up the palm of her paw. Judy hopped up and down for a bit, feeling them bounce with her. They were so <i>jiggly</i>. And she looked amazing too! The new breasts had given her body something of an hourglass shape, rather than being solely bottom heavy like she was used to. Judy wondered what Nick might think if he saw her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy glanced at the floor and noticed the remote still there. Then again...If this was all reversible why not have a little fun with the enhancements?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Judy do?</span></div></div>",

He noticed a pair of long ears like a rabbit's too, as Stephanie held up the face to reveal it had empty eye sockets and a gaping mouth with two buck teeth on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard of spending a day in someone else's skin?\" Stephanie asked him. \"Well, this will help you do it quite literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...That's a costume, right? You didn't just murder someone in the back, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! This is a top of the line disguise tool that lets the wearer <i>feel </i>like another species of mammal. All you have to do is strip down and put it on and let the magic happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then offered it to Nick for him to inspect. It surprised him at just how warm and soft the wad of fur was, almost like it was a living and breathing creature in his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh huh,\" he said after looking it over a few times. \"Well, I don't think this is quite what I had in mind nor in my budget...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing I'm so confident in it that I'm willing to let you take a test drive in it for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gestured to the changing room right in the corner of the shop.

Both the goat and the suit were giving him strange vibes as he stepped inside the booth and closed the curtains behind him. He then began stripping down just as requested by Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how am I supposed to get into this thing?\" he asked, holding up the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was closer to it, he was noticing just how small it was compared to his foxy form and the only hole large enough seemed to be the gaping mouth.

Was he crazy or did the suit look curiously like the very person he was trying to get to know better? How was this supposed to help exactly? Was the intention to scare her or...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spend a day in someone else's skin,\" Nick muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPure curiosity now possessed Nick as he pulled open the mouth of the suit so it was wide enough to begin fitting his feet inside. The first two things he noticed were just how tight and how warm the mass of fur was. Despite feeling very constricting, the suit seemed to expand with his leg as it worked its way down to the feet. Bunny feet were some big shoes to fill though, and while the rest of the suit felt tight, his toes had some freedom at the bottom. Then he worked his other leg inside as he pulled it up to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing to the mirror, it looked like some bunny creature was devouring him in a comical fashion. Nick huffed a laugh as he worked on fitting his arms in next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more of the suit he worn, the more compressed he felt like he was wearing something made of latex. Though the skin had a durable pull to it, like it was a big blanket. It hugged to his body, keeping his foxy frame as he wiggled his tail into position. Then his arms. All that was left was the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching out the mask, he managed to fit the nose over his long snout, much too long to look anything like a bunny. His ears shifted into place inside the head as he looked at himself in the mirror. He looked like a mutation between fox and rabbit, with the grey fur and ears of a bunny but his old, lanky body shape and predator-like face. That fact disappointed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is this just supposed to do anything else,\" he called out to Stephanie. \"Or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hit the switch on the back of the neck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't even noticed that at the base of the head, just before the spine, there was a metal switch buried under the folds of the fur. Without a thought, Nick flicked in and was immediately overtaken by the most intense feeling he had ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like his entire body had turned to jelly as the already tight suit felt several degrees more tighter somehow. Nick struggled to keep himself upright against the wall as he made a new discover. The changing room was getting bigger, though that wasn't exactly the truth. He was getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery part of his body was being crushed and pressed down as Nick watched his eyeline shrink closer and closer to the floor. Before his very eyes, his long snout began to press itself closer to his face as his teeth rearranged themselves. The only parts of him that seemed to be growing at all were his feet and his rear, which he felt swell as the world pressed down on his shoulders. He glanced over to the mirror as he watched in awe as the fox wearing a bunny suit looked more and more like a certain bunny with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the intense transformation, Nick realized that he had dropped almost 1/3 of his usual height and he was staring at a perfect, naked clone of Judy albeit with green eyes instead of her usual purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That worked, right\" Stephanie called back to him. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gathered his wits and determined that he felt...</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed much bigger than it had just a few moments ago. This was especially true for Stephanie, who was now more of a towering presence than she had been before as she stood over him with her hooves on her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" replied Nick as he took a moment to run a paw down his new body. \"I really look and sound just like her, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down to the last detail! Speaking of, you might want to put some clothes on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick hadn't even considered that, as wearing the skin felt almost like wearing a suit. He could still feel his own body trapped within, cramped and crushed into a shape that it wasn't used to. But it also wasn't uncomfortable either, almost like he was rolled up into a ball. Though he recognized that he couldn't exactly go walking around as Judy in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grabbed his old outfit left in the changing room, which only highlighted just how much he had shrunk. He was able to wear his old green shirt as a dress particularly and the pants had to be held up by his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first thing's first, I should probably get some clothes that fit me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, good plan,\" Stephanie commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do I owe you for the suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at all, my friend. Call this a free sample. Something tells me you'll be back for business soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough that assumed a lot, Nick had to confess it was not unfounded. He could see a dozen scenarios in the future where he might need a disguise. And if she had suits for mammals of all sorts then he could go posing as anyone. The thought was almost as exciting as what he was going to do posing as Judy. The ideas made his toes curl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm off then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Just remember, you need to flick the switch to get your form back to normal before removing the suit. Otherwise your body will be stuck in the shape of a rabbit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Nick was off as he stepped out onto the street, hoisting up clothes that were much too big for his bunny body. It was incredibly exciting to see the whole city from a new perspective, but he commanded himself to focus on the task at paw. He needed some clothes to complete the disguise. And he had options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go to Judy's apartment, who was out and about at the moment. He'd have plenty to choose from there. There was also going to the station where he could get one of her police uniforms. Or he could always just go clothes shopping on his own and buy something Judy might never wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he choose?</span></div></div>",

And the station would be too public if Nick were to just waltz in there disguised as Judy with only his old clothes. What would the other officers think of that? So, his only option then was to get some fresh clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's a good thing the suit was free,\" Nick commented as he checked his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wasn't much for fashion, as if that wasn't evident by his own tastes in clothing. But when it came to this matter, there was something exciting at the thought of having to dress Judy up. There was an evil smile on his face as he turned down the street and headed for a store he knew for a fact that Judy had never once stepped foot in before. Victigeria's Secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had several girlfriends over the years, Nick was quite familiar with shopping at the deluxe female's store, as he passed by the posters of a tiger posing in underwear with bedroom eyes. But he had never actually shopped there for himself. It was the habit of most boyfriends to attend as he glanced around to see the various couples. But he was there to pick out something that Judy would never in her life be caught wearing, though would look good on her all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick started with the basics, getting fitted by a friendly employee who didn't once question why he was wearing oversized clothes. With his sizes determined, he got to work picking out a lace bra and matching panties. Next he grabbed a tiny black dress in Judy's measurements that would highlight her butt as well as be comfortable enough to walk around it. Then he went to the makeup section of the store where they had an employee offering to apply everything for a price. After haggling a bit, Nick walked away with eyeliner, lip stick, and eye shadow all properly in place to make him look gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, Carrots,\" he said, winking in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was having quite a lot of fun posing as Judy so far, the world was different when it saw him as a bunny girl. Everything was bigger, for one, but people also treated him nicer. What's more was that he was getting attention too, but it so happened one such eye on him was someone he knew.

He turned around to be greeted by the largest cheetah he had ever seen. That had in part to do with the fact that he was still getting used to being at Judy's short stature. But Clawhauser was also a pretty hefty sized cat, which made him all the more larger from Nick's stunted perspective. He was barely at knee level with the cat as Clawhauser leaned over to get a closer look at Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it!\" Clawhauser squealed. \"Oh em goodness, what are you doing here?

To each their own then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing here then? And why are you all dressed up like that. I've never seen you wear makeup before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know.

I've seen the way you two look at each other. We all have! So, spill it. Is this some plan of yours to get his attention?

So, of course I want to help! For the sake of love as much as making enough money to buy tickets for the next Gazelle concert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought for a moment. He hadn't considered potentially using this Judy suit for the sake of profit. Maybe he could work it out so that he'd be able to make a quick buck and buy even more suits like this to play around with.

However, this carrot isn\u2019t a normal carrot. It\u2019s a magic item I found in a mysterious forest and it has some extraordinary properties. It should enable you and Judy to understand each other like never before,\u201d Stephanie explained with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn\u2019t believe what the goat was saying. He didn\u2019t believe in magic anyway, but he could feel this shop and its objects had something special.<br>\r\nIf the goat weren\u2019t lying, this carrot could be an interesting experience for him and Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, your \u2018special\u2019 carrot intrigues me! How much does it cost?\u201d the fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI offer you this item for free!

He supposed it had to do with the unspoken attraction he had to Judy. Being in her body was actually a little exciting. Being a former hustler, he had gotten used to the idea of acting and having to pretend to be someone else to open doors. While he never <i>literally </i>had to be someone else before, it wasn't much different than that. From an outsider's perspective, no one would be able to tell the difference that it was him in here. He could completely pose as Judy, he certainly knew her habits and quirks well enough from being up close to her all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sat up for a moment, taking in the strange sensations and feelings that came with his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, his sense of smell was greatly reduced. He felt like he had a cold from how little scents he was picking up with his bunny nose. However, the ears more than made up for it in how they were able to pick up sounds from all over the apartment complex. He could actually hear one of Judy's neighbors singing in the shower all the way on the other side of the building, if he focused hard enough. There was also the matter of being in a female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Judy was lacking in the chest department, she more than made up for in in the lower body which was mostly muscle. Nick felt light as he skipped across the floorboards effortlessly. The balance without his fox tail was different, but his body seemed to move naturally on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness for small miracles,\" he said to himself as he looked in the mirror at Judy, still wearing her pajamas. \"Well, I guess we just gotta start the day as normal and let whatever this is work itself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst case scenario, he could always go back to Stephanie's shop and have her solve things. It was their day off from work, so he had plenty of time to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that means getting dressed first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging was a little awkward in that, though it was technically his own body, he wanted to give Judy as much privacy as he could. So, he closed his eyes when he removed his shirt and pants, fiddling around the dresser for some jeans and a simple shirt he had seen Judy wear on multiple occasions. When he opened his eyes again, she was standing there dressed and ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not looking forward to having to go to the bathroom,\" he muttered to himself. \"Well, Judy Hopps, we're ready to pretend to be you for the day, aren't we? Shall we head to Stephanie's Shop first and get more details on what's happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he nodded to himself and started for the door, but not before there was a knock. Nick frowned, he didn't know Judy was expecting company. But this would be a good opportunity to put on his acting chops and pretend to be her if it was someone who required it. As it happened, the person(s) knocking at the door happened to be...</span></div></div>",

And to be more convincing, I offer you this watch for free,\u201d replied Stephanie, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was pleased with his good deal. He knew he would come back to this shop someday.<br>\r\nHe then left and decided to try the watch and its ghost powers on\u2026</span></div></div>",

How can I help you today?\"<br>\r\nShe looked very odd, her weird clothing, the jewelry adorning her, and over all her huge size, she was even bigger than Clawhauser.

Consider it... a good luck charm of sorts.\"<br>\r\nHer answer sounded a bit cryptic and the cheetah was clearly not convinced.<br>\r\n\"Tell you what honey, take it now, and you can pay me later only if you're satisfied with the result.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...Okay... Thank you... Should I leave you my name or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear, a cute face like yours is hard to forget. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved him goodbye and he left a bit weirded out.

If you're brave enough to enter her shop, you may find that what your heart desire's is a little bit of change in your life.
