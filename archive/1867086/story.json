            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exploring one of Sunnydale's dozen-something cemeteries usually involved finding a vampire--at least one vampire--in every one.  Buffy had done a quick five-minute sweep of this one and had found nothing.  She didn't hear anything unusual or see any signs of violence.  Satisfied, she headed for the exit, ready for home, bed . . . and probably homework that she had forgotten about until just now.<br>\r\nActually, this patrol had been unusually unproductive.  She dusted a few vampires earlier but things had been so quiet afterwards that Willow and Xander had gone home and she spent the rest of the evening relaxing, strolling from crypt to crypt and finding nothing.<br>\r\nAs she left movement caught her eye towards some graves away from the exit.  It was a round, dark shape, somewhat humanoid, but awkwardly lumbering over something on the ground.  Disgusting gulping sounds came from the shape.  It didn't look like a vampire, but Buffy still readied her stake and walked towards it.<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" she said, \"I'd hate for this night to be a total bust.\"<br>\r\nThe creature heard as she approached, and stood tall on its two flabby legs.  At first, Buffy thought it was fat, but when it lumbered towards her the thing was more of a giant, walking water balloon, filled with some kind of gelatinous slime that gurgled around as it walked.  Its hands were like big useless paws.  It's head more of a large bump coming off of its smooth shoulders, with a round mouth with a few dozen tiny sharp teeth, and two black, beady eyes.<br>\r\nIt pointed a pudgy finger at Buffy as it spoke in what she assumed was anger.<br>\r\n\"Glurb glooog gozareth!\" it said, or some approximate of that in a slow, deep voice.  Spittle of blue slime flew from its mouth at it spoke, flying far enough to spatter Buffy.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't speak ugly blob, but maybe if you slow down and speak louder I'll understand what you're saying.\"  With one fluid movement she had her stake away and was leaping off a tombstone, kicking the demon in its chest before it could react.  It was too soft, though.  It reeled backwards, rolling its arms to keep balance, but Buffy was hurled to the ground rather than being able to launch herself back to a standing position like she normally would.<br>\r\n\"A-goorga!\" the thing said, apparently even angrier.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, agoorga's right,\" Buffy leaped to her feet.<br>\r\nThe thing bellowed, slime flying from its mouth.  Buffy grimaced as it hit her again.<br>\r\n\"Um, gross.  You might--\"<br>\r\n\"Slorsh!\" it yelled, opening its mouth wide and spraying a bucketful of the slime all over Buffy.  She blocked some with her arms, and dodged backwards to avoid most of it.  Her good fighting jeans might be ruined after that, she thought.<br>\r\n\"Hey!  What'd I ever--\" she started, turning back to the creature.  It was already on her, the slime nothing but a distraction.  She threw up an elbow to hit it in the face and it bit her arm, creating tiny puncture wounds that didn't really hurt that much.  Although, it ruined her sweater.  That was an entire ensemble ruined by this thing.<br>\r\nThe elbow thrust did connect, though, with the creature's head flying backwards, taking its body with it.<br>\r\n\"Shlubba guga!\" it said, awkwardly trying to remain standing.<br>\r\n\"Ouch!  Watch what you do with those things,\" Buffy said, kneeing the demon in its giant, blobby gut as it fell backwards.  She stepped off of it and came down hard on its head.  It apparently had no bones, since Buffy squished it flat, disgusting blue slime exploded out all over her boots.<br>\r\nShe looked down as the demon stopped moving, what with its head smashed.<br>\r\n\"And there go the boots,\" she said.  The creature's body quivered and began shrinking, the slime that filled it evaporating, or vanishing.  Within seconds all that was left was skin as Buffy stood over the body, holding her tiny arm wounds.<br>\r\n\"Not sure how something like that survived in the wild,\" she said, preparing to leave.  This body was clearly going to take care of itself and wouldn't need disposal.<br>\r\nAs Buffy walked out of the cemetery she felt queasy and blamed the bite, wondering if it was venomous.  Her stomach was groaning, feeling sick and full.  It came on her so suddenly that she had to stop and steady herself on the cemetery gate.  She hunched over, he arm wrapped around her stomach.  She moaned as pain and pressure grew inside her.</span></div></div>",

She didn't both putting on anything more than sweatpants and a tank top to go downstairs for breakfast.  Her slayer energy, she figured, just wasn't with her today.<br>\r\nThings hadn't been easy lately.  Her friends were still getting used to her return after Angel's death.  The new slayer Faith was less than helpful despite her noninfectious enthusiasm.  It's no wonder she was so tired and sluggish.<br>\r\nDawn was already awake, almost done eating three of the large pile of pancakes on the table.<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's mom?\" Buffy asked as she got herself a plate.<br>\r\n\"She's at the gallery,\" Dawn said.  \"It's like 11:00.\"<br>\r\nBuffy's stomach growled, making her realize just how hungry she was.  She sat down and, without a second thought, just pulled the entire stack of pancakes to her.<br>\r\n\"Hey, some of those are mine!\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n\"You have yours,\" Buffy said, her mouth already full with her first bite while she poured syrup on with her free hand.  She didn't even both to cut them, just cutting the entire stack into large bite fulls with her fork and shoving them in her face.  She was ravenous.  Her mind suddenly fixated on the task of getting these pancakes into her stomach.<br>\r\n\"I'm going over to Tiffany's,\" Dawn said.  She spoke some more, probably detailing her plans for the day, but Buffy wasn't listening.  She was eating.  And eating.  And eating.<br>\r\nIn less than a minute she had demolished the stack of a ten pancakes.  Dawn rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"You're not even listening to me,\" she said and stood up.<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" Buffy swallowed.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing today?\" Dawn said, trying to take an interest.  She was getting old enough now that Buffy's slayer duties were holding more than a casual interest to her.  She was thinking that soon, maybe, Buffy would let her in, let her help.<br>\r\n\"I dunno'.  I'll check to see if Giles has anything for me to do,\" Buffy stood up and went to the fridge.  There wasn't any food readily available, just cold cuts, drinks, ingredients.  If she wanted food, she'd either have to eat or drink it straight, or prepare it herself.  She was just so hungry right now.  Her stomach, full from breakfast, stilled growled at her, demanding more food.  And she wanted it now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rational part of Buffy's brain told her she had just had a full breakfast.  She couldn't possibly be this hungry.  A drink was in order to wash it down.  That's what her rumbling stomach wanted, she thought.  There was a gallon of milk, almost full.  As Dawn watched with part awe and part disgust, Buffy opened the jug and began drinking.<br>\r\nAnd drinking.<br>\r\nAnd drinking.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes as she poured the milk into her mouth.  She felt her full, growling stomach growing cool as it filled with milk.  She rubbed it gently as she drank, the rhythmic glug glug glug sound hypnotic.  Her stomach whirled and growled under her hand, growing fuller with each gulp.<br>\r\n\"Um, Buffy?\" she heard her sister say, but ignored her.  The very act of filling her stomach seemed to put her into a trance.  She only started coming out of it as she approached the end of the carton.  A dull ache was spreading through her cold, stuffed stomach.  She became conscious that her hand was no longer feeling the flat stomach she was used to, but instead a gentle curve.  A hard, bulging curve that pressed out into her sweat pants, riding her shirt up enough to expose her taut tummy to the world.  It was starting to hurt now.  She grasped her stomach with her free hand harder and moaned.  She couldn't stop until she finished the carton.  It didn't make any sense, but that's how she felt.<br>\r\nFinally, nearly an entire carton of milk was gone, vanished into her tiny, impossibly full stomach.<br>\r\nShe belched so loudly it could be heard throughout the house.  She wiped her mouth and wobbled in place.  She put the empty carton back in the fridge and looked down to see what her hand was already feeling.<br>\r\nHer tummy peaked out from beneath her shirt.  It was pushing out several inches, a hard, alien dome on her otherwise tight, slim body.<br>\r\nShe pressed it gently with both hands.  The cold feeling was dissipating, replaced with an uncomfortable, almost painful sensation of a belly stretched beyond human limits.<br>\r\nShe belched again, unable to speak yet.<br>\r\n\"What the heck, Buffy?\" Dawn was more annoyed than mystified.  She was used to her sister occasionally showing bizarre bursts of appetite, which she attributed to her slayer nature.<br>\r\n\"Why did I do that?\" Buffy asked, turning unsteadily to her sister, both hands still firmly on her engorged tummy.<br>\r\nWith difficulty she lowered herself into the chair and leaned back.  She winced both from pain and from the sight of her bloated stomach sticking out.<br>\r\nThen it growled again, followed by another giant belch.  Buffy moaned, leaning her head back.  She was still hungry.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\nBuffy had to gather her thoughts before she answered.</span></div></div>",

Finally deciding Buffy was just being weird again, Dawn decided to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  I'm going to Tiffany's.  Be back later,\" Dawn waved as she turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy stared blankly ahead as she slouched in the kitchen chair.  She knew something was off, but she just couldn't couldn't put her finger on it.  Even with her hands cradling the swollen gut full of milk and waffles she was finding it hard to wrap her head around why she was feeling so strange, sluggish, and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even realized it, Buffy had stood up and opened the fridge again.  The cool air tickled the exposed skin of her stomach as she opened the door.  With one hand on her hip, her other searched for food.  Any food.  There were lunch meats.  She could make a sandwich.  That takes too long, best to just eat this bologna out of the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How am I still hungry again?</i>  The question her mind asked didn't register with her body.  She took the lunch meat and bit into it, chewing little and swallowing fast.  She couldn't get it in her fast enough.  No more bologna?  Well, there's ham--wait, that was barely half a pound, it's already finished.  Milk?  Already drank it.  There's bread in the breadbox, that counts as food.  It'll be like eating a sandwich in parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took several steps to the bread Buffy's mind was finally able to think clearly when the food wasn't in her hands and traveling down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" she said out loud, since thinking didn't seem to be working.  She stopped walking and pressed both hands into her now round, tight belly.  Her naval popped out and her sweatpants were being pushed down by the recent switch to a more pregnant appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is definitely not right,\" Buffy said, willing her hands to remain firmly on her stomach.  She didn't like the feeling one bit, the fullness, the uncomfortable sensation that she wanted to explode just for the relief, but it was keeping her from grabbing more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spell thing.  Got it.  Calling Giles now,\" Buffy didn't even finish the sentence when she realized that, with one hand still rubbing her stomach, the other had grabbed the loaf of bread.  She tore into the plastic wrapping to get at it.  The bland taste filled her mouth, and was leaving her stomach even fuller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a half-squeal, half-whine Buffy found herself already scanning the kitchen for more food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a jar of olives.  Buffy could eat that, and she did, simply emptying it into her mouth, then picking up the ones that fell and eating those, too.  A bottle of ketchup?  That was food, and Buffy's insatiable belly demanded it.  Some mustard next to that.  That container soon emptied completely into Buffy's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So I'm reduced to eating condiments then?</i> Buffy thought, her eyes scanning the kitchen.  She walked, with some discomfort, to the fridge.  She kept hand over her stomach.  It was growing tighter by the second.  She felt her skin stretch around it.  Soon it would be sticking out past her breasts.  She already thought she must looked pregnant, and felt it.  Her back ached a little from the unfamiliar weight up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped open a packet of hot dogs and ate them, one by one, raw.  She grimaced at herself.  They tasted disgusting uncooked, and she felt disgusting eating them, but she simply couldn't stop.  Her body was out of her control.  Every edible thing she saw, she had to eat.  Her stomach churned despite being too full to do anything but sit there like a giant, heavy lump in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy opened the freezer.  Ice cream.  She yanked the top off.  Without getting a spoon she just dug her fingers in and shoveled it into her mouth.  Each swallow was painful as it stretched her tummy further.  This was when Buffy finally gave into panic.  A gallon of ice cream, gone in five minutes.  A bag of frozen peas gone in even less.  The skin over her stomach stretched painfully as she began to feel her hips ache.  She felt a tickling feeling around her belly button.  She reached out to feel it and heard a distinct 'pop' as it pushed itself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her lungs were getting too compressed by her swollen gut to truly scream, Buffy did her best to at least yelp.  She waddled backwards holding her belly in her hands.  It was impossible.  The freezer was completely empty except for some frozen meats.  But there was no way she could eat those.  They'd break her teeth.  She reached for them, and then with a great force of will hurled herself against the counter by the phone.  Before her stomach could groan at her to do otherwise, she dialed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" came Giles' voice over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy croaked out, \"Giles . . . help!\" and then dropped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy?  Buffy?\" she heard, but already her belly was leading her across the kitchen again.  There was still some food left in the fridge, she knew.  She held onto her back as she walked, sticking out her belly like she really was a pregnant woman.  There must be nearly thirty pounds of food in there.  Not a lot of weight for a slayer to lift, but it was a different thing when it was inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay.  Giles is coming.  Just have to hold out until then,</i> she thought, only slightly calmed at the thought.  Her stomach moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I don't explode before then,</i> she thought in panic, knowing that she was already far more stuffed than any regular person could ever be.</span></div></div>",

Vampires wouldn't be out in broad daylight like this.  Demons might be, but everything felt normal.  What they were not expecting to find was Buffy lying on the kitchen floor surrounded by discarded bags, cartons, and crumbs.  She looked asleep but her breathing was heavy, which made sense considering how stuffed she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Giles said softly as he knelt down next to her.  They gathered that she had been eating, but no normal person could eat this much.  No stomach, or the skin around it, could stretch as much as Buffy's had.  She didn't look full, she looked pregnant.  Her stomach towered over her, round and tight.  There were stretch marks forming along her sides, and her belly button had popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to her?\" Xander asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she . . . eat all everything?\" Willow asked unbelieving as she looked at the empty cabinets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy?\" Giles said.  He reached out a hand and touched her stomach.  It was tight, painfully so, and her insides turned with a juicy gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy's eyes shot open with a gasp, she grabbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that hurts!\" she yelled.  Giles yanked his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy struggled to pull herself into a seating position, but only managed to do so halfway by leaning against the fridge.  She blushed despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this happened,\" she aid simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Giles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate it all.  Everything.  I couldn't stop.  I knew I was full, but I just couldn't.  The only thing that stopped was that I think I-bwuuuurp-passed out,\" she moaned and rubbed her stomach.  It hurt just to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should regroup at my house,\" Giles said.  \"Can you stand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy tried.  She gripped the cabinet and stood up, but the weight was too much.  She felt the sides of her stomach straining, as though her stomach as going to fall out.  She yelped in pain and sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I don't think . . .  I don't think I can stand on my own,\" she said, her worry finally showing.  \"What's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, a little help,\" Giles and Willow lifted Buffy.  She had to grip her stomach tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like I'm going to explode,\" she said between breaths and burps, \"Am I going to explode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't think so,\" Giles said as they moved her to the den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think if this is a spell it's taking into account that you'd get this, ah, full,\" Willow said.  \"I think anyone who wasn't a slayer would have passed out from exhaustion before you did.  So, um, yay for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm real impressive,\" Buffy huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did it?\" Xander asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think first we need to stop it,\" Giles said.  Buffy's belly was gurgling and churning loudly.  She winced in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm still hungry, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've had enough,\" Willow said trying to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow and I will get the bottom of this.  Xander, you clean up-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!  really?\" Xander said, looking at the mess.  \"I am in a stabbing mood, not a cleaning one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xander, please just do it,\" Willow said.  \"And maybe leave a note.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Dear Ms. Summers, Daughter fat now.  More news later,''\" Buffy said with what breath she could muster.  She took a blanket from the couch and wrapped it around herself as they passed.  The last thing she wanted was neighborhood rumors about how Joyce's problem child got herself knocked up.  Willow started to helpfully pull her shirt down somewhat, but Buffy yelped and pushed her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too tight to touch,\" she said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three left Xander alone.  He shrugged, and commenced to cleaning as well as he knew how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay me in the back seat,\" Buffy said, \"Having trouble-uurp-bending in the middle right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey complied.  The ride was comfortable for none of them.  Every bump or turn of Giles' car caused her stomach to go into an uproar, and noises weren't pleasant for those just listening either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Buffy, we can fix this.  You'll be good as new and not all stuffed in no time,\" Willow said, although she certainly looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I believe you but just hurry, okay?\" she said, holding her belly as tight as she could.  It was like her insides were struggling to get out, and the weight was causing her hips and back to ache even lying down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In their months together, Willow made Tara feel more special than she ever had before.  She had grown in confidence and assertiveness since they met.  She had gotten over a lot of the hang ups she had from her upbringing.  She was learning to be herself.  She didn't feel so bad about being shy, and didn't mind not being as up to par in her magical studies as Willow was.<br>\r\nStill, Willow was learning a lot.  Her skills were growing each day.  It didn't seem liker her love for Tara was diminishing, but one thing was now causing Tara to doubt herself.  She felt her meek, mousy personality taking over again, and felt even worse at the reason.<br>\r\nTara was gaining weight.<br>\r\nIt was a little at first, as much as any college freshman might.  Since usually wore clothes that didn't show off her figure it wasn't noticable at first.  But now she was outgrowing things.  She was getting a regular potbelly.  Her face was growing puffy, her cheeks bloating up.  Her ass and hips were especially feeling the brunt of her indulgence as she looked in the mirror one day and discovered that she was officially wide.<br>\r\nShe moaned, a pouty expression on her pudgy face.<br>\r\nWillow, still slender, looking beautiful in something as simple as a flowing skirt and t-shirt, looked around the door, smiling.  Tara's heart sank when she saw the smile fade, replaced by an obviously force one.<br>\r\n\"Whats up, sweetie?\" Willow asked entering the room.<br>\r\nTara, almost in tears, spread her arms.<br>\r\n\"I'm fat.  I'm just . . . fat.\"<br>\r\nWillow hugged her.  Her hands avoided the newly developed rolls of fat on her back, and her increasingly flabby ass.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tara, you're not fat, you're . . .\" Willow didn't finish the sentence fast enough.  \"Well, you're beautiful and I love you and you know that, right?\"<br>\r\nTara sniffed.  She could tell that as much as putting on this weight bothered her, it bothered Willow, too.  That she knew Willow was ashamed that it bothered her didn't make it sting any less.  Willow had never thought about Tara's body until she started growing.  Then she tried ignoring it.  She was ashamed of herself.  It seemed so superficial of her, but she couldn't help it.  Willow admitted to herself that she liked her women like she liked her men, thin and fit, or at least small, even if she wouldn't say that to Tara.<br>\r\nThe occasional goading to go for a walk with her, and some vague references to using the college gym, didn't help.  Tara knew they were aimed at her.  And Willow knew she'd have to get used to having a fat girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"I . . . I know you find me less attractive now--\" Tara started, as she tugged on the shirt hugging her round belly.<br>\r\n\"Aw, sweetie, no--\"<br>\r\n\"I know you do, it's true, don't lie,\" Tara said it sadly, not accusing, not blaming.<br>\r\n\"Tara, it's just that . . .\" Willow didn't know what to say now that it was almost out in the open.<br>\r\nTara ran past Willow, shoving aside her hand.<br>\r\n\"Tara, wait,\" Willow started after her.<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" Tara said.  \"I have to go think, okay?  Just leave me alone for now.\"<br>\r\n\"O-okay . . .\" Willow said as Tara left.<br>\r\nShe sat on the bed, confused, upset, depressed.  She'd give Tara a few hours.  A little weight shouldn't be anything to get so upset over, anyways, Willow told herself.  Although secretly she was embarrassed to admit she hoped Tara was out doing something about her gain.</span></div></div>",

And I know she picks up on it.\"<br>\r\nBuffy had her own worries, though.  She tried listening to her friend's problems, but she just couldn't focus.  Like most of their conversations lately it was mostly one-sided.<br>\r\n\"That's not shallow, Will,\" Buffy said as comforting as she could, \"It's normal.  Doesn't mean you dont' love her.  I'd be concerned too if someone I was dating gained a lot of weight.  It shows you're worried.\"<br>\r\nWillow nodded unconvinced.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what I tell myself to make me feel better,\" Willow said.  \"But . . . I just don't like how she looks weight the, uh, weight.  And I never even thought about stuff like this before.  And now every time I look at her I miss how she used to look, and . . . and . . .\"<br>\r\nBuffy noted the pause even though she wasn't really paying attention.<br>\r\n\"And what?  Talk to me.\"<br>\r\nWillow lowered her voice, shame creeping in.<br>\r\n\"And . . . I start worry about my own, um, weight.  I'm afraid of getting fat, Buffy.  I never even cared about looks before!\"<br>\r\n\"Lots of things change in college,\" Buffy said, staring off into space.  \"Besides, you're super thin, you'll never gain a pound.\"<br>\r\n\"Probably not, but I'm worried that I'm worried about it now.  And all this worrying has gotten me worried.  And then I'm worried that I'm so worried about my own body that I'm not worried enough about Tara--\"<br>\r\n\"Will, Will,\" Buffy put her hands up as Willow was becoming frantic.  \"Just stop thinking about it so much.  It'll work itself out, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay . . .\" Willow said.<br>\r\n\"Now, I have to get to this . . . sciency class--\"<br>\r\n\"Precalculus.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.  I have to get to my science precalculus class.  Wish me luck.\"<br>\r\n\"Good luck,\" Willow said as she left Buffy.  She wasn't feeling any better.  And Tara still hadn't spoken to her since she left last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was thinking just as much about Willow as Willow was about her.  She paced her lonely dorm, dressed in some of the few big, frumpy clothes that still fit her.  She had gone through all her magic books.  Looked up everything she could online.  There were many, many solutions to her weight problem.<br>\r\nAn illusion spell was out.  She wanted to be thin again for real, not just look it.<br>\r\nHyper-metabolism spells had some drawbacks she'd rather not deal with.<br>\r\nAll the other spells required so much preparation.  Tara should have known that, though.  She was so cautious in her magic use, much more so than Willow.  Spells which can change the mind or body are infamous difficult and dangerous to pull off.  She knew she would have to be careful.  She just wasn't sure she had the strength or know-how to do it.<br>\r\nHer misgivings seemed less and less trivial each time she looked in a mirror, or felt her belly jiggle when she moved, or felt the first, agonizing pangs of her hips in the early stage of waddling.<br>\r\nShe went to work through the night while Willow sat by her phone waiting for her to call.  Tara was cobbling together numerous spells to produce a spell that had as little cost and the most effect.  Once all the preparations are in order, she just had to announce it, and let the magic run its course.<br>\r\nShe took one last look at her profile, at her bloated breasts, and her belly which had grown past them.  At her giant ass, her hips so wide they were well past her shoulders.  And worst of all her round, moon-like face.  With a final resolve, she sprinkled some dust onto the complex circle on the floor, the candles at strategic points flaring up and glowing blue as she spoke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara closed her eyes and pictured Willow as she looked nestled amid the sheets and pillows -- her pale skin with its dusting of freckles, the sheets draped over her slim form.  <i>That</i> was the body Tara wanted -- not this bloated bag of blubber she was turning into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me the same size as Willow,\" she repeated.  \"And keep me there.   Oh, I beseech you, don't let me get fatter than Willow ever again!\"   The magic whirled around her, whipping at her frumpy clothes, and then, with one final shimmer, it ripped from her, expelled from the room in a window-rattling blast.   The candles went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara groped for the light switch.  <i>Did it work?  Am I thin again?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got the light on and turned to the mirror.   Her heart sank.  She hadn't lost an ounce!   She was still the same fat old self she'd always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara cursed under her breath.  <i>I was so sure it was working! </i>  It hadn't<i> felt</i> like a dud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at the bed, where she'd laid out her favorite old jeans and sexy camisole, the ones she hadn't a prayer of fitting into these days.  Once she was thing, she'd planned to slip into them and go surprise Willow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViciously, she wadded up the cami and flung it into the corner.  Then, exhausted from lack of sleep and aching with disappointment, she threw herself down onto the bed and cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA breeze blew in through Willow's open window, chilling her under the thin sheets.   She blinked muzzily.  <i>Mmmrh?</i>  She felt the prickle of gooseflesh on her arms and belly, and tried to tug her T-shirt down over her exposed stomach.  It was harder than she would have expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe propped herself up, blinking in disorientation.  <i>Morning, I guess.  So Tara never called... </i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't like her.  Willow felt a trill of worry in her stomach.  What if she'd done something crazy?  She slid herself out of bed, feeling sluggish, and it was about then that she noticed just what was wrong.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed over to the mirror.  As hard as it was to believe, it was true.  She'd gained weight overnight.  Thirty, maybe forty pounds.   Her shirt -- one of her favorites, a memento of a band she'd particularly enjoyed at The Bronze -- was so tight on her it was fraying.  Her shorts were practically ready to burst off of her.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, my goddess!</i> Willow thought.  <i>I'm all... chubbery-blubbery!  How am supposed to go out like this?  How am I going to tell--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frown deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tara.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take a brain of Willow's caliber to figure out that there was probably a connection between her girlfriend's recent weight problem and her own recenter one.   She felt an angry tickle in the back of her throat.   <i>What was this, a spell?  She can't control her eating, and I've gotta suffer for it?</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced herself to calm down and take deep breaths.  It wasn't necessarily intentional, after all.  Sunnydale was packed full of amulets and potions and demons and enchanted objects and ill-tempered genies and who knew <i>what</i> else.  It could even have been her own fears that triggered this somehow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she decided she'd better call Tara up and find out exactly what she knew about the new Willow.</span></div></div>",

She felt even less appealing now.  She had to force herself out of bed, force herself to tug on an ill-fitting skirt and indecently tight top.  At one time it would have looked cute on her, she thought, not for the first time, as her phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew it was Willow.  It rang a few times before she could no longer resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Tara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara?\" came Willow's voice.  Tara would have felt tremendous relief if not for the tremor in her lover's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you come over now?\" Willow said, followed by a sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout asking any more, Tara was heading over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow had already had a good cry at the loss of her figure and now sat on her bed waiting.  The only things she could find to fit her bloated body was a bear of sweatpants and a large t-shirt.  And even that rode up on her stomach, exposing a dimpled naval she did not want to be constantly reminded of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm all belly</i>, Willow thought with a frown, her newfound double chin spreading out as she looked down at the bulbous gut spreading into her lap.  It's not that her thighs weren't thicker, or that her ass hadn't ballooned in its own right, but it was definitely her belly that was bugging Willow the most.  It had gained proportionally the most weight.  She almost wished that, whatever Tara had done, she could have at least gotten some extra flab in her breasts and hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought made her more depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened.  Willow cringed as she saw Tara's expression.  She slowly walked towards her fattened girlfriend, her hands going up to her mouth, unable to speak at first.  Willow managed a feint smile and shrugged.  It almost seemed funny now.  Willow had only recently developed a fear of getting fat, and now right on cue, here was the heavier, flabbier Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my fault,\" was all Tara could say.  She began crying.  It made Willow feel better.  She knew it wasn't intentional, but the anger only completely dissipated when she saw Tara's reaction.  Willow, with some difficult, heaved herself up and went to her.  They embraced, both feeling extremely self-conscious about her their larger figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, I never meant for this to happen,\" Tara said.  \"I just wanted to be thin, like you, and . . . and . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, honey, I know.  It was an accident,\" Willow avoided saying more.  She was enough in the right mind to know that telling Tara how disgusting and blubbery she felt might be taken the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stepped back to look her in the eyes.  They both smiled, finding themselves in the same predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her better nature, Tara now had a new appreciation for how hard it was for Willow to watch her gain weight.  As much as she wanted to focus on getting Willow back to normal, Tara couldn't help but realize just how much less attractive she found Willow now.  It was a fleeting thought--although it returned briefly as Tara's eyes involuntarily eyed Willow's puffy cheeks or round, full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fix this.  I promise, Willow,\" Tara said with a resolve Willow had rarely heard in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hit the books,\" Willow said, trying to sound perky despite knowing she was looking anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tara was already at it.  She reached out her hand and, as a burst of hot air blew between them, spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Let this be reversed!</i>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Willow shouted, but it was too late.  Tara had spoken, and in her haste had essentially just thrown magic at the problem with no prior thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stepped backwards from the force, her hands were on her belly.  It felt full, and active, and the feeling was spreading.  She yelped as she felt her stomach stretching into her hands.  One, two, three inches, it pressed outward, her shirt riding up even further, her lovehandles becoming a full belt of fat as the sensation spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Blorp</i>.  Her belly actually went 'blorp,' Willow thought, squealing as her body spiraled out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her sides, they puffed out.  Her hips and ass expanded even, stretching her sweatpants to become form-fitting.  When the tingling reached her breasts, she grabbed for those too, and felt only a slight stretching of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara!\" Willow shouted in fear as the last of the weight finally settled on her face, already swollen from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was done.  Another ten, fifteen pounds on her already chubbified self.  She didn't even want to look in the mirror at the damage.  She could tell be the weight pulling her down, by how she had to spread her legs more to stand, that she had surpassed chubby and was now fat.  Officially fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow whined, holding her flabbier gut in despair, and then was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had experienced something else.  She felt a pleasant, sucking feeling throughout her body, like a great weight was being lifted from her physically and spiritually.  Her hands moved to her belly as it shrunk, rubbed her hips as they narrowed.  She was still large, but, as she turned to the mirror her feeling of ecstasy coming down to a comfortable joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt was no longer too tight, but complimented her soft curves nicely.  Her dress had fallen a little, her belly and ass no longer forcing it up higher on her waste.  And her face, that was the best.  She smiled and didn't feel disgusted with how she looked.  She was still larger than when she started college, but she was smaller, and it just felt so <i>good</i> that it barely registered exactly what had happened to those excess pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Willow's rounder face, Tara saw an expression that was part shock, part betrayal.</span></div></div>",

Why not be thin?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured with as much subtley as she could, boosting the waning power of the spell.   Willow's belly jiggled and bulged.   Tara felt her own body thin further.  Her size-XL panties, already loose, started slipping down her butt.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nSo close, so damn close, but if only I had a flat stomach--I've</i> never <i>gotten to have a flat stomach!  That's not fair, is it?  And what difference will another five pounds make?   Or ten?   Maybe fifteen....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TARA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tara was knocked off her feet as Willow tackled her.   It wasn't the first time her girlfriend had jumped into her arms, but it was the first time there had been so much of her.   It felt like being hit with a sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed on the bed, the springs creaking ominously under their combined weight.  Tara struggled, but found she was pinned.  There was no way she could shift Willow's bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump redhead glared at her furiously.  \"TARA!\" she snarled again.  \"What are you <i>doing?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I... it was an accident!   I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were all those extra finger-wavy parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>sorry!</i>\"  Tara choked.  She could barely breathe with Willow's weight crushing her.   Suddenly ten pounds here and ten pounds there seemed a lot more significant than she'd assumed.      She started to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, Willow heaved herself off of Tara, panting with the exertion.   \"That was <i>not</i> okay, Tara.   Look what you did to me!  I'm more of a...a butterball than you ever were!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara hung her head.  \"I...it just felt so good.  I'm really, really, really sorry.\"   The more she thought of what she'd done, the more she hated herself.   And yet, somewhere deep inside her, in the nasty, selfish place she tried to keep buried, part of her was cheering, <i>I'm thin, I'm thin, hooray!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>was</i> thin, too.  She wasn't just back to normal, she'd actually managed to get a little slimmer than that, carving off those few pounds she'd never been able to lose in high school.   Her dress didn't just fit, it was loose.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's done is done.\"   Willow sighed, running chubby fingers through her hair.   \"Now, how do we undo it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next several hours poring over magical tomes.  Willow fidgeted constantly, unable to get comfortable with the unfamiliar weight on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do it?\" she grumbled, awkwardly repositioning herself on the bed.  \"I mean, usually I put the book in my lap, but I don't <i>have</i> a lap anymore.  It's full of ....me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it,\" Tara reassured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I hope not.\"   Willow paged through the book.   \"Hey, wait, I think I found something!\"   She ran her eyes over the page.   \"Ya-ta-ta-ta-da, reversal of weight-based curses and incantation, da-da-da, weight balancing--this is it?  This is what you said you did, right?   'A Spelle to Tie one's Figgure to that of Another Young Maide?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I think so?\" Tara said.   \"I didn't realize it was an official 'spell'.  I was just... sort of...improvising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow frowned.  \"I hope we learned our lesson about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded hastily.  \"So, what does it say to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First it says we have to be balanced against one another, 'Onne a Gargantuan Balance as that Whych in the Burning Tymes was Used to Weigh the Accused Agynst a Duccke.'

I'll do anything to make it up to you.  If you want to try anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can't risk it if we don't fit the spell.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara remembered an incident when her and Willow first began openly dating, when they were out in public and Willow looked at her in such a way that, for the first time in her life, she felt really beautiful.  That was before the weight started piling on, and her self-consciousness returned with a vengeance.  Now, thinner than she had ever been, wearing a flowing skirt and clingy top she borrowed from the now plus-sized Willow, was the first time Tara ever felt sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked briskly--thankfully not waddling anymore, she noted--into the town square she could imagine everybody stopping and staring at her, like she was in a shampoo commercial.  Of course, she knew that wasn't the case.  Around a college campus hot, thin girls like here were everywhere.  <i></i>Like me now,<i></i> she thought with growing dread.  As great as her new body felt, she knew it wouldn't last.  She would be forced to willing stuff herself for weeks, months, until she could be even with Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she thought it was a fitting punishment for what she had done, but it didn't make the idea anymore appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a quiet Chinese buffet which her and Willow had been to before.  The owners probably didn't recognize her, or if they did it was such a slow, lazy part of the day that they dispensed with their usual pleasant greetings.  Tara found a seat, found her first plate, and filled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe filled it with rice.  Realizing even fried rice might not be fattening enough, she piled on some pork.  Some bread rolls.  Some egg rolls.  She wasn't even sure how fattening this would be.  All she knew was if she didn't meet up with Willow later absolutely stuffed she would be in for some serious guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Tara wasn't exactly a big eater.  It was more her choice of food, inactivity, and the slow change of metabolism that comes with that made her balloon up in the first place.  So after she was done with her first plate, she was full, but knew she had to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all meats, this time.  Mongolian beef.  A healthy helping of spicy chicken.  She had to force it down by the time she got to the end of this plate.  She leaned back and belched loudly in the empty restaurant, her hand resting on her full, but still perfectly flat, stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>How much more before I can say I'm done?<i></i> she wondered.  She rubbed her tummy.  She rubbed it like she was saying goodbye to a new friend she didn't have enough time with.  She frowned, groaning out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced spoon after spoon of fried rice down her throat.  Three plates would be her limit for starters, she thought.  She was starting to look as bloated as she felt, her stomach gently rising and pressing into the elastic band of her skirt.  When she leaned forward and found she had to work at it, Tara realized that enough was enough.  Maybe she would eat more tomorrow, but the thought of more food now was making her nauseous, and nausea was the last thing her painfully swollen gut needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a depressing thought struck her.  It was easy for Tara to gain weight, and she would be back to her sad, fat self in no time.  But how fast could Willow lose weight?  Willow, with her naturally slim figure, complete lack of any experience in exercising?  Willow was already on the other side of two-hundred pounds, and if she didn't lose any weight at all, Tara would have to be there, too.  She would have be as fat as she made Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she heaved herself up to leave, her hand listlessly rubbing what she thought must be a massively bloated belly, Tara left with a heavy heart.  There was no way out.  Tara would have to become fatter than ever, just so Willow could be thin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her food-adled mind, Tara grew increasingly resentful that Willow was opposed to using more magic to fix this.  Maybe there was a way to change her mind?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Tara got home, she was feeling significantly less bloated.  That was important for what she had in mind.  She dug through her closet, looking for something she hadn't even thought about in ages.  And there it was--wadded up way in the back--the cute see-through nightie she'd picked up for a long-ago date night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been so embarrassed at the prospect of wearing it, but it had looked so good on the plus-sized model in the catalogue that she decided to risk it.  It was a disaster.  The model might have been a size fourteen, but she was a toned size fourteen with perfect curves.   The lingerie made her look glamorous and sexy.  It made Tara look like a bowl of pudding.   She'd stuffed it behind the coats and never mentioned it to Willow.  Until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gauzy fabric settled against her shoulders as soft as a dream.  She turned and looked at herself in the mirror.  Breathtaking.  Not a hint of pudding anywhere.  It was a little bigger than it needed to be, true, but it didn't ruin the effect; the nightie poofed out around her like a translucent crimson cloud, but her slim lines cut a sensuous path through the froth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sexy</i>, she thought, feeling moisture in her eyes.   Whatever happened, Willow was <i>going</i> to see her in this outfit and she was <i>going</i> to enjoy it.   She covered herself with a sweater and jeans and headed over to Willow's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExercise was a pain in the butt, literally.   Willow rubbed her over-sized posterior, which had begun to feel sore from the hand seat of the exercise bike despite the thick layers of padding.   Who knew working out was so damn tough?  She was exhausted and soaked and she hadn't even lost an ounce of fat yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang.  \"Comin'!\" Willow gasped, sliding off of the bike and producing a complaint from the floorboards.  She really didn't want to answer the door in her current state.  She was dripping with sweat, and the yellow T-shirt-over-green-spandex-aerobics-gear ensemble she was wearing made her look like some kind of bloated frog.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even less enthusiastic when she saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara,\" she said.   \"What is it?  I'm a little <i>busy</i>.\"   She saw Tara's tiny wince as she emphasized the last word.  It wasn't really nice to nettle her guilt gland like that, but what the hell, she deserved it.  All Willow had to do was look down at the hillock of chub where her feet used to be to see that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I've been eating,\" Tara said.  \"I really have.  But... I just thought it would be a waste to spoil <i>this</i> too quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the door behind her, she shucked off the sweater and let her jeans drop, standing in front of Willow in nothing but the nightie and a nervous smile.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, great,\" Willow snorted.  \"Look, I'm not in the mood right now, so--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do whatever you want to me,\" Tara said.  \"<i>Anything</i>.  No matter what!  You can't really mean you want to give this body up and have me turn fat again.  You <i>can't!</i>\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... well, I don't want to be fat either!\" Willow blurted. \"Yeah, it's nice that you're hot and all, but, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit that the sight of Tara in that outfit was distracting.  She just wanted to jump on her and do all kinds of crazy things to that slender body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--but forget it!\" Willow said.  \"If we want to undo this, you've got to get your weight up and that's all there is to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Tara said.  \"I'm just saying... do we have to do it right away?  Why can't we enjoy ourselves just once first?\"  <i> And maybe once you've been with me skinny, you'll change your mind...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's thought, Willow responded:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Dawn arrived at the University of California, she had no interest in joining a sorority.  In fact, it was only with a lot of mental preparation that she had an interest in college.  Some inspirational words from her sister changed that.  Buffy was the selfless warrior that Dawn always looked up to, even during the resentful bouts of sibling rivalry.  And only as Dawn grew older did she realize that she didn't have to literally punch demons out to help Buffy in her mission.  She would have to do it in a less physical way, like Giles or Xander or any of the other normals among the evil-fighting squad she grew up with.<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite sure what major would help her the most in that, but getting into a college was a start.<br>\r\nHer friend Tiffany from the now defunct Sunnydale High School was the only one on campus she knew, and that was good enough for her.  Dawn wasn't yet interested in any of the social aspects of college.  Tiffany was, though, and so any socializing Dawn needed could be gotten through her.  But a sorority?  No, that was out of the question.  Dawn was part of the popular crowd and that wasn't going to change now.<br>\r\n\"We have to join a sorority,\" Tiffany said.<br>\r\n\"Why?  We don't have to pay people to be our friends,\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n\"Dawn, come on, they have the best parties,\" Tiffany said, already realizing that wouldn't intrigue her more studious friend.  \"Look, we can both get into Kappa Phi Delta Gamma.\"<br>\r\n\"KPDG?\" Dawn said with a sneer, \"Aren't they like the super model sorority were everybody is all super thin and hot?\"<br>\r\nTiffany nodded her head.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like you!  And kind of me,\" she said, hoping to appeal to Dawn's vanity, at least.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, no thanks,\" Dawn said.  She turned her head towards a table in the school cafeteria, which looked more like a mall's food court with its ring of fast food places surrounding the tables.  A few Kappas were there, all gorgeous, all with perfect figures and hair.  Dawn noticed them only because this sorority seemed dedicated to only admitting the hottest of the hot, for no reason other than keeping their beauty quotient high, apparently.<br>\r\nActually, now that she looked at them, it was somewhat uncanny how absolute beautiful all the girls in that house were . . .<br>\r\n\"But, like, they're not just about being hot,\" Tiffany went on, \"They're kind of like, um . . . Freemasons.  Yeah, they do occult research and stuff, too.\"<br>\r\nDawn cocked an eyebrow in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.  They look like a bunch of airheads to me.\"<br>\r\n\"But you love that weird magic stuff, right?  And they have books and a library and everything in their house.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" this actually intrigued Dawn.<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't seen it.  But Amber Jameson told me they're into all that, and that they have crazy resources.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" Dawn said, now so obviously intrigued that Tiffany knew it was only a matter of time.  \"Why don't you join and tell me how it is and then we'll see?\"<br>\r\n\"I can't, I don't . . . think I'm pretty enough.  But you are.  And anyways, I don't to be in there without any friends.  If we both join and they let us in then it'll be way better.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it.  But if they don't accept you then I won't join,\" Dawn said, indicating that she had already thought about it.<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Tiffany said, grabbing her friend's hands in excitement.<br>\r\nThey turned and saw the Kappas again, chowing down on their burgers, pizza, grilled chicken, the worst of the unhealthy foods this cafeteria had to offer.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, how do they stay so thin?\" Dawn asked, who had never had a problem keeping her figure ever since she developed into the slender, beautiful girl she was today.<br>\r\n\"That's probably one of their secrets,\" Tiffany said with a thoughtful nod.  She didn't really know much about what goes on this or any sorority, but assumed secrets were part of it.</span></div></div>",

Put on the charm.\"<br>\r\nEllen shook her head vigorously, then belched with a mouth full of food.<br>\r\nTiffany lead the way to the three girls.  She was unable to stop herself from smiling awkwardly.  Dawn was put off before they even stood up, but now even more so by the fact that all three had turned and were smiling at them.  Only Jenna was reeling it in.  Ellen swallowed quickly and shouted to them, completely ruining the subtle trap Jenna hoped to set.<br>\r\n\"Hiii!\" Ellen said and waved.<br>\r\nTiffany perked up and quickened her pace, leaving Dawn trailing behind her.  At least this one girl might be a bit much for her.<br>\r\n\"Hi!  I'm Tiffany,\" Tiffany held out her hand to Ellen, who had already picked some fries again and wasn't ready.<br>\r\nJenna stepped in.  She took Tiffany's hand just as Dawn joined them.<br>\r\n\"Hello, Tiffany.  I'm Jenna.  This is Melanie, and Ellen, who you met from across the room just now,\" Jenna glared at her.<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry, I guess I shouldn't be so friendly when we're trying to get pledges,\" Ellen said.  Melanie crammed the last piece of pizza down her throat and joined the conversation.<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean--\" Tiffany stammered.  She was expecting this to be more like a job interview.  And here were these three elite sorority sisters already offering her the chance to join.<br>\r\nJenna looked at her cell phone and stood up.<br>\r\n\"Look, we have to get to class.  But, I'm assuming you were going to ask about joining Kappa?\" Jenna smiled.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly.  That's what we're all about,\" Tiffany said.  Dawn still hadn't spoken.  Something seemed off about these girls.  The fact that they were all in perfect shape and yet the table was littered with evidence of a feast was the first issue.  The second was that Dawn didn't expect them to offer membership.  Were they that desperate for members?  Didn't Tiffany say they were highly secretive?<br>\r\n\"Look, we're having a mixer tonight.  Just us girls and potential sisters.  And we'd love for you to come, Tiffany,\" Jenna said.  Melanie and Ellen wiped their faces and stood up.<br>\r\n\"It'll be a blast.  You gotta' come to this thing.  Everyone's going to be there.  I'll be there, Jenna will be there, Melanie, um--the rest . . .\" Ellen said, almost bouncing as she spoke.<br>\r\n\"Reel it in a little, Ellen,\" Jenna glared at her petite associate again.  \"Oh, and who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n\"Dawn Summers,\" Dawn stepped forward.  \"I'm with Tiffany.  Just thought we'd see what all this sorority business was all about.\"<br>\r\n\"You can see for yourself tonight.  I'm sure you'll make excellent additions to our team.\"<br>\r\n\"We could sure use the numbers,\" Ellen said, nodding and smiling.<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Dawn didn't know what to make of that.<br>\r\n\"Don't mind her.  Ellen just gets so excited about pledges that she can't help herself sometimes,\" Jenna said.  Her stomach growled, loud enough to be heard over the cafeteria.  She had paced herself like she warned her friends to, but now was famished.  The very magic allowing them to stay so thin did nothing to curb their appetites.<br>\r\n\"Anyways, it was so nice meeting you,\" Jenna took Dawn's hand and looked into her eyes, very professionally.<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the invite!\" Tiffany almost squealed.  She had spent so much time thinking of sororities as unattainable havens of popularity and acceptance that she couldn't contain her excitement.  She didn't notice what Dawn saw, that the three were looking at them with varying degrees of desperation, that only one of them wasn't stuffing her face with abandon when they spoke.<br>\r\n\"Just make you come and have a good time.  I'm sure you will,\" Jenna said.  \"See you tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Tonight!\" Ellen repeated, \"At the Kappa house.  At eight!\"<br>\r\n\"See you there,\" Melanie said, covering her mouth to hide a small burp as she followed Jenna and Ellen out.<br>\r\nDawn and Tiffany returned to their seats.<br>\r\n\"They want both of us!  And they were so nice!\" Tiffany said.<br>\r\n\"Relax, they're just other students.  Don't you think they were a little . . . off?  And what was that thing about 'numbers?'\"<br>\r\n\"Off how?  Don't try to get out of this.  You said you'd come if they invited me and they invited both of us so pleeeeeease come with me tonight, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, fine, I'll go.  It's just a sorority.  The worst that can happen is the party is lame, right?\"<br>\r\n\"It won't be,\" Tiffany stared dreamily off in the distance, watching the three sisters leave the cafeteria.  \"They're just so cool!\"<br>\r\nDawn was deep in thought.  She wasn't thrilled at this obligation.  She had studying to do.  She had shows to catch up on.  Mostly, an all night binge just didn't appeal to her.  Her heart only softened on the matter when she saw how happy the mere prospect of this party was making Tiffany.  Her friend couldn't stop smiling.  All right, Dawn told herself, I'll try to have a good time for her sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they two arrived, Dawn was pleased to see that it wasn't as big an affair as she thought.  There were maybe forty students there, and most of them were very clearly Kappas.  They were all gorgeous, some even elegant.  There weren't many guys there, and those that were looked like they were already spoken for.  Dawn didn't mind.  She wasn't there looking to dance.  She felt underdressed, for one thing.<br>\r\nJenna greeted them and began showing them around, introducing them to the impossibly beautiful sisters that they, Jenna hoped, would be joining.  Ellen and Melanie followed them, speaking highly of everyone they met.<br>\r\nDawn was busy surveying the scene.  She hadn't had time to do the research she would have liked to do about this mysterious sorority.  Everyone was too cordial, too beautiful, too ridiculously accommodating.<br>\r\nOnly one girl there didn't seem to fit.  She was shoved into a skirt two sizes too small and waring a tank top that must have been flattering twenty pounds ago.  She looked dazed, constantly rubbing her round stomach.  The girls around her were especially nice to her, leading her around and hanging out with her even though she didn't look entirely awake.  This concerned Dawn.<br>\r\nThe lack of dancing also concerned her.  It didn't take long for Dawn to realize that nobody was dancing because everyone was eating.  The model-thin sorority sisters would go from friend to friend, but always went back to a lavish buffet table to grab more food.  Only the guys there weren't eating.<br>\r\nFinally, Jenna had introduced them to everybody.<br>\r\n\"Now, I have to go make nice with some of the senior sisters,\" Jenna said in a you-know-how-it-is way.  \"Go.  Mix.\"<br>\r\n\"It's a mixer, after all,\" Ellen said, grabbing Tiffany's arm.  Melanie followed as Tiffany was dragged off to the buffet.  \"And I'm starving, let's get some food first!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn and Tiffany sat on the comfortable couch, surrounded by their potential sisters-to-be, who chattered away, asked about their families and their interests, and complimented their outfits.  Tiffany soaked up the attention, but Dawn only felt her suspicions growing.   Jenna had \"pretended\" to mistake her Sears jeans for designer originals -- and she was sure anyone so elegant and fashion-conscious would never make such a mistake.    She was being buttered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the potential new sisters here were, she realized.  The few girls who weren't already members were surrounded by knots of Kappas laughing and cooing over them and keeping their plates topped off with mountains of greasy, fattening treats.   She and Tiffany were no exception; they hadn't even had to get off the couch, because the Kappas had just kept piling on more pizza, and more chips, and more soda, and more and more and more.   Half an hour into the party, Dawn was so stuffed with junk she was beginning to feel slightly sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you <i>always</i> eat like this?\" she asked, looking down wearily at yet another parmesan-crusted hunk of Crazy Bread.  \"I mean, you guys don't <i>look</i> like you live on pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna smiled and arched her back, emphasizing her slender waist and pert chest.   \"Let's just say we know a few little stay-slim <i>secrets</i> that work <i>exceptionally</i> well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't stick your fingers down your throats, or--\"  Dawn began.  Tiffany elbowed her in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn!\" she scolded.  \"Of course they don't.\"  She looked up at Jenna apologetically.   \"Sorry about Dawn.  I would<i> love </i>to hear your secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna laughed.  \"Well, it is a <i>secret</i>, dear.  But when -- if you're invited to join us, I promise you you'll find all about it firsthand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a commotion from across the room.   Dawn's head turned in time to see one of the groups of Kappas backing away from a girl she recognized as another potential pledge -- a short, stocky girl with chocolate-brown hair.   She had one hand on her stomach and another clamped over her mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom!\" she groaned.  \"I gotta -- I'm gonna--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Kappas, her face twisted with a look of disgust, pointed the girl to the far hall.  The sick girl staggered across the room, disappearing into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that's a shame,\" Jenna said, shaking her head.  \"Ate too much, I suppose.  I hope she manages to keep it off the carpet.\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMaybe if you weren't practically force-feeding us</i>, Dawn thought.   \"I guess not everyone has the stomach to be a Kappa, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna chuckled again.  \"You know, that's a very good way of putting it.  We do like to find sisters who can put their money where their mouth is, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany -- who had to have eaten at least as much as Dawn had -- widened her eyes and stuffed another piece of pizza into her mouth.   \"I 'ike e'ain,\" she mumbled around the wad of dough.  \"Mmmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby girl spoke up, and Dawn realized it was the first thing she'd heard her say.   \"That's right, you know,\" she said dreamily.  \"That's why they wanted me.  I won the pie-eating event at Springfest last year.  See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked her finger across the screen of her phone, bringing up a picture of a several people behind a table covered in empty pie tins.    Dawn took a closer look.   Sure enough, there was the girl, grinning face plastered with pie filling  -- about forty pounds less of her.   She was practically svelte.   She'd really packed in on over the summer.   Which was funny, when you thought about it, because she was the only girl here who wasn't stuffing her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want the rest of my food?\"  Dawn asked.  \"I don't think I can finish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" the girl said hurriedly.   \"I'm ... I'm not hungry.\"  Her features darkened, and a half-formed worry wrinkled her forehead.   \"Besides, I think I'm gaining weight.  Especially since ... since most of the girls came back from summer break... it's almost like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be silly, Lindsay, you look great!\"  Jenna said hastily.  \"Doesn't she?  Doesn't she just look amazing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Kappas were quick to agree, soothing Lindsay and showering her with compliments.   <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nSomething definitely stinks here</i>, Dawn thought.  <i>And I'm going to find out what it is.  And to do that, I'll need them to like me.   And they like big eaters...</i>   She picked up her grease-soaked plate again.   <i>Sorry, stomach.  You'll just have to suck it up.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two hours of stuffing and schmoozing and Dawn was still not entirely sure something supernatural was happening.  Of course, she was certain that some shenanigans were afoot, but she was careful about jumping the gun.  In Sunnydale, she already would have decided that, yes, the Kappas were fattening up new members to stay thin themselves, but outside of the Hellmouth that kind of hypothesis would be less and less likely.<br>\r\nOn the one hand, no outside force was compelling her or Tiffany to stuff themselves.  And then on the other, the Kappas were eating more than them constantly and didn't even look full.  Meanwhile, Dawn wasn't sure she could stand.  Both her and Tiffany slouched back in the absurdly comfortable couch, hands on their full, hard tummies, diligently accepting food and conversation from passing Kappas.<br>\r\nJenna was with them almost the entire time.  Each of the potential pledges had a few girls hanging around them, making sure they stayed stuffed.  They others slowed down as the night went on, each taking seat and not getting up while they stuffed their faces with anything the Kappas gave them.  Dawn wanted to ask Tiffany about what she thought.  Surely by now even Tiffany's enthusiasm would have waned in light of the feast resting inside her.<br>\r\nThen Ellen, the hyper blonde ballerina Dawn remembered from the cafeteria, gave her a break.<br>\r\n\". . . of course you'd be living in our house, Tiffany, that's how sororities work,\" Jenna answered Tiffany.  \"We have plenty of room.  More than we used to, I'm sorry to say.\"<br>\r\n\"A lot less--uurp--members these days?\" Dawn said lazily, barely stifling a soft belch as she self-consciously rested her hands on her stuffed stomach.<br>\r\n\"Sadly, it's true,\" Jenna said, then added quickly, \"I think our standard's have gotten higher, perhaps.  Or maybe Greek societies aren't as popular as they used to be, what with the economy and all.\"<br>\r\nTiffany nodded with a mouth full.  Dawn had given up eating, only picking at a plate full of greasy, cheesy nachos another Kappa had left next to her.<br>\r\n\"Just makes it more exclusive,\" Tiffany nodded and then swallowed.  She leaned forward, her smile as bright as at the start of the evening if her eyes were heavy.  She opened her mouth to speak and then blushed bright red as the button snapped off her jeans.  She paused, waiting for a reaction.<br>\r\nJenna just laughed and went on.  Dawn just stared, wide-eyed, as Tiffany went on as if nothing happened as well.  Dawn figured she was on the verge of busting a button herself.<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\" Ellen ran up and grabbed her friend's hand, \"Where's Chelsea?\"<br>\r\n\"The brunette who threw up all over the bathroom over an hour ago?  I think she left,\" Jenna said.  \"Just couldn't stomach it,\" she chuckled to Dawn and Tiffany.  Tiffany robotically laughed back.<br>\r\n\"Damn it!  Damn it!\" Ellen said, stomping her foot in a cartoony fashion.  \"Any other pledges left?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, well--\"<br>\r\nLindsey hadn't said a word in over an hour, just leaned against the wall by Dawn, staring dreamily into space.  At one point she began rubbing her soft stomach and didn't stop.  She was now hunched over, grasping her belly tightly.  To Dawn it looked even bigger than before, rounder even.  She heard a painful gurgle from inside while Lindsey winced.  The zipper along the side of her skirt had begun sliding down, Dawn now noticed.  It was like over the course of the night her stomach, if not the rest of her, was growing fuller despite her not eating a thing.<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh,\" Lindsey moaned.<br>\r\nJenna stood at attention, \"Lindsey?  What's wrong?\"<br>\r\nLindsey moaned again, hunching forward, cradling her now pregnant-looking belly.  Her shirt didn't even fully cover it now.  Dawn attempted to stand and offer a hand, but found her own fullness keeping her weighted to the spot.  She couldn't move fast enough before Lindsey bolted as fast as she could.<br>\r\n\"Something's . . . wrong . . . \" she said as she scuttled off.<br>\r\n\"Lindsey?  Lindsey?\" Jenna said.  She turned to Dawn, \"Poor thing.  She has a gluten allergy.  It must have just hit her.  I'll go see if she's okay.\"<br>\r\nLindsey ran to the bathroom, or rather waddled.  Jenna followed, as did Ellen, finally leaving Dawn alone with Tiffany.<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tiffany, let's get out of her,\" she said, shifting into a sitting rather than slouching position.  Her jeans dug into her stuffed tummy uncomfortably.  Tiffany shamelessly remained slouching, her jeans popped open, still munching on a chicken leg.<br>\r\n\"What, why?  I haven't eaten this good in months!  And that Jenna is so cool, I hope she's out sorority boss person thingy.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?  Tiff, I've been pumping her for information for two hours and she's evaded every question and flat out made stuff up the whole time.  And everybody is being way too nice for this to be normal.\"<br>\r\nDawn thought she'd keep any fears of magical happenings to herself.  Tiffany was never in the know about Dawn or her sister's world.  Like most of the former inhabitants of Sunnydale, Tiffany kept herself in intentional ignorance.<br>\r\n\"Are you suspicious because they're actually nice and not a bunch of nasty airheads like you thought they'd be?\"<br>\r\n\"It's not that, it's--Tiffany, look at this,\" Dawn motioned to her stomach, so full it actually looked rounder.  Then she motioned to Tiffany's equally bloated midsection.  \"We're going to explode if we eat anymore.  For the sake of our figures, let's call this a night.\"<br>\r\n\"You two!\" Jenna returned.  She looked nervous but kept up a cheerful disposition as always.  \"So, night's winding down.  Everyone had a good time.  I hope you two are okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!\" Tiffany said.<br>\r\n\"A little full . . .\" Dawn said, no longer hiding the suspicious tone she originally took with them.<br>\r\n\"That is just great.  You two are definitely Kappa material.\"<br>\r\n\"So, um, do you discuss it and then let us know if we're in?\" Tiffany asked hopefully.<br>\r\n\"We'll do you one better, dear.  You can join tonight if you want.  You'll just have to sign the vow of secrecy, there will be a little ceremony, and then you're in.  Kappa for life, and all.\"  Jenna was smiling much wider than Dawn thought appropriate.  Looking around, she realized that only one other potential member was left--a slim, serious-looking Indian girl who held her own when it came to eating.<br>\r\n\"We'd be honored to have you as part of our sisterhood.  Are you in?\" Jenna was asking Dawn more than Tiffany, since Tiffany was obviously willing to do anything she was told.</span></div></div>",

Dawn didn't know which was more uncomfortable -- the pressure on her overfull stomach, or the way Tiffany awkward tried to insert herself into the hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's a tie</i>, she decided eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, there's no need to wait.  We'll get you made official Kappas and then you can crash here tonight.  It'll be just like a great big slumber party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had to fight the urge to roll her eyes, and wondered if she'd made the right decision.   Every slumber party she'd ever been to had involved large amounts of food, and the thought of <i>more</i> eating was distinctly unappealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just have a quick word with the others,\" Jenna said, turning to the room and clapping her hands.   \"Okay, Kappas!  We have some new pledges here and we're going to conduct the ceremony in just a moment--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chorus of cheers and some enthusiastic clapping from the girls; Dawn could swear she heard at least one of them say \"<i>Finally!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--but first, a couple of reality checks for you all,\" Jenna continued.  \"First, right now Lindsay is on her way to the emergency room.  No, no, hold your gasps, she'll be fine.   But I wouldn't expect her to return.   I realize Lindsay played a vital role in our sorority and I know a lot of you put a lot of <i>pressure</i> on her, more than one girl could be expected to take.   I expect you all to treat our new pledges with respect and care.  That means no piling on more than they can handle, <i>especially </i>not tonight.  I think we can agree they're all partied out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a general mutter of acceptance, but people weren't happy.    Dawn noticed Melanie, the Hawaiian-looking girl she'd met earlier, dropping a half-eaten chicken breast back onto her plate with a scowl, and several of the other girls were emptying their plates into the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna opened a door in the paneling and motioned the new pledges through.  The stairway on the other side was dank, narrow, and smelled of earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a root cellar,\" Jenna said soothingly.  \"There's better light down there.  Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three new pledges followed her -- Dawn trying not to let her suspicions show <i>too</i> obviously, Tiffany beaming with joy, and the quiet Indian girl looking so nervous her knees might start knocking together at any moment.  Dawn felt bad for her.  She wanted to yell, <i>run!  Get out of the house while you still can!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she wouldn't if she wouldn't soon regret not taking her own advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the staircase was a circular stone room which had to be well below ground level.    In the center of the room sat a statue.   It was massive, carved from rough reddish-white stone with striations that made it look like the surface of Jupiter, and shaped like some sort of gibbering creature -- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the blindfold went on.   Dawn gasped.   \"Sorry -- you're not a sister yet!\" Jenna said into her ear.  \"Now, we'll prick your finger and you just sign your name--\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nOh, because this isn't a bad sign or anything</i>, Dawn thought sarcastically, smearing her bloody fingertip across what felt like parchment.   She doubted it would be legible even if she <i>had</i> been able to see what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, the ceremony.   Girls, don't worry about what your hear.  This is all just for fun.\"  Jenna's voice dropped suddenly.  <i>\"Alixiin!  Moralasque!  Piru!  We call on your strength.   Manifest and be made true!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn felt a blast of hot air on her face.  She wished she could see what was happening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Tiffany, Dawn, Tamisa, raise your right hands.  Everyone else, repeat after me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I take these three to be my sisters.<br>\r\nWhat sustains me, shall sustain them in my place;<br>\r\nI ask only what I need to live</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assembled Kappas repeated the oath in a dull roar.  Every single one of them must be in here, Dawn realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let them blossom where I wither<br>\r\nLet them be granted the abundance of all of us<br>\r\nAnd let what we take and do not need, be given to them instead.<br>\r\nKamlatchimarazon!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kappas clapped their hands together, two short, sharp claps in unison, and the furnace heat dissipated.<br>\r\nDawn felt something smooth and cool being placed against her lips; a ceramic bowl.  Obligingly -- she could hardly stop now -- she drank, though she felt like she was about to burst.   Her painfully full stomach strained against her jeans.   The liquid was salty and sweet, and probably would have been quite delicious under other circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blindfold was ripped off her head and Jenna was grinning at her.  \"All done!  You guys are Kappas now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can I look at the--\"  Dawn began, but Jenna and Melanie were on either side of her, spinning her around and practically dragging her back towards the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was all that stuff about blossoming and giving your stuff to me and all of that?\" she persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just a stupid old poem.  Silly, I know,\" Jenna said with a shrug, \"but it's tradition!  Now, come out, let's get out of this smelly old basement.  I'll show you to your rooms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn wanted to press further, but she already felt so stuffed and lethargic that she could barely keep her eyes open. <br>\r\n<i>Fine, bed</i>, she thought,<i> but tomorrow, answers!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna didn't find holding back from eating any easier than the other girls did, but she did it.  The next morning, though, she finally indulged.  She had three frozen pizzas in her fridge waiting for her.  She ate one.  Only with great strength of will did she resist from eating the others.  There was a lot of work to be done.  Now was not the time to be celebrating.  They lost one sister and gained three.  They were still far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that mindset, Jenna went down to the social around ten and was extremely pissed off to find most of her fellow Kappas lounging around stuffing their faces.  She wasn't so much disgusted by the fact that they were casually eating leftover food that had been sitting out all night--they had the same insatiable hunger as her, and it didn't care what the food was--but that she had been fighting so hard to not binge for months now and after her constant talks her sisters refused to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" Jenna stormed in.  She tried not to yell, fearing that the new pledges would hear, but that self-restraint was difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ellen said, her mouth full.  Other girls put their plates down or hid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'm calming down now,\" Jenna gave herself a moment.  \"Do you know what happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we finally got three new mules!\" one girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we have three now.  Now, a lot of you haven't been as studious when it comes to the magical arts as you're expected to be, so let me explain this to you.  When you eat, the calories go to our mules.  For a house our size we need at least ten.  That way, over the course of a semester they might gain fifty, sixty pounds at the most.  A lot, but not unrealistic.  When we have less than that, they start getting fat too fast.  And when we have too few, they don't just absorb the calories, they're stomachs start filling.  Lindsey almost exploded last night--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to eat here!\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--because you hogs couldn't hold off.  We have three mules now.  I'd like to keep their growth down to ten pounds at least for the first week, okay?  Can you slobs handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few nods of reluctant agreement.  Melanie glared at Jenna and Jenna, eager for a single person to take her frustration out on, took notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a problem with that, Mel?\" Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No--\" Melanie said, but Jenna was already talking like she said 'yes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you don't understand because you're not a legacy member like most of us.  It's not just our figures that we're maintaining here.  Beauty is important, yes, but there's more.  There's grace.  Charisma.  Even luck.  And it's not just ours.  Our mothers, and sisters, cousins, all depend on Kappa houses remaining alive and well.  We are the only chapter in the country that's shrinking every year.  If we have to close, we won't be the only ones paying for it.  No offense, but just because your family is a bunch of obese middle-class failures doesn't mean you can ignore that the rest of us have more riding on this than just our own college careers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're doing our best, what are you doing other than just bitching at us?\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember your obligations.  I'm the leading sister here.  If I think any of you are going to threaten the survival of this chapter, I can put in to have any one of you made into a in-house mule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't--\" Melanie said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna spread her hands to Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are released from our protection for one day!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of sheer terror on Melanie's face as priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a blank.  Next time I won't hold back,\" Jenne turned to leave.  \"Mel can clean up.  The rest of you come with me.  We have to get these girls moved in and settled into Kappa life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn awoke feeling full.  Maybe even fuller than when she went to sleep.  She rubbed her bloated tummy and buttoned her jeans with more effort than she liked.  She realized she would have to crack this case in a hurry if she didn't want to become a butterball before the semester was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself in one of the Kappa's smaller social rooms, sleeping on a comfortable couch.  Apparently she stayed up chatting and--she groaned to herself--eating with the other Kappas for a while before passing out.  The new girl was curled up on another couch.  Tiffany was lying face up, her visibly swollen stomach popping out for all the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost noon.  Dawn didn't think she'd have time to do any spy work today.  But if she could talk to some of the girls one on one, away from Jenna, maybe she could get some information out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged her shirt down and headed for the social hall.  She heard movement and was surprised to see only Melanie there.  Melanie was not the one Dawn would have chosen.  She knew she was close to Jenna, for one thing, and probably loyal.  Also, she was on the cheer squad.  Dawn didn't even know cheerleading was a sport outside of high school.  And her experiences with cheerleaders were either the ones who mocked her for being a weird loner freak in school, or Cordelia during the few times she saw her while her and Xander were dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Dawn put on her most cheerful expression as she approached Melanie.  Melanie glowered, but then faked a pleasant smile when she saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dawn!  Glad you're awake.  Did you have fun last night?  I love breaking in the new sisters,\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was a blast,\" Dawn rubbed her sickeningly full stomach, still managing a smile.  \"Do you, uh, need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I volunteered.  The others are going to help you three get ready today.  You're moving in, so there's that.  Also, lots of functions.  So many functions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was bothering her.  Dawn took a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?  You seem like something's bugging you,\" Dawn asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melanie wanted to unleash a few choice words about Jenna and her entitled little princess complex.  It definitely was no fun being left to clean up after the others; the table looked like it had been attacked by pigs.  Filthy, ill-mannered pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer place was just as messy as the others, of course, but well, that was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>wanted</i> to say something, but she held her tongue.   If it got back to Jenna, it could be a disaster.  She could be made into another mule -- just another calorie sponge for the rest of them to fatten up.  She couldn't stand the thought of that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two years ago</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie stomped into Kappa house and flung herself down on the couch, sobbing.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong <i>now</i>, Mel?   Stub your toe?  Break a nail?\"  her fellow first-year Ellen said, rolling her eyes and taking another huge of bite of her pastrami sandwich.  \"Mmph -- see a cloud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellen,\" Jenna said warningly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's always just drama, drama, drama with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellen, do I have to tell Jane you were being mean to one of our most <i>valuable</i> members?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen paled.  \"You wouldn't dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Narc.\"  Ellen made a face, wiped a splotch of sauce on her face, and left.   A moment later, Melanie felt Jenna's hand resting on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to talk about it?\" the sophomore girl asked her kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Melanie sniffled.  \"Ellen's right.  It's just stupid drama.  You wouldn't be interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very interested in keeping you happy.  Come on, sweetie.  Tell me what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looked up at Jenna balefully.  \"I -- I gained weight again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jenna said, looking shocked.  \"I could have sworn you'd <i>lost</i> weight.  It doesn't show at all!  Are you sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The c-captain could tell.  She made me get on the scale in front of everybody, and, a-and I've put on fifteen pounds since coming here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well -- that's just the Freshman Fifteen, everybody gets that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In less than a month?  And I only barely made the team as it is.\"   She remembered the way the captain of the squad had tried to eliminate her at the beginning of tryouts -- \"<i>Look, Mau, maybe in whatever one-pineapple town you come from they're hard up enough for girls to let chubsters on the squad, but this is the big time, okay</i>?\" -- and had only relented because her routine was so good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me she'd weigh me again in a week,\" Melanie said, \"and if I haven't lost at least five pounds, I'm off the team!  I'm never gonna do it.  I've been eating nothing but carrot sticks since I got here, but... but I just keep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned and grabbed the roll of fat squashing over the waistband of her skirt.  \"I don't know where this is <i>coming</i> from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna gulped down the last bite of Ellen's sandwich.  \"Well, if they kick you off the team, it's their loss.  You can just... spend more time around here, with us!  You know how much all the girls <i>love</i> having you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie sniffled again.  \"You've all been so nice to me... and so supportive.  I don't know how I'm gonna do it when I have to go home for winter break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna nodded.  \"The holidays are hard on all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sisters will have a field day when they see how fat I got,\" Melanie said sourly.  \"Just because they can eat and eat and never gain a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sisters?\"  Jenna was instantly alert.  \"How many?  How old are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five, and I'm the oldest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Five? </i> And... you say they have fast metabolisms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I don't know why I'm the only one who got screwed.   I just know when <i>they</i> go to college, they'll never gain a pound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm.\"  Jenna looked thoughtful.  \"And... what if they did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypothetically, let's say you could arrange it so your sisters would put on a little weight during their college years.  Would you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess,\" Melanie said.  \"I mean, that would be great!  But it'll never happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna gave Melanie a quick hug.  \"You know what?  I'm going to have a talk with Jane.  I think the other sisters and I just might have a solution to your problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One year and ten months ago</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\"  Melanie's mother squealed, almost jumping the security checkpoint in her rush to grab her daughter in a bear hug.  \"Is that you, Mel?  You look amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof.  Hi, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you've lost so much <i>weight</i>!   Alice, look at your sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, cool,\" Alice grunted, not taking her eyes off her handheld game system.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shrugged.  \"Well, they really give us a workout on the squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still!  You must have dropped twenty pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just seventeen,\" Melanie grinned.  \"But it's great.  It's a real supportive environment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at Alice -- skinny little high-school Alice -- with a strange gleam in her eye.  \"In fact, they said they liked me so much, they were extending an open invitation to my family.  When you girls get to college age... the Kappas will be waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive mules -- excellent ones, with quick metabolisms and lots of room to grow.  They weren't all coming here, of course.  Alice had just started school in New York.  Melanie had noticed she hadn't been putting up many pictures of herself up lately, and the ones she did post were increasingly likely to be Fat Girl Angle Shots.   Still, it had been quite a coup for Jenna.   The higher-ups had been <i>very</i> impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did Melanie get?  She got to clean up after the rest of these hogs.  She snorted in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing's bugging me,\" she said.  \"I'm fine.  Just fine.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn nodded slowly, trying to give Melanie a look that said she knew something was going on and that it would be okay to trust her.  Instead, Melanie didn't notice.  Which was for the best.  Dawn's earlier attempts at such a look met with confusion rather than confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Dawn said.  \"But, you know, you can talk to me if anything's wrong.  We're sisters now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn wasn't sure if that came out as sarcastic.  Melanie stopped cleaning for  second and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  I appreciate it,\" it sounded sincere, if sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel was a dead in for the moment, Dawn decided.  The other girls were off in all directions.  She didn't hear anything from anywhere else in the house.  She had an idea.  An investigative idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go check out the library.  I'll see you later, 'k?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  Good luck, those are some dense books there.  I could never get into them.  But I'm sure you won't have any trouble,\" Melanie went back to cleaning with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn found the library towards the back of the building.  There was a well-marked exit, and next to it a cellar door leading downwards.  It looked less creepy than last night as the girls led her down to that room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was open slightly.  Otherwise, it would have been easy to miss.  It wasn't exactly hidden, but it matched the antique wood walls of the library room, and could be mistaken for just another wood panel.  She opened it and went down, the creek it made less startling than if it had been the dead of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was another story.  She went down the well stairs, at least a full story, two stories below the surface.  When the stairs ended Dawn shivered.  The air down there was chilled.  Nothing inherently supernatural about that, Dawn told herself.  She asked herself why she was trying to deny something mystical was happening before realizing she was just getting very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short stone hallway led to another, older wooden door.  Dawn held her breath and stepped in.  This was the room she had been initiated in.  There were lights, but she couldn't find a light switch.  Now that she was away from the stairway any light from outside had vanished.  She took a few hesitant steps, then took out herself cell phone, holding it in front of her to at least get a little light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So this is why they only remember to grab flashlights in horror movies</i>, Dawn thought.  Right now that's all she really needed.  She could make out the stone floor, ancient and worn, the stone brick walls matching the well, some fixtures for torches on the sides, and a human-sized reddish monster with blank, evil eyes and a snarling, toothy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn yelped and jumped back.  Of course.  The strange demon stature in the middle of the room, made from that stone that was also strange, and of no known demon species she was familiar with.  But she knew people who were more familiar with more demons.  She snapped a picture on her phone of the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I'll get lucky and I'll find it in the books.  Won't have to bother Buffy or Giles at all, wherever they are,</i> Dawn thought.  She really had gotten more self-sufficient since coming to college.  She did her own laundry, got her own food, and investigated her own supernatural conspiracies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of food still made her a little sick.  Dawn found herself lightly rubbing her still-full-though-less-swollen tummy as she noticed that the demon statue had quite a potbelly, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, footsteps from above.  Echoing voices.  One of Ellen's.  The other was another girl Dawn remembered.  Casey?  Chelsea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . everyone knows I don't lock the door, Kelsey,\" Ellen said as they voices approached from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody doesn't know that.  That's a dumb to thing to know anyways,\" Kelsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, what is with everybody these days?  We just scored three new mules--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!  Not out in the open!  What if one of them is around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they wouldn't be hanging out down here, that's for sure.  Besides, I saw them in the guest room like an hour ago.  Asleep and bloated, as they should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices were at the door now.  Dawn very cautiously tiptoed behind the statue.  It was the only place to hide in the room.  She noticed a warmth emanating from the thing.  It was getting steadily warmer the longer she crouched behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it!  Evidence!  Or at least, spoken evidence of something evil happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, Jenna says never to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blah blah blah, Jenna says a lot of things.  She pretty much explained the whole Kappa premise in front of God and everybody in the dining hall a half hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Melanie asked for it, I guess,\" Kelsey said, not sounding entirely convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pft!  Look, I love Jenna and I love Melanie, but those two can be real drama queens to each other.  Especially lately.  Hope these new mules calm them down, though.  It'll be great to finally let go and eat what we want again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey laughed.  \"We already do that.  You're the worst about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a healthy eater.  I'd be five-hundred pounds if we didn't have those mules.  Now let's lock up and go get the new girls moved in.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn heard the door swing shut, followed by the clanking of metal on metal.  <i>They're locking the door!</i> she realized.   She fought the impulse the sprint for it, to shove the door open, but realized it was already probably too late.  And she was in no condition to be running, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the voices, already muffled by the heavy door, fade as the girls left.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now what?</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, she might have been better off getting caught after all, she realized.  That lock on the door seemed kind of ... final.  She didn't think they came down here very often.  What if she were stuck down here until the next time they showed up with pledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her full stomach.  <i>Well, at least I won't starve...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blood ran cold at the thought.  <i>Starve, hell, if I'm stuck down here for very long I'll be as big as a house!</i>   Already, she was sure she was fatter.  She pictured the Kappas shoveling in junk food, and her stuck in the basement, getting bigger and rounder with every passing day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, unless they though to check this room when they noticed she was missing.  Then they'd probably just do something horrible to her, like dress up in hoods and stab her with a big curvy dagger.   That was one thing Buffy had mentioned about these demon cults -- they really liked their hoods and their daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInch by inch, she passed the pale light of her phone over everything in the room.  The statue wasn't any prettier on closer inspection.  It still looked like a grotesque, bloated demon, just closer up and uglier.   At its feet were a few worn coins she didn't recognize and a small leatherbound journal.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn pocketed the journal.  \"Just borrowing,\" she hastily told the statue, patting it on one rough cloven foot.   It felt like metal in the sun on a summer's day, so hot it almost hurt to touch.  She quickly drew back her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue wasn't coming to life or anything like that, but she got the sense that whatever this thing was, this gross creature depicted in the statue, it was very close by, and it was watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't suppose you'd be willing to just let me out?\"  Dawn mused, half to the statue, half to herself.   To her surprise, she got an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't suppose you'd be willing to give me something in return?\" coughed a dusty-sounding voice.  This was followed by a hacking cough and what sounded like the beginnings of an avalanche, as if something were expelling pebbles from its windpipe.  For a moment, Dawn though she saw the stone features move, but when she looked again, the lips were frozen in the same sneering grimace, displaying a row of teeth more finely carved that anything else on the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Dawn spoke up, \"uh, uh, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" rasped the voice, \"it would have to be something pretty good, wouldn't it?  I'm fairly certain you're not exactly heading up there to throw me a parade.   More likely I let you out and you come back down here with a sledgehammer and smash up my icon, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" Dawn said.   This was fairly close to the truth, but she realized that saying it probably wouldn't be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other hand, I'm bored silly down here.   I used to serve priestesses.  Queens!   Now I'm stuck in this moldy old cistern helping a lot of vapid bimbos keep their figures.  You're the first one who's actually talked to me in over a hundred years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... so you'll let me out?\"  Dawn said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it,\" the statue said.  \"Maybe if you agree to find me another Receiver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Receiver, a -- what those skinny halfwits call a mule.   Do you know how much hard it is taking all those calories and cramming them into only three of you?  It's like trying to pack luggage for a dozen people into one tiny suitcase, only that suitcase is your <i>ass</i>.   Do that, and I'll yet you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, okay,\" Dawn said.  \"But you'll let me out <i>first</i>, right?   I mean, not gonna find anyone down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You agreed to that pretty quickly for someone who actually meant to do it,\" the statue said.  \"Let me make this clear: if I let you out and I don't have another Receiver by sundown today, I'll start packing <i>everything</i> into <i>you</i> until I have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gulped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn hesitated.  Finding another receiver was just another way of saying to find a new member for the house.  That meant finding another thin, pretty, unsuspecting freshman to be made into a fat suppository for sisters who were already more beautiful than necessary.  She glanced around, hoping to find an open door that she somehow missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and make up your mind,\" the demon said.  \"You're a Kappa now, so you're supposed to find new members all the time.  They're just really bad at it.  I'm just giving you extra motivation and a way out.  And anyways, if you're true Kappa material you'll be back to your old figure next year when you become a full fledged member.  In the meantime, you're already growing.  Why not make an effort to lighten the load <i>and</i> look good in your sisters' eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Already starting?</i>  Dawn's hands unconsciously moved to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is just--\" she was going to explain it away as the massive feast she had eaten last night, but when her hands met an unfamiliar softness she stopped.  She looked and saw that her form-fitting sweater was a fitting her form along the bottom a little too well.  She poked the tiny bulge under the waist of her jeans, noticing that it was starting to squish out all around just slightly.  How much did that represent?  Five pounds?  One pound?  Dawn really had no idea.  And she was finding it less and less appealing to have to find out what even more would do to the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon chuckled at her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caught on so quick.  Guess the Kappa flattery doesn't work on you so well.  Of course, if they had a full compliment of receivers then this would be happening so slowly you wouldn't notice until much later.  But, with only three, well . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, it's a deal,\" Dawn said it so fast she was surprised at herself.  Only after did she start rationalizing this decision that she would have this place shut down and this demon done with before anyone got hurt.  Maybe if she spent the day researching she could even figure out a way to stop them and not have to add another mule to the house.  Yes, that was her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn still hadn't stopped holding her hand over her stomach.  She really was trying to ignore the fact that she was afraid of what was happening to her, and pushing out any thoughts that suggested to her that she had made a deal with this demon just to save her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" the demon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open slowly with a creak.  Dawn took a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot,\" Dawn said.  \"I'll find somebody by midnight, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sundown.  It's sundown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not make it an even midnight?  I mean, don't you demons like that time of night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tribe uses a lunar calender,\" the demon said.  \"Now hurry.  You don't have much time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon tried a maniacal laugh, but stopped when it came out sounding cheesy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn locked the door behind her.  She still had that journal.  She still had an entire library with possible clues.  But for the minute she realized she had best make contact with the other sisters, or at least Tiffany.  Her vanishing so completely might raise some eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's phone bleeped at her.  While in the dead zone of the basement Tiffany had left her a message.  The sisters were moving them in.  They were already going over there.  They were each getting their own rooms and everything.  Dawn could swear Tiffany was sounding more enthusiastic by the minute about being a sorority sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey, Dawn!  This is Tiffany!  We're gonna' move all of ours and Tamisa's stuff over to the house.  You know we all get our own rooms since they have so many free ones and we're gonna' be right next to each other still so that's awesome!  I'm so excited!  I bet you're studying, right?  It's okay!  We might even be done by the time you're done, these girls can move really fast.  If you want to reorganize your things in your room they can help with that, too!  They're soooo good at moving things, it's incredible.  Well, byyyye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, all her clothes still fit, of course she's still excited.</i> Dawn thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose Kappas could not only move in a hurry, but they did it silently.  Dawn passed nobody while crossing campus on that Saturday afternoon.  The dorms were mostly quiet.  Her and Tiffany's room was nearly empty.  Dawn didn't know whether to be impressed or disturbed.  Their dressers and desks were already moved.  A few unpacked boxes remained.  Dawn checked their closet and found her clothes were still there.  Good, she needed a change.  She felt grimy after a night of gorging, sleeping in her clothes, and then being stuck in a demon lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unfortunately still too warm to put on a jacket, so Dawn settled on a clingy t-shirt.  She didn't like the way it was stretched around her tummy.  She especially didn't like the way even this pair of jeans was more snug than it should be.  Her profile showed a clear little bulge on her stomach.  Was her ass getting bigger?  Did her face look fuller yet?  Dawn didn't think so.  It was a long time since Dawn looked at her self so long in a mirror.  She had a very un-Dawnlike thought as she did so.  She thought about how sexy she looked, how beautiful, and how much she dreaded anything changing at all.  Even the tiny soft stomach she had now was becoming repugnant to her.  She had a fleeting thought that this was the Kappa influence.  That perhaps by being aware of their plans, any kind of subtle magic to make new mules ignore their weight gain had backfired on her, and she was becoming hyper-aware and hyper-sensitive.  Sure, that Lindsey had ballooned up in just a few months without fully being aware, but she didn't know what was happening to her.  Did the demon work this subtle magic on them, too, or was it a separate spell the Kappas cast to make it easier for them?  Or, was Dawn also considered, was she just feeling guilty for agreeing to give the Kappas another victim just so she wouldn't have to get as fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself away from her reflection.  It was time to get to work.</span></div></div>",

She shifted in her seat, unable to get completely comfortable with the way her jeans were pinching her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Make that a kid the day after the candy store...</i>, she thought.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, it was easy to come up with justifications why it wouldn't really be so bad to invite this girl or that into the Kappas for a little while, but it was just as easy for her to find the flaws in her own reasoning.  She felt like she had a little angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, just like in cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that girl?\" suggested the devil.  \"She's dressed for basketball.  She's an athlete.  She'll work off the pounds in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" said the angel.  \"She could get kicked off the team.   Do you really want that on your conscience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about <i>her</i>?  She's skin and bones,\" the devil continued.  \"Probably anorexic.  Why, you might be saving her life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the cost of destroying her psychologically,\" the angel pointed out.  \"You know very well what something like that would do to someone already suffering from body image issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about that fat girl over there?   Nobody said she had to start out thin.   I mean, she probably wouldn't even notice twenty or thirty more pounds, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For shame!   At her size, more weight could endanger her health!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on.  There just was no girl she could bring herself to subject to the Kappa treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd only bought a few carrot sticks to nibble on, but as she shifted position she realized that she was becoming very full.    <i>The others must be having lunch</i>, she thought.  And as usual, not showing an ounce of restraint.   That strengthened her resolve.  If she didn't do something, it would be <i>her</i> subjected to even more of the Kappa treatment -- at least finding another girl would help mitigate things a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scanned the room again.  There!  A  slender girl carrying a large tray of pasta and garlic bread, with a thick slab of chocolate cake on the side.   She was perfect!  Obviously, she had a great metabolism.  She wouldn't gain more than five pounds, Dawn was sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how sure are you that you can do something to stop the Kappas?\" the angel wondered aloud.  Dawn told it to shut up and hurried over to intercept the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, uh, excuse me, I couldn't help but notice... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looked the girl up and down.   She was pale and freckled, about as ginger as it was possible to be, and her long red hair was held back loosely in a clip.  She was short, maybe under five feet, and not quite as thin as Dawn had assumed at first.  Maybe even a little chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Short people put on weight really easily--\" began the angel, but Dawn shushed it again and took a good look at the girl's clothes, trying to find any clue she could latch onto.   Cute white capris.    A powder-blue T-shirt with a silhoette of a sailboat on it.    Good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I noticed you were interested in sailing, and my sorority, the Kappas, has been thinking of, um, buying a boat, you know, to go boating.   So we're looking for girl who are, you know, into sailing.  To teach us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well,\" the girl said, blushing.  \"I don't know the first thing about sailing, really.  This is just a shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Dawn said.   She <i>really</i> didn't want to let this one get away.  She already felt so stuffed she doubted she could sit down again without taking off her pants.  \"Um... do you want to join anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl brightened.  \"The Kappas?  Sure, I heard they were great!  Do I need to, I dunno, interview with somebody or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn put a hand to her mouth to stifle a belch.  \"Oof.  No, you're in.  We can head over and get your inducted now.\"   Her stomach gurgled, and she winced.  \"<i>Right</i> now.... uh... what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randi,\" the girl said, grinning.  \"Let me just set this tray down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can bring your lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi laughed.  \"What, this?  This isn't mine!  I was just grabbing seconds for Amanda.\"  She nodded her head towards the portly girl Dawn had considered earlier.   \"I <i>wish</i> I could eat like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What -- what do you mean?\"  Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that if I ate all that, I'd probably weigh about a bazillion pounds!\"   Randi said fervently.   \"I barely have to <i>look </i>at fattening food and I just put on weight like crazy!   I heard the Kappas are pretty good at keeping their members thin, though...\"  She giggled.  \"Maaaaaybe I'd be only grabbing a brownie.  Gosh!  The Kappas!  I'm so happy, I could just burst!\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nI wonder if stakes work on shoulder angels?</i>, Dawn thought glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna breathed a sigh of relief.  Things were looking up for the Kappas.  They had gotten three mules to replace one lost one, and one of not only was gorgeous befitting a Kappa, but showed intelligence and initiative.  If they could get another six by next Friday, they would be at the minimum and out of the red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she was naturally miffed when the other girls showed hesitation at their bubbly new sister Randi.  They didn't object to how quickly she was rushed through the initiation, of course, but that she just wasn't Kappa material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, she's got a gut,\" Ellen said, taking a huge bite of a massive ham sandwich, and continued with a full mouth, \"And she's so ginger.  Really, we can do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desperate times, Ellen,\" she said.  \"We have to lower our standards a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was walking into their little side den as they spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no room to talk,\" she said to Ellen, annoyed but not angry, \"She's a little soft but she's not fat.  You were so fat when you came to us you were practically a ball.  We wouldn't have looked twice at you if it wasn't for your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen looked a hurt by the memory of her old fat days, and stopped complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that Dawn?\" Melanie said.  \"Think she'll make through the first year and stick with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping so,\" Jenna said as she plopped down.  \"That girl's got what it takes.  Reminds me of me four years ago, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you started blowing up the minute you joined a sorority,\" Ellen said between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke about that,\" Jenna snapped.  \"We don't have much time to get up to code.  We need more pledges and we need them now.  If you two showed half the effort Dawn has in one day we wouldn't be in this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna huffed and left, leaving Melanie and Ellen to seethe.  She was right, of course.  They had been riding easy.  But it wasn't just their fault the house was in such a state.  Jenna's managing had a lot to do with it.  But they knew they couldn't complain.  Their lives and figures would be on the line if they crossed the already overstressed Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, that was a photo finish</i>, Dawn thought, stifling a belch despite being alone, reading, in her new sorority room.  She could tell some of the girls weren't pleased at Randi.  Why, she was merely cute, and a little pudgy, not the beautiful goddess the Kappas should expect.  So Dawn was a little surprised their accepted her, especially so quickly.  They must be in worse straits than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn could feel the fullness taking hold as the girls took Randi to be inducted.  She ran to her room just in time for her jeans to pop open from her bulging stomach.  It was the first time she had felt panic since joining the night before.  Viewing her profile in the mirror in her dorm, she could just bare tug her sweater down to cover the round bulge that didn't belong on her body.  They must have inducted her just in time for sundown, as the sudden surge in bloating she felt quickly subsided, leaving her only a little more painfully stuffed than she had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grimed at her reflection when she noticed the tiny rolls of skin squishing over her jeans.  <i>Great.  Those will be lovehandles by tomorrow night.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Even worse,</i> she added, <i>I think I'm starting to think like a Kappa.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited to go and see Randi.  She could hear the sisters moving about the house in a hurry, probably moving stuff in.  Occasionally the always enthusiastic Randi could be heard, still pleased and punch to be accepted, and not sounding the least concerned at the feast they had crammed down her throat during the \"interview.\"  Dawn wanted to get the library to look up what that demon might be, but didn't want to be seen sneaking around, so she tried looking online and found nothing.  This was a job for the kind of books that don't get uploaded into Google Books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi's room, it turned out, was across from hers and next to Tamisa's.  When Dawn stepped out after the commotion of moving died down, she saw the door was open.  Those Kappas work fast.  They already had Randi set up with a bed, and Randi was taking clothes out of boxes and hanging them in the closet.  She did look a little tired, and while not nearly as much as Dawn, a little bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaawn!\" Randi said, dropping a shirt she was putting on a hanger and rushing out as soon as she heard the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raaaandi,\" Dawn attempted the same excitement in her greeting, \"Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRand gave her a big hug, which did not go easy on Dawn's overstuffed tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls are so nice it's ridiculous,\" Randi said.  \"They moved all my stuff right away!  Can you believe it?  I'm so glad you asked me to join.  I just know this is where I ought to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's mind had been mostly on how full her stomach was, and how soft certain parts of her were certainly getting, and now switched to full on guilt mode at Randi's words.  It must have showed, as Randi's expression went from enthused to slightly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?  Did I do something wrong?  Did one of the girls say something about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn opened her mouth to speak, ready to confess, but instead belched, long and hard, for a full five seconds.  She blushed bright red and held her rounded belly in her hands.  She had forgotten her jeans were unbuttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi laughed, assuming Dawn's expression was just horrible gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Dawn said meekly, and before she could get another word out Randi was talking again and going in her room to put up clothes.  Dawn followed to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, these girls love their food,\" she patted her own stomach, \"I'm absolutely stuffed!  They'd better teach us their secrets to staying so thin soon or I'm going to blow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, no you won't--\" Dawn stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I will,\" Randi giggled.  \"You didn't know me in high school.  I was like 250 pounds until my senior year.  I just decided to get healthy and work at it--really, really work at it--and here I am!  Who would have thought I'd ever fit in with the Kappas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn really felt like crying at that revelation.  She could feel that good angel shaking a disappointed finger at her.  <i>Forget the angel.  What would Buffy say if she knew I put someone in danger like this?  To save myself?  Worse, just so I wouldn't get fat?  Still, I can't let this body go without a fight--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head to stop that train of thought.  That wasn't like her.  The Kappas might not be intentionally messing with her mind, but it certainly felt like they were, stuffing her day in and day out supposedly without her knowledge.  She knew her sister wouldn't give an innocent up to a crazy fattening cult even if it did mean she'd be doomed to a life of obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--normally go the movies on Sunday with Amanda but she can probably come, if you want to go, and there's probably more sister stuff to do I can get settled in with the sorority life.  This is all so new to me!  Dawn?  Did you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Dawn said.  She had zoned out while Randi had been going a mile a minute, straightening up her new room while Dawn was so distracted she barely helped at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asking what do you think we'll do tomorrow?  I figure it'd be a bunch of awesome sorority stuff, right?  What's the Sunday schedule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I only joined last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You must be the best new sister they have!  You already brought in a friend, and made a friend, and a bunch of other friends eventually, and--I think I might be using the word friend too much, you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe a little,</i> Dawn thought.  Normally she wouldn't mind Randi's extreme friendliness, but now it was just making her feel worse and worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randi, I'm going to do some homework before I go to bed.  I'll see you tomorrow, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Randi said as Dawn left, \"Sleep tight, k'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Dawn said quietly, stealing a glance at Randy's puffy stomach as she left, knowing it'd be fuller by the morning.  Exhausted, yet knowing she shouldn't waste another minute, Dawn planned her next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn thought that maybe Randi was just exceptionally excited about joining the Kappas, but as they strolled to the house she discovered that Randi was excited about everything.  Several times she greeted someone who Dawn assumed was a long-time friend, but Randi explained they simply had a class together.  She was certainly friendly enough to be a Kappa, at least.  She wouldn't have to fake being overly interested in new sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived several guys were leaving.  They smiled and nodded politely, then went on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, you're just in time!\" Tiffany yelled from inside.  \"They moved all of our stuff in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they work fast!  Didn't you just join last night?  That's crazy!\" Randi said, apparently enthused by the prospect of rapid moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, isn't it?\" Tiffany bounced out.  \"Bye, guys!\" she waved to retreating guys, who Dawn recognized as being from a fraternity on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tiffany, this is, um, Randi--urp--\" Dawn couldn't suppress a little burp.  She self-consciously patted her stomach, trying very hard to not stare at her friend's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, they were both fuller than last night, and, Dawn thought with increasing dread, some of that fullness was quickly becoming fat, but this was ridiculous.  Tiffany wasn't even bothering to pull her shirt down over her bloated belly, and she had at some point switched to stretchy yoga pants.  In fact, her formerly stick-thin friend had a tummy that looked a lot like Randi's own little one, even if the rest of her still looked as slender as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tiffany,\" Tiffany grabbed Randi's hands and the two shook and giggled vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Well, these two should get along, at least,</u> Dawn thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Jenna,\" Jenna appeared from behind.  \"Are you Dawn's friend?  Any friend of a sister's is a friend of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jenna had any concerns about letting Randi in, she didn't show it.  Dawn knew Randi wasn't exactly Kappa material, but then she wouldn't have thought she was herself.  Randi was cute, of course, but far from the beauty that the Kappas seemed to value so highly.  And she was average build, and not the variations of slim and/or toned like the rest of the sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually she just asked if I'd like to join, and we came right over.  Isn't that great?\" Randi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!  Come on inside and meet the others.  We'll have to see if your right for the house, of course, but you seem like Kappa material to me.\"  If not for the fact that her clothes were getting more uncomfortable as the day went on, and that both her and her best friend's stomachs were stretched to their limits, Dawn would have taken Jenna's tone as completely sincere.  Jenna glanced over at Dawn with a look she could only interpret as impressed.  Dawn hadn't been around all day, but she was barely in the house for twelve hours and was already bringing in pledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn made up an excuse about having to take care of something, and then ran to the library as fast as her uncomfortably full and active stomach would let her.  She was feeling a little jiggle around her middle, just slightly, that she was sure wasn't there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you dropped off that poor innocent girl to be fattened while you run off to find another victim?\" that hypothetical shoulder angel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shut up, I have to read that journal and return it before they induct Randi</i>, Dawn thought to no one.  She realized she might have jumped the gun in not taking care of that first.  The journal could hold clues that might have made finding a new receiver unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a secluded corner of the library's lower floor, Dawn found a comfortable chair and took the journal out of her bookbag.  She also, with an audible groan and a wince, undid her jeans to sit more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journal was old, but not ancient, and it was in good shape despite its obvious age.  She had trouble seeing anything on the pages when she first opened it.  Sure, there were words, but there were too many of them.  The parchment-like paper shimmered like a hologram with handwriting overlaying other handwriting, as if it had been written and rewritten dozens of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it's like those magic eye books from the 90s</i>.  Only by holding it at a certain angle was Dawn finally able to make out the most recent entries.  It was written in a blue ballpoint pen.  Nothing special about that.  The date was over two years before, and it was an oath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, Jenna Greene, take the office of head of this chapter with the honest intent to do everything in my power to further the goals of all my fellow sisters, in this and every house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe signed and dated it.  The text now fully in focus, Dawn read the first entry, a terse account of how Jenna came to replace to former head . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . . Jenna couldn't race to her room fast enough.  She slammed the door and locked it.  A mirror was on the wall opposite.  She viewed her reflection with dismay.  She was beautiful, and like all Kappas took great pride in that, and so the punishment she had been dealt was all the more horrible.  She was only trying to help the house.  She was always trying to help.  But that incompetent bitch Lucy didn't care.  She was so full of herself, so concerned with her own short-sighted desires that she was was letting this chapter fall into ruin.  Membership was down to a record low.  Pledges were leaving as fast as they could find them, and that meant lowering their standards, which meant less and less pledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna also knew, as did the other girls, that Lucy wasn't just derelict of her duty, but she had been stealing from the sorority coffers all year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was going to let it go.  Lucy would be gone by the end of the year, and Jenna was a shoe-in for the new head.  Except that Lucy had forced her hand by punishing her like this, and only for going over her head to organize fund-raising and pledge-recruiting functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's stomach moaned.  She pressed her hands into.  She could already feel the fullness of the entire house of sisters descending upon her.  She cried softly.  With a grunt she tore off her jeans and her shirt, putting on frumpy sweatpants and a baggy hoodie.  If she was going to balloon up before her eyes she did not want to feel her clothes growing tighter, her buttons popping, her shirt riding up to expose what was becoming of that flat, sexy stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her eyes.  She had to work fast.  She had a few calls to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie and Ellen came by hours later.  By then Jenna was just biding her time.  She was lying on her back, her eyes closed, trying to ignore the creaking sounds her expanding body kept making.  A layer of fat had swelled out all over her body, but her stomach was so stuffed that it was almost rock hard to the touch, and rose up past her now bloated breasts like a medicine ball.  Occasionally a great rumbling would cause her to shift, and the way the fabric of her sweats rubbing against her reminded her that her hips were far too wide, that she didn't even want to see her ass now, and that even her arms were thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we come in, Jen?\" Ellen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jenna said.  She tried to sit up, but the effort required depressed her, and so she stayed in her lying position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy said she'll only keep you as the mule until midnight.  But she probably has something . . . embarrassing planned for you, you know, when you come out tomorrow,\" Melanie said.  \"But, hey, it's only like thirty pounds, right?  Not much more than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to say,\" Jenna said, still not getting up.  \"I would be worrying more about Lucy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, the other girls think she was way out of line--\" Ellen started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  She'll be out by morning, so don't even think about her.  I told the higher ups everything.  They're looking into her right now.  They might even come and get before we can even say good bye.  What a shame.  But that's what happens when you go against your sisters.  Thank you for your lovely support, girls, but right now I'd like to be alone.  I'm not feeling very . . . presentable right now.  Good night.  I'll be sorry if I don't get to see Lucy off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was dragged out kicking and screaming by mooks sent by the senior house leaders the next morning, Dawn read.  Jenna was voted into the chapter head the very next day.  Her body was back to its old self within weeks, with the Kappa diet being what it was.  Furthermore, because of Lucy's negligence the leaders had made a deal; half of the calories of this house would be allowed to be put into storage for two years to allow them time to get up to speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt created a backlog of calories for the demon to store until there were enough receivers to handle them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dawn read the other short entries, this backlog kept coming up.  It ran out just before summer.  That's why Lindsey had grown so fast.  That's why Dawn, Tiffany, and Tamisa were as full as they were.  That's why Jenna was frantic to find more mules and fast.  The last entry was dated weeks before, and Dawn did not like what it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our time is up.  I refuse to allow me or any of my sisters to take the place of pledge mules.  We'll have to get by with whatever pledges we have, even if that means resorting to drastic measures.  Mandy's looking into spells that might help.  Hate to be a pledge now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gulped audible.  She rubbed the exposed, taut skin of her stomach.  Somehow, she was afraid that this wasn't drastic enough for Jenna.</span></div></div>",

The other Kappas must be putting on a feast for Randi.  She experimented with trying to button her jeans again, but found her increasingly hard, round stomach firmly blocking the effort.  Worse yet, her t-shirt had ridden up again.  Pulling it down just made it snap back up.  That's the problem with form-fitting clothes, they always fit your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid the journal into its resting place, looking up at the demon statue.  It seemed asleep, or possibly not present.  She wasn't going to have a heart to heart with it just now, though.  She made straight for her room, leaving the dank lair as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn made up her mind to call Buffy.  If Buffy couldn't help herself, there were plenty of other slayers who could.  She was in over her head and knew it.  Not only was she feeling guilty for bringing in a sucker to save her own slim ass, but Dawn was certain that anyone who came to help would find her much puffier than she was comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't go upstairs to the rooms without passing the social hall, and so had to make a very quick appraisal of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were feasting again, although less so than last night when there were a dozen pledges to impress.  Some, including Jenna, were crowded around Randi who appeared delighted with the attention.  Tiffany laughed with them and smiled nearby, trying to take part but mostly just soaking up the air of good humor.  Dawn noticed Tamisa sitting dejected on a chair in the corner, with Ellen apparently trying to cheer her up.  Tamisa looked tired, slouching, her hands listlessly rubbing her stomach, hidden by a baggy windbreaker that completely hid her trim--and, Dawn knew, currently bloated--body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn,\" Jenna said, begging Randi and other girl's pardon for minute as she rushed to Dawn in the hall.  \"I am impressed,\" she took Dawn's hand in what looked like a sincere show of friendship.  \"It's only been one day and you're already recruiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing--\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nothing.  Our chapter has been losing members for years now and I think you could breath some life into us.  This is a good thing,\" she smiled.  \"Keep this up and there will be big things in your future, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Big things like my ass,</i> Dawn said as she attempted a pleased expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jenna.  I'm just, well, I'm just glad I can help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll initiate Randi tonight.  She's got a really . . . good attitude,\" Jenna nodded firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go check something first but I'll be back down in a few minutes,\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.  It's been a long day, I know.  And you have to get settled in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, Dawn remembered.  They have swiftly moved her and Tiffany out of their dorm and into two separate rooms.  Dawn assumed that made them less likely to catch onto each others mysteriously rapid weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn saw the boxes in her room packed efficiently and, to the sisters credit, securely.  They must have it down to a science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what time it was in England, where Buffy and Slayer Co. had their operations.  It was probably early morning.  Her sister's cell was not operational, which would have had Dawn worried had she not known that she was often in places were keeping a cell phone wouldn't be practical.  Roman crypts.  Indian burial mounds.  Regular places like that.  So she dialed their headquarters and hoped somebody was still awake.</span></div></div>",

She then belched loudly into her phone as her stomach shifted another influx of food aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sincerely say I am not disappointed with this call yet,\" Xander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry--uuurp--I'm kind of, um, bloated at the minute.  Which is kind of why I'm calling . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn filled Xander in on the last day, not even leaving out how she convinced Randi to join.  She knew she was a heel for doing it, but Xander didn't judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\". . . . And if you could send somebody to shut this place down fast I would reaaaaally appreciate it because I'm pretty sure I'm already getting fat and fat would not be a good look for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to worry about,\" Xander said, in a commanding tone Dawn found surprising.  She remembered him as more taking orders than giving them.  \"I'll get the closest slayer to go on there and clean them out--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait, we're connected to them somehow, me and Tiffany and the others.  I don't know what will happen if slayers just come in roundhouse kicking the doors down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also not a problem!  Already have the boys looking into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the boy.  And a few ladies, and Andrew.  It's late and we're shortstaffed.  Buffy would come if she could, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right,\" Dawn said, a little relieved.  \"I'm kind of relieved.  I blew my first shot on my own.  And I got somebody else involved.  And she probably has bigger problems than college girls getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't beat yourself up, kid.  It's not an easy thing we do.  I'm sure Buffy would be proud that you tried to do this on your own and . . . okay, I'm moving into after school special territory here so I might have to let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Dawn giggled, stifling another belch.  \"I need to get back down there before they miss me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Righto, Dawno.  I'll let you know when we find something.  And if a slayer shows up, follow her lead.  Unless she wants to follow your lead.  Ah, you two kids will work it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Xander,\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night and good luck,\" Xander said, hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn breathed a sigh of relief.  Well, as heavy as she could considering how her stomach was getting so full she was starting to have difficulty breathing.  Before leaving she made the mistake of looking in the bathroom mirror at her profile, noticing that her stomach was just as swollen as it felt.  She rubbed it and pouted.  She couldn't even suck it in.  She dug through one of the neatly organized boxes and found a long-sleeved t-shirt that was long enough to cover her stomach.  It didn't hide the fact that she was horrendously bloated, but at least she wasn't displaying her bare belly to the world anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time to back down with the girls and make nice, biding her time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn only caught snippets of the three sisters' conversation as they approached.  She gathered that they were looking for new members.  That, and the fact that they suddenly turned and smiled like maniacs at them as her and Tiffany approached made her question the decision to talk to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Tiffany.  I gotta' do some studying,\" Dawn stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but, but, I can't talk to them alone, what'll I say?\" Tiffany whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo answer her, the smallest, loudest of the three was at her side, already holding her arm like they were best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey!  You wouldn't be looking to find out more about our lovely sorority life over at Kappa Phi Delta Gamma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was taken aback, but then joined in the girl's excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite blonde yanked Tiffany away to pitch the sorority to her.  To Dawn, it sounded too much like something a religious nut handing out pamphlets at an airport would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, Tiff,\" Dawn waved, and walked off wondering if they still had religious nuts handing out pamphlets at airports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the library.  If Tiffany was joining some weird, cultish group of ultra-thin college girls Dawn wanted to know what they were about.  The rumors she heard were vague, referring only to the fact that Kappa house was more secretive than other houses, and that they were definitely into esoteric topics at the higher levels.  They certainly didn't seem like nerds of the occult, but appearances weren't everything, even if they were extremely important to the Kappas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up news articles from the past hundred years yielded instant results.  For one thing, every couple of years since the early 1930s there would be an article about how the Kappas were losing members, dwindling from their glory days in the 20s.  Then there was some kind of mysterious incident in 1933.  The details were scanty.  A girl either disappeared or died tragically, and the Kappas were suspected of accidentally causing this.  Maybe through hazing?  Maybe a demon ate her?  Speculation wasn't Dawn's strong suit.  She was training herself to think only of the facts and let the interpretation come from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen by chance she stumbled on some blogs by former Kappa members.  Details were vague there, too, perhaps from a nondisclosure agreement they signed when they joined the house.  The few blogs she found from Kappas who stayed only rarely mentioned any goings on within their sorority.  One thing was clear--these girls who left stayed only briefly and were not happy.  Dawn must have skimmed a dozen journals of college girls--did she sound that whiny in her diary, Dawn wondered--and noticed a distinct pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThin girl joins.  Thin girl gains a lot of weight.  Thin girl leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most recent one involved a Japanese exchange student named Keiko who put on eighty pounds while being the sorority for only three months.  Dawn sent her an e-mail to ask if she had any information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly 8:00 when Tiffany called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" Tiffany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the library doing research.  About these Kappas--\" Dawn began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna go to a party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?  It's, um, not at the Kappa house, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!  We're invited!\" Dawn could picture Tiffany's expression over the phone.  So hopeful, joyful, at the very prospect of being near this sorority.  Dawn didn't get it.  Tiffany was never obsessed with popularity in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn thought about the potential information she could by going to the party.  She could question the sisters first hand.  She could even explore the building.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't matter if you're the lowliest, greasiest nerd or the hottest, most popular cheerleader, high school can beat down all but the toughest souls.  And Dawn Summers was feeling the pressure.  Her grades were suffering from stress at home.  Her sister was going through a rough time.  Her mother was sick.  And at school, her few friends weren't too happy themselves.  Jennifer, a constant companion, had been out sick for two days.  Dawn finally got word that she had developed acne so bad she had to be hospitalized.  Dawn visited her, and left more depressed than ever.  She tried to talk to Buffy about things, but she had problems of her own.<br>\r\nThe worst part at school was her friend Danielle.  Danielle was an outcast like Dawn--pretty and shy, but prone to being so awkward around others that she made few friends.  Danielle found solace in books about the occult and magic.  Dawn found this amusing most of the time, but sometimes seriously considered letting her in on the family slayer secret.  Real live proof that the magic she studied could actually exist would certainly brighten her life.  And sharing all these secrets with someone else her age would ease the burden Dawn was feeling more and more with each passing year.<br>\r\nBut Danielle was talking to her less and less.  To add insult to injury, Dawn found that she was on speaking terms now with the queen bitch of the popular crowd, Heather.  Heather was everything any popularity-aspiring high school student wanted to be.  She was stunning, articulate, intelligent but still socially adept.  And she never liked Dawn in particular, so it was especially hurtful when Danielle started ditching Dawn more and more to hang out with her new image-obsessed friends.<br>\r\nWhen Dawn told Danielle that Jennifer was in the hospital, she just looked sheepish and walked away.  She couldn't even respond.  Dawn, teenage hormones raging, went to the bathroom and cried.<br>\r\nIt was a very cathartic few minutes until Heather and her cronies entered, fixing their make-up in the mirror and chatting idly, a mix of gossip and insults.<br>\r\nHeather suddenly stopped in mid-sentence.  Dawn quieted her sobbing, not wanting to be caught like this.  Heather's high-quality imported high heels approached her stall all the same.  The other girls stayed behind, giggling and whispering.<br>\r\n\"Dawn Summers?\" Heather's deep, sensual voice came through the door.  Dawn suddenly noticed how different it sounded from the beginning of the year.  More mature, sexier even.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Dawn, no longer crying, but her voice still quivered when she spoke.<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful even with those little boobs,\" Heather said.  Dawn didn't know how to take that.  It sounded sincere, but the girls giggling behind her could mean otherwise.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Dawn repeated.<br>\r\n\"I mean it,\" Heather said through the door.  Dawn could tell she was striking a cocky pose even though she could only see her feet.  \"I wish I could keep my stomach as flat as yours.  And forget about my ass, that just gets out of control if I don't watch it.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank . . . you . . .?\" Dawn was thoroughly confused.  She knew she was being set up for something insulting or embarrassing, but she didn't know what.<br>\r\nThere was silence from behind the door.  A long minute went by before Heather spoke again.<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it while you can,\" Heather said at last.  Her and her friends turned and left.<br>\r\nDawn sat on the toilet with a confused expression.  Her hand was no self-consciously holding her--as Heather said--flat stomach.  Was that a threat, a promise, a warning, a weird zing?</span></div></div>",

They were planning on practicing a few moves of their own, Cordelia recently becoming unimpressed with the others on her squad.  Harmony never showed up.  After waiting a generous five minutes Cordelia went back to the locker room to change.  She wasn't used to being stood up, and hSoped there was a damned good explanation.<br>\r\nShe would call Harmony once she cooled down.  She opened her locker and changed from her shorts to her form-fitting designer jeans and belt.  Looking sexy after a disappointment always made her feel better.  As she reached for her shirt she saw something in her locker.  It wasn't there before, and so must have been put there within the last ten minutes since she arrived, changed, and waited.<br>\r\nShe took out the heart-shaped box and the first thing she noticed was an intoxicating aroma.  They must be chocolates, but she had never known chocolate candies to smell like this.  It gave her a pleasant, light-headed feeling just holding them.<br>\r\nNow, Cordelia was just getting used to the idea of the supernatural.  She had accepted that the perennial loser Buffy and her friends were doing some kind of work to keep the forces of evil at bay, and in her own way she appreciated that.  So her decision to not eat the chocolates was not out of fear of poison, but that they were somehow linked the insane magical stuff she had been trying to put out of her mind.<br>\r\nAnd yet, without even changing out of her clingy school t-shirt, Cordelia opened the box.  Her hands were on auto-pilot as she did so, her mind telling her that the scent was just too tempting to resist.  There was no note inside, just twenty, ordinary looking chocolates<br>\r\nCordelia bit her lip, trying to fight the temptation.  She gave in all too quickly, and was rewarded with a cherry-filled delight so rich, so sweet, that she actually went weak in the knees from eating.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm!\" she moaned with pleasure.  She had never had that reaction to any food before.  Without a second thought she had popped the next one in her mouth,. moaning in ecstacy.<br>\r\nShe heard another, softer moan from around the lockers.  This gave her pause, and for a moment she was able to resist these sweets that were somehow making her eat them.  Her hand was rubbing her satisfied midsection, sending waves of pleasure to her mind.  The chocolates might as well have been yelling in here ear, the urge to inhale them was so powerful.<br>\r\nShe took a few steps toward the row of lockers and heard another moan.  Cautiously--while popping another chocolate in her mouth--she peered around the corner and discovered what happened to Harmony.<br>\r\nCordelia gasped when she saw her friend, but didn't drop the chocolates.<br>\r\nHarmony was lying agains the lockers, her eyes half-closed and a pained, distressed look on her face.  She was wearing her work-out shorts and t-shirt, and her stomach was exposed as a big, round, flabby dome sticking out further than her breasts.  Even her breasts, already impressive, were swollen and starting to droop towards her belly.  Her thighs were straining the limits of her shorts, as her arms did her shirt.  Her face, somewhat soft to begin with, was almost round.  Her lips were puckered from the added fat on her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Harmony?  What is going on?\" Cordelia took a few cautious steps toward her friend.  The gears were beginning to turn.  She couldn't pull her eyes away from her friend's destroyed body--as another chocolate greedily was shoved into her mouth, her stomach groaning and quivering with delight.<br>\r\n\"Cordy?\" Harmy said, barely conscious.  \"Help me . . .\"<br>\r\nThen Cordelia stopped.  She saw the same box of chocolates she had lying next to her prone friend.  It was empty.  Harmony was now fifty pounds heavier and couldn't even stand.<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" Cordelia said, bringing her hand to her mouth, which coincidentally had a chocolate ready to be eaten in it.  It slid down her throat without protest, like the others, and her stomach now felt strangely, uncomfortably full.<br>\r\nCordelia pressed her hand to her flatt, toned tummy and felt something shifting deep inside her.<br>\r\n\"Oh . . . oh God!\" she repeated, her eyes going wide in shock as she felt the first feeling of bloatedness under her hand, her jeans feeling just a tiny bit tighter.</span></div></div>",

But no, Alisha held her ground, or at least half her ground.  It was past 10:00 and five-year-old Lizzy was two hours past her bedtime, hiding under a blanket finishing up the second \"adult\" movie Alisha let her watch.  She knew her parents wouldn't let her watch an actual scary movie, so Alisha decided to play the original Willy Wonka and the remake for her.  Despite being clearly disturbed by the first-as any sane person would be-she still insisted she be allowed to watch the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha didn't really care too much.  She was sixteen and a babysitter, so she basically spent the night on the phone with her friends.  Only when the second movie was done did Alisha actually go and check on Lizzy, still with the phone in her hand.  She found the poor girl half asleep and shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lizzy, bedtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy looked up at her with frightened eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna',\" she said, clearly trying to turn a fearful appearance into a defiant one.  Alisha wasn't going to take the time to deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I let you stay up and watch movies like you wanted.  Now do me a favor and get some sleep, 'k?\" she then said into the phone, \"Yeah, I'm putting her to bed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much reluctance Lizzy agreed.  She didn't say anymore, but she really was scared.  Almost every scene, jumbled up in her childish brain, was contorted into something even more horrifying.  She already anticipated nightmares involving oompa loompas and a maniacal mad scientist performing horrific experiments on kids like her.  Alisha didn't care and she knew it, but to Lizzy there were other concerns.  Even at her young age she realized that her being scared, or sad, or upset, had implications beyond when others had those feelings.  There was something inside her, or maybe something around her, that made already bad things worse.  Still too young to understand, but old enough to know that this wasn't normal, she was often silent when things outside the ordinary happened when she was upset.  She started to understand she was responsible but didn't yet know if it was intentional or outside her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I still got like another hour here.  Hey, what was the homework for Mr. Duncan's class . . .?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha sat lie on the couch while Lizzy lie in bed, shivering, afraid not just from normal childhood thoughts, but from what those thoughts might turn into.  If Alisha had taken time to comfort her, it might have made some difference, but then Lizzy's moods were powerful ones not easily changed.  And Alisha was just a sixteen-year-old girl, more self-absorbed than the usual teenage.  She worried about what her friends thought, what her enemies thought, that she was getting too fat, the normal things.  Lizzy had noticed on some level that her babysitter was getting larger lately, although she was not quite fat yet.  Lizzy remembered watching the original Willy Wonka, thinking of the fat kid who fell into the chocolate . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy heard a dripping sound from the other room.  A clash or a bang would have alarmed her, but this just made her think the faucet was leaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, Julie, gotta' check this,\" she said, leaving the phone as she went to make sure a flood was on her hands.  The faucet in the kitchen was fine.  She heard the dripping again, but this time it grew steadily, eventually sounding like a sloshing sound coming from the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, the washing machine,\" Alisha said.  She had used it earlier, but that was hours ago.  Could something have broken?  She'd certainly not get paid if she flooded the house.  She opened the door and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmooth melted chocolate spilled out of the pantry.  It surrounded her shoes, getting onto her legs.  She stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-?  Gross, what is this?\" she said as the sludge continued to spill out.  It seemed to be coming from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the floor dipped under her where the river was coming from.  She cried out, hopping to the side.  The river deepened as the chocolate flowed out of the kitchen, into the living room, and then god knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the river grow in width and depth she became entranced by its flow.  She wasn't about to try to drink it, though.  That would be ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my dear, you like what you see?  Well, be careful, this river is dangerous,\" said a man coming from out of the closet.  He was dressed in a flamboyant purple suit, top hat, and had a wild mess of hair.  He looked, Alisha realized as she stepped away, frozen in shock, like some kind of version of Willy Wonka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're-you're-\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me me?  What about you you?\" he said, \"Like I said, though, you should be careful.  This river is dangerous, it's not for swimming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha stepped back.  \"I-I-I wasn't going to . . \"  Rapidly regaining her composure Alisha's plan was to flee and call for help, but this Wonka was too fast for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's especially bad for chubby girls to get near it, no offense,\" the man said with a grin.  He was next to her now, standing along the bank of the rushing chocolate river flowing through the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chubby?\" Alisha said, offended despite her fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act surprised,\" the Wonka person said, he then patted her stomach playfully, \"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha jumped back, pushing him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's spotted you,\" he said, grinning wildly.  Something was coming out of the river, or rather, the river itself grew an appendage, a blob.  Alisha backed into the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, young lady, but I'm afraid it thinks you'll make a good home,\" the man leaned on his cane, looking almost sorry.  Alisha didn't have time to think.  She pushed her hands in front of her face but was too slow to stop the river tendril from rushing into her mouth.  She tried to scream and only gurgled, forced to the floor as she felt herself swallowing more and more of the rich, thick chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't drown in it but it'll drown in you it seems.  At least as much as you'll hold, mm?\" the man prodded Alisha's tummy with his cane.  It was getting full now, rounding out, popping her shorts open and pushing her shirt up.  She had to stop trying to force the chocolate back and now grab her stomach, hoping to stop it from filling.  Every cry was a helpless gurgle.  She was virtually paralyzed with panic as the river continued to fill her, plumping her belly further and further from its normal state.  She felt she would burst.  Tears streamed from her eyes.  There was no hope,  she was simply too full of chocolate to get any more into her.  Her stomach rose up and outward a foot, two feet, maybe more, sloshing and forcing her onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gluuurrgggle please stop!\" she finally screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes.  The man was gone.  The river was gone.  But her the chocolate on her face, the stains on her shirt, and her enormous, heavy belly remained.  With a sad croak, Alisha finally screamed for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Lizzy heard the sounds, having no idea what was really happening.  She wanted it to stop but didn't know how.  So she hid under her blanket.  She didn't even come out when she heard Alisha yelling, begging for somebody to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere, down the dark streets of Sunnydale, a creepy man in purple strode waving a cane and humming a jaunty tune to himself.</span></div></div>",
