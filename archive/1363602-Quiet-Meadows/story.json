Looking at the map reveals a green space reserved only for the forest itself. The small town you're on the outskirts of didn't even gain a mention on it, which really doesn't bode well for finding anything of value in it. Leaving you care behind, you walk down the road as the Sun sets, the shadows creeping down on the place rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a good view of the town itself with a small sign to your left proclaiming the legend \"Welcome to Quite Meadows. Population.\" With the rest having been scratched into being completely indecipherable. Looking out over the town itself, you can see it's large enough to support at least a triple digit figure population. The buildings are low, with nothing really standing above two storeys. The lights on the roads slowly light up to reveal each street is empty, making things look rather eerie and feel lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to overlook that for now, you cast your eye to a small map beside the sign. At last, something useful! You glance over the map to see if there's anything of interest and several buildings pop up on the faded paint. A hospital is to the far north, which might be handy, if see if there's a pharmacy you can pick up supplies for your trip there. A hotel is closer to the south, which, considering the time of day, might be a good place to head for. An actual mechanic's is only a few streets away, but there's no guarantee that they'll be open now. Looking past the sign, you see a neon sign advertising a cafe which would be a boon, it's been a few hours since you last ate and that seems like a good a place as any to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever way you choose, you think it's best to do it now as it's getting really dark and the shadows are falling quickly. You also can't help but feel as if there's someone watching you, always an unsettling sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last glance over the map, you decide that there's only one course of action.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hospital is your top priority; the car crash truly damaged your spine and shoulder blades. Each time you take a step, your back reacts and prompts a painful awareness that blatantly and constantly bugs you. Hopefully, the employees at the site will procure medical needs and the price will be adequate...right? Somehow, you doubt that but proceed nonetheless. Health comes first and money after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the northern path, you simply can't shake off a bad sentiment; there is a hint of dread and despair in the atmosphere. Cars are parked on the side of the asphalt, yet they are covered in dust - they were most likely abandoned by their owners in the midst of whatever occurred to this supposedly dead town. The houses themselves are dark and empty, giving no impression of life from the interior. Let's not forget about those sinister buildings with a few light sources. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened to this place?\" You mumble to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the urge to hurry up to your destination now. There appeared to be some sort of grunt behind you but when you looked over your shoulder, there was absolutely nothing safe for obscurity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wonder who would actually live here. This place gives me the creeps,\" you comment to no one in particular, or maybe to that ghost standing right behind you. Nah, must be a hallucination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hospital is in your sight by now. The construction is roughly two stages with light constantly turning on and off. Quite different than the ones you've visited before - it gives the appearance of being a mental asylum instead of a health care. However, you are here and it's too late to go back now. Taking a deep breath, you enter in the lobby and surprisingly, it was as untenanted as the rest of the districts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Helllooooooo? </i> Anybody there?\" you shout through the room. Though, complete silence is what you received in response. Waiting a bit for something to occur, you decide to add in your two cents. \"I have cookies if anyone wants any?\" Remarkably, no one desired any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo well for your health now. It was ludicrous to think that there would be signs of living in the hospital in a deserted town. It doesn't look like you'll do much here so you backpedaled and were about to leave the surrounding when a voice catches your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!\" a feminine tone calls out to you. \"Quick, come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you notice a woman at the counter gesturing for you to follow her. She has an average height and is a brunette with long pelt that reached her back. Her brown eyes scanned your body in search for weapons but she did not see any. The young lady sported a black tank top with a...bulletproof vest? Accompanying the garment, she adorned green camo pants and soldier boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Are you gonna stand there and wait for them to come get you? Hurry up!\" She yells in a low tone. You have no idea what she was talking about - who was 'them'? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. I'm coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the stranger, she grabs you and sinks you to the floor with a finger on her lips to tell you to be quiet. Peering over the counter, she appears to be contemplating on something but you had no clue of what. After a few instances, she turns her glance back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? You could have been attacked right there. It's not safe to be wandering around the city with no weapons at all,\" the foreigner scolds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? What's out there?\" You ask, perplexed about the whole ordeal. \"I've walked through the block and I didn't see anything suspicious. Everything was just...empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were walking in the-- How are you still alive? They should have killed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would have killed me? Tell me what's happening, goddammit. My car crashed near the town and I had nowhere to go. If I could get some context, that would help,\" you practically demand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she sits down against the furniture with a sad expression. \"Ever since 15 years ago, we were all living a good life until <i>they</i> came. The tickle monsters emerged out of nowhere and killed so many of us in the blink of an eye. One by one, the inhabitants were hunted and tickled until they died of lack of oxygen. My parents and cousins were victims of their onslaught and I, as well as other survivors, are the only ones remaining. If you are detected by them, it is close to impossible to escape their wrath and they have unique abilities to accomplish their cruelty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle monsters? Are you serious?\" You query, disbelievingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nods. \"Yes, that's right. They trap human beings and strip them of their clothes. They track down your most ticklish spots and exploit them fully with their dreaded entities - which differ from each sorts of creatures. Even if you weren't sensitive anywhere, they have many ways to <i>make</i> you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, you gulp; you were pretty ticklish yourself and you knew which areas were high ranked on the scale. Never did you once believe that you could perish from laughter and the thought merely makes you shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, the name's Sonya. I can tell that you're injured with all that blood on you. Come on, I'll show you where the others are and get that treated for you,\" your new comrade smiles and guides you to another section of the building.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They might come off as...crude and vulgar at first, but you'll get used to them. We all do,\" Sonya recounts as she leads you to a straight and narrow hallway. \"And we have a nurse as well. She's very skilled at her job and she'll patch you up in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridors are empty and messy; the concrete wall is old and crumbling, some doors are broken and pieces of its former assembly are on the floor. Rats are snacking on food remnants and hospital beds have corpses of dead patients on them. The only thing that seems to be running fine is the lights - the electricity appears to be fully functional. A few blood puddles are discernible on the furniture around and a repugnant smell invades your nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" you blurted out, disgusted, \"and here I thought my apartment was filthy. What happened to this place? I thought that those Tickle Monsters only tickled people, not slaughter them. It looks like someone got brutally murdered here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. They do in fact tickle people to death but they eat them as well. Once they assure that you're dead, they devour your intestines and your limbs like you are their afternoon snack. Then, they burrow their way through your skull and take your brain as candy.\" A very grotesque description that almost made you throw up after hearing it. Thankfully, you just grimace in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now I know that I won't have lunch today. Is there any way to kill them?\" you ask inquisitively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are. However, it's not that easy to dispose of them since they always travel in packs. If you manage to kill one of them, the others will notice your presence and assault you right there and then. You won't stand a chance against them if you're not prepared,\" Sonya explained. You gulp at the image in your mind and shake your head. That could have definitely been you out there. \"In any case, we've arrived. Welcome to the East Block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now find yourself in a wild space filled with many unfamiliar faces - there are about a dozen of them. Each are minding their own business, entertaining themselves with whatever artifacts they have left. Men are playing poker at the tables in the back while girls are talking about their recent discoveries in a separate corner. Some are older than others with white taints in their hair while some are blatant teenagers. One thing's for sure; they all look tired and miserable as if they just lost a member of their family. The air has a feeling of despair and depression. Thankfully, there are individuals that still keep their heads up in this dark juncture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure approaches you both and inclines in Sonya's vicinity - a sign of respect for superiors. The person is a female with shoulder-length blond hair and possesses deep blue eyes. She condoned a similar outfit to Sonya but a bit more explicit. She wears a midriff-baring tank top with the hem residing below her ribcage. Her shorts seem quite tight on her hips and it is tightened by a black belt. A weapon holster is attached to her thigh with a gun in the interior. She has high boots, brown gloves and armbands in addition to dog tags. Despite her revealing attire, the stranger looks like a capable combatant given her well-toned stomach and muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to see that you came back alive, captain,\" she says. \"If I may ask, who is this person?\" At this, she gives you a quick glance to indicate that she's referring to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, this is a survivor that somehow managed to walk through the entire town unharmed and emerged from the lobby downstairs. This person could be a good use for our team with sneaking skills like that, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went in town undetected? Very impressive,\" Cassie comments while firmly shaking your hand in a friendly manner. \"Not many people make it out there alive. I'm glad that we have you on board. My name's Cassie Palmer and I've been here for as long as I can remember.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, thanks I guess. I'm not that great as you say, I just skipped through with sheer luck,\" you respond modestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suppose we can use your luck then. Cassie, would you be so kind to provide our new teammate with some medicine? That crash must have been pretty brutal. The dislocated shoulder and broken ribs should serve as proof of that. We need our comrades to be at their full strength if we have any chance to survive this apocalypse,\" Sonya clarifies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'll do so immediately. Please follow me...\" she grabs your arm and takes you to the medical section where other women are awaiting. They all give the impression of being quite young but looks can be deceiving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cass, who's the newbie?\" A tall, slender female asks. She has long black hair and stamds around your height. She seems to be a latina judging by her tone and faint accent as well as her beautiful hazel orbs that peer into your own. The girl sports a casual pink t-shirt with blue jeans and a ribbon around her collarbone. Her skin is moderately tan and her teeth are white and shiny. Truly fits the illustration of a hispanic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sophia. This is...\" You don't really listen to them anymore as your eyes inspect the other occupant. The damsel beside Sophia is lean and detains red pelt in distinction of the others. She doesn't seem very joyful and she looks away from your stare. The woman exhibits a ripped black dress with a silver necklace. She has a ring on her finger but it looks very battered and ruined. To top it all off, the gal only wears one high heel while her other feet is barefoot. \"Hey, are you listening to me? Stop staring at Cynthia and pay attention.\" Cassie's voice brought you out of your daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what? What's going on?\" Ah, you poor human being. Sometimes you're just hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, you can't be a dimwit during times like this,\" she scolds while you have the decency to look down shamefully. \"Anyways, I finished patching you up while you were in your own world. Try to refrain from moving too much. In a couple of days, you should heal and be up and running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, thank you very much,\" you state while rotating your shoulder blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! We're all that humanity has left, so we need to stick together and help each other as often as possible. If you have any questions or problem, don't be afraid to ask us.\" With that, Cassie takes off with her two companions while you remain on the couch. You yawn and stretch, suddenly feeling a bit drowsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, what the heck. Might as well get some shuteye when I have the opportunity,' you thought while you close your eyelids and fall asleep almost spontaneously. Your environment changes and you embark on a sweet dream without a single care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A noise catches both of your attention at once and you synchronously peer your head at the origin of the rattling, but there is nothing. It is very odd indeed, were you simply hallucinating? No...you couldn't have, you definitely heard something all right. It resembled some sort of gurgling, yet it was hard to make out what it was. Maybe the paranoia is getting to you and you're starting to imagine things that don't exist. It didn't make sense, something wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that just now?\" you nudge Sonya in the elbow, engendering a slight jump in recoil. \"I think I heard a growl or some sort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard it as well, what was that? And why does it sound...so familiar?\" she asked while you shrug. \"That's strange, maybe it was our imagin--Woah!\" There it is again, the same gargoyle that reverberated a few instances ago. That cleared out any doubt; there was certainly someone or <i>something</i> with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm <i>definitely</i> not imagining things. It didn't seem like it came from afar.\" You both come up with the same conclusion; whatever made that noise was in the room that they were in, potentially hiding somewhere out of sight. Your skin crawls and you lock your arm around Sonya's in a frightened state. \"P-please tell me that humans can make that sort of noise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both look around with the possibility of an attack in the back of your minds. There it is; a rustle near the entrance. Judging by that very long and furry tail, it was undoubtedly not a human. It is the first time that you see something like that and it didn't appear like it is an animal. Its snarl evidently confirms that and you breath heavily, fundamentally due to the footsteps that got closer and closer to your hiding spot. Your new friend motions for you to keep quiet, but it was exceedingly difficult to do so in this unnerving situation. Abruptly, the footsteps ceases and silence ensues the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were trembling uncontrollably, Sonya places a hand on your shoulder. \"Whatever you do,\" she whispers, \"don't look up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that kind of warning, you can't help yourself to be curious. You directed your eyes upwards and the view is quite intimidating. You see a horrifying monster with no peepers and its brain looks like it's about to fall off its skull. It has very, very, very sharp claws that seem to be able to shred through your flesh in the blink of an eye. The feature that sticks out the most, though, is its extremely lengthy tongue that is approximately 2 meters long and its skin looks like it's about to come off, like it was peeled. It is too much for you to contain and you reflexively scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shiiiit!\" you yell loudly, enough for the creature to perceive. That is the moment that you knew you messed up badly. The monster lets out an alarming roar and pounces on you. Luckily, you have great intuitions and you jump out of the way and sprint to get cover. You run to the nearest door and shut it as quietly as possible. <i>Did it see me?</i> Unfortunately, you have forgotten one important detail, or should I say person? Sonya is still on the other side. <i>Shit...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is too late to go back now. The brunette's screeches are heard and you slowly open the door to get a peek on what is happening. The sight that you see isn't pretty; your female companion is at the beast's with her wrists in its hold and she's dangling in the air, her legs kicking violently. You got a clearer view of the monster now: It's roughly two feet tall and is completely covered in fur. It has four arms as well and they seem to be wiggling menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, let me go you monster!\" Sonya struggles, doing her absolute best to get free of its hold but it is simply too strong. You really feel sorry for her at this point because you abandoned her with it and now she has nowhere to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have you now, human.\" You gasp. The being actually spoke fluent English? You initially didn't think that they would have the tiniest of intelligence, but you stand corrected. \"It looks like you have been hiding her all this time. I believe there are other humans in here as well...\" It paused, sniffing the air in search of something. \"Yes, I can sense one right now.\" You cover your mouth to suppress another gasp emerging. \"No matter, I will track them after I am done with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might as well kill me now, you demon!\" Even in this dreadful predicament, Sonya isn't afraid to confront it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster isn't fazed at all and begins the first phase; stripping the victim. It seized her bulletproof vest and ripped it away effortlessly. Sonya's squirms are more prominent at this point and she cursed the creature several times, which proves to be futile in this case. Her tank top was removed, shortly followed by her pants and her boots. She blushed, embarrassed and humiliated as she now finds herself in her silky white underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your associates locations and I might spare your worthless life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you,\" was her retort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then.\" It positions its claws on her figure and commences its onslaught. \"Coochie coochie coo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You walk through the empty streets in the direction of the hotel, the silence and lack of anyone unnerving to say the least. Fog is falling thick and fast and the lights from the lampposts are of limited use at best. All the while, you can't help but feel that someone's following you. Any time you turn around, there's no one or nothing that can be seen, but the feeling makes you speed up, practically running as you see the hotel loom up in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather oppressive Gothic looking building, you spot the name 'Noir Plume Inn' on a sign before diving into the lobby. By doing that, the feeling you'd been followed fades, only for a new sense of danger to rise up in your mind. Looking around, everything seems normal, although old fashioned. The furniture is heavily cushioned, the room itself painted in dark reds and abstract paintings hung from the wall that you don't like looking at for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past that, a face looks up from a nearby desk to reveal the receptionist. She is attractive, but very severe looking thirty-something year old with hair tied tightly back into a bun, a dark dress that hugs her figure and dark eyes that all but pierce you with a harsh gaze \"Yes?\" She asks, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit foolish over panicking over nothing, you cough before going on \"I-I'd like to book a room, for tonight if that's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\" The receptionist replies, although looking no less severe because of it. She quickly brings up a large ledger, filling in your details with a quill, rather adding to the antique feeling of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she does that, you drum your fingers on the desk, trying to think of conversation \"So... Kinda quiet out in town tonight, huh?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's as busy as it ever is.\" Was the reply before she handed over the key to your room to you \"Dinner is about to be served if you'd like to make your way to the dining room. Otherwise, your room is on the second floor.\" With that, she got back to the ledger, marking down further details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that seemed to be it from her although there were still a few things running around in your mind. This place was so odd in how it put you on edge and the fact this town wasn't even on the map begged questions and now that your fear of being followed had gone, maybe look outside to get a better grip of the place.

You amble around the place, taking in the art on the walls while being rather flummoxed with some of them. The shapes and colours were all weird looking and hard to make out any real pattern. From the frames around the pictures though, it looked as if some money had been spent on them at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving away from the art, you walk over to a table in between two comfortable chairs, seeing several magazines and newspapers scattered around on the surface of the table. Looking over it, you see one that's a local newspaper called the <i>Meadow Gazette</i>. Sitting down in the chair, your attention is drawn right away to the headline on the front page; <b>TEASER STRIKES AGAIN!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about the wording, you then see the photo beside the article, two exhausted and utterly embarrassed looking people, a man and a woman, covered with blankets being led into a van by the police. Neither are looking into the character and their skin is flushed red as you note that they don't appear to be wearing any clothing on their upper bodies, the blankets covering their modesty and the photo cutting off everything below the waist. After noting that, you look to the article to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Teaser, the notorious menace who has been haunting Quiet Meadow's streets for six months now, has struck once more last night. At the home of Jack and Kayleigh Sandhurst, the couple were attacked in the dead of night, tied up and subjected to the form of torture that the Teaser has become infamous for. After an hour, both members of the couple agreed to hand over what money they had on their premises before the Tease continued to torture them for another hour. As with the previous attacks, there have been no clues as to the Teaser's identity, even their gender being unknown. All that can be certain is that the entire town appears to be at the mercy of this dreaded tickle torturer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Tickle torture? You knew people in the smaller towns did things differently to others, but this really took the cake. This person broke into people's houses and tickled the people inside until they handed over their money? You feel your face get a bit warm from blushing as you remember your own sensitivity and place the paper back on the table, hoping you'll get your car repaired even quicker now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point...</span></div></div>",

Muffled through the foggy air you instantly were aware that it was a wolf, and not a dog, that started to howl in the distance. Memories flash to your mind. Many years ago you spent some weeks with some friends at a remote cabin in the forests under the mountains. First it sounded like adventure and fun. You then thought that, if you excluded the bears, you an your gun was the most dangerous species around. Soon the nights told you otherwise. The wolves that were watching your steps during daytime from a safe distance turned up every night at your doorstep and even break into the house. You and your friends shot more than one of them. This did not deter them. It only made them more angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a few other beasts have answered the first wolf to his call. You think that they now sound already closer to the hotel. Certainly you want to keep your grace and pretend to act as you had not heard anything. The receptionist lady grabs a ring of keys and walks to the front door. Two heavy bar locks that seem odd for a hotel entrance are moved to fix the door to the door case. You gulp from the thought of a hotel that needed just defenses at night. Next are the blinds of the windows which shut with a bang of solid metal landing on metal. In order to lock the blinds the receptionist lady opens the window. Cold fog is pressed through the narrow wedges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jump from your chair when you hear a wolf howl now very close to the hotel. Now the windows are closed again. You feel like being in a safe place in an unsafe world. Or is it a prison?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide the best course of action would be to go to the mechanic. It looked like it was only a blocks away, so it wouldn't hurt to check if it was still open. As dusk settled over the town, you noticed that there didn't seem to be too many streetlights. At least not as many as you'd expect. It was probably just to save money, you thought, as small towns like this probably kept to the schedule of the sun more than anything else. As you walk to the mechanic's, you keep getting the feeling that you're being followed or watched by someone, but every time you turn around you don't see anything. Actually, that in itself is a little odd. It can't be that late, yet there's no one around on the streets. You can see lights on in many of the buildings, but no one is outside but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think on it for too long, you arrive at 'Doyle's Car Repair.' At least, that's what the fading paint on the sign says. It doesn't look like much, more like a large garage attached to a small house. Or maybe it was the other way around, the garage seemed to dwarf the dwelling. You could see a light on inside the garage through the windows, so you knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to see a relatively young woman open the door. She looked to be in her late 20's, wearing a pair of loose overalls with a black tube top underneath, as well as a pair of black gloves. The tanned skin of her arms and sides were exposed, not that you'd complain at all about the revealing nature of her clothes, she was definitely an attractive woman. Light blonde hair fell down to the small of her back, tied loosely. There was no trace of oil or grease in her hair, but you couldn't say the same for the rest of her. Her overalls, face, and arms were all streaked with oil, and behind her you could see a car up on a lift and partially disassembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" The woman said to you amicably. \"Not from around here, are you? Car break down? Come on in.\" She beckons you into the shop, and on entering you notice it's one big room. There's a couch and desk along one side, and the other has an impressive array of tools. Some look to be very modern, while others look like they've seem better decades. \"Lots of cars break down around here for whatever reason,\" the woman continues. \"It's what keeps me in business. Actually a lot of folks end up staying here but\u2026 ah, I shouldn\u2019t go on. Name's Ashley Doyle; this is my shop. What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my car broke down a little ways back and\u2026 um, you're the mechanic?\" you ask a little dumbly, not expecting the owner of a car shop to be a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley glares daggers at you. \"That's right, I am. I took over this place from my parents when they\u2026\" she trails off a moment, as if remembering something rather unpleasant. \"Anyway, I know more about cars than anyone within a hundred miles of here. And if you don't trust a woman working on your car, you can deal with the problem yourself and go to hell for all I care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your hands up apologetically. \"Sorry, sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. I didn't mean anything by it, really! I was just surprised. Look, my car is working, and I don't know anything about them. I was hoping you could tow it into the shop and get to work on it in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mechanic takes a long look outside a window before looking back at you. \"Nope, can't do it tonight. It's already dark. Work stops around here once it gets dark, that's just the way it is.\" She grabs a towel and starts trying to wipe some of the oil off of arms. \"I'll can take care of everything in the morning, don't you worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, since you weren't even sure the shop was even going to be open this late, this is still more than you hoped for. You thank Ashley for her help, and tell her that you'll come back in the morning. You start to head back for the door when she calls out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Where are you going, to that motel?\" She asks hurriedly. \"Look\u2026 you shouldn't stay there, and folks around here don't go wandering around at night. You really shouldn't either. You're welcome to sleep on the couch over there, free of charge.\" The way she said all that seemed odd. Just how diurnal are these people? Would they really take it as an insult if you wandered around their town at night? Then again, you could suppose that an outsider walking outside in a little town like this might make people suspicious. And if you could just crash on the mechanic's couch for free, that would save you some money. For all you know, the locals might try to gouge an outsider who doesn't have anywhere else to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Miss Doyle. I appreciate the hospitality.\" She smiles at you, although if you aren't even supposed to go outside again, you're a little annoyed that you can't even go back to your care for a change of clothes. Ashley Doyle tosses her towel onto a workbench, and moves to the windows. You watch as she shuts and latches each window tightly, moving around the room methodically. It surprises you, it's already hot in here, and shutting the windows will just make it even stuffier. \"Hey, why are you closing the windows? We could use a breeze in here, especially if this is where I'm sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looks around furtively for a moment before answering. \"Uh\u2026 well y'see, if I don't close the windows, things can get it at night and I don't want you to deal with pests or anything\u2026\" She says, although you noticed all the windows have screen doors. What could she be talking about, raccoons? \"My house connected to the garage by that door there, and I'll be sleeping in the house. If you knock, I can hear it an answer. I'm going to take a shower and hit the sack. See you in the morning, outsider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley leaves before you can say anything, which also strikes you as odd. You didn't have any dinner, and it seems pretty early to be going to bed. You guess that she already ate, and that this town is an 'early to rise' sort of place. Still, you don't feel tired yet. You could walk around outside a little and enjoy the night air before bed. You could go back to the car and get some food and a change of clothes, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didn't want to upset the locals by walking outside, you could at least open the windows. You didn't buy her 'pest' story, and the smell of the car oil and equipment is making you a little light-headed. It couldn't hurt, could it? Well, or you could just sleep, at least all these odors would help knock you out, it seems. Or you could wait a few minutes and knock on Ashley's door. It'd be nice to talk to her a little more before bed, after she's gotten out of the shower. What to do?</span></div></div>",

The door takes some fiddling, it being oddly reinforced and all, but it opens out to Quiet Meadows beyond. You step out into the darkness, only the street lamps showing any light and even then, they were only pools of light in an ocean of darkness. The blinds and curtains of all the nearby buildings are shut, no light coming out from them which strikes you as odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's also odd is the sheer silence, nothing is making a sound, not even a stray cat or car in the distance. It's quite unnerving and you start thinking about heading back inside when you finally hear something, a piercing scream. You look over to where the sound came from to see a woman burst from out an alley, only to trip on... something? You think your eyes are playing darkness on you but the shadows and darkness around the women are shifting, her falling down beside a street lamp at least giving you a clear idea of what's going on. The light is poor enough to make out seeing what the woman looks like pretty hard though, that and her thrashing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Get away! Please!\" The woman cries out as the darkness churns and shifts into the shape of tendrils that wrap around her body, trapping her against the ground. You blink and rub your eyes, finding it impossible to believe what you've actually seen, but there it is. You shake your head, thinking that maybe the oil in the garage had more of an impact than you first thought. Another scream grabbed your attention though and you look back to the woman to see that the tendrils had split from her limbs to start poking and prodding along her side, causing her to lunge her body upwards and start howling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your mind stop short at this. Weird enough that the darkness in this town came to life and seemingly hunted people down, but then tickle them as well? You can't help but feel a shiver going through your body at the thought of being in a similar position as the unfortunate person before you. Your own ticklishness was well known to those around you, and frequently exploited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're brought back to reality with the woman screaming from laughter as the tendrils dart in and prod constantly over her sides, moving up to her ribs, you realise that you need to make a choice. After a second, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night hangs still over the peaceful little town of Quiet Meadows. An inky blanket of lullaby shade falls gently over the picturesque metropolis, as the sandman lets his trickle his hour-glass. Gently, the time of rest calls the good townsfolk to their beds, ways lighted by the celestial radiance of a smiling crescent moon. A gentle breeze plays amidst the poplar trees, the mighty trunk almost seeming to sigh to themselves in contentment as they sway back and forth. From end to end, the peaceful municipality slumbers on, somnolent solicitude disrupted by a solitary regrettable incident...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hold on!\" you manage in a sort of distended yelp to the poor figure writhing on the ground. \"I'll get some help!\" Screaming and shaking on the ground, the hapless figure before you seems entirely deaf to the comfort, occupied in fighting a losing battle for her sanity. Long, sinuous shapes -tentacles? Tongues? Hoses? The night itself?- dart through the pedestal of light around her, clawing at her limbs, tearing at her clothing, probing for an opening on their wailing prey. She can do little but roll and about and laugh, swatting at them ineffectual as they probe over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good as your word, you reel backwards inside the office, slamming the door behind you and pressing against it. Copper tinges at the back of your mouth, in contrast to the frigid moisture breaking out on your forehead. Under the circumstances, the intoxicating workshop atmosphere of the office does little for your rationality as you gulp it down. You press backwards into the cool metal at your back, grateful for the sensation of the door as something solid and immovable. <i>Dream, dream, just a screwed up- </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-H-help meeeeheeheehehahahahahaha!\" At the renewed howl from outside, you up and bolt toward's Ashley's door, making the unlucky portal practically vibrate in its frame as you smash your fist on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley! Ashley! Help me out! There's a- a <i>thing</i> out here and its got someone! You've got to help me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an epoch, the door yanks inwards, and you all but slump in relief at the sight of the mechanic framed therein, looking tough and cocking the lethal barrel of a big, beautiful, heavy duty- flashlight? Did not she have anything bigger than a flashlight?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By god in heaven, dude, don't you know better than to yell at a girl who's trying to shower?\" the mechanic almost knocks you over as she shoves past you, darting up to the door and kicking it wide with one practiced motion. \"Light under the desk- grab a pair and get out here!\" without a thought she ducks out into the night and screams and swooping shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the occasion, it felt hard to argue with a voice that authoritative, and you leap to the clerical desk. A pair of friendly gunmetal red flashlights shine at you from their <i>holsters</i> beside the chair, and, rather than foolishly consider the circumstances, you instead pull a John Carter and bolt after your companion. Down the street, the lady remains right where you left her both those long seconds ago, but, to her credit, with both arms free of restraining tentacles and instead locked in a death grip around the streetlamp. The still night air is full of writhing tendrils all around and behind her, squirming against her clothing in search of an opening, burrowing and nuzzling against her sides and body as they tease her. To the rear, two anaconda specimens pull at her heels, while she in turn tugs at the lamppost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole scene- squirming mass of onyx maggots in the background, tear-streaked maiden in the foreground, pearlescent halo of measuring light in the upper right- looks like nothing so much as a renaissance painting. Probably of some bereft soul besetting protection from the pit from an undecided angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtistic potential aside, the bereft soul in question seems about to lose it. Her pale skin shines under the moonlight with the liquid exertion of holding on, face -jaws ghoulishly wide, eyes bolted shut- the picture of misery and desperation. Tentacles prod freely over her sides, bound tight in a small jacket, as their inquisitive brethren explore up her skirt and knead themselves into her underarms. Stretched taut, she'd be defenceless even without the pull of the tendrils, and together, the combined attacks prove too much. Without fanfare, her little fingers pop off, then her ring fingers, and then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Then Ashley is upon her, blazing beam of her light sweeping back and forth over the tendrils. Wherever the concentrated light lands, the blackness steams, lighter clouds of darkness seeming to sizzle and drift up from the scorched appendages soundlessly. The -whatever it is- remains completely silent under the onslaught, but the tentacles pull back with one last fierce yank, at last dislodging their victim's last precarious hold. Tight on Ashley's heels, you slide across the pavement around her, grabbing hold of the unluckly lady and yanking back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your feet, fresh and pumped on adrenaline, you have considerably greater purchase than she did, and the tug of war jerks to a halt. You grit your teeth, hauling and hauling, in some corner of your mind just hoping that your object's arms don't rip out and leave her to be dragged off. The fear is as real as the hidden monstrosity. Around you, Ashley's light shines like a searchlight, focussing in on the wavy tendrils and scorching them back with practiced accuracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back! Get back, you vermin!\" the mechanic hollers, keeping just ahead of the tentacles that reach out for her like a giant swatting at an elusive fly. Keeping back, but pressing in, forcing the monster to endure ever-more concentrated UVs to keep up the fight. Behind her, you hold on, sweat dripping down to spatter against the dry pavement, muscles burning, chest feeling considerably too small to hold enough breath. Even as light burns over it and its prize is denied, the thing keeps silent, giving no indication of distress or indignation. And then, in desperation or some breed of battle-lust, Ashley lunges straight into the mass of tentacles, light flashing left and right even as tentacles claw at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it relents, and you fly backwards, landing hard in a bush, the shaking, giggling, sobbing form of your ally coming down atop you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks,\" she heaves out, as you stare straight up at the starry sky, trying to ignore the grotesque slithering sound of the <i>something</i> receding into the darkness. The noise is like a pack of colossal slugs having a race, as your assailant recedes. You feel too tired to pay much attention, even to the soft mass of effeminate hair pressed up against the lower half of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Painting, flashlight cradled under one arm, Ashley walks up to you, extending a hand down. She does a double-take at the figure resting atop you, but recovers enough to say,       </span></div></div>",
