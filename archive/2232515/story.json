All roaming the streets doing whatever they may please. King Garon didn\u2019t bother with proper law enforcement after all, typically just executing people if they caused too much trouble and have it be done with. Speaking of whom, the king was currently out of castle krackenburg. Something about heading to a dragon temple of sorts, something he demanded he go alone for. Well, alone and with Iago. That creep stuck to him wherever he went. For those who\u2019d stayed behind though, it was a blessing. They didn\u2019t have to deal with his schemes and snitching for at least a few days and they could just relax and have fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the first in the royal castle to take advantage of this freedom for fun was princess Elise. She\u2019d found herself running through the hallways with her toys, laughing and playing. Her retainers were struggling to keep up. Leo and Xander did nothing different really, both just training. The younger prince training his mind in the library and the eldest prince training his body in the courtyard. The other royals were having a little tea party in the dining room. Simply chatting about various things, with Camilla making sure to coo at her little brother plenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since the two of us just had a night together. I missed nights like this. You should come sleep with me to make it just like old times\u201d Camilla encouraged. Corrin couldn\u2019t help but blush a little, recalling those days. When he\u2019d been very young, Camilla was immediately who he\u2019d go to if he ever got scared by a nightmare. So he\u2019d actually spent plenty of nights in her room. And she didn\u2019t seem to mind one bit whenever it had happened. She did love her little brother dearly after all. \u201cBig sister... you know I\u2019m much too old for that...\u201d he tried to convince her, but the purple haired woman just shook her head. \u201cNonsense dear. You\u2019re never to old to look for comfort in big sis...\u201d Camilla encouraged, smiling sweetly. Corrin could only really nod. How could he be mad at her for that? Thus, the two enjoyed their night of talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly though, somebody who was not enjoying their night very much cake barging in. It was prince Leo, who was getting annoyed by a particular tome. He\u2019d been trying to pull off a spell for hours now and just couldn\u2019t get it to work. \u201cLeo? What are you doing here?\u201d Corrin questioned. Leo never attended these little parties, always just getting annoyed by them. \u201cI came here because I knew there was two of you. Now hold still...\u201d The tactician muttered as he placed the magic tome on the table, then placed his, Camilla and Corrin\u2019s palms on the cover. \u201cDear... whats this about?\u201d The princess questioned, really just confused now. Although she was happy to see another brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIgnaseus... gallaran... pasak... maroaasa!\u201d Leo suddenly yelled. For a brief moment, it seemed as if nothing was happening. But then the tome began to shine brightly! Just as he\u2019d predicted, he needed three dragon veins, not just one. There was just one problem... the light had gotten way bigger than he\u2019d expected! It actually ended up engulfing the entire castle! It had truly been years since anything in Nohr had shined so bright. And when it finally subsided, the spell had worked... sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was meant to shrink just one person, Niles having been the volunteer. No doubt so he could let the prince play around with him. But instead of shrinking one person and leaving everyone else intact, it had shrunk everyone and left one person at normal size. That person being...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing climactic seemed to have happened, at least not in the eyes of lady Camilla. She blinked a few times after the light, trying to figure out what was going on. \u201cWell brother, that was certainly an... interesting spell. I do hope it didn\u2019t hurt our dear cor... rin...\u201d She mumbled, only to trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple haired woman glanced around, looking for her little brothers. \u201cCorrin dearest?\u201d She called out in a bit of a confused tone when she couldn\u2019t see him. The princess then turned her head to try to look at Leo, only to see that he wasn\u2019t there either. \u201cWhat... is this some kind of prank? Is that what this is?\u201d She asked, clearly sounding annoyed. The busty woman was not the kind of be a fan of pranks. She looked around at all the possible hiding spots in her room, not really seeing anything. But she assumed they were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Be that way. I\u2019m going to sleep...\u201d Camilla called out, wanting to make sure they heard her. And they did, loud and clear. Because as it would turn out, they were indeed still in the room. Just a lot... lot... lot smaller. In fact, they weren\u2019t even tall enough to peak out of the carpet. They\u2019d gone down to the minuscule of only about half a centimetre, absolutely puny! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin and Leo were both completely lost in that forest of carpet, not able to see much. But when Camilla stood up to her full height, which was already tall by human standards, they definitely saw her. But they didn\u2019t see their sister. They saw a goddess, towering above into the heavens... and then saw their sister. Seeing nowhere else to go, they started to follow along, although she seemed like she was hesitating<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... I could just go to bed... or I could...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Quite a storm had rolled over parts of the adrestian empire as well as Garreg mach. Winds howled strong enough to blow down trees, rain pouring down so thick one could barely see. Indeed it was a brutal storm. Many were surprised that no sort of natural disaster was occurring, wondering if it was only by the grace of the goddess the storm wasn\u2019t killing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it wasn\u2019t dangerous though, that didn\u2019t mean anybody was going outside. It would be extremely easy to get sick if anyone tried to go out. Thus, in an effort to keep the students of the officer\u2019s academy safe, they had a day off of school today. Of course, they couldn\u2019t leave their dorms either, but they didn\u2019t have to work. Manuela definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to handle 50 or more sick kids at once after all. And for the most part, this all seemed to work fine. The students stayed in their rooms, with a staff member bringing them all meals. It seemed like it was going to just be a slow, stormy day... until one teacher decided to ask a favour of her students...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry... you want us to ...what?\u201d Felix asked once again, still unable to believe what he\u2019d just heard. At the moment, he, Dimitri and Ingrid had been gathered in Professor Eisner\u2019s office. She wasn\u2019t their teacher, but had still requested they come there anyways. She needed them for something. \u201cI said I want to shrink you all down, head into Sylvain\u2019s room and grab some papers for me\u201d Byleth said completely void of emotion as if that were a perfectly normal sentence she\u2019d just stated. The three students just couldn\u2019t believe she would ask something like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you even want us to do this? And why us specifically?\u201d Ingrid questioned. Although she had a feeling it was because of something stupid Sylvain did. \u201cWell I actually tried to get some other students to help with the task, but none of them have come back yet. So I figure it would likely be best if I sent in his closest friends instead...\u201d Byleth mused, still expressionless. Felix was about to open his mouth again, but the prince stepped in this time. \u201cWell I think we should be able to do this task easily for you, professor!\u201d Dimitri said rather enthusiastically. \u201cGreat\u201d Byleth replied, instantly snapping her fingers to magically shrink them down, leaving Felix and Ingrid no time to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d made the three barely half a centimetre tall so that they could really go through the room undetected. The teacher scooped the three up in her hands and started to walk through the storm, keeping her grip tight around them to protect them. Once she was by the red head\u2019s room, she crouched down and pushed them all underneath the door. \u201cIt\u2019s a paper with blue ink on it\u201d she said simply before just leaving. The three now tiny students barely had time to comprehend anything that had just happened. It had all been so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... we\u2019re stuck doing this now...\u201d Felix grumbled, very clearly annoyed. Ingrid sighed. \u201cLook, if we do it quick it will be over. So let\u2019s just get it over with...\u201d she said, thinking things would be much better if they went fast. And it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to get a single piece of paper, even at this size. The only problem would be Sylvain himself, who was currently... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not everyone\u2019s meant to be big, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!\u201d Raphael said encouragingly. But the blue haired boy was having trouble being enthusiastic about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fairly average day at the Garreg mach officers academy. A few weeks ago, one of the black eagle students Caspar had begun training with a golden deer student, Raphael. The much shorter boy wanted nothing more than to get tall and strong like his new trainer, but nothing he did really added to his form. It was likely a genetic thing, but there was no way to prove that in this age. So instead he just kept trying to train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraining was over for the day though, making him rather upset. After his friend left, it was just Caspar left in the training grounds, sweaty and tired. He was getting ready to leave, but then he found something. \u201cHuh? A spell book...?\u201d He mumbled, picking it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student flipped through the tome, only to find something quite interesting. \u201cHuh? A growth spell?! Hell yeah!\u201d He yelled, thinking he\u2019d found exactly what he wanted. Caspar wasn\u2019t the greatest at magic or anything, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop him from trying.

And yet despite the peacefulness, monsters still lurked outside of the towns and cities. Many monsters had disappeared after the fall of both Mordegon and Calasmos, but there were still a decent amount of stragglers. It was mostly the likes of slimes, goodybags and platypunks, but a few larger ones did enjoy stalking the night. And one in particular had decided to come out and play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was spotted within the foothills just outside of Heliodor\u2019s capital walls. A merchant man had seen a large creature shambling about on his way back into the city. It didn\u2019t take long for the guards to be alerted, as well as some extra help. The great heroes of Erdrea were currently staying in the castle, at the request of Jade\u2019s father, thus they were the ones the guards immediately looked to for aid. Or rather, just the luminary. The great hero\u2019s comrades were all tired and honestly didn\u2019t care enough to gear up for just one monster. Thus they simply let the legendary hero take care of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter donning his purple attire and grabbing the sword of light, the Luminary headed on out into the hills with a few royal guards. The only light they had were two torches and the moon. The hero still felt no reason to be afraid though. It wasn\u2019t as if the spectral sentinels were still alive to cause havoc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was nearly still, with only a very light, cool breeze. It put the guards on edge, but the Luminary managed to keep himself level headed. The only sounds were the light chirping of crickets, the clanking of the guards armour and their own footsteps against the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d searched for nearly a half hour, coming up with absolutely nothing. It was starting to be believed that perhaps the merchant had simply given them a false alarm for the fun of it. Or maybe he\u2019d seen some sort of large, passive animal. Either way, the guards were finally starting to calm down and relax a little... making it The perfect time to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large silver gilded beast came from the ground, as if it had previously been burrowing. It held a similar terrifying appearance to that of the great gyldygga, simply smaller and less extravagant. In mere seconds the creature bit into one of the guards, only to toss him meters away. The other tried to raise his shield, only to be tossed aside by it\u2019s horns. This left the Luminary to fend for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the guards, the great hero was able to dodge the oncoming volley of attacks. Claws scratching, teeth gnashing and horns thrusting. It truly fought like some sort of violent animal, which perhaps it was. The hero was able to fight back as well, his legendary sword easily able to repel the creature and his magic able to damage its metal exterior. It soon enough seemed as if the battle had been won, with the hero standing on high and the monster defeated on the ground. This unfortunately would not be the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds before the Luminary could unleash the finishing blow, the beast suddenly began to expel magic from its mouth, making the hero freeze, covered in a purple aura. This wasn\u2019t any typical type of magic... this was curse magic! The hero let out a few grunts of pain, but eventually succumbed to the curse, blacking out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, it was bright. It was daytime. The luminary was rather confused, honestly. He seemed to be back in the castle. Not in the room he\u2019d been sleeping in, but rather in a hallway. He could tell this due to the ornate architecture all around him and the type of carpet he was laying on. He wondered if he\u2019d simply been sleepwalking and passed out. Had it all been a dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up, trying to figure out exactly which hall he was in. It was a rather large hall... in fact, an extremely large hall. A hall that was far too big for this castle! He glanced around even more, seeing the massive doors and statues. Then he gasped and realized exactly what type of curse had been planted on him last night. One that stole his size! The legendary luminary was now reduced to the size of a common bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to get up to go and find help right away, but it seemed as if he was going to have company well before that. He could hear footsteps echoing through the halls towards him, getting closer by the second. It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Strolling through the halls was the princess of Heliodor herself, Jade. Despite her royal title, she was no fancy dress wearer. She was a skilled warrior who\u2019d proven to be completely invaluable to the Luminary, in more regards than one. She was a fierce fighter who could knock the head off of a demon with a single kick, but was also able to sit down and simply talk with people. She tended to act cold on the outside, but the Luminary knew she wasn\u2019t like that at all. It\u2019s why he\u2019d come to view her as a sort of big sister in his life. Just right now that big was quite literal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of her approaching steps would cause quite the shockwave of vibration and sound to shoot out at the tiny hero. Such a meaningless act of walking and yet it seemed so powerful to someone so small. Of course, her natural appearance was rather intimidating as well. She was a gorgeous woman, blessed with such a body. Her long black hair flowing behind her and her typical tight fitting green warrior\u2019s garb certainly added to the look. But her eyes were always just so intense. And yet, the hero noticed one odd outlier of a detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor whatever reason, the princess had decided to roam the castle barefoot. It did make sense, considering she lived here. The typical rules did not apply to royalty, not that she liked to act like it. Jade was very humble and thus rarely took part in an special princess privileges. Of course, being comfy with no shoes was one of those privileges she didn\u2019t mind taking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for another lovely day of paperwork...\u201d Jade mumbled as she strolled across the red carpeted halls. She was heading towards the office off near the throne room. After the war against the demons and monsters had ended, Erdea wasted no time in going back to normal. And with things normal, it meant plenty of work for the kingdom\u2019s leaders. Jade may not conduct herself as a princess, but she wasn\u2019t one to shy on responsibilities. Thus, she was ready for a day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t detest paperwork per say, far from it. However, it certainly wasn\u2019t adventuring with her friends. She did long for that thrill of exploration and discovery as she\u2019d done before. But now wasn\u2019t the time for that, at least not for her. Even so though, she\u2019d make this as enjoyable as she could. When she\u2019d woken up, she\u2019d taken a nice, warm bath. And when she headed out, she\u2019d left her boots behind. She did live the feeling of the thick carpet against her bare soles. Not to mention how much for comfy and free it felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the Hero simply stared at her quickly approaching monolithic form. How could he not? She was beautiful! From her intense eyes all the way down to her bare feet, which he took an extra moment to stare at. She had long soles, long toes and not much width in either. They were also very smooth and very soft looking. Truly the elegant feet of a princess. Elegant feet that were about to trample him down into the carpet. His brain soon kicked in again and the luminary began to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t be enough though, as just one of her slow steps covered so much more ground that his highest speed in the same amount of time. Soon enough, she was right above him. Jade lifted a leg above him, unaware of the tiny hero. Her foot cast a shadow over him, completely blocking out the light from above. He knew he couldn\u2019t get away from her, so in a last ditch effort, he jumped...</span></div></div>",

He tumbled into the ground just to the side of her foot, narrowly avoiding being squished beneath it when she stepped down. At least it was a soft landing thanks to the carpets floors. He watched as the same sole that almost crushed him raised up and went forward. It really was such a harmless, innocent act for her. But it could have devastating effects on him at this size. And knowing how easily harm could come to him, the Luminary decided that his primary goal now should be getting back to normal size no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought it over for a few moments, before decided to chase Jade as best he could. It was unlikely he could figure this out on his own, so going to his friends for help seemed like his best bet. Only problem was keeping up, as the giantess was so much faster than him. If he had any mana left, he could cast accelerattle, but the curse had drained him of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an hour of running, both him and Jade had reached the destination. She was heading into her office off to the side of the throne room. The luminary was exhausted, but kept going. He\u2019d been able to handle dark lords and ancient evils, he could handle keeping up with big sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he went into the office though, he glanced around to see if the coast was clear, or if he had other options.

So with nothing for him there, the little luminary followed along the princess into the office room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like most of the other rooms in the palace, ornate, plenty of red and gold. But also some beautiful wooden furniture, most notably the grand desk that Jade planned to use to work. There was plenty of papers already stacked on it, so she was definitely going to be here a while. Which gave the hero a perfect opportunity to grab her attention. The only question was how to go about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade sat in her seat with a sigh, her generous backside sinking into the cushioned seat. Today she\u2019d basically just be filling out a bunch of rebuilding permits. People needed approval from the royal family to build anything within the capital after all. Jade didn\u2019t particularly approve of that rule, but the law was the law. \u201cTime to get started... hopefully I can finish before the afternoon...\u201d She mumbled to herself as she picked up her feather pen and began to sign papers.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Another size kink interactive on this site, but I decided to get specific with the genre. Some will do a specific game and some will just say all. So I went with a middle ground and got a specific game genre, which thankfully is the one with the best characters ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for rules and stuff, I\u2019m pretty lax. You can do male or female characters, growth or shrink, almost any kink. Pretty much whatever you want. If there\u2019s something I happen to feel doesn\u2019t fit, I will remove or edit it though <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo paragraphs minimum for additions and try to keep your grammar at least somewhat decent. If you don\u2019t think you can do that or simply aren\u2019t in the mood for it, send me a message and I\u2019ll consider writing a chapter for you in exchange for some points<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, hope you all enjoy and do feel free to add. Foot related chapters are encouraged~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny characters added here belong to their respective owners btw</td>",
