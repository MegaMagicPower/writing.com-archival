In a matter of seconds the large cake was gone, and Zoro's flat, muscular stomach was distended and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive,\" Sanji said, crossing his arms, \"Looks like somebody has a hidden sweet tooth.\"  Sanji watched as Zoro licked his lips and fingers clean from the fudge frosting and smirked, \"Still hungry?\"  Zoro nodded, \"Yeah, gimme more of those cakes.\"  Sanji focused on the counter in front of him and three cakes appeared in front of the bloated swordsman: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.  Each cake had the same kind of frosting on it, but all three were gigantic compared to the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro's mouth began to water at the sight of these massive cakes that were so big that they covered the entire counter.  Without thinking, Zoro grabbed the first chunk of cake he could get his hands on and shoved it into his mouth.  The sweet taste of strawberry cake and frosting made him even more ravenous, and he just kept forcing cake down his throat.  In less than ten minutes, the green haired swordsman had devoured all three monstrous cakes and leaned back in his chair, his stomach so bloated and hard that it looked like he had swallowed a massive ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of relaxing, Zoro sat up and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the attack against his taste buds, he managed to swallow the way to heavy chocolate-y cake clump. He coughed a bit, trying to get the after taste out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bad, huh\", Sanji asked. Zoro nodded. \"How can a cook serve his crew something like that?!\" he shouted. Sanji stayed calm even though he was getting a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is new to me too\", Sanji explained. \"I am still getting used to it. The taste is hard to get right.\" He opened and closed his hand in front of his face a few times, then grabbed a small piece of cake himself - and tasted nothing. \"Huh\", he wondered, \"really not good. I have to try more, I need to get this right!\" He exclaimed with conviction, turning towards Zoro. \"What kind of cook can't make tasty food?\" He stepped closer and put his hands on Zoro\u00b4s shoulders looking him directly in the eyes. \"You are gonna help me getting better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Zoro wanted to refuse, but his stomach growled once more. <i>Why not?</i>, he thought.<br>\r\nThe next hour or so consisted of a repeating cycle of Sanji materializing food (this time in smaller portions), then giving some to Zoro and then taking a bite himself. The first few tries were abysmal, tasting somewhat like sand mixed with rotting fruit. The pudding was the worst, that just tasted like mud.<br>\r\nThis went on and on. Slowly, the food started to become less and less horrible, the last few tries even tasting somewhat decent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting full.\" Zoro felt a bit bloated and was starting to get tired. He wanted to sleep it off. He actually good food lay heavy in his toned belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more\", Sanji said, a bit slower than he usually talked. Zoro could tell that, despite having eaten way less than himself, Sanji was getting quite full as well. Sanji focused and as a finale to top off their practice round, he tried the fist cake once more  - it appeared between him and Zoro on the small table in the kitchen. It was smaller than the first cake, but managed to look even more sugary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well -\", they both said in unison right before each taking a half of the cake and popped them in their mouths in one piece..</span></div></div>",

The green-haired swordsmen sat up and placed his hand on his six-pack, \"What the hell, I just ate breakfast.  Why am I hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Zoro stood up and walked slowly to the kitchen, and pulled open the fridge.  Nothing in there seemed to look good to him.  Zoro decided he's just shut the fridge and go back to sleeping.  On his way out, he ran into Sanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it, Marimo!!\" Sanji said, angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro ignored him and kept going, but when he looked back, there was something about Sanji that made his mouth water and his stomach growl.  Zoro put his hand on his stomach and looked down, \"I.... wanna eat Sanji?\" when he said that his stomach growled louder.  Zoro thought about it, and said to himself, \"No, that's stupid.  Besides, even if I wanted to, i'd have to fatten him up, he's to-\" at the, Zoro's stomach growled the louder then he'd ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro sighed, \"I might as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro decides to...</span></div></div>",

He stopped and watched Sanji cook, thinking of a way he could fatten him up.  That's when Zoro noticed that the vest Sanji was wearing was getting tighter around his mid-section.  Zoro then noticed that Sanji's arms, face, chest, and legs looked fatter as well, but his belly was the biggest.  Zoro grinned and walked away, \"This is gonna be easy.  Ero-cook is already getting fatter for m- wait.\"  Zoro looked back and was surprised.  Sanji had gotten BIGGER.  How was this happening?  When Zoro ran into him earlier, he was skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Zoro saw it.  Sanji had a massive plate of cookies on the counter and he was eating them while cooking.  Zoro watched as Sanji picked up a cookie and ate one, and instantly gained ten pound onto his frame.  Zoro mouth started to water as he watched Sanji eat cookie after cookie, completely unaware of the fact that he was getting fat.  The button's on Sanji's vest and shirt began to pop off until his now massive belly hing out.  Sanji looked like he was around 270 pounds once the last cookie was gone.  Zoro watched as Sanji waddled around, cooking food for the crew.  All Zoro had to do was get his hands on more of those fattening cookies and he could get Sanji to the perfect size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro saw Sanji pull a new batch out of the over and Zoro decided he would act now, \"Wow, those look good.\"  Zoro said looking at the cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji crossed his fat arms, \"Their for AFTER dinner, Marimo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro rolled his eyes, \"Okay, then.

Zoro just grinned and pushed Sanji onto his bed, sitting against him to pin him down, and stuffing two or three cookies at a time into his mouth, feeling Sanji's belly grow against him as he force-fed him.

He sat there on top of Sanji's massive belly, looking down at his amazing meal.  Since Sanji weighted 270 pounds before Zoro started to feed him, the swordsman guess that Sanji now weighed about 670 pounds.  Sanji's face was very round and he had two chins.  His thick neck lead down to his soft man boobs, which were followed by his gigantic fat belly which Zoro was sitting on.  Zoro's weight pushed into Sanji's belly, causing him to sink down into it slightly.  Zoro massaged Sanji's massive gut while looking him over more.  His arms were very thick, and Zoro looked behind him to see that Sanji's leg's were just as thick.  Zoro's mouth began to water and he looked down at Sanji, \"You know, Ero-Cook.  You and I have fought for a LONG time, and now, for once, you get to help me.  By being my meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji stared up at Zoro confused and frightened, \"Wha.... What?!  Let me go, you freak!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro leaned over and he picked up a book that Chopper had given a few weeks back.  It was about the human anatomy.  Zoro read a paragraph that explained that if enough pressure was placed on the joints in the jaw, you could pop them in and out of place without damaging your jaw.  Zoro placed his hands on the spots on both sides of his face and pressed until he heard a pop.  Once his jaw was out of place, Zoro grabbed Sanji by the sides of his head and smiled, \"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro opened his mouth wide and shoved Sanji's head into his mouth, licking him all over and amazed at how good Sanji tasted.  Zoro started to gulp Sanji down, pulling his shoulder's into his mouth with ease and sucking on his fat chest before gulping that down too.  Zoro had some trouble once he got down to Sanji's massive gut, but once he got half of it in, eating the rest was easy.  However, Zoro decided to prolong Sanji's demise.  He wanted to enjoy the fruits of his labor and licking and tasting Sanji's fat gut, enjoying the amazing taste that came with it.  After his stomach started to growl, Zoro decided he better stop playing around and finish his meal.  Zoro leaned his head back as the last bit of Sanji's fat stomach slid into his mouth.  Once in, Zoro grabbed Sanji's feet and pushed the rest of him in, and a few more gulps, Zoro's stomach was stretched wide, wiggling around as Sanji tried to escape.  Zoro laid back on his bed and stroked his Sanji-filled belly and sighed happily, \"Aaaaaah... Wow.  Who would have guessed that Ero-Cook would have tasted so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro laid his head back and continued to stroke his moving belly as he slowly started to fall asleep, \"If Sanji tasted this good, I wonder what some of the other crew members taste like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro the finally fell asleep, digesting Sanji in his sleep and adding the cook's fat to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zoro woke up, he had gained...</span></div></div>",

Not only did he realize that since he ate Sanji, they crew no longer has a cook, but they'll all start to wonder where he went.  Eventually, fingers will point to Zoro's gut.  Zoro gulped and he decided he had no other choice, he would have to eat the rest of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro was so wrapped up in the idea of eating his crew that he didn't even notice the faceless figure in the kitchen cooking, or the food on the table, which the crew was eating happily.  Zoro looked around, he needed to pick his next meal soon.  Zoro noticed that all of them men in the crew had gained weight recently, the two biggest being the captain, Luffy, and the shipwright, Franky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy's vest was strainging as best as it could to keep his large belly in, and his shorts had already given out.  His arms and legs jiggled with fat as he stuffed his chubby face with food.  Franky, who was sitting right next to Luffy, was the bigger of the two.  His open hawaiian shirt allowed his gigantic gut to hang out, covering his stretched out speedo.  His face was fatter then Luffy's, as were his arms, legs, and butt, which could barely be contained in his tight fitting speedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro's mouth watered as he watched the two, and he guessed their weight in his head.  Luffy was around 250, smaller then Sanji before Zoro fattened him up.  Franky had to be around 330, MUCH bigger then Sanji was before his fattening.  Zoro knew it would be easier to fatten Luffy, since he was naive.  Franky would be harder, since he would have to force him like he did Sanji, but he would taste SO GOOD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Zoro smelled the fattening cookies, again, not realizing the faceless man in the kitchen cooking, and knew he had to make his choice soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro decided to eat...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After eating the 450 pound shipwright, Zoro spent the next few hours sleeping and he digested Franky; every single pound of Fat that Franky had on him was quickly added to Zoro's body.  Once Zoro woke up, he let out a long yawn and stretched, before relaxing his massive body and putting one fat on his gigantic belly, smiling.  Zoro chuckled and rubbed his belly, \"Who would have guessed that eating my crew mates and getting this fat would be so enjoyable?\"  Zoro put his hands on the back of the wall he was sleeping against and lifted himself up and headed towards the door to his room when he noticed the full length mirror hanging from his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green-haired swordsmen grinned happily as he took his first look at his new body: he was even bigger than he thought!!  Zoro had developed two extra chins from all the fat that collected on his much wider face.  His neck was thick with fat that it was barely visible, and his shoulders were wide and broad.  Underneath those rested Zoro's large man boobs, where his once large and firm pec were.  Directly underneath his man boobs was his gut; his stomach hung down past his knees and stuck out almost four feet in front of Zoro.  The large scar that ran across Zoro's torso curved around his new fat nicely.  Zoro smiled and he turned around and look at his backside; his ass was massive and round, and his legs were extremely thick and padded with fat.  Zoro couldn't help but be proud of his new body, and the only thing he wanted now was to keep feeding it pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro was never the best at math, but ran the numbers through his head to try and figure out his weight; he started out at around 210 pounds, all in muscle, and then he at Sanji, who weighted 670 pounds, which put Zoro at 880 pounds.  Zoro then added the weight of his newest meal, Franky.  A wide grin spread across Zoro's face as he placed his hands on his enormous gut and jiggled it, \"I weight 1,330 pounds!!\"  And as if on cue, Zoro's stomach growled loudly.  Zoro opened the door to his bedroom and headed onto the deck of the ship, \"Don't worry, little guy.  We'll get you some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro waddled into the kitchen of the ship and took his normal spot at the table while everyone ate.  The faceless man in the kitchen continued to cook for everyone, and a second faceless man sat across from Zoro: in Franky's old seat, eating like everyone else.  Zoro, however, didn't notice either of these things.  He was to busy look at his crew mates to figure out who he'd eat next.  Zoro's eyes scanned the entire room and he had plenty of options: Luffy, Chopper, Usopp, Nami, and Robin: both of which have turned into boys and began to fatten up like the rest of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro licked his lips and he finally narrowed it down to two options: Luffy or Chopper.  Luffy had put on an amazing amount of weight since Zoro saw his yesterday; he had gone from a skinny 250 pound appetizer to a delicious 540 pound main course.  Usopp, however, was still pretty skinny by Zoro's standards, weighing only about 310 pounds.  Luffy's signature red vest was wide open as he shoved food into his mouth and his shorts were tearing at the seams.  Usopp's brown overalls were still buttoned, but obviously doing their best to keep all of his flab in.  Zoro thought things over and he ate the food on the table, which didn't taste nearly as good as Sanji and Franky did.  Once the table was cleared, Zoro smiled to himself as he finally figured out who he was gonna eat.  Zoro decided to go after....</span></div></div>",

Zoro shook his head and returned to reality, planting a pat on Luffy's gut.  \"Looks like you're getting pretty big there, 'captain,'\" he said, a sly grin slithering across his lips.

Zoro sat back in his chair and rubbed his massive belly happily; he had eaten more than he expected to, but he was okay with that.  He knew that all of that food he just ate would only help him grow fatter.  Zoro looked across the table of empty dishes at Luffy and grinned; the rubber boy had eaten about 85% of all the food on the table.  Luffy relax in his chair and sighed happily as he rubbed his enormous stomach, which was so big and stuffed with food that flowed over the top of the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Luffy, looks like you beat me!\"  Zoro said, faking his disappointment.  Luffy grinned back at his first mate, \"Hey, don't be so upset, Zoro!!  In a few years, maybe you'll be able to out eat me!!\"  Zoro looked up at Luffy, \"Oh, well, it's not that.  I decided that if I could beat you in this eating contest, I would stuff myself like crazy with all the food I could find!!  But, I guess I'm just going to have to let you do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy instantly sat up, which caused his stomach to pool over the table even more, excited at the thought, \"Really, Zoro?!\"  Zoro nodded, \"Yeah, I already put all of the food in my room.  Why don't you head on up there and start eating your prize?\"  Luffy didn't even think twice about it and waddled as quickly as he could to Zoro's bedroom.  Zoro licked his lips hungrily as he watched Luffy's hind wabble back and forth, barely able to be contained in his now skin tight, seam bursting shorts.  The sight of Luffy waddling away made Zoro's gargantuan gut growl loudly.  Zoro chuckled and patted his stomach, \"We'll get him soon.  He just needs a bit more meat on his bones is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luffy scarfed down food in Zoro's room while Zoro relaxed and let the food in his stomach digest, deep in the bottom of the Sunny Go's hull, three men who had snuck aboard at the last dock talked amongst themselves.  All three of them were brothers, but they couldn't look any more different: the oldest one, named Cago, was extremely thin, tall, and had red hair that came to a point at the front.  The middle brother, Gran, was muscular and his hair was buzzed short and blue and the youngest brother, Bage, had shaggy blonde hair and weighted around 700 pounds.  \"So is everything working?\" Gran asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCago nodded his head and grinned, \"So far, all of our devil fruit powers have worked wonders on the Strawhat crew.  They've yet to notice the replica-mimes that I created based on the cook and shipwright, and Bage's vore-vore fruit powers are working wonders on the swordsman.  Soon, he'll have devoured the entire Strawhat crew!\"  Gran smiled and looked to his youngest brother, was scarfing food from one of the crew's crates, \"This is to perfect.  And with the help of my World-World fruit powers, whenever that idiot swordsman eats one of his crew mates, they'll simply be transported to that alternate food dimension I created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBage swallowed down another helping of cake and look at his brothers, \"But what about those two women?  How did they turn into men?\"  Cago pulled out a map and unrolled it, \"We've entered a section of the grand line that, for some reason, turns woman into men.  It doesn't affect out plans though, so it's fine.  Soon, the Strawhat Pirates will be at our mercy and we'll take their ship for ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on deck, Zoro had decided that he had waited long enough, and lifted his massive self up from the table and made his way to his bedroom where Luffy was gorging on food.  Zoro's mouth watered as he got closer to the bedroom, excited to see how big his next meal would be.  When Luffy had left the kitchen earlier, Zoro had to guess that his captain was around 970 pounds.  When Zoro opened the door, he was that Luffy had eaten every piece of food in the room and he weighed...</span></div></div>",

Sanji told Zoro that he saw him eat five plates and that he'd get fat if he ate more.  The two fought for some time before Snaji agreed to cook more food.
