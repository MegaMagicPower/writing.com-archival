What revenge?\u201d Her eyes had started to adjust, and now she could see Misty, her face like it was when she was a Dark Signer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty\u2019s eyes narrowed and she leered at Akiza, her gaze hateful. \u201cDon\u2019t play ignorant with me, Akiza. Revenge for my younger brother, who you killed in cold blood. Didn\u2019t you, Black Rose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell?! Had she forgotten the last few months entirely?! \u201cMisty, it wasn\u2019t me! It was Sayler who killed your brother! Don\u2019t you remember?!\u201d Was she.......No, it wasn\u2019t possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLies!\u201d Misty\u2019s expression was one of rage. \u201cI know you killed Toby! And if even if you won\u2019t admit it, you know you killed him! But don\u2019t worry about killing anyone else, Akiza. Because I\u2019ll make sure you never harm anyone ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza glanced around her eyes fully adjusted. It looked like she was in a warehouse, with tons of crates stacked high to the ceiling. \u201cJust w-what are you gonna do to me? Tourture me to death? Beat me bloody in a card game? I can take it, Misty-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza was cut of by Misty softly chuckling. If she was normal, Misty\u2019s laugh might have been cute. But as she was, it came off as unsettling....\u201dNo, Akiza. I don\u2019t have any tools to torture you, believe it or not. I wouldn\u2019t be able to stomach them. But maybe you can stomach what I have planned for you...\u201d She chuckled again, a bit louder this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, Akiza spotted a label on a nearby crate. She turned to look at at it. It read: <br>\r\n\u2014\u2014++\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-++\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\nDark Choclate Cake- Bulk Shipping<br>\r\n120 per crate<br>\r\nFor various Bakeries in Neo Domino<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014#\u2014\u2014\u2014-#\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-#\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nNo...she possibly couldn\u2019t-<br>\r\nMisty\u2019s response was the confirmation of her fears. \u201cAfter all, you cant hurt anyone....if you can\u2019t move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza\u2019s eyes widened in fearful shock.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I thought that I\u2019d treat you to a rather sweet buffet...at the expense of your waistline, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Misty walked over to the nearest crate to Akiza, and pushed the lid off it. The wooden slab clunked to the ground heavily, as Misty pulled out a cake from the crate. Akiza knee what would happen to her if any of that cake entered her mouth....More would fimd it\u2019s way in, and on to her waist, until she burst or became too big...she didn\u2019t know which of the two Misty was aiming for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow....shall we start.....Akiza-kun...?\u201d The grin on Misty\u2019s face was that of a psychopath\u2019s....she slowly walked towards Akiza, pulling the cake out from it\u2019s box.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza clenched her jaw tight and refused to open it. At least, that was her plan. The cake\u2019s aroma was delicious and wafting up her nose..(it smelt so good-she wanted to taste it-but she couldn\u2019t let Misty have her way with her-you need to breath with your mouth-she could breath with her nose- the smell is in your nose-you can taste it on your tounge-)<br>\r\n\u201cMrpphhh?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGot you.\u201d Misty\u2019s psycho grin had vanished, replaced by a simple smile.<br>\r\nA lapse of concentration meant that Akiza had opened her mouth, and Misty had shoved the entire cake into Akiza\u2019s mouth. Forced to chew and swallow lest she choke to death, Akiza had much time to sample the flavour of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very rich, and it tasted much like Dark Chocolate-oh my goodness, it was dark chocolate!-with chocolate icing. Her taste buds felt like they had died and gone to heaven....As she swallowed it, a sense of blissful wanting spread through her, like her body wanted more-it needed more, that blissful feeling she didn\u2019t want to stop-but this was Misty\u2019s doing-her belly felt full and empty at the same time-it was a whole cake and she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#\u2014-#<br>\r\nMisty gazed at Akiza. The girl seemed to be very much enjoying her meal, her eyes narrowed in bliss, some chocolate around her mouth, her jaw working hard to chew up the cake. Her belly was already beginning to expand out, ever so slightly. Her arm was glowing with that Signer Mark, for whatever reason, Misty didn\u2019t care about the mark. She wanted Akiza\u2019s thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Akiza.....How was that cake, just now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..Mruph..pluh..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty\u2019s psycho grin retuned to her face. \u201cWhat was that? You should know better then to speak with your mouth full, Akiza-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza\u2019s response was after she had swallowed the last bits of the cake. \u201cM-more....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What she really wanted to do was to get Yusei\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other day, she had been by his place, and found him not working on a Duel Runner, but rather reading a magazine with red cheeks and unzipped pants. His reaction when he had noticed Akiza was not very much like him, as he had panicked, quickly hid the magazine, and tried to pass it off like everything was normal. She hadn\u2019t seen much but the cover\u2019s picture of a rather heavyset woman ( the name of the magazine was sometjing like \u2018BBWG Monthly\u201d had tipped her off: Yusei liked his ladies large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had basically given Akiza a bit more insight on what Yusei liked in a woman. And she could use that to her advantage to get his attention. So now, she had a lam, or rather, two plans. She could find a copy of that magazine, and from gather information on how to best gain weight(healthy) and possibly there question Yusei, or she could find a place and stuff herself silly, and get ahead start on getting a wider frame.

Her shirt slid tightly back on, it failing to stretch to cover her new gut, amd her arms feeling slightly compressed by the long sleeves.

She had payed $30 for these...! Then the door bell rang again, and she snapped back to reality. After a few more go\u2019s and failing, she settled for using friction and tightness in her upper thighs and buttocks to keep the jeans in place, and she did the belt up to the last hole for insurance. Her jacket was tight around the back, but her shoes still fit. She put her glasses on her head and made her way to the door as quickly as possible, opening it as to see who was ringing the door bell so persistently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wish she hadn\u2019t.

And yet this single though of his sister gaining weight triggered a switch deep inside his inner being. It was mix of healthy curiosity and a strange fascination, which he simply couldn\u2019t understand. From this point on, he dedicated a large part of his free time to imagine his own sister gaining weight by different means. He was addicted by that single thought for days, no matter how sick these were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Leo was ready to make his dreams come true and really fatten his sister up. Aside of the regular force feeding with lots of food over a longer period, he also bought some instant and temporary weight gain pills that, combined with food, will make that person gain weight instantly, but the weight gain will dissolve after one day, making her turn back normal like nothing happened. What will be used is up to the writer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first idea would be to convince his sister to gain weight. It will definitely backfire, but he could try it out.<br>\r\nThe most likely scenario which will piss off Luna and maybe scar their relationship is to force fed her.

We- hey, where are you going, Dubhe?!\u201d Luna could hear footsteps walk-in away from the cave.<br>\r\nA third voice spoke up, the Dubhe in question. \u201cI am off to inform the rulers that we have one of the Signers, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNash won\u2019t like that we only have one, you know!\u201d Megrez sounded out with a mocking tone.

These alien things, for a lack of a better word, had abducted her to serve as bait so they could capture all the Signers. So far, she had seen the three who had jailed her, a fellow named Vector, and some kind of rulers, one named Nash. If they had rulers, they must have been a civilisation. Why did they want to kidnap the Signers? And what exactly were these alien things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, back to my point, what is there to consider?! We have one of them, we can use her as bait, and the others will come and try to save her, and we\u2019ll catch them in the attempt, and then King Nash, Lady Merag and Marin can do whatever they\u2019re going to do with them.\u201d Megrez quickly went back to his conversation with Merak, and thus so spoiled whatever plan these aliens had cooked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...but..\u201d Merak paused for a moment, and then countered Megrez\u2019s words with his own. \u201cWhat if they don\u2019t come immediately to save their fellow Signer? Or decide she\u2019s not worth it? What if we only capture some of them when they come to rescue her, and the rest escape and have to be hunted down? Humans have different basic needs to us Barians, you know. Humans have to eat, drink, sleep, eject waste from their bodies....the list goes on, and we need to keep our prisoners alive untill we have all of them, or they won\u2019t come...or worse, get mad and demolish us. Long term thinking.\u201d Barians....that\u2019s what they were? But more importantly, they were trying to prepare for the long haul....not good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegrez didn\u2019t respond, and when he did, it was stutter filled.. \u201cI.....um, I...I was tinki-kink.....thinking long term!\u201d he spluttered out.<br>\r\nMerak didn\u2019t believe him, from the tone of his voice. \u201cUh Huh....tell me then. How would you make a long term solution for keeping the prisoners fed and watered without giving her a chance to escape?\u201d Uh oh....<br>\r\nMegrez\u2019s voice, filled with uncertainty, responded with \u201cWell......\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was feeling hungry, but not so that she wanted a proper meal. She put her clothes back on as best as she could-minus her shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd I not notice the damage to these?\" Luna's poor shorts were stretched far past their breaking point, and had several small tears in them. She doubted that they wouldn't have lasted any longer had she not noticed her weight gain. Frankly, she wasn't too sure how they had survived up until now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably would have exploded right off me...!\" Luna realized with a blush. Stepping out of the bathroom, she passed through the kitchen on her way to the bedroom to grabs some more cookies, and drape the stretched shorts over the bin. Opening the cookies, she devoured one of the delicious cookies in two bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered her bedroom, the first thing she did was drop the cookies on her bed and then, bending other, opened her bedside drawer and pulled out a laptop, hidden underneath her undergarments. She had received the laptop as a birthday gift from Crow and Yusei, along with a few booster packs from the Invasion of Worms set(Likely free of cost, as Yusei had a part-time job setting up and updating the Duel Terminals.) Leo had got one too, and the siblings had sworn to each other to keep the two laptops separate. Luna had gotten a pink laptop case for her's and hidden underneath her undergarments when not in use or charging, cause she knew that Leo wasn't going to go looking there anytime soon. She placed it on her bed, and grabbed the charger cable as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she waddled/walked over to her closet and opened it up, so she could try and cover her panties. Even though she wasn't going out,  you never know who might pay a visit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, none of her pants would fit her anyone, so she would have to wear one of her skirts....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhhmmmmgghhh...!...no good... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....if she could get them around her waist. None of them came close to making it around her increased size! So, she joined two skirts together and tryed again. The super skirt fit! If just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorta perfect....\" Now, she needed to figure out where she was going to do her research. She wanted to obviously surf the web near a power outlet, of which there was one in the lounge room, and one in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich should she choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>....now that Luna was thinking, she realised that her current snack array was poor. She only had chips and biscuits, and both of those snacks had disadvantages. The chips were always sticking to her teeth, and those cookies, now that she realised, tasted bad. Not \u2018horrible\u2019, inedible bad, but there was something in them that she didn\u2019t like the taste of. She would have to make the walk to the store and get some new snacks. She could save the ones she had now for lat-......actually, Leo could have them. She was newly fat, not newly a glutton! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with a goal in mind, Luna begun to put her clothes back on the best she could.....expect she stopped when she picked up her shorts.

Frankly, she wasn't too sure how they had survived up until now, as they were ready to give up the ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey would have burst right off me...!\u201d Luna realised with a blush. Folding the pants up and slinging them over her shoulder like Leo would sling a towel, she made her way out of the bathroom, passing near the bin to place the shorts on the lid. She wasn\u2019t too sure what to do with them right now, but if she wanted to go out in public, she needed to cover her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into her room, she waddled/walked over to her closet and opened it. Obviously, none of her pants would fit her anymore, so she would have to wear some one her skirts. Pulling out a few skirts, she attempted to fit them around her expanded waistline, with little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhhmmmmgghhh...!...no good... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....if she could just get them around her waist.

If just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorta perfect....at least for now.\u201d She would have to buy a much big skirt or much bigger pants when she went out. Retreaving her Duel Disk and her deck from her bedside cabinet and strapping it to her arm, she headed for the front door. She nearly grabbed the last pack of cookies, but stopped herself and instead headed for the door. Leo would be back soon, and she could trust her brother to watch the place. Still, she grabbed her set of keys and locked the door when she exited the house, before slipping the keys into her bossom. \u201cWho needs pockets, anyway?\u201d Luna giggled.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n\u201c,&gt;\u2014\u2014\u2014/ 5DS<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\nThe mall wasn\u2019t too far from Luna and Leo\u2019s house, but due to the extra weight Luna was carrying on herself, it felt like the distance had increased by a fair bit. Not helping were the looks she was getting from passerby\u2019s, a fair amount fixed on her backside. The looks on their faces were varied, but Luna figured most of them were because of her very much visible panties. It was a wonder someome Sector Security hadn\u2019t stopped her yet! Still, she was getting closer to her destination.</span></div></div>",
