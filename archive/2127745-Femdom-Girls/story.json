I was 8 years old when I first saw Grace; she was not the most beautiful girl and one could even say that she was a bit chubby. Of course, at the time, I did not know that she would become a dream (nightmare).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when I was in the fifth grade, 2 years aafter Grace moved into the house next door. We had been friends ever since but I always suspected an alternate motive behind everything she did. It wasn\u2019t until I was 10 years old that it happened. At that point of time, I was one of the taller guys in my class at 5'2\", and Grace finally decided to ask me out near the end of the school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to subtly put her down, but she kept clinging on the me. Eventually, I had to push her aside and tell her that I only saw her as a friend and that I liked the girl named Ashley in my class more. Hearing this, Grace ran off in a storm of fit and screamed that I would regret not accepting her. I tried to chase after her but my crush Ashley came up to me and started to talk to me so I forgot about Grace. One week later, my mom told me to go ask Grace's mom if they would like to go to the beach together. As you go to their house, Grace's mom answered the door. She was a beautiful and 5'7 tall lady who was still in her 20s. Her husband had left because she did not want to get an abortion so she had been raising Grace alone. She was standing in her 3 inch platforms because she was about to leave for work. When she answered the door, I instantly got a boner staring up at the 5'10\" women in heels. When I asked her if they could come to the beach she said that...</span></div></div>",

She is going to stay there for 2 years because she got invited to a female athletic sports camp. \"Oh..\" you said, trying to figure out why Grace will ever leave to do something without telling you. As you left Grace's house, time started to pass, eventually you and Ashley started dating. Suddenly, over the summer of your 7th grade year, Ashley passed away, her body was found with her neck snapped and in a river near the local grocery store. She was so full of life why would anyone want to kill her. The police eventually found a suspect by the name of Richard Holmes and all the proof strayed towards him. However, Richard was dead as well with a gun shell in his head. The police eventually ruled it off as a drunk man trying to get some action, but when it failed he went suicidal. No one noticed that Richard was battered and had his neck broken as well. . .</span></div></div>",

On the first day of school, you realized that there was a girl in your homeroom class that you didn't recognize. Also the girl was extremely beautiful and was as tall as you at 5'4\". However, for the entire semester you never brought up the courage to talk to her, but you did catch her sometimes staring at you. Finally during the second semester, you had two classes with her, language arts and science. Somehow, luckily you were her lab partner, but it was pre-assigned and their was only one lab a semester. However, during the 2nd week you finally found out her name when she came to talk to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, remember me?\" The girl said; confused, I looked around to make sure no one else was around me. \"Wow, I leave for 2 years and everyone has forgetten about me.\" She said. No way I thought it couldn\u2019t be her but I just had to confirm it. \"Grace?\" I asked her, \"Bingo.\" She said smiling. Grace had changed so much that I didn't even recognize her. \"I heard about what happened to Ashley, it's such a tragedy.\" She said. I was almost over Ashley but the mere thought of her again put me into a depressed mood. From that point on, I was barely paying any attention to Grace. Eventually, she lefted after getting my new number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------TIME SKIP---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the year, I had grown another inch and was now taller than Grace. Eventually we started dating for the few weeks we had before Grace was to leave for volleyball camp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Both of these choices take place near the end of the summer.***</span></div></div>",

On the week before school started, I went to the banquet which was suprisingly close to my home. As I walked in I noticed that it was a rather empty place, only the team and  me were there. As I walked into the main hall, all I saw were girls, looking around I couldn't find Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I decided to ask one of the girls in the middle of the room who looked like she might be a coach. As I walked up to the girl I noticed that she was probably at least 5'8\" without the heels, but with her platform wedge heels, she was easily 5'10\" or 11\". As I reached up to tap her shoulder, she turned around and to my surprise it was Grace.  \"Oh, hey you made it,\" Grace said towering over me as she grabbed me by the shoulder and introduced me to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stared up at Grace who had grown over 4 inches during the summer, I started to feel insecure as I backed away from her. I left the party early without saying good-bye to her. However, on the way home I met Ashley's sister. She was only one year younger than Ashley and they looked nearly the same. I instantly fell in love and we started to set up a date...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace's POV:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as my boyfriend slipped away, I tried to find him but I saw him leaving. I decided to follow him home and surprise him later.. but that all changed. I saw the girl that looked exactly like that slut I had murdered last year. Something in me snapped when I noticed that my boyfriend has not gotten over her yet. Revenge will be mine. I followed the girl home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy POV:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got home I quickly texted Emily to ask her when she would want to go on a date.

As you were about to exit the park, you heard your phone vibranting as you pulled it out to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a text message from Emily that asked me where I was. I quickly replied that I was leaving because I thought that I was there on the wrong day. Emily told me that she was at some sort of bathroom area and that she was lost, i knew exactly where she was because I had gotten lost there with Grace a couple of times as children. I texted that I will be right there and ran towards the bathroom. But I hadn't ran more than 30 seconds when I got another text, it was from Grace. I decided to ignore it for now and pretend later on that my phone had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got to the bathroom area, I noticed that Emily wasn\u2019t any where to be seen. As I pulled out my phone to text her I heard her ringtone in the bathroom. As she texted me back and told me to meet her inside the bathroom, I got excited and thought that I was about to get some already. It was pretty late and there was no one in the park. I quickly ran in to the bathroom, the only stall that was occupied was the handicapped one and as I opened the door.. I saw Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not moving and she looked seriously hurt. As I looked around I thought that there might have been a rapist or serial killer around. I quickly grabbed my phone but noticed that it wasn't there. As I suddenly realized that my phone had fallen out of my pocket in my excitement. I quickly ran out the stall and grabbed my phone to go outside to call the police. As I was running out I suddenly bumped into a large object and fell down. \"Oh no,\" I thought, \"it's the murderer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I fell to my butt and looked up I saw a pair of heels and my heart rose, it might not have been the rapist but as I looked up I saw Grace with her arms crossing glaring down at me. \"What are you doing here?\" Grace hissed. I dropped my phone and told her what happened but she ignored me and just said so you were cheating on me. I realized the situation I was in and knew that I had to call the police before the killer actually came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly grabbed my phone and started to type in 911 but Grace grabbed my phone and crushed it... What the.. how was she so strong I thought as Grace squatted down and said \"You're dead.\" She flicked my in the forehead and sent me flying down the bathroom until I hit the opposite wall. As I sat there motionless Grace walked into the stall and grabbed Emily and brought her in front of me. As she held Emily in a reverse choke lift with one arm she used her other hand to lift me up too in a throatlift. \"Here this is what you wanted right,\" Grace screamed as she forced me towards Emily and made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Grace was insane as she threw Emily back into the stall and lifted me higher on the wall as she repeatedly smashed my head until I died.</span></div></div>",

As shd caught me staring at her she asked if I would like to sit on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to please her to get her to quickly leave I said sure and got up and sat on her soft lap. As soon as I sat down I realized that my feet couldn't touch the ground she was just so much taller than me. After a while I told her that i had to go. As I tried to jump off her lap her hands cupped my chin and she wrapped her arms around me and whispered \"Still lying to me, huh?\" as she increased the pressure. I tried to break free but it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she stood up bringing me with her. As I was held in a reverse throatlift dangling a couple of inches off the hround. \"You lied to me, you just didn't want to see me.\" She hissed in my ear at this point I was flailing and thrashing trying to get free but her choke was just too strong. I was passing out fast with one last effort I managed to break out of her hold. However, it felt too easy but I dismissed it in the heat of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I fell to the ground trying to catch my breath I was once again sent flying by a kick in the stomach. I flew backwards and rolled over 20 feet backwards. It was over for me as I tried to crawled away but Grace was right behind me as she grabbed the back collar of my shirt, picked me up and slammed me to the ground again and again until I died.</span></div></div>",

So I decided to text back to Emily \"I'm sorry, but I cannot be your boyfriend, I already have a girlfriend.\" I waited for a while but never got a response from Emily. I thought that she must have been really upset with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the summer past fast and I didn't see Grace because I was busy hoping to finish my summer homework. However, near the end of the summer, I heard on the news that a girl had been missing for a while now. It was Emily. The last time she was seen was when they saw her with me. I was arrested and put into juvenile hall for the kidnapping of Emily. They never found her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, I was locked away for quite a while before new evidence arose and showed that I was at least not guilty of the crime. Luckily, I was able to keep up with my studies and I was able to stay on track to go to highschool. When I returned I realized that I no longer had any friends no one wanted to hang out with a potential criminal and I was pushed away to the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't seen Grace in a while so I decided to text her to ask her to meet me at the local pond where we always used to hang out. When I arrived the next day and stood waiting for Grace to come I saw a beautiful tall girl who had to have been almost 6 feet tall. She saw me and started walking towards me, I couldn't believe it, it was Grace. When she saw me, she realized that the top of my head didn't even come up to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared down at me towering, she said \"Sorry, but you're just too short for me now,\" as she walked away. 3 days later, at school I was being chased by a couple of jocks who thought that I was out to do no good. In a split decision, I realized that I was trapped and there was only two rooms to go into.</span></div></div>",

As we heard a couple of slams and loud smacking sounds it stopped. Then Grace walked in and sat at her throne. We knew that we were supposed to crawl up one by one and worship her feet. As the first guy went up he started to kiss her feet but after about 15 seconds, Grace snapped her foot and kicked him backwards flying. \"Wow,\" Grace growls as she got up and grabbed the guy she just kicked by the throat and lifted him into the air, \" you guys really are just useless shits huh,\" as she choked out the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, I realized that she was emotionally unstable and that we could easily take her if we wanted to, but something also told me that the boyfriend that dumped her wasn't any thing important to her.</span></div></div>",

I wondered why Emily would choose this location; because I could have swore that her house was on the other side of town. I decided to ignore this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked through the park I realized that i did not know where exactly in the park we were supposed to meet. I decided to call her. As I dialed her number, I heard the ringtone behind me as suddenly I got hit in the back of the head. As I feel down to the ground thinking I got jumped, all I saw was Grace standing there. Was it my imagination? I wondered as I blacked out..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up I was in someones bedroom. As I opened my eyes bigger and looked around I realized that I was in Grace's bedroom. Nothing had changed at all since the last time I visited so many years ago. I realized that somehow I had gotten here. As I sat up slowly and got off the ground I decided to walk around the room a little. After a while, the door opened and Grace walked in. As I turned around to look at the towering girl, she asked me \"Why? Why did you break up with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't answer but something told me that this girl had snapped. She was probably the one who had knocked me out in the park. But how did she carried me here? I wondered. It was then that I found out as Grace walked up to me and slapped me around the face sending me flying to the ground. \"Why? \" Grace screamed as she walked up to me pulling me up by the collar and lifting me to my feet. As I tried to run the opposite way she pulled me back and slapped my other cheek with an exploding slap and sent me flying to the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, I knew I had to fight back or I wasn\u2019t going to mke it out of here. So I quickly got up and ran at her and managed to tackle her to the ground. I hadn't been the most athletic guy but I managed to do it. It was then that Grace kicked me in the stomach with both of her heels and sent me flying a couple of feet backwards. Damn how was she so strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the wind knocked out of me, I wasn\u2019t able to move as Grace walked up to me and grabbed my throat and lifted me to her eye level with her heels on about 6 inches off the ground. \"How dare you treat me like this?\" Grace said as she extended her arm and lifted me higher into the air, \"How dare you break up with me through a text message?\" Then she threw me 10 feet across the room. Luckily, I landed on her bed. As I recovered my breath, I knew that it was over for me unless I ran or begged for my life.</span></div></div>",

The payment for the job was amazing, there was no paycheck but rather a success track. If we made it through the job properly, we would get massive compensation in the form of a fully paid 2 million dollar house, 3 cars, and a hundred million dollar.

Although, out of the corner of my eye, I kept spying on her and seeing her reject all the guys that tried to hit on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, may I have your attention,\" I heard a voice from the center of the room, \"it was a man.\" We all looked towards him as he introduced him. It turns out that he was retiring and the family needed a new butler, and the girl that was sitting in the corner happened to be the eldest daughter of the family. The new butler's task will be to guide the girl and may eventually be allowed to marry her if deemed worthy and in term inherit the family's fortune. Upon hearing this, the majority of the guys in the group starting cheering and started screaming out questions like \"What do we have to do?\" and \"How do we apply?\" Although there was also a couple of skeptical guys who were wondering if this was legit. At that the butler handed each of us a stack of hundred dollar bills. We were then told to leave and meet at their mansion 3 days from now after we had enough time to verify if the money was real..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButler's POV:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Miss Katherine I have done exactly as you told me,\" the butler said. \"Good,\" Katherine replied \"I heard all of it myself, now we will see which one of these males will be a proper slave replacement for you my dear butler,\" as Katherine stood up towering over the butler's measly 5'7\". \"I guess it is good-bye for you then,\" Katherine said regretfully as she walked out of the bar leaving the man behind. \"Yes, it will be,\" the man said as he walked towards Euturn Bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour POV:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you walked to the bank to see if the money was real and it turned out it was. After answering some questions from the bank teller asking you where you got the money and how, you were set free to return home. Three days later you got ready to go to the mansion, you knew that you would have to put up a proper act if you were going to succeed at gaining the job. When you arrived at the mansion, you noticed the signs that pointed towards the interview room, as you followed them towards the room you noticed the line of people waiting to get in. Finally, it was your turn to enter, you were the last one. As soon as you walked through the doors all you saw was the girl from the other day sitting on a throne of a sort with her legs crossed. \"Kneel.\" the girl said emotionlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The story takes place in a unnamed town. <br>\r\nYou are a male who is varying in age and circumstances depending on the scenario. In all the scenarios, you are 5'5\" tall. The main characters (girls) are much stronger than the guys and they love to dominate them. There are three possible scenarios that can be chosen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace - Classmate<br>\r\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 In this storyline, you are a student at East High School in your junior year. Grace is a girl that you have had a crush on since you were children. This storyline starts during your childhood where Grace actually liked you. But as shr grew older, you weren't tall enough for her so she started to humilate and dominate you. Grace is 5'11\" tall with a beautiful face, straight silky hair, and does not have great curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Sarah - Twin Little (big) Sisters<br>\r\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This storyline will have you the main character being outgrown by your little sisters. When they were little, you would constantly bully them both, but now that you are almost 19, you have pretty much stopped growing. Your sisters are 15 years old and have both blossomed into beautiful ladies. Amy is 5'9\" tall and Sarah is 5'7\" tall, both of them wear their hairs in a bunch of curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine - Mistress<br>\r\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This storyline will take place in the future when you are about 28 years old. You have just got out of college after 10 years with a doctorate degree and more. However, just when you thought your life was at a peak, you went to a bar late one night and met Katherine. That meeting caused your life to come shattering down before you. Katherine is a 17 year old, 6'3\" tall blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n - Prefer height and strength domination but other stuff such as feet or ass domination works too.<br>\r\n- I reserve the right to edit or delete any entries.</td>",
