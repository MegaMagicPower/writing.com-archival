I think it will help the readers out to keep tabs on all the powers Sylar currently has. (though this could get to be too much, later on; we'll see.)  So each time Sylar kills off a super, just copy and paste the previous list, and then add the new one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrent Location: NEW YORK:<br>\r\nPowers, so Far:    Telekinesis <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many powers, for a hungry super villain.
