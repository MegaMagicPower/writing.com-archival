We'll be leaving next Monday for our trip to Europe!\" said Mrs. Chambers, patting her son's thigh as the enormous, navy blue limousine pulled up outside of Sterlington Private Academy for Boys. \"You still haven't told daddy and me who you're going to be bringing with you on our holidays!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's right, champ!\" said Mr. Chambers, \"Don't forget, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't forget, mommy. I'll tell you once I come home from school today!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back door to the limousine swung open and Chester waddled out, straining against his enormous school uniform - custom-made to fit his gigantic body - while the family's chauffeur held out his schoolbag for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Davis\", he said, and waddled off to class. Chester was so fat that he had to waddle around school with a walking-stick, to help him keep his balance. He finally made it to his classroom and sat down at the back. He stared around and wondered who he would pick to accompany him on his month-long luxury cruise to Europe and around the Mediterranean... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many people he could choose! Who would he take with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy Jenkins - his poor, but honest friend, who loves feeding Chester all he can eat...and even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiberius Vanderstaal - His extremely good-looking, rich boy-model friend, who loves teasing Chester about his obesity, and rubbing his fat-rolls!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan Applewood - his parents run a vegan healthfood company that he can't stand! Maybe a month of junkfood will cheer him up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper DeJaeger - Hollywood superstar and child-actor extraordinaire - one of Chester's oldest friends, who has a weakness for his friend's massive size. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

S-sorry dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester had waddled into school and was heading to his locker when he slammed into something thin and pale, bowling little Timmy Jenkins right off his feet! His spectacles fell to the ground! As Chester struggled to regain his balance, he'd accidentally trodden on them, his 525-pound bulk crushing them to pieces! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got them!\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\" said Chester quickly. He pulled Timmy to his feet, \"Oh man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad's gonna kill me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester knew that Timothy was exaggerating, but not by much - The Jenkins family was one of Sterlington Academy's charity-cases - intelligent, deserving kids who got into the school on a free scholarship paid for by the school board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy was exceptionally bright, but also a magnet for bullies. He was also one of Chester's closest friends - the fat kid, and the scrawny geek with glasses naturally stuck together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get my dad to buy you a new pair!\" said Chester, \"Sorry dude! Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" said Timmy, \"I have a spare pair in my bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy pulled out his old pair of glasses and carefully fitted them onto his thin, pale face. Like Chester, Timmy had blonde hair, although his was lighter, and his skin was paler, his eyes a frigid icy blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude!\" said Chester. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay!\" said Timmy, massaging his elbow where he'd fallen over. \"Ow, that stings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get my dad to buy you a new pair!\" said Chester at once, \"Sorry dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ches. You're the best!\" said Timmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys went to their lockers and Chester shoved his bag inside and pulled out his books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Timmy, uh...\" he paused. \"Um...y'know school holidays start soon and uh, well my parents are going on a trip to Europe...you wouldn't wanna come with me, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy laughed, \"Dude, I can't go to Europe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean you'd come as my friend! My guest! We'd pay everything for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...But Ches that's gotta be like a million bucks! I can't...I mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please? It'd be really cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah but...I...really? Me? You have so many other rich friends you could take!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm offering because you're my friend, not because of...whatever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yeah I...Sorry Ches I didn't mean...I mean...I...\"</span></div></div>",

A flurry of golden hair and blindingly white teeth was his first impression, when a tall, and extremely good-looking boy sat down in the desk next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiberius Vanderstaal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vanderstaals were one of those insanely rich, old-money families. Tiberius's grandfather was the CEO of Vanderstaal Apparel, one of the most famous luxury clothing and accessories companies in the world. Tiberius was naturally decked out in the finest clothes that money could buy. He looked just like a model - because he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tiberius...\" Chester groaned, rolling his eyes. His friend laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Ches?\" he asked, \"What are you doin' for the holidays? Gonna camp out in your factory and eat all the leftovers, huh fatty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOR your information, my family is going to EUROPE for the holidays and I WAS asked to pick a FRIEND to come with me\", said Chester, \"And I WAS thinking of asking YOU. But if that's how you wanna be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! No, c'mon dude! No cool!\" Tiberius said, \"You're gonna invite me, ain'tcha!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I dunno...after all...perhaps I should ask Timmy...he'd like it more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timmy!? You don't want to invite him! C'mon man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or if you don't wanna go to Europe with your parents, you could come to my place for a sleepover!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a whole month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester rolled his eyes, \"You are IMPOSSIBLE, Tiberius...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossibly CUTE\", he teased, and leaned in to give his friend a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEWWW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiberius laughed, \"So c'mon fatty, what's it gonna be? Either way, you know I'mma be good company...\" he teased. </span></div></div>",
