            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the middle of the day and Sonic and Tails were on patrol in town making sure no Eggman schemes were happening and lucky for them nothing was. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a day where Eggman does nothing at all and we can enjoy the day ourselves\u201d. Sonic agrees and replies, \u201cYou said it little buddy. Why don\u2019t we go ahead and grab ourselves a couple of chili dogs?\u201d. Tails agreed and began following Sonic until he saw something in the corner of his eye. It was a small dark tent that seemed to be calling him to enter and ran inside with Sonic following. He started looking around and seeing many items that could be classified as either intriguing or bizarre and maybe both. \u201cLook at all this stuff. Would you want to get anything Sonic?\u201d. \u201cNah, all this stuff looks weird to me.\u201d They both kept looking around until Tails found a medium size rectangular box. The top was blank so Tails opened the book and saw many pieces looking like it being part of a game. \u201cI think this a board game we should buy it\u201d. Sonic began looking at it himself and gave his opinion, \u201cThis looks normal from the rest of things around here. Why not\u201d. They tried looking around for the owner when a figure in a cloak looking to be an elderly female alligator comes out of the shadows. \u201cGreetings. How may I help you?\u201d. Tails slightly afraid still asked, \u201cHello ma\u2019am. How much for the board game?\u201d. \u201cAh, I\u2019d be willing to part with it for twenty rings.\u201d Tails thought it as a steal and paid for it while Sonic shouted out, \u201cCome on Tails!\u201d Just as they were leaving the elderly alligator was preparing to give a warning. \u201cBeware new owners of the game. You will be faced with many strange occurrences as you... oh they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m sure they find out sooner or later. Good luck\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails caught up with Sonic and then asking, \u201cCan you call the rest of our friends to play tonight\u201d. Sonic replies, \u201cSure. Right after we enjoy those chili dogs. Tails just laughed and followed Sonic to get their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Sonic and his friends gathered at Tails\u2019 house and workshop. They were all enjoying drinks and snacks while they were waiting for the last two guests to arrive. The ones who showed up already, excluding Sonic, were Knuckles, Amy, Cream, Shadow, and Rouge. Finally, the last two guests Silver and Blaze finally arrived with Tails to greet them while Silver had something to say, \u201cDid you know Eggman is spying you outside\u201d. Tails looked outside and sure enough Eggman was outside. \u201cEggman? What are you doing here?\u201d. Eggman explained, \u201cWell a little robo birdie told me you were going to play a game together. Can I join you pleeeaase?\u201d. Tails didn't trust him but still asked, \u201cAre you going to cheat?\u201d to which Eggman nodded no but Tails can clearly see him crossing his fingers but gave up and let him inside. Tails then revealed the game and pulled the tome like manual and read the premise of the game. All players are friends who travel to many places and during their travels stumbled into a dark mysterious area where they tried to go back but can\u2019t as some mysterious force prevents them to. A mysterious voice says the trespassers need to exit the other end of the land but while walking through will be inflicted with many curses on the way. Will the friends make it or all suffer from the curses never be seen again? After reading the premise of the game, some gave their thoughts. Shadow starts, \u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t join in these ridiculous games, but this one sounds dark and morbid so I\u2019ll join in. Amy continues, \u201cGame sounds fun. Cream and I will play as long it doesn\u2019t take too long for I need to take Cream home later\u201d. Everyone else agreed thinking it was just a harmless board game. They each grabbed a game piece and placed it on the board with each piece changing color based on the player it represents.\u201cSo, who should go first?\u201d. Sonic replies, \u201cSince it\u2019s your game why don\u2019t you go first. Tails thought it was reasonable and grabbed the die and noticed there was a skull to represent a one. Though concerned he brushed it off and rolled the die and moved his piece and went and took a card as the rules state after each move a player must take a card or the game won\u2019t continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled a card from the stack and at first nothing was on it but after a few moments an image was beginning to form. Once the image was complete it showed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tails was confused by the image on the card and showed it to everyone. \u201cWhat is this supposed to-\u201c his sentence was cut short when a light flashed from the card. One the light faded it looked like nothing happened. Tails was going to speak when he felt strange. His chest felt heavy and suddenly breasts were forming behind his chest fluff, a vagina was forming in place his cock used to be, and he started becoming curvy and round in all the right places for a female. It took a while but he realized that he became a she. Now with that fact in her brain she immediately began hiding behind many things trying to hide her female parts. For some reason Sonic started laughing and Tails was taking it a little too personal. \u201cStop laughing Sonic. This isn\u2019t funny.\u201d Sonic couldn\u2019t hear what she was saying as his laughter blocked out what she was saying. Tails started getting angrier until she then changed to leaking tears and shouted, \u201cSonic you jerk!\u201d running away crying leaving toward her room. Sonic stopped laughing when he saw Tails leave and everyone looked at Sonic. \u201cThat was horrible Sonic\u201d says Amy pretty much saying what everyone wants to say. Sonic being oblivious what he did asks, \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t think my laughing would affect him\u201d. \u201cSonic, sometimes you don\u2019t understand girls at all\u201d. Sonic confused by that statement replies, \u201cBut Tails isn\u2019t a girl\u201d. Amy had to get it through his thick head, \u201cWell he is one now. You laughing hurt his.. her... I mean Tails\u2019 feelings. Go see him... her.. Tails right now. Sonic feeling bad agreed and went lookin for her around the house. He looked up to the bedroom and can hear weeping coming from the bathroom. \u201cTails? You in there? Look I\u2019m sorry for what I did I wasn't thinking about the situation and I\u2019m sorry. After a few seconds, Tails finally answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me but when I saw my breast laughing at my misfortune instead of getting angry I felt compelled to run away and cry all my pain\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry buddy. Will you please forgive me?\u201d. Tails replies with, \u201cSince you apologized and you are my best friend, of course I forgive you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith things patched up between them, Sonic had to ask, \u201cWith things settled, how will you solve that coverage problem?\u201d. Tails began looking around the bathroom and saw a few clips, scissors, and a few large towels which gave her an idea. Sonic can hear noises coming from the bathroom but decided to wait for Tails to finish whatever she was doing. After a while the noises stopped and the door opened revealing Tails wearing a dress of some kind. Tails explained, \u201cI managed to make a makeshift dress out of the towels. The hard part was making a hole just in the right place for my tails to go through\u201d where she then turned around sticking out her ass showing her curves while wagging her tails. Not wanting to make it weird he looked away while blushing a little. Tails was confused why Sonic was doing that when she realized what she\u2019s done and turned around and blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to change the subject, Sonic asks Tails if she wants to meet up with the others and she agrees until they hear a voice saying \u201cGuys? I think you need to come over here\u201d.</span></div></div>",

They followed her pointing leading to everyone gathered at the door. They can see Knuckles punching some invisible wall as they were trying to leave but some force won\u2019t let them. Knuckles gave up saying, \u201cIt\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t break through it\u201d. This gave Eggman the opportunity to be their hero for once. Stand aside Knuckles. Leave this to a genius\u201d. He started pressing a couple of buttons on a device on his wrist and soon enough buzz bombers surrounded Tails\u2019 workshop and begin firing their lasers at the weird barrier creating a large smoke cloud. Once the smoke clears, nothing was changed and they were still trapped. \u201cWell I\u2019ve done all I can\u201d as he gave up and went to enjoy more snacks in the kitchen. It then occurred to Tails, \u201cI think it\u2019s the game that won\u2019t make us leave. It makes with my sudden \u201cchange\u201d and not being able to leave\u201d. This seemed reasonable to Shadow and he knew what to do. \u201cI\u2019ll handle this. Chaaaooss...\u201d. Tails noticed and tried to stop him but was too late, \u201cSpear!\u201d and Shadow flung chaos energy at the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the smoke clears, they all see the game without even a scratch but there was a burn mark all around the game on the table. \u201cShadow! Did you have to ruin my table?\u201d in which Shadow replies gives a scoff while turning his head. \u201cAnyways, I think we need to reach the end of the game to make things back to normal and be free. So, who\u2019s going to go next?\u201d. \u201cI think Shadow should go next\u201d says Sonic. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019m going next. You\u2019re just a coward and don\u2019t want to go next\u201d. This was then Sonic found a way to trick the black hedgehog. \u201cSure I\u2019m a coward, but that makes you a coward as well doesn\u2019t it? The ultimate life form afraid\u201d. This angered Shadow and his pride got the better of him. \u201cI\u2019m the ultimate life form. I fear nothing and I\u2019ll show you\u201d. He immediately grabbed the die and rolled it while realizing what he just did. He turned around to see Sonic with a huge smirk on his face. \u201cI hate you so much Sonic\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then proceeded to move his piece and take a card.

You never have seen the movies!? Buying things from ancient and suspicious looking pawnshops and garage sales always end with cursed or haunted objects and that always happens when not consulting with the owner first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never pegged you in believing the supernatural, Eggman.\" Tailsko said. The rotund human snorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never did I, but evidence proves their existence and I've always looked at how to weaponize them against you.\" Team Sonic rolled their eyes on the comment but the man simply shrugged \"Its always a work in progress but I'll get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!\" Amy shouted calling their attention \"What do we do, I-I can't be pregnant with Shadow! I cannot be his mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone looked at Eggman who was weirder out \"W-what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Egghead. You had seen the movies.\" Sonic started \"How do we return Shadow and Amy back to normal and stop the curse?\" He says which caused Eggman to start thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are only two options; We could destroy the cursed object which it's often impossible, difficult or its a generally bad idea or all three of them combined which means that the curse could either become permanent or it'll get progressively worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's the other?\" Knuckles asked which caused the human to frown<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go through the game until someone's wins, then the curse will lift itself and we all can go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis when everyone now understood the danger of the situation, Tails, and Sonic without knowing had brought a cursed board game and now they were trapped until the game its finished. feeling guilty, Tails looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't have purchased it, I'm sorry guys!\" Tails whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Tails don't look bad, we didn't know any better!\" Sonic said, trying to cheer the vixen up \"We didn't listened to the Alligator lady when she tried to warn us and look in the positive side! All of this is over once we finish the game!\" Sonic said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully!\" Tailsko added \"Being a girl feels... weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get used to Tails.\" Amy added with a smile \"I can help you up if you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Amy...\" Tails said with a smile, her mood clearly improving.

In her mind she thought Shadow did his little trick and disappeared and appear somewhere else to get away from everyone. Suddenly Cream wasn\u2019t feeling well and felt something strange was going on in her belly. Her belly went from flat to slowly inflating and as it grew it began lifting up her orange dress. After a while, her belly stopped growing and the size of her belly was even bigger than the size of her own body. She thought that was the end of it until she felt something moving inside her belly. Any woman would freak out seeing this but Cream had no idea what was happening to her and decided to go to Amy to show her. She lifted her moving belly and her body off the couch and started waddling her way to Amy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little waddling Cream was able to reach Amy and pulled on her arm to get her attention. Amy turns around and gives out a little shriek which made everyone look toward Cream and her shocked to what is happening to her best friend. \u201cCream! What happened to you?. While she was calm Cream replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know but my tummy is moving on it\u2019s own. At first they didn\u2019t believe her but then they saw some moving bumps protruding from her belly. Nobody had a clue what happened to her until Tails had a theory of what happened to Shadow and is happening to Cream. She went back to the board game and picked up the card to see the baby symbol in Shadow\u2019s color inside a belly. This was all coming together but she need more proof and came up with an idea. She went to her work bench in her workshop and pulled out a device and began making modifications to it by adding a microphone and modifying the speakers already installed in the device. The last modification she made was attach the device to a large strap and it was complete and brought it to everyone else. \u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d Sonic asks having no clue what it is. \u201cThis is a special type of listening device that could amplify the sound behind walls. I was originally going to sneak into Eggman\u2019s base and install it in secret so I can get a good listen of his evil plans. Eggman annoyed by that statement says, \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend I didn\u2019t hear that\u201d. Tails rolled her eyes and continued, \u201cAnyways, I\u2019m pretty sure it will amplify sounds behind walls of fresh and will prove a theory I have. Cream, let me put this on you\u201d. Cream allowed it and Tails wrapped the strap around her with the device placed on the front of her large belly. She switched the device on and at first it was only static but then they think they can make out a voice coming through the speakers. \u201cYou think this prison can contain the Ultimate Life Form? Then you made a big mistake. Chaaoooss...\u201d. They were horrified when they saw Cream\u2019s belly growing red and Tails needed to do something to save Cream. \u201cWait Shadow! You\u2019re going to hurt Cream\u201d. This catches Shadow\u2019s attention as he can hear her voice. \u201cTails? Where am I? There\u2019s very little light in here making it hard to see. Also there\u2019s this weird rope attached to my stomach and I can\u2019t get it off\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then began kicking all around him which caused Cream pain. \u201cStop Mr. Shadow. Please. That hurts\u201d. \u201cCream?\u201d Shadow wondered as why he can hear her but not see her. It was time for Tails to explain so no more damage or problems could occur. \u201cListen Shadow. You need to be careful on what you do. From what I found out I believe you are inside Cream\u2019s womb and she is basically your mom at the moment. Cream heard what Tails said and repeated the statement Tails made, \u201cI\u2019m a mommy?\u201d. This made Shadow angry and start raising his voice amplified through the device. \u201cI don\u2019t care where I am! Just get me out of here!\u201d. Tails needed to further explain that the only way to fix his problem is to finish the game. Shadow had no choice but to agree and had to wait inside Cream\u2019s cozy womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Shadow understands they were able to continue the game and Tails asked who will go next. Seeing her friend how she is now, Amy decided to go next and rolled the die then pulled a card. What was shown on the card was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone was still running around the house and workshop while Tails was thinking of reasons shy Shadow disappeared. It was then she had this weird feeling in her stomach. In an instant the vixen felt heavy in her front and looked down and became shocked in what she saw. Her belly grew to the size of a beach ball which instead of making her scream in fear made her scream in anger, \u201cOh come on!\u201d. This got the attention of everyone and came back toward her. Lucky for her, she made the makeshift dress as a two piece so her new belly didn\u2019t stretch it and cause a wardrobe malfunction. \u201cFirst this game made me into a girl and now as a cruel joke it made me fat. Her answer was questioned when suddenly she felt a kick coming from her belly. This made her panic and needed to find out more so she went to pick up the card Shadow left behind. With her dome of a belly, she had difficulty bending down to reach the card but all was okay when Sonic picked up the card and handed it to her. Tails thanked Sonic for his help and looked at the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the baby with Shadow\u2019s color inside a belly and things were coming together for her but she needed a little more to reassure her. While holding her belly she walked toward a work bench and pulled out a device and worked on completing it. During the work a few kicks came from inside her belly causing her to stop. \u201cOof. Hey keep it down in there will you?\u201d. She began to rub her belly and whatever it was calmed down. After a few minutes, she completed the device which looks to be a large monitor equipped with speakers, knobs, and a microphone. She placed it on a strap and then wrapped it around her belly with the device placed on the front of the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began slowly walking toward everyone while being confused what the device was. \u201cWhat is that on your belly Tails?\u201d asks Sonic. \u201cThis device will answer the question of what happened to Shadow\u201d. She began turning on the device and at first it was just just static but then a visual was being shown. What they saw was a baby black hedgehog with red spines curled up and with a fleshy rope attached to its belly button. Amy asks, \u201cIs that Shadow? But he\u2019s a baby. How did this happen?\u201d. Tails then gave an explanation of what she found out. \u201cI looked at his card and from what I can interpret it Shadow became unborn and had to be sent in the womb of any female playing the game. I just happened to be the unlucky one and he was put in my new womb\u201d. At first some of them were skeptical, but not anymore when they saw the black hedgehog did a kick and then a bump protruded from her belly. Cream came closer to Tails to see the baby in the monitor and then looked at Tails large belly. \u201cOh he looks so cute. Do you mind if I rub your tummy and feel the baby Tails. At first she was hesitant but she replies, \u201cSure\u201d. Cream then placed her hand on her belly and began rubbing it and Shadow returned the rubs with a soft kick that made Cream giggle. While letting Cream keep rubbing since it felt good Tails continued, \u201cHopefully, this is not permanent as I really believe the only way to turn everything back to normal is to finish the game. So, who\u2019s going next. After seeing what happened to Tails and Shadow they became afraid and started arguing and trying to pass the turn to another. This made Tails angry and she yelled out, \u201cJust take your damn turn already!\u201d. Shadow can sense that his \u201cmother\u201d was angry which made him angry and made him let out a hard kick which managed to hit Tails\u2019 bladder. Tails then felt a sharp pain below her and now needed to quickly make her way to the bathroom. \u201cShadow, why are you causing problems for me little guy? Listen guys, one of you need to take your tur- turn to continue and finish the game. I need to go but please keep going. I\u2019m begging you. Uurrgh! I can\u2019t hold it anymore! Gotta go\u201d. She immediately made a dash to the bathroom making it in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody around the board game were still hesitant not taking a turn and then Sonic spoke out. \u201cOkay guys, I don\u2019t know what the game has in store for us but if we don\u2019t do something Tails and Shadow will stay like that. As their friends we need to help them and work together to be free of this nightmare. So who will go next?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Tails tries explaining the best she can, \u201cI think that\u2019s a succubus. It\u2019s a demonic creature that lives to have sex with males in their sleep. What\u2019s it doing here when everyone is awake?\u201d. The succubus\u2019 form is fully revealed and begins talking to Blaze. \u201cSo you are the one who summoned me? You look cute and your body does look comfy and warm, but I think it could use a little \u201cboost\u201d. Blaze was confused by what the demon was saying until it spreads it wings and started to fly toward. Blaze still trying to process what was happening was too slow to react and the succubus flew inside her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze began looking all over herself trying to find out what happened to the demon. \u201cBlaze?

Suddenly they saw her clothes burned off her body and were replaced with a skimpy red leather outfit. Then her body starts to change with her breasts and butt grow to a ridiculous size and having curves in all the right places. Then the weirdest of her transformation came when she grew curves horns on her head, bat wings growing on her back, and her cat tail turning into a long thin tail with a pointed end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her transformation, Blaze couldn\u2019t help but feel every part of her new body.

Amy got a look at the card and was about to answer of having no idea when she saw Cream changing. First, Cream was growing taller to the same height as Amy and the rest of the older girls. Then her chest started to inflate where she now had D-cup sized breasts and a bigger and rounder butt. With these new assets it would poke out of her child dress but her clothes changed too as it turned to a two piece dress with a shirt to contain her breasts and a skirt that was able to cover her adult sized butt that had the same colors as her old dress. The only thing not provided was a bra as since she was little and didn\u2019t need one there was nothing to change.

Every transformation of his friends seem horrifying or unfortunate to him that he didn\u2019t care they stay like that while keeping him safe. That all changed though when he saw Blaze who was giving seductive poses while squeezing parts of her sexy body. He knew that Blaze would never act like that for she was always serious and would always get embarrassed when it came to anything sexy. This gave him enough motivation to keep going and pick up the die, rolling it, and after moving his piece picked up a card from the stack.

Sonic stretched his arm and grabbed the card from Silver\u2019s hand to get a better look. Then with a deep voice he says, \u201cYeah, this looks like her card except the clock is moving the other way\u201d. \u201cWell, what is that supposed to-\u201d Silver was saying before he stop mid sentence and just stood still. This concerned Cream as she asks, \u201cMr. Silver? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d. He still stayed in place while he answers with, \u201cI don\u2019t know. All of a sudden my body feels like it\u2019s being pressed and becoming compact into a tight space\u201d. Soon after he felt dizzy and his body started shrinking as he was getting younger until he became a ten year old child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering from his dizziness he couldn\u2019t help but notice that everything and everyone looked bigger. \u201cHey, when did everything get bigger? Tails needed to correct him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that everything got bigger but instead you got smaller. You\u2019re pretty much the same size as Cream was before\u201d. Silver couldn\u2019t believe it but was reassured by Sonic who was behind Silver as he said. \u201cIt\u2019s true Silver. You\u2019re pretty much a kid right now. Silver began turning around to face Sonic but was horrified by what he saw. With his size he didn\u2019t see his friend Sonic but instead a large beast that looked three times his new size. Silver couldn\u2019t help but cower in fear and just started screaming running away. \u201cNo wait Silver come back. I\u2019m not going to hurt you\u201d Sonic says trying to calm him down. Silver kept running from the giant werehog looking back until he crashed into something large. \u201cOof! Silver! Watch where you\u2019re going as you\u2019re going to hurt me or my babies\u201d. Silver then tries facing forward and notices whatever he slammed into was large, round, and warm. He was also able to recognize the voice as it came from Amy. He then started to blush as he realized he crashed into Amy\u2019s pregnant belly. Not knowing what else to do Silver just hugs Amy\u2019s belly for safety and Amy can feel him shivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic gets close enough and tries to check on Silver. \u201cHey Silver, have you calmed down yet?\u201d. Silver nods and replies, \u201cYeah, sorry Sonic. I don\u2019t know why but at this size everything looks scary. Especially you in your werehog form. Eggman wanted to give an explanation as Tails explained the previous one. \u201cSeems Silver with his new regressed size to that now being a child\u2019s size somehow he can have the attitude of a child as well sometimes. It seems understandable he would be afraid of a giant beast of a hedgehog. Either that or he was always a coward and likes to act like a child\u201d. This made Silver angry and he yells out, \u201cShut up Eggman. I\u2019m not acting like this on purpose\u201d. Before he can continue he heard Amy\u2019s voice again. \u201cUm Silver? Would you mind letting go?\u201d. He then notices his hands had a tight grip on her round belly and was hurting her so he immediately let go. \u201cOh. Sorry Amy. Didn\u2019t mean to hurt you or your baby. I think I\u2019m okay and now getting a grasp of the change to my body. It feels weird to be a kid again\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he\u2019s calm and not freaking as a child Silver sits down as his turn was done and there were only two players left to take their turn before going back to first player and repeating the order.

She can feel that aura coursing through her body as she felt powerful. Then her clothes started changing from a tight suit into a long black dress and would only cover the lower half of her breasts and wearing a bra that looked thread like almost like spider web. The final changes was a black pointy hat on her head and a really old book materializing in one hand and a broom appearing in her other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream was amazed by Rouge\u2019s transformation. Wow Miss Rouge. You look like a witch in a storybook except you look really pretty. The boy lefts couldn\u2019t help but agree as with her body she looks like she would belong in a storybook meant for adults as she filled out every part of her new dress with her breasts being squeezed by said dress as well. Tails didn\u2019t become entranced by Rouge like the boys which her eyes focused on the book Rouge was carrying. \u201cWhat kind of book are you holding Rouge?\u201d. Rouge took a look at the book and says her best guess what it could be. \u201cI think it\u2019s some kind of spell book. I\u2019m only guessing it is because for some reason I can see some type of aura emanating from the book\u201d. This gave Tails an idea. \u201cDo you think you can find a spell to fix all the changes made on us?\u201d. Rouge replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Let me see\u201d. Rouge let go of the book and everyone was amazed the book floated right in front of her and with a wave of her hand the book opened. She then wiggles her fingers causing the book to skim through pages while she gives a quick look through each page. After a while, the book shuts close while Rouge gave a disappointed face. \u201cSorry Tails. I didn\u2019t find anything. Figures this cursed game wouldn\u2019t give anything to fix all this\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was getting frustrated and started stomping her feet and even bouncing around forgetting for a moment that Shadow is inside her. \u201cWoah Tails. You need to calm down or did you forget you have a little one inside you right now?\u201d Rouge says while waving her hand around. Suddenly Tails started floating a bit in the air and kept floating until she descended onto a soft chair. After feeling the very soft chair and getting comfortable Tails did calm down and with nothing else to do just started rubbing her round belly. She then saw a hand holding a snack belonging to Sonic\u2019s stretched arm. \u201cHere Tails. You should eat as you might be angry from hunger. If you need anything else just let me know. I care about you as you\u2019re my best friend\u201d. Tails couldn\u2019t help but blush while taking the snack. She started taking nibbles as she was thinking why she felt weird after Sonic said that. Eventually she thought it was nothing as she continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything that occurred, there is only one player left to take their turn before the order repeats again and that was Eggman.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for him, nobody did and they all just shook their heads. He would have gotten angry except for some reason he was feeling pain all over his body. His body, along with his clothes, was shrinking reaching the same height as Sonic and the rest of his friends. But that wasn\u2019t it as his true transformation occurs. His small circular head grew to the shape of a triangle  with a fuzzy muzzle over his mouth and a pointed snout at the end of his face. With his tinted glasses covering his eyes he still had his iconic mustache right below his pointy snout. Instead of a bald head he had brown fur, the same color as his mustache, all over his head under the goggles over his head with small round ears and the fur would be seen growing all over his head if it wasn\u2019t for his red jacket and black pants and connected boots covering his body. Speaking of body, his biggest change was him from having a big belly to make his body to a more tubular and thin shape and finally giving him the appearance of a weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other players were surprised that they saw their egg shaped enemy become something like them. Eggman was recovering from the pain he experienced and knew something was off. \u201cA mirror. Someone bring me a mirror!\u201d Eggman yells out as he was panicking. There was no mirror in sight but Eggman found an object with a reflective surface and saw his reflection. He was shocked at what he has become. \u201cI\u2019m like all of you. A stinkin animal\u201d. This was too good an opportunity for for Sonic so he says in a scruffy voice, \u201cLook on the bright side Eggman.
