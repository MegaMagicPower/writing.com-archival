But she also sported a ridiculously fine body. She was the hottest black girl in the school, and probably the hottest of any ethnicity. Her dark brown hair was kept short, so her curly locks made a cute pixie cut. She had full lips, large, brown eyes and a great smile. Her body was legit- 5' 5\" and DD breasts, which rode high on her chest. She had a slim waist but wide, full hips and a nice backside. Her legs were smooth and lean. She knew how to dress with class and appeal. You missed her. Pity she moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sleep, you feel strange sensations. You shift and toss uncomfortably but don't quite manage to realize what has happened until it is too late- the necklace has been activated, and you have merged while in the dream. </span></div></div>",

Stop!\" Breathing heavy, you started to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You continued to stare into the mirror.

You didn't want to split apart, at least not yet, but, you can't stay like this forever. As you thought long and hard, you heard the door creak. Turning your head, you saw your little sister, Emily. Her face was full of shock, making you assume that she saw what had happened.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't noticed her. Emily was always jealous of Rebekah's gorgeous body, and resented how she used it to manipulate boys to get what she wanted. She hadn't been so blessed with the figure that her sister had. Particularly in the boob department. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRebekah was in a bratty stage, and always asserting her independence. Well, she wasn't going to be independent much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on using the necklace, Emily felt drawn to Rebekah. Slowly, she walked to her bed feeling surges of heat and arousal inside of her. Rebekah was noticeable affected too, but continued to listen to her music. She tugged on the straps of her bra and black tanktop, and fanned herself slightly absent-mindedly. Emily stood next to the bed, behind Rebekah, feeling a powerful longing for closeness with her sister. It was strange. She slowly, gingerly began to move onto the bed. Rebekah had gone still, her head resting on her book, her music stopped, breathing softly, eyes mostly-shut.<br>\r\nEmily slowly slid her pajama and tube-top-clad body over Rebekah's, feeling entranced and compelled in some strange ritual. She laid herself down onto Rebekah, and spread her legs and arms out to match her's perfectly. <br>\r\nThey lay there, slowly breathing, pulses of heat washing over their warm bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the merge began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Emily was right on top of her older sister, she had the strange urge to be bonded with her.  Normally she would hate her guts, but now she feels like she wants to be a part of her life.  Almost on instinct, Emily lowered her head to Rebekah\u2019s neck and kissed it.  Immediately, the two sisters felt hot as their body temperature skyrocketed.  Almost immediately Rebekah turned over on her bed and looked at her younger sister.  Normally, she would scream out loud and tell her to get out of her room.  But for some reason, she wanted to welcome her with open arms.  She then stretched her arms out and closed them around Emily, giving her a deep hug.  Both girls starred at each other with deep blue eyes and were completely flushed.  But then suddenly, without warning, the two planted lips with each other and gave each other a long passionate kiss.  That\u2019s when the necklace really began to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment they started to make out with each other, the necklace glowed and its energy spread to both bodies.  Within moments, their skin got incredibly hot and they were sweating like there\u2019s no tomorrow.  During their kiss, they couldn\u2019t get out of it.  The reason why is because their lips were glued to each other and the skin around the lips started to melt in.  But they didn\u2019t seem to care as their love for each other soon started to escalate.  Around Emily\u2019s back, Rebekah\u2019s hands were melting to each other\u2019s fingers and was completely fused, making Emily trapped with her older sister.  But Emily doesn\u2019t want to escape and want to be with Rebekah for a long time.  The two continued to make love with each other while their bodies melted into one another.  Even their clothes and hair were melting along with them.  But the two didn\u2019t care.  All they want to do is to be together.  Together forever.  As they keep making out, their bodies begin to compress and melt away to nothing.  Rebekah\u2019s breasts were flattening as they melt like two scoops of ice cream while Emily\u2019s droop downward and landed on her older sister\u2019s body.  Their faces too were barely unrecognizable as the sweat was melting off their faces.  The moment they close their eyes, the skin melted over their eyelids and sealed them completely.  Not to mention that their noses and ears closed themselves up due to the melting clogging up with holes.  Though they cannot see nor hear or smell, they can still feel everything.  Their bodies continue to get less and less shapely and more liquidly while their legs and arms formed together.  Within moments, both Emily and Rebekah were long gone and all that\u2019s left was a multi-color goo that was on the bed.  But that was just the first phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the two melted to nothing, the good begins to move around and take shape.  The middle started to get all curvy while two mounds grew at the top and expanded into breasts.  Four stumps grew on the top and bottom of the blob and extended longer, forming feminine but athletic muscles.  At the very top of the body a small lump grew and took shape.  It was obvious that it was going to be a head as the mouth, eyes, nose, and ears began to form.  Soon after that, hair grew on top of her head and went down in waves.  In a matter of minutes, two girls became one as the one was resting on the bed, breathing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mysterious woman slowly opened her eyes and looked up at the ceiling. Feeling a little flushed, she placed her hand on her head and began to rub it.  \u201cOh wow\u2026\u201d she said a little weak, \u201cThat was incredible\u2026\u201d  She suddenly blinked and soon realized the sound of her voice wasn\u2019t her.  Placing her hand on her thought, Emily, the person that held on to the necklace, soon realized what happened.  She quickly got off the bed and approached the full-length mirror to see the end result.  What she saw was truly amazing, as she had merged with her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was beautiful with C-cup breasts and luscious curves of her older sister while having the athletic stature of her former body.  Her face was no exception either as it belonged to a dream queen with glimmering blue eyes, poutty lips, and flat cheeks.  Her hair was long and black with red highlights at the tips, meaning that it was a mixture of her older sister\u2019s and her hair color.  Even her clothes look fantastic, as it was a mixture of hers and her older sister\u2019s as well.  She was wearing a long sleeve floral pajamas with a couple of buttons on the top unhinged, showing off her ample cleavage.  She was wearing no pants to speak off and the bottom hem revealed a bit of her silk skintight panties.  And the long white and stripped tube socks that go up to her slightly muscular knees made her look so hot.  She placed her hands on her hips and made a sexy pose, making her feel completely comfortable about her new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Emily remembers something.  If her body merged with her sister, so does each other\u2019s memories.  She started to concentrate hard and remembered things from her sister and herself.  She remembers about all the athletic achievements from her grade school gymnastics over the years and her cheerleading practice in high school.  She also remembers Rebekah\u2019s sultry actions from tanning at the beach with the bikini strings off, to showing off for the boys in her school.  She finds it more interesting and now she can be both athletic and sexy at the same time.  She then turned around to relax from getting merged.  But the moment she turned around, she noticed something strange.  What was it?</span></div></div>",

His hips began to widen, as he felt the power of the two absorbed girls flow juices into his system, morphing him to fit their new female needs. His butt swelled suddenly, pulling his sweat pants taught around the hips and backside, but leaving loose fabric along his legs, which were now lithe and hairless. His waist was shrinking to a tiny hourglass, but his abs remained toned. His arms shriveled to defined, fainty stems. He felt his hair grow a bit longer and full, his face shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his own reflection again, stunned to see a sharp-featured, defined beauty. His men's medium t-shirt hung loosely around his new feminine form. He felt his cock stiffen, engorged to maximum size as he became aware of the sexual being he had now become. That was the precise moment when he felt the waves of heat in his chest.<br>\r\nShrieking a higher-pitched moan in panic, he tried to hold them in, but they began to just blossom outward with unstoppable abandon. His hands filled with doughy soft boob flesh as they grew into enormous Ccup melons, high and proud on his toned muscular body.

His sisters had just merged in one of the sexiest displays he could ever imagine, and the key to that process lay unguarded on the bed. He had to have this experience- he had to have her body inside of him. <br>\r\nHe put the necklace on, stepped into the bathroom, and pulled the shower curtain away. Rebekah shrieked in surprise but couldn't resist her brother's firm grip. He held her against him as his form drained away into mist and flowed through her nostrils, mouth and ears. She rolled her eyes back and felt her body begin to turn control over to it's new master, her brother and owner of the necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott opened his eyes to find himself in a flawless goddess of a body. He was please to find that her form had been \"adjusted\" to meet his male needs. He was the gorgeous woman he had sought to absorb into, only with his old male equipment, ready for some woman on-woman love. Some very happy lesbians were going to have a great night tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.1zoom.net/Girls/wallpaper/32285/z276.8/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.1zoom.net/Girls/wallpaper/322...</a></span></div></div>",

Showering sounds told her that her friend from grade school was busy, but the occasional, strange moaning made her think twice about what was going on. Was Rebekah Emily playing with herself in there? <br>\r\nThe thought made her blush. She had always had a thing for other girls, and Rebekah Emily was certainly a girl she couldn't help but notice. So often she had dreamt half-awake of sliding under the silk sheets with her friend and intertwining that athletic little bombshell with her own long, elegant form. She was tall, 5' 11\", and not as noticed by the boys because she didn't want to be- always hiding her gorgeous shapely legs, wide, full woman's hips and smal waist, topped by a lovely set of C-cup breasts, under sweaters. She always had her hair up and wore thick glasses to give off that \"academic\" look that kept people un-interested.<br>\r\nBut if only her best friend noticed her, in that way. <br>\r\nShe noticed the strange necklace lying on the bed, and feeling strangely compelled, she picked it up and put it on.<br>\r\nShe felt a tingling, then a buzzing, then a veritable throbbing low down through her breasts and into her womanhood. Wringing her elegant hands together, she kneaded her knees and shifted her hips in their pencil-miniskirt she was wearing, stockings sliding against themselves as she gasped in pleasure.<br>\r\nSomething was happening!</span></div></div>",

What was this power? All logic and fear of rejection fled under this oppressive and invigorating sexual force. Just as she was about to try the doorknob of the small half-bathroom, Rebekah Emily opened the door, clad in nothing but a towel, her eyes wide, chest heaving. Sweat and hot water droplets mixed as they ran from her round cheek, down her slender neck, and out onto the curvature of her ripe melons. Teneille took a step forward, the necklace pulling her towards her friend. <br>\r\nThey said nothing, quickly smothering each other in full-lipped kisses. Teneille's glasses and sweater came away immediately, revealing her straining cup bra which bulged under swollen tits, She squished them up against R.E.'s throat, feeling her friend's own high, round firm C's smushing up against her ribs below her own ample bosom. Slender, silky arms with small, manicured hands slid their way up and down her bare back, teasing the clasp of her bra. The towel fell away, and the two were rolling under the covers of the queen size bed. Interlocking their legs, they rode each other as tongues danced a beautiful symphony. <br>\r\nSuddenly, Rebekah Emily screamed in pleasure and her hips convulsed, bucking against her tall friend. A strange light began to shine around them, and all sense of time and space seemed to roll away. Teneille threw her head back in ecstasy as her new lover gently kisses her throat and long, pale neck. A flood of pleasure and warmth spread over her, starting from her box and spreading upward throughout her body and down her long legs, which she wrapped tightly around her nymph.</span></div></div>",

She was shocked, Teneille, who she had suddenly found herself in passionate throes with, was totally out of sight. She felt a strange throbbing deep within her lower abdomen, and felt the irreversibly pointed drive for sex that she had a moment before- only her lover had vanished!<br>\r\nShe twisted in her bed to realize that her body was... changed somehow. She felt... longer. Looking down at her legs, she noticed that her feet looked a little bigger than before. Her hands were small, as always, but her arms seemed to be... growing!<br>\r\nShe felt her proportions shift as her arms grew slightly, staying firm and toned as she had always had, but absorbing the length of teneille. Her legs were next, starting at the hips, began to grow outward, pushing up the blanket which they lay under until the hang on the edge of the bed. She looked under the sheets to see her gorgeous form blessed with a full, toned and shapely set of woman's legs. Her small, youthful twigs were gone! <br>\r\nHer butt surged, and she reached back to feel her hips widen and fill out, and her butt blossom into a full, round caboose that would fill out a miniskirt nicely. Her waist stayed waspishly small, her abs slightly visible under smooth skin. She got up, feeling tall and graceful, to see herself in the mirror. Shocked, she was a perfect blend of the two faces before. Only, her eyelashes were unusally dark and long, and her lips full and red. Her face was a combined average but also in certain sexual features a product of the two girls. FInally, she felt her chest throb. She knew it was coming. Staggering back from the mirror, she fell to a sitting position on the bed and threw her head back, arms propping up her body as her breasts surged outward. Rebekah Emily's C-cup bust was enormous enough, but now Teneille's thirsty knockers were being injected magically in to add as well.<br>\r\nWith each shiver of orgasmic pleasure, she felt her boobs fill and swill. Burgeouning up and out, her athletic frame lifted and propped them up toward the ceiling. She moaned in joy as they bounced shamelessly, jiggling with each shudder of her mincing hips. Her bra, her tank-top, her t-shirts, nothing was going to contain her savage bosom. <br>\r\nShe shakily stood up, her sweaty warm body flushed with orgasmic power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img002.lazygirls.info/people/pandora_peaks/pandora_peaks_pandora_11_OWn28aX.sized.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img002.lazygirls.info/people/pand...</a></span></div></div>",

Standing up, she was awash with a sense of physical power. Her muscles were more toned, developed. Her face was similar, but tan instead of freckled like Scott, dark-lashed and more angular.

This... muscular, slender creature before her was both Emily and Scott, and also something else.<br>\r\nSomething she felt her self wanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for her leg, Rebekah leaned in to look closely at Emily's new face.

You're just glad that you didnt arrive late. If so, your father would feel a bit of shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turned the engine off. Keeping the interior light on, you looked at your reflection in the rear view mirror. Humming, you checked yourself before getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, it's cold.\" The wind blew. You could feel a small drop of water landing on your legs. \"And it's about to rain. Great.\" Annoyed that the dress will be ruined, you took out a small polkadot umbrella. Opening it, you put it over your head. Standing up, you closed the door behind. It slammed shut before you locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No rain will mess my evening up,\" you said. Just then, you realized that you were acting like your mom. \"I <i>am</i> becoming mom.\"  You put your hand on your mouth. \"Okay, I think it's time to separate ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You reentered the car. Sitting in the driver's seat, you left your legs out. You looked at the necklace and thought about separation. Nothing happened, until you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt like you are being pushed for behind. You looked down to see your arms moving out of her own. Leaning forward, your head and torso came out of her. Your legs were the last ones. You walked forward a bit. You and your mom were no longer merged together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Doesn't feel like I merge with her. More like possess her.\" Your mom was dozing off before waking up. You noticed this. Thinking fast, you hid behind the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my goodness,\" said Nicole. \"I should be careful taking those migraine pills.\" Nicole let out a yawn and stretched herself. Her breasts were snagged underneath her tight dress. \"Don't worry honey, I'll be over there soon.\" Nicole got up. She took her purse and umbrella and left. She was unaware on what happened earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Now what?</i> You came out of your hiding place. Your hands were covered in soot from the car. Dusting it off, you sighed. <i>I wanted to go in there too, but I was acting like mom for a bit.</i> Crossing your, you started to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I'll just merge with someone else. Easy. </i> You looked around for someone. No one else was arriving, until you see a green compact car pulling in. The driver that came out was a Caucasian female in her 20s. She was wearing a white top that showed her midriff and matching white skirt. Around her neck, was a silver beaded necklace that forms a triangle shape. Interested, you were checking her out. She looked rather hot to you with her long blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No time for that Scott, you need to merge with her. Oh crud.\" As a typical teenaged male, your lower neighbor became stiff. Ignoring it, you snuck in between several cars. She was about to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Weaving in and out, you were several feet away from her. Downwind, you can smell the car freshener from her vehicle. It was cinnamon. You can hear her closing her conversation on her cell phone. She turned her back towards you, to remove the key from the ignition switch. You took this chance to merge with her.</span></div></div>",

Latching onto her like a baby, she flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She never uttered a sound. Fearing for her life, she tried to remain calm. You were surprised. The last time you used the necklace, your mom became motionless and unresponsive. You figured that since you want to merge with this woman completely, it didn't apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Make this quick. I don't want her to feel scared,</i> you thought. <i>I should've introduced myself. What was I thinking?</i> Unable to move away, the necklace forced you and her to,  <i>move</i> into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like two droplets of paint, colors bled and swirled. The crosses from your own white shirt, migrated to hers. Your black shorts colored in her skirt. Sliding her arms onto yours, you see her skin turn from fair to a slight darker tone. However, you shifted your eyes to the most obvious sight. Her breasts. They moved as they grew only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Oh damn it.</i> Unable to control it, you became aroused as your underwear felt tighter. Suddenly, your underwear became softer. Your erect member was twitching against her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman gasped. She can feel it twitch, sending her mixed feelings of pleasure and disgust before it relaxed and receded. She grunted and sighed. She feels her legs absorbing and being absorbed by yours. Finally, your heads started to merge. She closed her eyes. This unusual experience of fear and slight pleasure played with her emotions. Her hair darkened, making her look like a brunette. The final physical form, showed off an attractive female whose age was around 18. Afterwards, the necklace merged the most important parts; your minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jude, the woman that you are merging with was met with your memories and vice versa. Your tastes in music, favorite hobbies, names of your friends, all were blended together. Your personality started to change too. However, your identity as Scott remained intact. Instead, you identified yourself as two people. The necklace merged itself with hers, overtaking its shape. With the merger done, you opened your eyes and leaned on the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa dude,\" you said. Astonished, you took out your phone--Judy's phone--from your purse. With the camera app flipped to the front, you took your time to look at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/xnTv24ul.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/xnTv24ul.jpg</a></div></span></div></div>",

As Scott, you were curious, imaginative, and impulsive. As Jude, you were successful, outgoing, and logical. As you inquired about yourself, your eyes drifted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your modest chest swayed as you shook. You rubbed your midriff. It is flat and trimmed. You have slender arms and strong legs. Overall, your skin was smooth to the touch, like a baby's bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn, we look good. \"Oh my gosh, my voice.\" You placed your fingers against your mouth.

You had your reasons that were for and against using it again. What would happen if you merged with a third person? Does the necklace only apply to humans? You shook your head. It made sense not to use it again for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, this is enough for now. Let's just go to the event.\" Finishing your grooming, you packed up. Closing the door, you locked it and left the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You smiled at several people as they walked past you. The valets were hard at work. As you walked into the building, you were greeted by decor. Paintings, wooden sculptures, etc. They greeted you with a feeling of being in a museum. Navigating, you stumbled what looked like the event. It was across the hallway with open spaces filled in by tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I can smell the food already.</i> Several lit candles are present. The flames danced from the gentle movements in the air. Just then, you stopped. In front of you was your mother Nicole. Luckily, she was already inside the ballroom. She was standing in line for the buffet table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Mom, don't scare me like that.</i> Taking a deep breath, you walked right in. <i>Where's dad though?</i> Looking around, you saw your father's familiar short hair from a table. He was already enjoying his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Dad's always hungry. Unlike my other dad.</i> You felt silly thinking about that. It was true. You have two families. One from Scott, the other from Jude. You frowned a bit. You never had any siblings as Jude until now. You chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>This necklace is like a blessing to me. Glad to have found it.</i> You looked at the green gem. You felt tempted to use it again but, denied it. Right now, it is best to enjoy what this event is offering. However, someone tapped your shoulder. You turned around to see your friend, Jude's friend Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, you made it,\" she said. \"Our table's there. You want anything?\" You didnt realize it until now. Amber sees you as Jude due to your clothes. Come to think of it, you looked more like her instead of Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I ain't complaining. I would rather look like this instead.</i> \"Sure, just get me the usual.\" With a nod, Amber followed the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I forgot how good she looked.</i> Much like yourself as Jude, Amber sported an attractive build. <i>Such a cheerleader too.</i> You smirked, knowing it to be true. You took your seat as you brought out your phone. You looked through the photos of yourself as Jude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Just when I thought I couldn't look better. This necklace is awesome.</i> You browsed through them. One was taken at a park. The other, was at a beach. <i>Can I even fit into that as I am right now? And what about my clothes as Scott?</i> As some more questions arise, Amber came back with your plate. It had a green salad, macaroni salad, grilled lemon chicken, and prime rib with an jus. Right next to it, a single scoop of white rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\" you said. \"So, where's everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just us. I chose a small table for two.\" The crunch from her salad kept her from talking as much. She paused after she swallowed. \"That way we can just be with each other until we go home.\" Giving you smile, you kept eyeing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Damn it. I don't want to merge with her but, I can't help it. I just need to know what will happen.</i> You sipped some water. Along with the sudden need to use the necklace, you also felt attracted to Amber. This was because as Scott, you never had a girlfriend before. However, it was unusual to be falling for your friend. You reached for your crotch. Making a grabbing motion, you stopped and placed your hand on your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Damn it, I'm not a boy right now. You pervert.</i> You made a visible face of frustration. This alerted Amber, causing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is the food okay? I got what you always wanted.\" Amber placed her hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, it's fine. I'm just thinking about this one guy.\" <i>Who I used to be.</i> You smiled. \"I'll be going to the restroom. Get us some dessert before I come back okay?\" With another nod of confirmation, you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my God,\" you said. Your voice echoed in the restroom. \"Dude, you were about to hit on your best friend from your Jude side.\" You sighed, knowing why. \"I guess that's the price I pay for using this thing.\" You tapped the necklace, making a dull sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, think of it this way. Scott might get two girlfriends. Hmph.\" You smirked, almost feeling a bit naughty. \"Oh my God, that is so wrong.\" With another sigh, you started to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you are right now, you're two people merged together. So far, it felt like a ride. Like riding a slow roller-coaster before it gained speed. Again, you felt attracted to her but kept your emotions at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn it, I want stay like this until it's over too.\" You took the necklace off and placed it down. \"I just have to deal with it. Be a good girl and deal with it.\" Turning around, you went into a stall to relieve yourself.</span></div></div>",

Let's find the owner. Together.\" said the first girl. Unbeknownst to her, the necklace reacted. They posed for a group photo as you got out from behind. The three were surprised, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As before, you grabbed onto the girl. It was an accident. Your boot lace was loose and you stepped on it. You fell on top of her. Her friends fell too, as she had her arms around their shoulders. Confusion, anger, and begs of forgiveness distracted all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the floor, the amount of bodies rose your internal body temperature. The fruitful fragrance of the girl's chewing gum went into your nose. The necklace proceeded to merge you with the girls. It wanted unification in order to stop the bickering that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell?\" You felt yourself pushing into the girl. \"No, stop it!\" The other two by your sides, found themselves sliding into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All four of you were helpless. The necklace was just doing its job. The girl wearing it felt the most uncomfortable. She feels her body tingle as her breasts pushed outward. Clothes came right off, leaving only just the undergarments. After what felt like an eternal amount of time, your bodies melded and blended together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my gosh,\" the girl underneath you moaned. \"Make it, stop.

It turned gold, as the gem split into multiple rubies. Two of them were hung by small short gold chains. Gold bracelets were worn on the left wrist. A single ring was on the right index finger. Golden blonde hair was tied in a bun of sorts. A decorative hair piece covered the right side. A maroon colored bra with matching panties covered the most private areas. Black stockings laced at the thighs. A pair of black slippers covered the feet. They shined under the light. Finally, <i>you</i> woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stood on your feet. You groaned as you stretched your neck. You looked in the mirror.

These types of qualities from the girls made you feel alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elisa stood out the most. As a senior and class president, she felt in control. She can be intimidating at times, but is quite polite. She is dedicated and hard working. Anne, a freshman, is her little sister. Considered to be the cutest girl in their school, she likes to dress up. She exhibited a nice attitude. She loves her sister very much. Alma, a junior of their school, was quite boyish. She and Elisa competed against each other in opposing teams during volleyball. When her family moved, she switched schools. Their rivalry became harsh, until Anne stepped in. They became best of friends after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now <i>this</i> is more like it,\" you said. \"I can finally enjoy the night.\" You picked up your clothes. \"What should I wear though?

You see your car flash its lights as the audible sound played once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There it is.\" You unlocked the car. \"I hope my parents didn't leave yet.

Both your heads were stuck to each other. Amber's screams vibrated into you. You could taste what she drank, what she ate, and vice versa. Amber continued to struggle. The constant moving made you sweat from the heat. Soon, her mind was being joined with yours, adding another piece to a seemingly never-ending puzzle. The whole moment, played, ended as fast as it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, I should be heading home now.\" said Nicole. \"It's getting late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now?

She relaxes, as she enjoys the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nicole sees a young woman walking past the table. She took her eyes off her cellphone. She greets her with a smile before she left. Nicole did the same. <i>That dress would never fit me.</i> Nicole sipped some water. She is unaware of the identity of the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was now 9:14pm. A few people were leaving the party early. Nicole would've been one of them if it weren't for the requests of her husband. The young woman flaunted out of Nicole's view. A few young men took notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Can this night be any better?</i> Merging with Amber, you've obtain a brilliant tan. Your face stayed the same, while your hair became longer. Amber's bronze like dress felt tighter on you, especially on your chest. Your overall physique screamed young and strong. On a mental note, Amber wasn't too different from Jude. She can be protective, sensitive, and strict, but is usually high-spirited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/se5WGDU.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/se5WGDU.jpg</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>At least I'm not an average Joe anymore.

She is still visible at the door. <i>Dude, I hope I didn't get into trouble. No. She believes me. I told her that I'm with friends.</i> Sure of yourself, you drank your fruit punch in one go. \"Tangy. Huh?\" Your phone vibrated in your hand. It was Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Crap.

Elisa's bossy attitude was affecting the way you act. You shook it off. You needed to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Emmy, don't worry. The movie I'm watching is like, 3 hours long' you texted. 'just chill for awhile. I'm fine :)'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'\u00f0\u0178\u2018\u0152 then. Just stay safe.' Emily sent her last reply. You sighed. Nodding your head, you saw your mom once again. She bend down and spoke to your dad. He gave her kiss on the cheek before she left again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Great, the fun just ended.\" You sighed. You didn't want to leave. <i>I would so merge with you right now, but I shouldn't. This is so irritating.</i> Drinking another cup, you see a man staring at you. Being polite, you smiled and left. When he wasn't looking, you made a face of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The night was cold. A slight drizzle of rain hits the dark tarred ground. The parking lot is less crowded now. Several people have left for home. Lying in the backseat of Jude's car, no one was around. It was time to separate yourself, at least back into a fusion of five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm gonna miss being the current me,\" you said. \"I never thought of a name either. Humph, whatever.\" With a smile, you activated the necklace. Just like that, a part of you was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amber felt herself being pushed out. Holding onto her, was the woman that she saw prior to this. Her dress migrated to her. She feels relieved that she can be herself again. After a brief moment of close proximity, you put on your original fused clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\" said Amber. \"I enjoyed it. It was kinda fun, even though it was only for a short time. For me at least.\" Amber blushed. \"I would've love to have been a party girl again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You will always be one in my eyes.\" You hugged her. \"If you ever want to, we can use this again. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amber looked at the necklace. It was a powerful object. It blurred the lines between individuals. Even though it was scary, she came to the conclusion that it can be a good thing. Still, she had her doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Deal, but be careful next time,\" Amber warned. \"This place was filled with people.

Jeez, you sound like Scott's mom.\" You pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But it's true right?\" said Amber. \"Anyway, time for you to go. Nicole will be home soon.\" Amber gathered her belongings. \"Bye fusion girl. Bring Jude back for me.\"</span></div></div>",

It was getting late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh well, at least it was a fun night.\" You said. You opened the door and sat in the driver's seat.

Just 20 minutes away from the hotel, was their house. Parking to the side, you relaxed and closed your eyes. You imagined yourself walking through the halls of Marble Hills High School. Everyone was admiring you. Your appearance and popularity was at an all time high. You smiled, before opening your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No, you knew this was wrong. You cannot exist like this. You need to go back to normal. Taking out Elisa's phone, you took a photo of yourself. This shouldn't be just a memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, I'm ready necklace.\" The necklace glowed. You begin to moan as your body felt hot. Soon, a pleasant and sexual feeling took over. But, the separation was fast. Anne's naked body was splitting away. She was sitting on your lap face to face. She was panting and perspiring. She opened her eyes to quite a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Elisa?!\" she blurted. \"Are, are you okay?\" Anne was worried that her sister was stuck like this. As you regained consciousness, you looked at her. Her bare skin was completely vulnerable. But, it's okay right? This is normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anne, go get dressed,\" you said with pants in between. \"Elisa's next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't took long before Elisa was herself again.

What was that?\" You turned to face her from inside the car. Right now, your new body and mind was just three people. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://m.imgur.com/cB7ApFy\" target=\"_blank\">https://m.imgur.com/cB7ApFy</a>) Elisa could only stare, wishing she could merge with you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Never mind...\" Elisa blushed. \"Just get to Alma's house now. Her parents will get worried.\" With a simple gesture of farewell, you drove off. Anne looked at her sister walking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alma groaned. While the decision was made, she showed the most disapproval. She was very accepting of the merger. Perhaps she and Scott were getting to know each other too much? And what about the others? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You promise that we can do this again for tomorrow?\" she asked with glee. Alma leaned over the passenger side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry, Scott never breaks a promise,\" you said. You reached over and caressed Alma's cheek. She shuddered, keeping your hand close. \"Aw, you two are meant for each other.\" Both of you giggled. \"I'll see you tomorrow. Take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you drove off, you can't help but feel a little turned on. The necklace seems to play with the emotions and bodily reactions of the people it affects. However, it was quick and fast. Upon reaching Scott's house, you relaxed once again. Soon, your sense of self returned to Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You groaned. Looking straight in front of you was Jude. She smiled and hugged you. All you could do was hug her back. However, your penis begin to grow hard at the sight of a woman sitting on top of you. At least she was clothed this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh crap. I'm so sorry,\" said Jude. \"My bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, no, no. It's fine. This is normal,\" you replied as you held her. \"I'm the one who should be sorry. I just, wanted to experiment with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. It worked out just fine, right?\" Jude smiled. While the first merging between the both of you was shocking, she understood why you had to do it. \"But, be careful next time. Remember what Amber said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" Jude got off of you and allowed you out of her car. She sat back down and started the engine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, don't feel like that. Anyway, I should be going. I'll see you tomorrow?\" Jude waved at you to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I promise.\" You waved back at her as she left. Deep down, you wished the other girls were still merged with her. Did the necklace recognize a desire of yours? Whatever that may be, you need wait until tomorrow. </span></div></div>",

The girls must want to merge really bad, coming to find you this early. Your first instinct was to hide the necklace, but think again, Emily never knew about the necklace and its power. Perhaps she would like it, just like the other girls you\u2019ve merged with\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that way, you decided to tell Emily about the necklace. You opened the door and introduced her to the girls. You ambiguously explained to her that you knew the girls from last night\u2019s event, then proceeded to tell her about the necklace. However, Emily doesn\u2019t seem to believe the necklace\u2019s strange power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, a necklace that bestows the power to merge upon its wearer? I could think of a more fancy tale\u2026 Is that what you girls came here for, incidentally?\u201d Emily inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you have doubts, just look at this lady here.\u201d Jude points at the fusion of Anne, Elisa, and Amber. \u201cA minute ago they were three separate people, but the necklace merged them into one.\u201d Jude pauses and eyes Emily up. \u201cHmm, I knew Scott has sisters, but I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re actually this cute. If you don\u2019t believe in the necklace\u2019s capabilities, why don\u2019t you try it out itself? Say, merge with me, perhaps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou somehow feel protective about Emily and don\u2019t quite want her to merge with Jude right off. \u201cHey, Jude!\u201d You interrupt. \u201cDon\u2019t get so enthusiastic. Emily never knew about the necklace. Give her some time.\u201d After all, the necklace is too powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScott, no.\u201d Emily stops you. \u201cI\u2019ve decided: I\u2019ll give this necklace a try, just to see if it works. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be harmless, right?\u201d Emily says as she grabs the necklace from you. \u201cYou are Jude, right? How does this w-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily, wait! I want to merge with you too!\u201d The fusion girl interrupts. \u201cUhh, okay, but what\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d Emily looks surprised by the interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer surprise continued as the girl literally melted in front of her eyes. In seconds three separate figures emerged, each with their own clothing on. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed your mind, right?\u201d An embarrassed Anne asks. \u201cWe rushed things a little\u2026 I\u2019m sure we can figure this out once we get to know each other a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to help Emily out. \u201cEnough! Stop arguing over my sister! This is all happening too fast. Em, where is Bek?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, still sleeping, perhaps?\u201d Emily lets out an uneasy smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down and chat a bit before deciding who to merge - assuming this thing works?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d The girls nodded and quickly started a conversation, allowing them to know each other a little more. In the end, who does Emily decide to merge with?</span></div></div>",

Refusing to merge with Anne as Emily made her wanted to compensate Anne somehow, but she really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to explain everything to Rebekah first and ask for her permission. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably take some time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne shook her head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be necessary. If she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleeping, I can just go in and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you know. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn about everything from my memories. How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but interrupt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould that be fair for Rebekah though?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne nods. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen she knows about everything, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you and Jenny thought about the idea, it actually sounded pretty good. Granted, Rebekah might feel a bit of shock, but it saves the time to explain everything. She felt she had no reason to reject it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Yeah. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not against it. Go ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jenny took off the necklace and handed it to Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne turned to look at you; you just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be quick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Anne took the necklace and ran off towards Rebekah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a few knocks on the door, then some chattering you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really make out. Next, you heard Rebekah scream; apparently Anne proceeded with the merge. Moans followed, and eventually all was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long before the fusion presented herself. You saw her running out from Rebekah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, her breasts dancing up and down. Fusing Anne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cuteness with Rebekah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bustiness, the result was a killer body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop before you, the fusion steadied herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRebekah would be so happy if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d knew about the necklace earlier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She sighed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAriane.

Part of us aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sisters, but we can at least be friends!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saying that, Ariane reached out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny put down the phones and happily shook the hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re different from our predecessors, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s build new friendships!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the words, Ariane smiled. She proceeded to take off the necklace and reached the hand with it towards Elisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry for taking Anne. You should have the freedom to choose what to do now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa took the necklace and fell silent. She pondered\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

The girls coincidentally evaded him when choosing merge partners, which meant there're three fusions in the house and he still hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merged with anyone today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until now, all the fusions appeared to act like what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combined of their predecessors. Their personalities might deviate into something independent in the future, though, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better for you to use their new names when addressing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be fine for now, I guess.

Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you merge with her when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here, Scott?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a possibility.

Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we go out and say, shop, when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking her time getting here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jenny suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa widened her eyes at the suggestion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great idea!

What do you think, Scott?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ariane looked at you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFine, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay and wait. Be quick, please. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to rot here while you girls have fun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your response, the girls cheered. They left the house quickly, leaving you to wait for Alma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down on sofa and turned the TV on, your phone beeped.

Elisa\u2019s white blouse and Amber\u2019s black shirt were combined into this set of clothes that fit the fusion perfectly.

Pressing yourself against the wall, you took a peek. Both girls were sitting down as they watch the same television. Their backs were facing at you. A mixture of feelings arose. This included desires, wants, and a bit of lust. Your breathing quickened and your heart raced to its limit. Walking carefully, you were within arms reach of them. The necklace became active again, awaiting its orders from its master.</span></div></div>",

Nicole's robe fell away as the older woman merged, mind, body and soul with the vast group of people sharing the bed in a single body already.

But it wasn't just her children, there were other women here, women who flocked to the new sense of motherhood inside of them, of maternal care. Each girl found herself either attracted to it, or wanting it focused on herself, and in short work, all of them were one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new woman sighed happily and leaned back in bed, before sitting up and sliding into Nicole's bunny slippers. \"Well, I'm not going to let good waffles go to waste.\" She said to herself, her voice, thanks to Nicole, Emily and Rebecca, and even to a certain extent Scott, sounding a lot like a familar tone heard around the house. She stood up, and briefly admired her curvaceous new body, more than the girls had ever had, better toned and tighter than Nicole could remember.

Are you even--</i> Before you could finish, each girl took ahold of one of your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, hi?\" you said. The sudden touch of their own arms felt comforting, soft, and smooth. \"How's it going?\" You questioned their actions. Their expressions looked blank. Then, it started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They wrapped their arms around you. Their bodies were pressed closer to yours. It was difficult to breath and speak. Their warmth mitigated this somewhat. They leaned heads towards your shoulders. You can smell a bit of fragrance from the twin to your right. You became relaxed, almost losing yourself to this strange sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So weird,\" you said with slows pants. \"What the fu--\" Without warning, you and the girls were condensed into a thick, almost goo-like material. It didn't bother you at all. The odd relaxing feeling smothered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The goo sprawled out as it turned into a light colored puddle. The necklace floated in it. It began its own transformation. It turned into an anklet as the goo rose up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The goo reformed rather quickly. A body of a female with long slender legs and a sizable pair of breaststroke formed. Soon, the shape of clothing was molded from the mass. A grayish wool tank top fitted around the torso. A checkered miniskirt graced itself on hairless thighs. A pair of fashionable high heels made the legs appear even longer. The hair was black and short, styled into a bob. Long pedicured nails painted red, tipped the fingertips. The necklace rested around the ankle as the girl blinked with her new brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soft pants were heard. She rubbed her eyes. Soon, memories of her former lives were regained. They bloomed in her head like flowers. She hurried up the stairs and into the building. Her pants became quicker. She wanted to see the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ignoring the music and gossip of guests, she went into the women's restroom. She went in front of a sink.

She pondered whether to use it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I could use it again. But, what will happen to me?</i> Samantha stopped in front of a small couch. She sat on it, releasing trapped air from the cushion. It hissed under her weight. <i>Maybe. I don't know. It's weird.</i> She picked up a pen from a nearby table. She twirled it in her fingers. Crossing her legs, she started to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The night was still young. Samantha was reading a fashion magazine as people walked passed her. She gazed at pictures of female models in bikinis. She chuckled. It was familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Feelings of admiration and attraction mixed in her head like a pot of soup. It bubbled in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Scott, you need girlfriend man. Just ask her out.</i> She played out a little scenario. She imagined you talking to your crush. A cute girl known as Lena. She was good at math and science. She loves to swim and play out her favorite songs on her piano. You loved how her blue dyed twintails dangled beneath her waist. Before her imagination could continue, her eyes wandered toward a familiar face. Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Mom!</i> Slight panic struck her. She wasn't prepared to see her so soon. Luckily, she calmed down. Nicole doesn't recognize her own son turned female sitting in a couch. She walked passed her, going back to the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Right, I'm not Scott anymore.</i> Samantha coughed. Rising up, she walked in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unlike the dinner event, Alicia and Alex were at a sweet sixteen birthday party. They stepped outside looking at the bus schedule before you can along. Their best friend, Joyce, was sitting with four other girls. They chatted as they ate their dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Good, they're still there.</i> Samantha continued to look at them. Several thoughts popped in.

It can't hurt can it?</i> Samantha covered her mouth. No, that's just wrong. But then again\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It was hard to focus. Clearly, you were quite excited about merging with the twins. This feeling shook her to her core. Before she could react, Joyce and the rest of the girls were getting off their seats. Samantha noticed this. She had to do something.</span></div></div>",

She became younger and slimer, with dark brown hair flowing down her back and some around her large chest which jiggles as she shivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally, she's not the same either.

Your body shivers causing your breasts to jiggle a little in your tight dress. Putting a hand to your head, you take a look into the mirror and see that you're merged again. Oddly enough...you can't get a sense of who you are. You feel the memories of your son, Scott filling your head and it brings a small warm smile to your face. At the same time, you feel memories of your mother, Nicole marrying Daniel for the first time and being able to start a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel strange to not feel like either one of them.

You feel a tinge of sadness overwhelming you as you think about unmerging. Shaking your head, you resolve yourself that you shouldn't be messing around. Honestly, if you were to remain merged, how would your sisters feel? How would your husband feel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconsciously, though you could tell, you are being influenced by being a mother and being a son. Who would drive your future decisions depend how strongly willed they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anymore obstacles or stomach problems, you arrive at the dinner event. Some of the passing guests looks at you astonished of your beauty. Some of the males gasp and are reminded of their current wives who stare in jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you feel happy. It's hard to explain it, but there's a sensation that makes you feel content on enjoying this party alone. The thing is...you aren't alone. You feel your mother inside you and you feel your son as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh no...what am I going to do?</i>' she asks herself as she feels a little resistant to the idea of unfusing.

It'll just be a distraction to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but you aren't a distraction, right? It's not their fault. You're an elevated being with a beautiful son and mother together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears start to flow from your eyes as you enter the women's bathroom. Quickly, not wanting to make a scene, you enter one of the stalls and sit on the toilet lid as you contemplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you can't come to a decision over your current conflict. Nicole simply wants to spend the evening with her husband and you would have a hard time convincing him that you are one and the same without explaining to him the powers of the necklace you are wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping your tears away, you are only consolated by the fact that you'd become whole again after the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, you stand up and close your eyes, focusing. You feel yourself drifting away into a permanent sleep and regret fills you for not being a little selfish, but Nicole is such a loving mother and wife; as such, you don't want to betray your husband and father, Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of your shared mind disappears and once again, you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly groan as seconds later, you come to. From within your mother's dress, you slowly split out of your mother's body like a newborn baby. From your mother's perspective, she sees her son unraveling from within her dress and feels a roller coaster of emotions as she waited to make sure you were separated from her completely. During the initial merge, she felt trapped but after merging again, submitting to her son's selfish request, the feeling of sharing her son is indescribable. She truly felt like a new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, it is the same and you are honestly shocked how such a merge could be different. It can only be due to sharing the necklace by accident. Either way, you feel a new appreciation towards your mother. Although she can be strict, she truly loves her family and you. With your body disconnecting from your mother's flesh, you slip out from under her red dress and face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shocked to see Nicole tear-struck as she sees you and despite trying to resist, you can't help but slowly cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom,\" you breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Scott,\" she gasps and you both hug each other. Even though you are naked, it doesn't bother you as you wrap your arms tightly around her and she does the same. She kisses you on the forehead and reluctantly pulls away, wiping the tears from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott...I don't know what that was, but...I don't think I've experienced such happiness since I gave birth to you. I...I know I said we shouldn't do this anymore, but...perhaps this will be okay. I love you, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel embarrassed to be in such close proximity to your mother, but you rest your head on her chest and hum. Despite aging a little and her chest reducing, you've always known your mother to be quite beautiful. Perhaps subconsciously, that's why you picked her to fuse with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Nicole is wearing the necklace. Even though she is tempted to keep it, that would mean leaving Scott in the stall. She had her reservations about using the necklace, but now, she feels it is a blessing. Taking it off and giving it to her son, she feels a slight tinge of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to merge with someone, right? Please be considerate, okay?\" she warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're honestly surprised she's no longer against it anymore. \"I thought you were against it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am. Truthfully, I don't want you to merge with anyone else, but since you're naked, it can't be helped. Until the event is over, don't do anything crazy, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't promise that as you had plenty of experiments, but you keep an innocent smile and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nicole gives you a kiss on the cheek and leaves the stall. You feel saddened to see her go, but internally slap yourself seeing how you have a bigger problem. Since you're stuck in the stall naked, you'll have to be quick and merge with someone so that you're not stranded naked. Obviously, it'll have to be a woman since you're in the woman's stall.</span></div></div>",

You and her felt <i>everything</i> together and it was both blissful and somehow, a little wrong. Yet before you could dwell on the consequence of your actions so far, you flinch when you hear the door open and then, a wail from a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's okay...mommy's here,\" a woman's voice sounded. It was warm and smooth, obviously, a mother who was trying to attend to the baby. Biting your lips, you thought how unfair this was. Just when you were thinking about your own mother, now you have an opportunity to get out of here, but to do so, you'd have to hijack a mother, with a baby no less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was either that or wait again for someone else to come. Thinking of your options, you decide to open your stall door a little and peek out to see who this woman was first before you made any judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the bathroom, next to the sinks is a woman of Latino origin and she appeared to be pretty fair compared to most girls and women you know. Wearing a black and tight one-piece dress, you could see her behind completely and she definitely had quite the ass, extending out as she leaned over to change her child's diaper on the sink counter. Moving on less you stare too long, you are thankful that she is in front of a mirror and see that she's a pretty young mother in her thirties with brown hair up to her shoulders with some highlights, lovely olive eyes, a small upturned nose, and an ovular head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she changed her baby's diaper, she had a serene expression, clearly not annoyed that she has to change her child's diaper and seems to be enjoying the evening well. It pains you to even want to consider merging with her. Even if you did, what would you do with the baby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, you don't want to stay in this stall for long. Right now, it's just her and if you wait any longer, soon there would be a flood fo women which made it even riskier to come out.

Hearing the barefoot steps coming towards her, you are fast enough to jump her and quickly pull the necklace over own neck as you flush behind her. Her tight frame and most importantly, her well developed behind flushed against your crotch and you grow ashamed as you grow hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman utters a scream before you quickly clasp your hand over her mouth and let the necklace do its thing. She emits a frantic muffle as you restraint her, your other arm squeezing around her chest to prevent her from struggling. It appeared her chest was quite large too. Was she breastfeeding the baby as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking yourself of such thoughts, you bite your lips as you whisper in her ear. \"Sorry about this, ma'am. I promise I'll take care of the baby until we separate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Latino woman could pull away and scream for help again, she felt an odd sense of comfort taking over her. You start to feel it too and your body loosens, no longer restraining her as both of you closed your eyes as the necklace subdued both you and the mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her dress drops by itself thanks to the magic of the necklace along with the rest of her articles. You utter a pleasant moan as you feel yourself drawing into her body from her back, your quivering cock flushing neatly into her crack. Of course, you aren't given time to enjoy the sensation as you are pulled so fast into her back that you lose any sense of arousal once your crotch merges with her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your own behind evolving much to your embarrassment as you are pulled into the mother. Meanwhile, as this slow transformation of occurring, the baby starts to giggle, clearly liking what he's seeing and a new emotion starts flooding you. This baby...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...this is your precious son, Chris. He's currently three months old and he's your first child. Perhaps...he'll be your only child though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs new memories and emotions arrive, you feel at ease, remembering the time at the hospital when you first gave birth to this healthy baby and held him in your arms. At your side was just your family and the supposed father which you don't want to see anytime soon decided to he's not ready becoming a father despite him getting you pregnant. Despite that, you are confident you can raise him alone especially with your now ex-boyfriend paying child support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being a single mother, you figure this would be your only child given you are only able to manage one right now. With your ex-boyfriend gone, it will be a while before you decide to find another man who is willing to support you and your son. Until then, you are happy to gain the support of your own family who has the financial support to make your life easier but you didn't want to depend on them forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually are a receptionist that's a part of the company that's hosting this event. The benefits are great for you and your child which is why you've been working here, even if the pay isn't that great, but since you are studying at your own pace to become a technical writer, you feel you'll be able to move on to better opportunities soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath as you sift through all these memories, you open your eyes and before you stare at yourself to see what kind of person you look, Chris is looking at you so happy and you can't help but smile warmly, drawing close and rubbing his soft forehead with your nose causing him to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, baby. Mommy's here now. Good thing you are already changed, huh?\" you coo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw away the dirty diaper into a trash can nearby and pick up your baby by your arm. Then, you freeze when you remember that you're naked. Looking around, you quickly put the baby back down on the counter and move to put back on the dress and rest of your undergarments that fell when you merged. Getting quickly covered up, you realize how even tighter the dress is and you blush in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dared not to look in the mirror yet and pulled Chris close to your chest. Her utters a happy squeal as he is snuggled against your chest. This only makes you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, I can't breastfeed you yet. There are some important things I have to take care of first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris utters another happy goo and you are aware how he may not understand what you are saying. It just gives you comfort to talk to him and see him so content. You are at least aware that your form isn't hideous, otherwise, you are certain your baby would be crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking finally into the mirror, you widen your eyes. <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a3/be/4f/a3be4fad6526ed3ab049be092cd1df84--exotic-women-latina.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a3/be/4f/a3be4fad6526ed3ab049be092cd1df84--exotic-women-latina.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it seems you've grown younger now which is always a good thing. In fact, since merging with Scott, you'd expect to grow younger.

Yet, you understand that Scott was in a bind though and don't feel any disgust at all, oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring closely at yourself in the mirror, turning your head slightly, you lean away and then shrug, focusing your attention on your little boy. You smile warmly at him as he stares around the bathroom, aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, while I'm here, we may as well meet your second mother, Nicole. Funnily enough, she's my mother too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you laugh trying to incite further happiness in your son, you start to quiet down realizing that someone could hear you and start thinking that you're crazy. Hell, you're already crazy considering how strange your memories seem to blend. You are now a mother, but you consider yourself and Chris to have another mother, Nicole...who should technically be Nicole's grandmother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Ah...let's not think about that for now,</i>' you can't help but chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

Others around you are unable to help stare, wondering who is this beautiful mother, strolling leisurely to the banquet area where Nicole was standing. Your mother was chatting with some of her husband's colleagues and it didn't appear that your father, Daniel had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping her on the shoulder, Nicole turns around wondering who is trying to gain her attention and she sees you, a little dazzled by your complexion and even more surprised to see a baby in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, wanting to surprise your mother for a little, so you make up a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, I don't believe we met. I'm a colleague of your husband, Daniel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending your free hand, Nicole swallows her surprise and smiles towards you, shaking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes I am, but my husband hasn't arrived yet I'm afraid...and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming, you grin, already having a name for yourself. \"My name is Erica. I suppose you could say I'm your new daughter and you are now a grandmother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping that bombshell, Nicole widens her eyes. \"Scott?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly covering her mouth with her hands, she looked around to see if anyone heard her, but luckily those she was talking to have already moved on elsewhere. She breathes a sighnof relief and then frowns at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear god, that is not funny, Scott! I was actually worried about you. Who...did you merge with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lowers to the baby in your arms, looking around and quite impressively fearless around so many strangers. It appears he doesn't mind the crowd and loud environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou provide a apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that mom. I'm Scott alright, but I'm also not. You can understand right? Scott made the decision to merge with Gina, the receptionist. As a result, I'm a mother now and you're a grandmother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Nicole did understand what you were saying after merging with Scott more equally. Still, she never expected her son to merge with a mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then Erica, is it? Just remember this is temporary. Just...oh god, is Gina going to remember this?\" she suddenly worried knowing how she remembered merging with Scott the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your mother's worries, you bite your lips as the baby giggled uncontrollably. He sure seems like he'll grow up to be a positive person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...well, she...\" you begin hesitating, \"...I guess I'm basically speaking for her by saying yes, but don't worry! She doesn't blame your son! I'll just stay out of the way until you are ready to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your reassurances, Nicole breathes a sigh of relief. \"I'm glad then. Truthfully, I didn't expect you...I mean, my son to do a mental merge as well...or maybe that's not how it works...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, focusing on your precious baby as you sway him. \"There's still a lot to learn, but either way, I'm glad Scott didn't overtake Gina. You should know, it's not right and furthermore, he wouldn't be able to handle the baby with just his knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole hums, then smiles. \"That's true. I guess this will be a good lesson for him to understand the hardships of being a mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, turning your attention back to your mother, \"Maybe...I think you are underestimating him and by extension, me. He already gained some motherly insight from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole raises her eyebrows, then relaxes and chuckles herself. \"Oh boy, this is so strange to suddenly share knowledge and experience. Anyways, take care of your baby then. He seems not at all fazed that he has a different mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? My baby is very strange and so bubbly too! Maybe he instinctively knows I'm still his mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pats your shoulder as you question. \"I need to make a call to your father, okay? Just enjoy yourself and I'll let you know when it's time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum and then watch as your mother disappears within the many guests that have come.

Allow me to welcome you though.

I can't say I've seen you around either at the company. Although it's pretty large, so I guess that's to be expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small giggle, finding it amusing that he's trying so hard to find equal footing so he can continue making talking with you. He seems like a really nice guy, but it's a shame that as you are now, you really don't work for the company that's hosting this event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the baby to your side, he leans over and greets the baby. \"Hey there, little guy. You seem pretty happy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris laughs as usual and in some part of your twisted mind, you want to imagine the baby is laughing at his poor attempts to connect with you.

There's not a lot of juniors and people our age working at the company it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on your looks, you assumed you could easily pass at least in your mid-twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenolds gives a slight smile, trying to seem casual, but inside he was in disbelief he got to talk to such a beauty. As for yourself, leading him to somewhere private, you wondered how you should approach giving your baby an upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

That may not be possible, but you want to at least try to see if the baby can take over the new merged form. As bad as it seems, Renolds was just a host for your precious baby boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to an empty room, Renolds was getting nervous, now realizing that you were leading him to an isolated area. Many things were popping into his head. Should he be scared or excited? Is he going to lose his virginity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, much to his disappointment, he wouldn't remember much to even question. He should actually be scared if things went to your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Renolds fidgets near the door, you ignore him for a few seconds and hold your baby in your hands up high. He giggles uncontrollably and his laughter was so infectious that even you couldn't help but giggle yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, baby...my precious baby,\" you whisper, then putting him down on a table, you unhook the necklace around your neck and settle it on Chris' small neck. Much to your amazement, the necklace actually shrunk so that it didn't fall off its host's body. If Renolds saw, he would probably freak out but luckily, he could only see your back, hiding the bundle of joy that's in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up Chris again, you then turn around and focus your attention towards the man behind you. Smiling as if nothing is wrong, you hold the baby at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you hold him, please? I've got to do something first,\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenolds was confused, wondering why the heck he was brought here. Were they really here just for a private chat...or something more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was something more...just not the way Renolds would see it. As soon as he took the baby into his hands, the necklace shined brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you knew, the necklace responded to will so either the baby legitimately wanted to try merging with someone after gaining the necklace or it responded to your will since you were the mother of the child. Either way, Renolds' mouth slowly opened as the baby's body started to float closer to his chest. No matter how he tried to push it away, the baby was now pushing him against the door frame as he tried his hardest to let go of the baby or keep his arms as stretched as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, it was futile as the baby laughed, unknowing of what was going on. It seemed this was the power of the necklace, pushing the baby in Renold's hands, closer to his main body.  His arms grew weaker, unable to withstand the force of whatever was pushing the baby towards him. Finally, he screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is this?! H-help! H-help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare, a little shocked at what was going on, you couldn't stop watching as the necklace was doing its magic, supporting the fusion with insane power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby's back finally touched Renold's chest and then started to submerge into him, even though his dress suit. He gives out a frantic scream and his body convulsed as the baby is pushed deeper into the center of his body. His hands were allowed by the necklace to finally let go of the baby as the fusion is already in progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his arms going limb, you start to see an interesting change occurring in Renold. Obviously, the baby had little mass compared the man in front of you, yet that doesn't stop the baby from changing the man's feature and overall form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body starts to grow younger, his suit slowly becoming looser on him. His hair grows darker and his face morphs into a more oval shape as it becomes younger. Any facial features fall off him as his body quivers, losing more and more of his maturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, his body stops convulsing and he fumbles onto the carpet. You gasp, coming to his side and rolling him over to take a good look at how much Chris has changed. You find that he is naturally younger than before, seemingly to be at least...</span></div></div>",

To lose that experience made the teenage boy devastated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'll unmerge!\" Chris quickly exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold yourself from laughing, seeing how Chris is taking your word so seriously. Regardless, it did the job and closing his eyes, Chris lets himself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the chest area of Renold's loose suit, a bulge started to appear and the body of Renold starts to progress back to his 20s, growing taller and fitting into the suit. Realizing that your baby could suffocate since it seems he couldn't come out of the clothes, you quickly move to unbutton the collared shirt underneath Renold's coat. Chris easily slips out and then starts to wail, as if coming out of a mother's womb for the first time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or it could be that he still retains the knowledge gained with Renolds. In that case, he would of course cry for losing the ability to control his body more. Yet hopefully, if that were the case, he'll grow up to be incredibly smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Ah, I'm thinking about it too much...</i>' you realize.

Still, it's too late to regret having already merged the baby with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving back into the women's restroom with Nicole, your mother smartly locks the bathroom to prevent any unwanted attention. Taking a deep breath, she furrows her eyebrows at you, obviously deeply disappointed that you tried to mess with the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have a long talk after this...and I'm specifically referring to Scott,\" she warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch. Regardless of whether it's you or Scott, you felt anxious, yet you understand completely that you shouldn't even try to mess with the necklace anymore after becoming yourself, especially with your own baby! You are ashamed to give into the curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...\" you turn to stare at your baby whose wail has turned into a soft whimper. He stares back at you, longingly and you feel your heart wrench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay baby. Mommy has to go now, but don't worry, Gina will be here for you, okay? I truly hope you are able to grow up as great as I saw earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives out a small utterance of noise that you aren't able to make out. Curling your lips, you continue to rock him gently in your arms, just wanting to spend a little more time with your baby. Hearing the foot taps of your mother as she crosses her arms, it's clear she wants to leave quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing baby. Can you still understand me now? Just...nod if you can, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stares at you, sniffling, and to Nicole and your amazement, you see his nod his small head twice. This gives you great joy because it meant that your baby has retained some cognitive awareness. He would surely be able to grow up and succeed in life easier thanks to the necklace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby. Then, if you understand, please don't give me...I mean, Gina too much trouble okay? Learn to control your bowels, first of all...or maybe that's impossible with how you are now...oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole clears her throat and then you sigh, realizing that you are only delaying the inevitable. Turning back to your mother, you sadly leave him in Nicole's hands and back away. A tear drops from your eyes because you don't know if you'll ever see your baby again in this form. You can only hope as Chris' second mother, you'll be able to see him again and care for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris doesn't start to cry again as he watches, sniffling a little, but otherwise, he watches intently, probably knowing that you were going to unmerge. You thought it was strange he wasn't crying. Maybe he's hopeful that he will see you again. It's not just him, you want to see yourself again...feel your own comforting sense of existence. It was strange, but unlike the fusion of Scott and Nicole who had many opportunities to merge, it couldn't be said the same for Scott and Gina who are complete strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No, that's not right. They couldn't be strangers after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you hesitate, wondering if maybe you should merge with Nicole and make a run for it. It sounds awful towards your mother, but you are only thinking of what would make Chris happier, He'd have the perfect mommy and with Nicole, you are certain you'd have even better knowledge of how to take care of Chris. Being a first-time mother has been incredibly stressful, so any experience gained would be a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Honestly, you can only hope for the best but you know that forcefully merging with your own mother is not a great solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you close your eyes and let go. As simple as relaxing and intending to unmerge, the necklace hears you and before you know it, your sense of self divides into two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as Scott, you gasp as you are expelled from her front body, immediately trapped underneath Gina's dress which is rather tight while your head is nuzzles in between her large chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Gina gasp and quickly try to wiggle your way out of her dress. Letting yourself fall, you find a way to slide from her dress down to the ground and then shuffle out. You are once again naked, much to your embarrassment and furthermore, the process of unmerging from someone like Gina proved to arouse you a little as your member stiffened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you hide your crotch as now Nicole and GIna stare at you with different expressions. Nicole's expression was relieved but Gina was saddened. Gulping and ignoring your physical state, you lower your head towards Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie, you don't have to apologize. I understand your circumstances already. You've given me such a beautiful gift for my son. I was so worried that I was raising him improperly but to hear him for the first time and telling me whether I'm doing good or not...I...I can't thank you enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nicole can't help but smile warmly. Actually, you felt incredibly guilty for using the necklace on the baby. With such limited knowledge, the last thing is to try such dangerous magic on a newborn. Everything worked out fine, but still, you aren't able to help but feel stupid because you felt it was your influence that caused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't take credit for this. It was so dumb on my part to put your baby at risk, even if it turned out okay. I'm really sorry,\" you apologized more firmly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole crosses her arms and smile, glad to see that you are owning up to your mistakes. Gina smiles as well, but doesn't push any further. She holds Chris tightly in her arms as she focuses on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Scott, in a way, I feel like you've become my son you know? I know everything about you and you know everything about me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to Nicole who is now furrowing her eyebrows, not sure what Gina is going on about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, thank you for your help and tolerance on my son, but he and I must go now. I'd like you to keep the events that happened a secret, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina nods. \"Oh, I understand! I just...would it be okay if I merged with you, Nicole? You have so much experience as a mother and truthfully, with your son's memories in me, I simply adore your child just as I adore Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blinks, a little shocked by Gina's admission and so are you. What she is saying is that she wishes to be your mother as well?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that Gina has the necklace on her which makes you worried. Sure, she is asking politely, but what's to say she can't merge with your mother? Did you even want this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, if you really contemplated it, you found yourself happy if you could gain a little brother like Chris. Being in a house filled with girls is sometimes lonely. Still, this is not your decision, it's your mother's decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she respond?</span></div></div>",

You can trail behind us if you want and we'll discuss it further there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes and gape at your mother. \"W-wait, you're not serious mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina claps her hands in delight. \"Absolutely! Can you tell me your address in case I get lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles and nods. \"Sure, we should exchange contacts too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on!?\" you shout, flailing your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole frowns at your outburst but gently reassures you. \"Sweetie, this is our responsibility. By merging with Gina, she has essentially become family too. I'm also not opposed to learning more about this necklace and I'm certainly not saying we'll be merged all the time. Be a little open though, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your ears and then Gina reassures you. \"Oh Scott, I won't do any harm, trust me! Won't you consider me as your second mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her hopeful smile, you flinch and then blush. \"I...I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe not as a mother, but you do feel a connection to her having become a mother. In a way, you suppose you'll have to find some way to live with it depending on the talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina strolls up and then surprises you with a hug. You can feel her amble chest pressing against you. Let's not forget that you're quite naked but it doesn't appear that Gina minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay. Thank you for giving me the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling awkward, you try your best to cover up your boner. Thankfully, the close contact doesn't last long as Nicole clears her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have an idea. Since my son can't go out as is, why don't you two merge for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina smiles warmly at you. \"I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, finding the young mother to be rather charming...or maybe that's because you merged with her before and got to know her on a level that nobody would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Yeah, that must be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blushes and turns away as she sees Gina and her son morph together while said woman beckons him. It might have been her eyes, but she could have sworn she saw the latino woman stroking her son's member as they merged. Either way, there's no doubt that the second time merging is far more intimate than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to bother with the details or think on what this could mean, she greets Erica who breathes heavily as she comes back into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Erica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica sways and tries to regain her footing. \"O-oh...this is such a strange feeling now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole raises her eyebrows and grows worried. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica raises a hand to stop her mother as she approaches and then shakes her head. \"I'm fine. It's just...as a mother, my future son is now part of me. It feels like a strange cycle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole coughs. \"I think thinking on it will be bad for you. Let's get going okay dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica hums and then grabs her stuff and Chris who has been granted the intelligence to understand what's going on. He reaches out for Nicole in yearning while making incoherent noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! He wants to be held by you it seems! Baby, you're making mommy jealous now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouts but isn't bothered by Chris' curiosity as she hands him over to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the baby, Nicole feels her maternal instincts rising and she coos at the baby. \"Sweetie, I'm not your mother but I might be soon! Don't get attached to strangers, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Nicole is only teasing, the baby shocks both girls as it tries its hardest to speak words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma...ma...both...mama...merge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial shock, Erica is the first to break away and squeal in excitement. \"His first words! He said mama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, on the other hand, remained frozen and seemed to need some gentle nudging by Chris to snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma...ma...go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens at home?</span></div></div>",

Then their waists and arms merge. As their bodies fully fuse into one, two large, soft breasts burst out against her tight dress. Finally, their faces merge into one; one that has characteristics from both Nicole and Gina, yet distinct from either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new woman bows in fatigue from the merge, panting and breathing heavily. Her dress is wet from sweating, which you somehow found strangely arousing. After resting for a while, she strides up to you and hugs you: \u201cScott, my son\u2026 I feel whole again. I will be your new mom.\u201d Despite her words, you only felt strange and uncomfortable. After all, Gina merged with your mom without her consent.

You utter a grunt as you try to pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop! This is wrong, Gina! You can't just take over someone like that... Ungh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's so, sweetie, why are you so erect?

When I was merged with you, I felt closer to you than anyone than I felt in my life! I felt like I knew you so personally and that you would be a great brother to Chris! Can't you say the same thing? While I'm grateful for being able to share a body, I can't ignore what happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression softens and she opens her arms with a hopeful smile on her face. \"Sweetie, let's join our families together.

He could have some remaining memories, in that case, it could explain what happened, and the way he reacted to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris' lips touch your breasts.

How lucky he is, you think, looking at this tiny body pressed against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen did you breastfeed for the last time? Maybe it was with Emily...? You froze, as you notice your thoughts. Nicole's? Scott's? They are still here, apparently. But their minds have merged with yours... Or maybe Gina merged with your earlier, while your son was looking? Or when you tried to take off the necklace from her neck? You are perplexed. <br>\r\nSo, they are now one, merged into you, a busty, redhead mom, breastfeeding her son. Their feelings, their thoughts, are now yours... But who are you? Gina? It seems so. Gina's personality seems to be the dominant one. But you can't avoid the fact that you are now two other persons.<br>\r\nA strange feeling brings you back to reality. You are groping your tit, lactating. Wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did Mommy stop to feed you?

Yes, that's it! Come closer to your new mommy. I can feel Nicole resisting as we speak, but this can be resolved so easily if you accept me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are ashamed, but the longing of becoming a son to this new fusion that you shared a part of grows. Finally entering the arms of the woman, she wraps her arms gently around your back and then guides your head to her breast. She cooes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how she wants you to latch on, you comply and close your eyes.

Oh, how I wish I existed when you were younger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you suckle, it seems Gina is beginning to lose her sense of self as Nicole resists less.

Quickly, you cover your lower half and pull back. \"W-wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina giggles, \"It's alright. Mommy knows you like me a lot. We'll have plenty of catch up to do now that I'm your new mother.

She\u2019s right. The event is still in progress, meaning everyone would see you naked. That\u2019s not mentioning you\u2019re in women\u2019s bathroom right now. There must be a way around this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScott, would you mind merging again?\u201d Gina suddenly asks. \u201cWe could merge you with the next girl who comes in here, that way it would be less embarrassing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking briefly, you realized there is no option but to agree. After all, that\u2019s probably the only way out without causing major chaos. It\u2019s time to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of being cuddled by Gina and waiting, you hear the sound of door opening. You immediately stiffen up, and see Gina\u2019s hands lifting up to grab the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the girl. She had blond hair and fair skin; her demeanor seemed surprisingly cold to you, almost as cold as ice. You wonder what kind of person she is\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there is no time. Gina already activated the necklace. You felt that irresistible power again, your body dragged towards the girl\u2019s. For a moment, she looked so surprised. Then your consciousness fades into a puddle of goo, only to be reformed seconds later into a new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp in your girly voice. This all felt so familiar\u2026yet still unique on its own. You never merged with a girl this similar to your age, and it actually felt great. Kneeling on bathroom floor, you look at your hands. They looked unblemished, pure\u2026<i>perfect</i>. Yes, that\u2019s the word. Looking over your body, a sense of perfection rushed over. Your skin is flawless, almost pristine. Hips and breasts are as large as they should be, carrying just enough fat to complement your curves. Passed on from your former male body, noticeable muscles decorate your arms and legs, giving the much needed athletic touch. Have to admit, you\u2019re utterly shocked by your new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina just stood watching next to you, a smile on her face. \u201cI am really surprised, Scott. I don\u2019t mean the old you is bad, but hell, I honestly didn\u2019t imagine you could be this beautiful! What should I call you now, hm?\u201d Her tone reeks of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your breath, you stand up. You just realized you\u2019re wearing a light blue short dress and white heels. Must be what the girl was wearing. Weird you didn\u2019t notice before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Celestine.</i> Celestine will do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re surprised as you said it. Did you just think it up? The name felt so natural, so fitting, you didn\u2019t give a second thought. Maybe it is better this way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelestine! What a nice name! It suits you perfectly! Well, without further ado, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Gina still have the smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Gina found a small table and you two are sitting next to each other. You\u2019re still feeling a little nervous with this overly-perfect body, but talking with Gina helps a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want to do now, Celestine? Since we\u2019re out of the situation, do you want to <u>unmerge</u>?\u201d Gina purposely lower her tone on \u201cunmerge\u201d, as if hinting at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you aren\u2019t very sure what attitude should you use towards Gina right now. Granted, she\u2019s your mom now, but now she gives you the option to stay as this merged state. Does this mean you\u2019ll become just like her, someone who hijacked others\u2019 body?

Instead, two groans echoed into the night as you split from Ariana. With your manhood returning, it hardens as if returning to the state when Gina was around. That said, the process of unmerging felt good too as you shared some senses with the girl before splitting completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, you were pushed out of Ariana who wobbles, retaining her dress though a bit messy thanks to your escape.

Thanks to you, she knows exactly how everything went down and it plays like a bad horror film in her mind. She needs no explanation as to why she became involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole clears her throat and hands you some clothes. You don't put them on yet as your mind is more preoccupied on what will happen next.

This sort of exchange played similarly with Gina and she ended up force merging with your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nicole widen your eyes. Nicole begins to speak in an upset voice. \"W-what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here,\" she points to Nicole and you, \"...I'm going to give you a choice in return for the trouble you've caused me. Merging wasn't such a bad thing even if it was forced. Nicole, I want to merge with you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This again!?\" Nicole exclaims, exasperated, \"...I'm a middle-aged woman who just wants to keep my family safe. Why would you want to merge with me of all people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel sympathetic to your mother, but at the same time and to your own shame, she's quite a looker for her age. It's one of the reasons you decided to merge with her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, two reasons,\" Ariana speaks clearly and smiles slyly at you, causing you to flinch, \"...I think it's safe to say that your son here wants a refreshed mother. Being merged with him, sharing the feeling of his motherhood experience with Gina, and then nearly letting you go in his conflicted state, I'd say you should give him the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes and Nicole sputters. \"W-what? If this is about my boy, then leave him out of this! Anything that happened is not your concern!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana harrumphs. \"Oh, but its. Second reason, your boy needs some punishment after everything that has happened and what better way than making sure his new mother is stricter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shakes, then nudges you back. She clearly wants you to move to safety but you can't. You start to worry for your own mother now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so what? You're going to forcefully merge with me again just like Gina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana shakes her head. \"No, I've learned enough through memories how badly that turns out. You're going to merge with me Nicole and there will be no resistance this time. If not, then I'll keep the necklace or go public with it, maybe even tell the police about my kidnapping. You guys can try to stop me, but that would mean either merging with me anyways. What will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grits her teeth. Indeed, she thought about snatching it away but even if she did, what then? Would she allow Ariana to go free and risk her family's life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt foolish in believing that Ariana would be kind enough to forget all of this. Given how Gina turned out, it seems the necklace brings out the selfish desire in others to merge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch, conflicted...what happens?</span></div></div>",

After that, you can hardly see them both as they wrestle each other with grunts. You hear Nicole shouting at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, get into the house quickly! I don't know how this will turn out...gah! Stop biting me, you brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about your mother, you shake your head. You move in closer hoping to break them apart but then you hear an odd mixture of grunts and moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to see the ground thanks to the darkness, you turn head quickly into the garage to pull a flashlight. You've thrown your clothes down on the ground in your effort to hurry. At the moment, nothing mattered than your family's state of being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the time to retrieve the flashlight, the struggling between Nicole and Ariana stops. You hear some unsettling rustling and turning on the flashlight near the car, you widen your eyes and let out a horrified scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana and Nicole stand up in a goopy mess, half merged and looking like some freakish ghoul as they slowly reform. They slowly draw to you but the sight proves to be too much for you as you quickly scurry into the house, screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the commotion outside while she was studying, Rebecca arrives and gasps to see her naked brother running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you nake-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your panic, you fail to see your approaching sister. It's too late to stop your momentum and you bump heads with her, knocking yourself out along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes longer than you wished. With a bit of a headache left after bumping into your sister, you rise with the morning sun shining through a window and onto the bed you lie in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and grabbing the left side of your head with your hand, you wince and force your eyes to open. You recognize the room you are in to be your parents' room. Oddly enough, you are the only one in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the covers, you find yourself in the pajamas. You had many questions going on in your mind. First, was it all a dream? Second, why are you sleeping in your parent's room? Third, is Rebecca okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first question is answered as you notice that you're actually not alone. You hear the sink running in the nearby master bathroom and shutting off, you hear some footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opens, your eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c840733/v840733122/708de/Rh3QV8BQeUI.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c840733/v840733122/708de/Rh3QV8BQeUI.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're up? Thank goodness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't recognize the girl and just as you are about to question her and try to avoid staring at her amazing body at the same time, you see the troubling necklace that confirms what she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-mom?\" you address, hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiles sadly. \"Yes, sweetie. It's still me, Nicole...or at least, mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat, deciding to stop staring. Nicole didn't care but decided to explain her current apparel. \"Sorry sweetie, but...I haven't been able to find anything better to wear. You'll just have to bear with me here, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, still looking down and gulping. Just a glimpse has made you rock hard underneath which is shameful, yet you reason that any man would react to a body like this. So far, it seems any fusion would do that too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath as Nicole moves around to check the nearby closets, you continue questioning. \"T-then, um...so, what happened? Last I remembered is...bumping to Rebecca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure because you were in a panic, but based on your older sister's surprised voice, you're certain it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole chuckles as she grabs a dress and looks into a mirror. \"Oh, your sister! She's fine, but I'm actually glad you knocked her out. I didn't mean to give you a scare last night, but at least now I can delay explaining my appearance. Today worked out well actually!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your eyebrows and look up to stare at her, only to see her heart-shaped behind. You quickly lower your gaze. \"Um...how so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nicole continues, casually swaying as she eyeballs the measurement of the existing clothes to her form, \"...your sister Emily is actually at a sleepover with her friends. Your father, who we were supposed to meet last night at the party, apparently got drunk with some of his colleagues and he arrived after we had to leave. He's currently out cold at his friend's house for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...that just leaves Rebecca...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole hums, \"...who you've knocked out so I've managed to move her body to your room. I was worried about you and hoped you would wake up sooner so we could talk which is why I had you sleep here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but...we'll still have to explain all of this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole frowns, throwing the dress in her hands on the floor and grunting in annoyance. \"I don't know why I'm even bothering! None of these will fit me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gasps a little, then blushes. She turns to face you. \"Oh, sorry sweetie. I've just been trying my hardest to find myself some proper clothes to wear. Honestly, it doesn't matter much though since we have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves to sit on the bedside. While you're trying your hardest not to stare, Nicole doesn't care at the moment. In fact, she feels a little thrilled to have her son mesmerized by her fused form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, look at me. You don't have to be reserved. Besides, you might have to merge with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyes and blink incredulously. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand touches your thigh, not at all helping your current state of increasing libido. She doesn't seem to notice though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I merged with Ariana out of desperation and was hoping to at least remain dominant in some fashion. I was successful, but since Ariana isn't resisting in the slightest, I have to be careful not to draw on her memories or else I might change mentally too. After things settle, I was hoping to unmerge and try to talk her out of this, but she...refuses to let go. I don't know how I can explain this to the family, so we have to try to fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or is it true?\" she cuts in, a question which you have no context for, yet the ways her eyes gaze on you unsettles you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...true what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Gina merged with me, were you really about to...let us remain merged?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lips. It's clear that Ariana's statement about your wishes kept repeating in her mind, probably literally too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was...confused, mom. I just...resonated with both of you somehow. I merged with you once and then Gina separately, both of you were mothers, and something in me just...wanted to see what would happen. I shouldn't have allowed that though! You're my mom and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole doesn't want to hear anymore and she plants a finger on your lips, hushing you gently. A tear draws out on her face and she smiles at you, reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I understand, sweetie. Truth is, I...I've not been feeling like myself lately. After merging with you, I felt so close to you and didn't want to let go. Then merging with Gina, that connection to you just grew. I was really about to let myself go at that time and thought that you might be happier with Gina as a mother than I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, that wouldn't be fair. It was too...\" you draw out, not sure how to describe it, but your mother chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...perverse?\" she finishes causing you to widen your eyes and continues, \"...that may be so, but the thing that troubles me right now is...I don't mind that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shakes and grabs your hand, forcing you to hold the necklace as she drapes her hand over yours. You start to feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to make a choice here, sweetie because I'm unable to. I love you and I...want you to be happy too. If you want to separate me from Ariana, then you'll have to merge with us and take control. The thing is...I'm not sure how to resolve the issue with Ariana and furthermore, I don't know if we'll ever be able to go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you might feel like you want to remain merge and if so...I don't think I'll be able to resist this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom...\" you breathe, feeling scared. Primarily, you don't know that if you merge with her, you'll want to let go either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and finally,\" she finishes with a weak smile, \"...I could always stay like this. We would have to explain it to the family but it also means that I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can't help but lean closer to you and you don't need her to finish to know how she's feeling. Her love for you has grown increasingly after merging with you and then experiencing Gina's desires. Ariana only seems to drive it further being a secondary connection to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Everything that happened so far happened because I got too curious for my own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles and then leaning closer, she cups your cheek, gazing at you lovingly. \"Baby, stop blaming yourself. It's alright. It just means that...we'll have to adjust somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiding your hand up, she forces you to take the necklace off her. Your hand drops to the side as you loosely hang on to it. You have no idea what to do with it at the moment and can't dwell on it any longer as Nicole's lips touch yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the feelings that had been held back explode in that instant. You let out a groan as she holds you lovingly and keeps locked for as long as possible. She rubs your thigh which slowly turns into rubbing the hard-on that exists behind your pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want this, but at the same time, conflict still exists in your head. The personality behind this fusion is still your mother. You break away and grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom, we can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shakily breathes and hugs you, her large chest pushing up against yours. \"I'm...sorry, baby. I want to so badly merge with you again but that just causes trouble. I...I <i>need</i> to at least embrace you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes you down, then kisses you again. You groan, unable to hold back any longer. The necklace in your hand slides away and jingles onto the wooden floor. Then, you and Nicole make love, joining together in harmony as you are able to without merging. This sort of contact is satisfying as well, even if it's not as a permanent feeling when using the necklace. That said, your inhibitions are lost when it comes to this newly fused form and exploring every curve feels familiar...as if it's your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes and you stare up at the ceiling with Nicole in your arms. You are at a loss on how to feel. There's content on one side and worry on the other. Looking at your mother's gentle face, you are overcome with satisfaction too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just lost your virginity to a fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Rebecca is awake?\" you ask, hugging Nicole further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hums and kisses you on the lips. \"I'm sure she is. We have some explaining to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips. \"She's not going to believe a word unless we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nods, not needing to hear you finish. She rises up and gives you a view of her perfect chest. \"Do you want to merge with her or should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you prefer?\" I ask, not wanting to make choices on your own without some advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slides her hair behind her shoulder and smiles worryingly, cupping your face. \"You're my only son. Sometimes, I look into your eyes when you were fused with someone and I...I didn't even see a speck of you in there. That really...troubles me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit uplifted by how much she cares and understand as well. There were times when you felt like you were going to lose yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you answer what you want to do with Rebecca, you want to address something else that troubles you. \"Um...by the way...how are we going to explain this to dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly widens her eyes and emits a small gasp, but then calms down. You stare at her quizzically. It's as if she's forgotten about her own husband!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, that's...we'll worry about that later, okay? Rebecca is the first priority since she's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Nicole is deferring the plan and doesn't really want to think about it, you don't push. Sighing, you get off the bed and change back into your underwear and pajamas. Nicole does the same and picks up the necklace that lies on the ground. Having bonded with you in bed, her urge to merge with you has been satisfied for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way, sweetie,\" she calls on you, \"...since I'm staying like this, you don't have to call me mom or Nicole if that bothers you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows. \"Um...what should I call you then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing an alternative name somehow helps you feel less bad. At the same time, it does indicate that a new personality is developing. You start to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean that you're....changing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline half-shrugs and half-nods. \"At this point, I don't feel like unmerging anymore but I feel better about it since you've made the decision on it. That said, I feel Ariana is forgiving you now and although it's annoying me a bit, I'm picking up memories of her without realizing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to sweat, \"So then...you're not going to punish me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline gives a playful smile. \"Not unless you want to, big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a heavy breath, amazed how quickly her personality is turning out. Yet, you can't regret your decision. Ariana put you and your mother in a difficult spot and it seems she got her way in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about her boyfriend? Doesn't she have one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's dumped as of today,\" Angeline proudly declares and smiles slyly at you, \"...I don't think I need to give you the reason now, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle nervously, not sure if you should feel lucky or worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Scott? Ugh...my head! Are you guys here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch as you hear Rebecca calling out, trying to find you. It seems that you could not delay any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline holds out the necklace in front of you. \"There's no longer a right or wrong decision here, Scott. Either way, it seems one of us has to merge to catch Rebecca up to speed. Who is it going to be?\"</span></div></div>",

At the same time, the same risks that apply to you will apply to her as well. Still, despite becoming a new person, she still feels a maternal need to protect her child, especially her only son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Scott,\" she smiles, \"...then, I suppose it's time to give your sister a new scare. One that doesn't involve your nude butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems this fusion has a sense of humor. You chuckle dryly and roll your eyes. \"Yeah yeah, let's just get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles and slides her way to give you a peck, then exits the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand a little dumbfounded, When thinking about this beauty who embraced you, it creates a stupid grin on your face. Mom or not, she's acting a bit more with a free personality which makes it easy to believe she's an entirely different person. Maybe at this point, you can consider your mother, Nicole lost for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, you don't feel sad. It's different from when Gina tried to take over and maybe that's because there's a level of acceptance that occurred within the fusion and yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows for sure. What can be agreed without a doubt is that your family is going to become truly messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you think upon that, Rebecca's screams fill the house and the timing couldn't be any more perfect. Not wanting to miss the fusion, you run towards the direction of the scream. There, you see Angeline and Rebecca merging partway. Naturally, your sister is frighten as she seemingly submerges into Angeline like quicksand. She manages to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-scott, s-save me! This woman is...eating...me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words are drowned out as she completely submerges between Angeline chest.

You watch in awe as she begins to transform as her body assimilates her daughter. She closes her eyes and groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips and watch as the transformation finishes. With her and Rebecca's groans merging together, it's a little arousing to watch. Yet, you try to keep calm and serious about this matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin no time, a new fusion is complete and the necklace has also decided to reform Angeline's lingerie and Rebecca's night where together.

From Rebecca's front, you start to see someone being pushed out. With blond hair, blue eyes, and a beautiful nose, Angeline gasps as her head extrudes out of the fusion. Some of your sister's true features begin to show itself the more Angeline pulls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin no time, the necklace completes the unmerge and Angeline is thrown to your side.

Of course, now that she knows the truth of the circumstances, she couldn't get mad. She lets out another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay...um...mom? Angeline?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline giggles. \"It's whatever you prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel clears her throat. \"Well, you sound a little bit like Nicole which is kind of creepy, but...since you don't look that much older than me, I'll stick with Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline chuckles. \"That's fine. I'd like someone though to call me mom. I'm still your mother, even if I'm not the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...right,\" Rebecca clears her throat, then grows concerned, \"...so, does this mean that...we'll never see our mom, Nicole again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline shuffles uncomfortably and grabs her arm. \"I...don't think I can unmerge right now.

I still need to digest everything, but I think we'll just have to work things out like always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline smiles appreciatively and moves to hug Rebecca.

No surprise that after merging, they'd understand each other better. Despite the young appearance of Angeline, Rachel could still feel her mother in there which gave her some comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile setting the down the plates, the doorbell rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline eyes Rebekah worryingly, but the college girl reassures her with a smile. \"It'll be okay. While we're both sisters, we're living into two different worlds right now with her in high school and myself in college. Compared to everyone else, we don't see each other than much so unmerging may be easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reasoning helped lessen some of Angeline's motherly concerns, but she knew from experience and talking with Erica as Nicole that the youngest sister did wish that her older sister were around more often. Despite that, she couldn't protest at this point since the decision was already made. She could only remain out of sight until the eventual merge finished so that Emily didn't freak out seeing a busty stranger in lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah planned not to waste any time as she opened the door for her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, sis! Have fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiles at her sister and nods. She proceeds to take off her shoes and put them in the closet while talking. Rebekah closed the front door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was great! Not much else to say, but my friends like to play a lot more girly games. It feels odd when you'd rather play some zombie horror game and watching scifi shows. Speaking of which, is Scott home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah smiles and clears her throat internally. She was glad that you weren't the one to fuse with Emily considering how attached she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's home, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surprise hugs her little sister from behind and giggles. \"...wouldn't you rather play with your older sister for once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gasps and then keeps herself from swaying. She frowns, feeling sceptical of the idea. \"I'd like too, but you're always busy with yoru college studies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah cocks her head and gazes at her little sister apologetically. \"Yeah...I'm sorry about that, but...I'm free! How about we do some sister to sister bonding here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily warms up to the idea, especially seeing how her older sister is serious. \"Yeah, that sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Rebekah chirps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace glows at that moment, hidden underneath Rebekah's shirt. It quickly started to feel uncomfortable for Emily as she felt herself being tugged too closely now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...s-sis? You can let me go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah smiles sadly. \"Sorry, but...we've got to first do some major catching up...on a family level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what-Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her body sink impossibly into her sister, Emily panics. Of course, there is no helping the initial reaction, so Rebekah could only bare with the guilt as her sister wriggles into her flesh while their clothing articles mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah closes her eyes as changes and new memories start to flow into her. At the end of it all, the new fusion gasps, as if breathing in for the first time like some newborn.

Well, you must be one of my daughters in control, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion scratches her head. \"That's the thing. There's no question that I'm your daughter...which is still odd, by the way. When Rebekah merged with you, she had a majority share of the fusion but it doesn't feel like that at all here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline clears her throat. \"Well, regardless of that. Emily should now have memories shared to know what happened with all of us. You should unmerge, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion nods, not questioning the effort. For some reason, she doesn't feel reluctant to unmerge either. Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Maybe they're confident that they'll merge together another time. Either way, I feel really warm and fuzzy. Everything just feels...right</i>' she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the commotion, you come down and then widen your eyes at your new sister. Upon seeing you, her attention shifted and she beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, there's my adorable little bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline curls her lips as the fusion attacks you, hugging you to oblivion.

Just call me sis, okay?\" she coos and cuddles you while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't resist her hugs and blush, growing conscious as you try to keep your lower half from hitting her. Angeline clearly sees your discomfort and places a hand on the fusion's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be enough. It's no surprise that you're sisterly love for your brother has increased, but...let's not let it get out of hand, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion pulls back and sticks her tongue out silly. \"No promises!

If that\u2019s all you care about, then I am both Rebekah and Emily. But I feel like more than that, you know. I feel independent from them, like I\u2019m me. Not a combination of two people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you felt repugnant against these words. \u201cYou know Rebekah initiated the merge to get Emily up to speed with the current events, right? Now with that done, you should unmerge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma frowns. \u201cOww, you really don\u2019t want to learn more about me, bro? C\u2019mon, shouldn\u2019t we at least get to know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly got really angry. \u201cNo shit! First mom, now you! Why is this all happening? Just get it over with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma\u2019s expression turned serious. \u201cRemember, I\u2019m a living human being, just like Rebekah and Emily. No more, no less. When I unmerge, I die. If you force me to unmerge, then you are a murderer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a break! Why\u2019d I want one sister instead of two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Angeline? What made you go soft on her? Don\u2019t you want our mom back? Did you even know Arianna in the first place? As far as I knew, she was a problem for you. In fact, we should work together and get rid of her!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Emotional, the fused sisters didn't expect the move. Trying to push away the woman, Angeline acts quickly. She remembers how you unfused Nicole from Gina in your desperate attempt to preserve yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you two need to cool your heads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their cries, Angeline's will reaches the necklace and affects Emma who wears it. This time the unmerging is quick, perhaps indicative of Emma's emotional state. What occurs is Emily nearly thrown out of Rebekah's body while the older sister pushes against the wall, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily is able to stop her fumble. Both of them pant, their hearts racing. While it seemed like things may relax a little, Emily doesn't look at anyone. She sprints away to her room, holding back her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline takes a breath herself and watches as her youngest daughter hides away. \"I figured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your eyebrows. \"Wait, I don't understand. I thought neither Emily or Rebekah was in control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah explains as she recomposes herself. She wipes some sweat that grows on her head and clears her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it definitely didn't feel like I was repressed. Not sure why, but I'm guessing its how I tried to ease Emily into the merge. We had a little chat before I surprise merged her. Though...I do have to apologize for how things went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns and looks at you. \"Sorry for the slap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, that was probably Emily's influence, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think that was mine,\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah rubs the back of her neck, laughing a little silly. \"Well, I mean...It probably isn't a good idea for our hearts to love you like that. It would make it harder for us to unmerge, so I guess our fused self decided in her thought process to slap you and try to make it out like a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...well to be fair, I should have pushed back too...and with Angeline back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline doesn't say anything, lowering her gaze and shuffling uncomfortably. She decides to excuse herself. \"I'm going to finish preparing dinner. Let's give Emily some time though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed to that. Rebekah takes hold of the necklace that has thankfully been left on her. She stares at it with some disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fucking up our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, <i>I</i> fucked up our family,\" you pressed with a pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah chuckles and shakes her head. \"If you didn't mess around with it, <i>somebody</i> would. All we can do now is sort things out with everyone once heads are clear; Emily especially. She's definitely not taking this well and I should have been more careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her sigh together. You feel rather surprised how wise Rebekah is compared to everyone. In fact, she's always been like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, I think you're the true mother of the house, sis. It still surprises me how well you're handling this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah smirks. \"I could have been too in a literal sense. Anyways, I'm sure we'll talk more later. I'm going to help out Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and when she leaves, you look in the direction where Emily fled. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

The damage has already been done. You may be strong sis but seeing Emily, it's clear not everyone can handle the effects of the necklace easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, taking a deep breath. \"But what if...we indulge the necklace? Is it really murder if everyone fuses once in a while, especially since we're family? Unmerge when necessary? Live both fused and our normal lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah narrows her eyes and bites her lips, somewhat tempted by the idea, but she holds out. \"That's...naive thinking isn't it? Also, murder? I think you're letting Emma's words getting to you too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't dismiss them though. \"...but they were your words too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah looks away for a moment and then drops her shoulders, groaning, before returning her attention. \"I...guess. That was simply self-preservation though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But again, couldn't we discipline ourselves? Like how you unmerged from Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah shakes a little, a pained expression over her face. \"I...I did that because you didn't want to lose me and that...really hit me. I was also dominant then, but when Emily and I became Emma, it was harder to let go. It may look like I'm handling it better than Emily is right now, but...that's because I'm trying my best to preserve our family. Isn't that what we should be doing now and healing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel bad to put doubts in your older sister's mind, but you're worried that nothing will heal at this pace. Healing may just be using the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do want to preserve our family and...I'd like to see you and Emily too, but I also don't want you both to lose your minds either. If you merge, I'll have a third sister and...I think I'm okay with that. We're family here, so...as long as I can see you and Emily as yourself from time to time, I feel like we can work this out better. I just hope you keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears start falling from Rebekah's eyes. She feels a whole slew of emotions that she tried to keep from raging. Yet, now her little brother is saying it's fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a sad chuckle as she wipes some tears and sniffles. \"You know I'll be more than just a sister, Scott.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's a bit of a rumble and Angeline chuckles dryly. \"Well...here she comes. You better get ready, Scott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-should I run?\" you ask, smiling crookedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasting a bit of the broth, she shakes her head. \"She has Emily's genes now. You'd be too slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott!\" Emma appears into the kitchen as expected. You turn away from the stove and give a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hello again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma squeals and opens her arms side. \"Come here, my sweet little brother! I can't thank you enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hold on-urgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushes you, pushing you away from Angeline and enveloping you into a hug. You take a fast breath and gulp as her new chest pushes against you. She snuggles into your shoulder with a heavenly sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! This feels so...right! I'm...I'm so sorry for what happened before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug her back hesitantly and try to keep composed. Glancing at Angeline, she smiles wryly and goes back to stirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat. \"Um...that's enough, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma pulls her head back a little but doesn't let go. She grins, leaning her face closer to you. \"Not yet~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing her lips onto yours, you utter a muffled groan before it goes silent. You feel Emma's heart beating fast and happily, resounding into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself growing hard and wanting to travel your hands down her curves, you fight the urge and pull away before things really escalate. She pouts a little while you gasp and put in some distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...what's the matter? I thought you'd be happier to see me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she is only playing, there is a greater love in her eyes now that the individuals that constitute her have heard their brother accept the consequences. Rebekah had enough influence into Emma's thought process to provide some pushback but now, Emma feels free enough to be happy with herself and her love which has doubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your breath, you give a worried smile. \"Well, I am. Rather, I want my sisters to be happy, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's expression soften. \"You're too sweet, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises her hands like claws and then creeps closer to you with a grin. \"But if you don't want what's coming for you, then I suggest you run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast,\" Angeline interrupts, placing a hand on the fusion's shoulder. \"Food is almost ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded of Angeline, Emma grows guilty and then turns her attention away from you. In turn, you breathe a little easier, but some part of you wanted to allow the fusion to embrace you. Although you haven't merged with your sisters yet, the urge to do so lingers in the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween both fusions that stand face to face, Angeline starts out with a sad smile. \"I'm sorry, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma curls her lips, her eyes starting to water. \"I...I'm sorry too, mom. You were right though...I was jealous. I thought that I would be closest to my brother and then...you just showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline lowers her gaze, then hugs her double-daughter. She gives a shaky breath. \"I love your brother too. I know exactly what you're going through but I also know that I'm not completely family here. I shouldn't delay any further here though. You deserve to see your real mother, not some impersonator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away, Angeline slowly takes away the necklace from Emma. She doesn't resist but does feel guilty. Still, she knows that Nicole is dominant within Angeline and even though she hasn't met Arianna in person, it seems unfair to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline sighs as she stares at Emma and you, then puts on the necklace. \"I don't know what will happen, but if what I feel from Arianna is real, then she has a deep desire to belong to this family. Yet, Scott is right. We can't ignore our real lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she closes her eyes. The necklace glows in response to her will and in a clean fashion, you see Arianna splitting away from Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, Arianna fumbles a bit and you move to catch her, giving her time to stabilize while on her feet rather than on the ground. You're a bit worried she'll get mad like before but instead, she shakes and slowly wraps her arms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to keep herself as composed as possible, she breathes shakily onto you. Not sure what to do, you just remain still as she tries to recollect herself. It seems like at any moment, she's going to break down and cry, but to your surprise, she doesn't. She just remains silent for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole takes time to recollect herself too, but she recovers faster having used the necklace a few times now. She glances towards Arianna with guilt and worry. When her eyes and yours meet, she quickly looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips the return your focus to the girl. \"Are you...okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna slowly nods. Nicole and Emma keep their distance, not wanting to break any glass as the girl tries to remain together. Slowly, she nods and pulls away. While still tugging at your arms, she turns her head to look at Nicole. Small tear streaks mark her face and then she frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...wasn't at all what I felt before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes widen and she knows the girl is referring to when she merged with Scott as Celestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lips, Nicole couldn't help but defend herself. \"I...had no choice. What did you expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna's eyes lower and she gives a bitter smile. \"I'm in the wrong too, I know. I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face tightens as she tries to find the words. She finally looks at you, a small warmth growing on her complexion. \"When we were Celestine, even if it was forced, I never felt such synchronicity with someone ever before. I...I wanted that again...I wanted to get to know you better! I thought that if I merged with your mother, I could get to know you on a deeper level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looks on, agitation building up but quickly, Nicole places a comforting hand on her shoulder. She shakes her head silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and for that, I'm sorry,\" she said, her hands quivering, \"I know I've caused problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes soften. Her maternal instincts couldn't get mad at the girl and even sympathized with her, especially after merging. \"Dear...come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna shakes her head and back away, knowing if she gets hugged by your mother, she would definitely break down. Yet, Nicole doesn't heed and only sees a girl that needs comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging the girl, Arianna finally gives into her tears and hugs back. Now, you back away and stand beside Emma who grows conflicted. It's clear she doesn't know how to feel about this girl anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some comfort is exchanged between the previously fused females, they break away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is going to happen?</span></div></div>",

Yet, as she believes that it's over, Nicole offers a compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arianna, I'll be honest here. I'd like to merge with you again...this time properly; however, you're young and it's easy to want some access to escape. I look into your memories though and you have such loving parents and a nice relationship with your boyfriend. Why would you want to throw that away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna knits her brows together and looks down, guilt plaguing her face. \"Everything has been just...boring. I love my parents, but I've always felt like I'm missing something. I could never explain it myself and always go through the motions. My boyfriend is nice, but...it's clear we aren't compatible with each other. He wants to go to a different direction than I do and knowing that, I don't think I can be with him. Plus, it's only been three months, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks towards you and then smiles. \"But it felt different when I was with you. Maybe that's just the necklace doing, but I felt like I was truly alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and rub your neck, embarrassed. \"Um...glad you think of me like that. I can't say I don't like you, but um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna didn't need you to say anything more. She nods. \"I know, things are crazy and I probably didn't help with that when I merged with your mom. Despite not being dominant as Angeline, I felt a little happy being with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole clears her throat, blushing herself. \"While my son is single, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. First, your parents must be worried sick! I'm partly to blame here for not unmerging sooner. You must talk with your parents first! How are you going to explain this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna rubs her arm and curls her lips as she thinks. \"Well...this isn't the first time I've gone out. Of course, usually, I tell them beforehand but I can say I met up with one of my friends at the party and spent the night over there and forgot to let them know. They might be upset, but they're pretty chill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole breathes easily. \"As long as you have an excuse. The last thing I want is to be framed for kidnapping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves to grab the keys to the car and then looks at you. You can see some conflict in her eyes as she stares at you, but she keeps calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-scott...Emma, I'm going to take her home. I may or may not come back with her depending on how things go. In any case, she'll have my number in case she reaches out to contact us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Emma nod. Before leaving with Arianna, she takes off the necklace and gives it to you. She gives a stern eye at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your father comes back, I'd like things not to get messy, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod hesitantly and Emma smiles innocently.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, it seems like I would fit Emma's clothes. Hope she won't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses, then shakes her head silly. \"Of course she won't. I'm making the judgment right now probably based on her influence and memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I'm talking to myself, trying to find reason in my actions thanks to Rebekah and Scott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hums and narrows her eyes. \"I think I should shut up now and go find some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...Scott and Emma...or rather Scott, Rebekah and Emily. What should I call myself?\" she muses as she puts on a casual blue dress that she could simply fit over. Oddly enough, she doesn't feel too picky about clothes and that's likely because Scott isn't picky. He's a boy after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thinks of a name, something comes to the front of her mind. She opens her mouth in horror. \"Oh shit! The pasta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly moving back into the kitchen, the pot is already boiling. Quickly, she pours strains the pasta that she hopes won't turn out overcooked and then sets it to dry. She begins cutting some vegetables that she would then mix with the pasta and reheat, stirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the aroma that fills her nose, she finally decides on a name with a smile. \"Gemelli...because why not?

Yet, now that they've merged and unfused between each other, there's an increase in confidence that they might be able to maintain some normalcy between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Seems kind of unfair to dad, but I guess we'll at least try until we fail.</i>' she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, she expected that her little brother and sister would think the same but instead, she gets a new fusion surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2d/27/be/2d27be88b24687df78bdcefd116e3e94.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2d/27/be/2d27be88b24687df78bdcefd116e3e94.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take a genius to know that she has been left out and Rebekah growls. \"Are you fucking kidding me?! I thought we were on the same page!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion smirks. \"Well, only one of us needs to greet dad. Just in case, just let him know that you have a friend over - Kayla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah narrows her eyes but she couldn't complain as the door is knocked. Grunting in frustration, she pats herself off and points at Kayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Once this is over though, you've either got to let me back in or unfuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla sticks her tongue out. \"No promises~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah rolls her eyes and quickly exits the bathroom, hurrying to the front door. She smiles wide towards her father who equally smiles in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad! Welcome back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel lets out a sigh as he comes in, loosening his tie and wrinkled dress suit. \"Thanks Rebekah. I had to be dropped off by one of my coworkers. I tried calling, but nobody picked up! I started to get worried. I also didn't see Nicole at the party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah seals her lips, trying to think of a cover based on the shared memories of the party. Closing the door behind her, she speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well, mom wasn't feeling good. She probably forgot to call and went straight to bed. Emily is...still out with her friends and um...Scott is too. I've been uh...studying with my friend, Kayla who's here with me in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel relaxes on the living room couch and raises his eyebrow, surprised. \"So everyone is busy with their own things, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closes his eyes and sighs. \"...well, I'm not mad, just so you know. I got a little hungover with my colleagues and so, things were crazy on my end. Anyways, I'm just glad everyone is alright. You mentioned someone is here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf possible, Rebekah doesn't want Kayla to have to come out. \"Yes, but don't worry about her! Everyone should be back soon though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel hums, then stretches a little before standing up. \"Well, I've still got a bit of a headache now, so...I'm going to try sleeping it off. Is that pasta I'm smelling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah glances over towards the adjacent kitchen and smiles. \"Sure is! Is that going to be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel chuckles. \"Hopefully not. It's been a while since all of us had a chance to eat together at the table. I know you've been busy with your college while I've been busy with work. Since you're on break, it'll be nice to see everyone's faces at once. That is if I can get rid of this splitting headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah places a relaxing hand on her father's back. \"It'll be okay, Dad. Just rest for now. You clearly outdid yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel laughs weakly. \"That's for sure. Alright then, I'll see you in a bit, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah watches his father retreat to the master bedroom and when the door shut behind, she lets out a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I hope everyone's normal faces are there too,\" she mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla peaks from behind a wall and then whistles. \"See, that didn't go so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah growls and turns her attention towards the fusion. \"It certainly would have gone better if I had my brother and sister at my side to greet him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then we'd have problems on why we haven't been picking up the phone,\" Kayla glances to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear it,\" Rebekah scoffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Of course, her first guess is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott and...Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla grins. \"Hi Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah sighs and crosses her arms. \"You missed out when we were all fused together. Dad just came back home though is taking a little bit more time to rest from his apparent hungover. It seems I'm the only one kicked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole flinches. \"Y-your father? Wait, he didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah gets ahead of her thought. \"No, don't worry, mom! We didn't expose him to the necklace. Luckily, he bought my cover as for why everyone didn't pick up their phones. I told him that this fusion, Kayla is my friend I'm 'studying' with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole curls her lips, guilty. \"That's my fault too, I suppose, but I'm glad he's alright. I won't disturb him but in the meantime, I want everyone to remain normal, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla frowns. \"It hasn't even been an hour! I literally just popped into existence five minutes ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole closes her eyes and sighs. She's about to argue with her fusion of a daughter/son but then she stops. At the thought of her son, Scott, her heart is riddled with guilt. When she was merged with Ariana as Angeline, though she had majority control, she was different enough to embrace her son in absence of fusion. Perhaps fusion would've been the better option but at that moment, neither she nor Scott knew if they would ever unfuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's still a fear in her mind too. She felt the reluctance herself and saw the reluctance when both of her daughters fused. It honestly relieved her to see that they at least managed to split halfway and not bring in their father to this chaotic mix. It almost makes her regret not believing they could have kept it a secret from Emily and Rebekah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I...I can't look at my son right now. It's still...confusing for me.</i>' she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecomposing herself, she pretends that she's fine. \"Kayla, is it? Please keep it quiet and I expect that you'll unfuse when it's time to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla smiles wide, then moves to hug her mother. Nicole takes it with ease, knowing that this girl isn't purely Scott. That said, she does want to see her son, but first wants to sort out her feelings better...not as Angeline, but his mother, Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Kayla and Rebekah goes into their own rooms and she finishes up the cooking of the pasta. She tries to distract herself as the day slowly comes to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose to dinner time, what happens?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily and Scott have always been close. Given that they are only a year apart, it makes sense but the biggest reason is that they share a lot in common in terms of likes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a young girl, Emily has never been one to play with dolls or pretend. Rather, she found a love for video games and reading science fiction novels thanks to her brother. As a result, they could talk together about various things easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there are differences. Emily has always been the most physically active out of the family. It can be said that despite enjoying time inside the house with her brother, she enjoys going to the gym and running with her track team members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them is here though. Instead, Kayla exists in place of them and to the shared interests of her personalities, she is taking time to play a video game that was sitting in Scott's room, one that neither of them could beat alone but perhaps it would be different this time now that she had their collective knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, it isn't. Zero progress plus zero progress doesn't mean any new progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla throws the controller and shuts off the console. She glances at the time on the alarm clock of Scott's drawer and frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...here's to me,\" she sighs, standing up and looks into a nearby mirror next to several posters. \"Seriously, if I wasn't family, I'd have a hard time splitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, she closes her eyes and breathes in. Soon, Kayla disappears and in her place, you and Emily reappear into existence, groaning with your minds dazed. You share a bit of skin but it spreads thin between you and her while your clothes rematerialize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a bit. Emily is the most reluctant to defuse as she clings to her you but eventually, you and her fumble back within the center of their room with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...wow...\" you breathe, leaning against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily likewise tries to regain her sense of surroundings, slowly sitting at your bedside. She places a hand to her forehead and groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a little sick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the risk of having to change your bedsheets, you quickly refocus yourself. \"Don't you dare, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily lets out a short laugh and manages to cool herself. Then, she raises her head, catching your eyes. A small guilty smile plagues her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back, more confidently. \"You feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily curls her lips and then moves her head side to side. \"I guess? I...I would say I feel better, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glisten as she breathes in, a little shaky before continuing. \"...this feeling inside of me, it makes me wish I wasn't your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes. \"Emily...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily snorts and shakes her head sadly. \"We've always been close, Scott and I consider you my best friend; however, thanks to the necklace, other people have gotten close to you as well. Suddenly, it feels like I have to compete. I know it shouldn't be this way and I know that my feelings shouldn't grow any further, but...it's hard. The necklace has done something to all of us that can't seem to reversed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow guilt starts to grow in your mind. \"Emily, I'm to blame here as well, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you've blamed yourself plenty,\" Emily cuts you off, \"...what's done is done. I may not be as strong as Rebekah is mentally, but...I just have to do my best. Whatever happens, I just have to remember that you're my brother...unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence grows and you feel goosebumps as Emily's eyes widen. Her lips quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...unless...I merge with someone so that I'm a different person...someone that's not your sister. Someone who's free to love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-emily, stop. That's not funny,\" you hurriedly protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily closes her eyes and sighs; she lets herself fall flat on your bed and stares at the ceiling, deep in thought before reopening them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, I'm sorry...but I'm serious here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, I don't want to have this conversation now,\" you plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily lifts herself up and clenches the bedsheet as stares at you, astonished. \"What's wrong with it, huh? Why did you lose yourself when Nicole and Ariana were fused? Did you resonate with Angeline that much?! Were you so resistant when Rebekah and I were fused? Was it because we just doubled even further as your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking so many questions, you can tell Emily just wants to understand because fusing with you hasn't provided her any answers. You bite your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the answer, Emily,\" you answer softly, \"...I can't exactly explain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's body quivers and her hands relax. She grunts in displeasure. \"This is so unfair. Thinking on it, you resonated with Gina...and almost let her remain as our mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let's not talk about that. Again, it was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-complicated, I get it. I'm not blaming you, Scott. I just...\" Emily pauses before speaking softly, \"...I want to make you happy. I want to be happier and...I'm feeling that the best way is to become someone I'm not, someone better...just like Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence once again invades your room. Certainly, the mood has turned awkward but given your previous conversation with her after she defused from Rebekah, it's not so surprising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat. \"Whatever happens though, we shouldn't ignore our lives. It's so easy to, but the reality doesn't change for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily hums. \"I get it. I really do. I'm not saying I'll live as a fusion forever but maybe...I can live as your sister one day and then someone like Angeline the next. Would that be too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a shaky breath. \"It'd be fucked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily chuckles sadly. \"...but we're already fucked up...except for Dad. I'm not expecting you to give an answer, but...just know I'm not going to give up on getting close to you outside of fusing with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving at that, Emily hops away from your bed and moves to hug your stunned form. Her declaration doesn't make you feel any better about the way things are progressing, but you can't just reject her outright. Rather than that, you're actually scared that it may go her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a fusion appears like Angeline that you're weak to, you might even forget the parts that make up the fusion. During the moment with Angeline for sure, you completely forgot she was partly your mother and it's clear it was the same for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily silently breaks away from you and exits your room. With the door closed, you just keep your mouth closed and stare down at the necklace which has fallen to the ground during Emily and your defusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

It's not just her - Rebekah, Nicole, Gina, Ariana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom family to strangers, a bond is created that doesn't go away even after splitting. Suddenly, you are faced with the desire of others to want to be with you, some more than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for yourself, you definitely feel an emotional bond to everyone but it's hardly equal. Perhaps that's why you could resist Emma's advances much less your sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's because they are your family; however, things go pretty south when someone outside of the family fuses with another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina and Angeline...you felt something for them. The desire to see them again grows and that's a problem because they all revolve around Nicole, your mother - someone you fused with the first time and indirectly made love to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Emily truly merged herself with someone else, would it be the same?

As a mother, she shouldn't even try to touch her child but as Angeline, she felt free and even loved her son more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack as a mother again, it would be hard for her to pretend like that life didn't exist. Even though the fusion is gone, the feelings remain and you can tell just by looking at her that she's deeply troubled and in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same goes for Emily, who actually hopes you agree to the idea, only because it means that to love her brother, she can simply fuse with Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you begin, your throat drying, \"...don't mind getting with Angeline, but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at Nicole, Emily, and Rebekah, you don't want things to go down the deep end to a point where being a family means nothing except what comes out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I love you all as family too, so...can we try to act like one when we're as ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole eyes widen and her mouth quivers, a conflicting wave of happiness and guilt swirling inside of her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of days have passed since your willingness to engage in a relationship with Angeline, one you had no idea how to approach and it racked your brain every night so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your father left for his business trip, your family looked stranger to you. One moment you would see your sisters each in their rooms, doing some form of studies or homework and the next, they would come downstairs to eat dinner as Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it would seem Rebekah and Emily is embracing the necklace, you and Nicole tried to avoid it at best. The past two days, Emily would nag at you to fuse with her and Rebekah but...you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're just a bit overwhelmed at the changes that are sweeping your family so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're also worried about your mother. Just yesterday, she asked to give a hug. A simple request, really. You give your mother hugs all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she's forcing herself to act normal but the truth of the matter is that when she hugged you, she didn't want to let you go. You can still hear her shaky breath and troubled gaze as she slides her hands across your back and side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she held you didn't feel like her normal hugs and she knew it too, which is why she suddenly pushed you away and tried to laugh the whole thing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to reassure it would be okay, but knew that saying anything would be meaningless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>If she fused with Ariana, wouldn't this make things worse?</i>' you think as you exit the school. Before you in the pickup lane, you could see that Nicole's car is already there and ready to pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile dryly and hop into the passenger seat, trying to muster an enthusiastic greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles, her complexion looking much better today. \"Hi, sweetie. How was school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she asks, she begins to pull out of the lane and start driving. You respond typically, mentioning how great it's the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Just letting you know, we're headed to pick up Ariana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze. While she did mention that Ariana would be visiting on the weekends, especially when your father is away, you didn't think things would progress right after you got out of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing nervous, you take a deep breath to help calm your mind. Was this the reason she looked happier today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy or not, you begin to doubt yourself and your agreement to start a relationship with Angeline. After seeing how your mother reacted towards you, you are worried this would harm her further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another breath, you look down at your feet. \"I...I won't deny it, I...l-like Angeline, but if this harms you, then I couldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie,\" she interrupts in a firm tone, her eyes focused on the road, \"...I...need this...please. You also promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut your mouth and seeing the pain in your mother's eyes, you don't elaborate further. For the rest of the drive, you remain quiet until you see Ariana waiting by the sidewalk with a duffle bag strapped to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes brighten to see you and your mother. It's clear that after she and your mother made an agreement and heard about your father leaving, she couldn't wait for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the backseat, she greeted happily. \"Hi Scott, Mrs. Nicole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles warmly. In a way, Ariana felt like a daughter to her after merging and gaining some of her memories. \"I hope you haven't been standing out there. I could have called you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana waves her hands and laughs. \"No worries! You told me that you'd pick me up after your son, so I figured it would be ten or fifteen minutes after classes end for this district.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her attention to you and with a guilty smile, she apologizes. \"Hey Scott, I know this must be awkward but...thank you...for giving us a chance...for giving me a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uhm, n-no problem,\" you lie but in your head, you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>This is awkward as hell!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, it feels even weirder with your mother around. \"S-so, I guess this means we're...dating, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana finds your hesitation cute but seeing how this could get confusing, she simply nods. \"I guess so. I've already told my boyfriend it's best we separate and he actually took it well! I hope the best for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" you muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looks up through the rearview mirror at Ariana and clears her throat. \"Just remember our agreement, Ariana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana flinches and you raise your eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, of course! I mean, I have my own studies too, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...what?\" you voice your confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles reassuringly. \"It's nothing sweetie. When we fuse into Angeline, I just wanted to make sure that you wouldn't be slacking off and forgetting to do your homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweat a little, now a little nervous in how this Angeline would turn out since Nicole and Ariana would perform a mental merge this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only hope nothing goes too crazy as you soon arrive home. There, Nicole had you wait in your room and requested you to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you wanted to take a nap for a bit, you couldn't help but feel restless as you hear Ariana and Nicole taking their time, talking like two friends and like a mother and daughter in the kitchen. You couldn't make out there conversation and desperately wanted something to help mentally prepare you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then you noticed a sticky note on you're desk. You haven't seen Emily or Rebekah, but the message written by Emily says \"Good luck, bro...and don't forget about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does not calm your heart. Internally, you curse your younger sister for making things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor at least ten or so minutes, you pace around your room, wondering how you should act. You take a sudden stop though when you then notice an ominous silence. It felt like just a minute ago, you heard laughter downstairs but now, it's gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath. A knock on your door would be so much better, but instead, you heard a soft voice that was unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is still smooth and velvety as you remember before, even while embracing her. Memories of that time plagued you with guilt, happiness, and shame. Now...you aren't sure how to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come in?\" she asks, worry in her voice as she notices a lack in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fumble and then clearing your throat, you speak up. \"S-sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, a light shines from the window across from your room within a hallway and adds to the allure of the fusion who smiles slightly at you. She sports a thin strapped dress which matches her blonde hair, glowing in the evening sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ilarge.lisimg.com/image/16682781/1080full-lindsey-pelas.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://ilarge.lisimg.com/image/16682781/1080full-lindsey-pelas.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help stare dumbly, it feels all the previous worries you had regarding Nicole and Ariana has been washed away. All you can remember is how dazzling the woman was when she first appeared to you wearing blue lingerie and trying to find something to fit her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the woman you gave your freakin' virginity to...and that is amazing by itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, this couldn't be the same woman. While there was an influence from the part of Ariana, it was still mostly your mother. Now though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhm...you must be different from before, right? Are you my...mom, Ariana, or some mixture of both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside your room, she chuckles at your confusion. \"Well, that's a good question. Honestly, I don't feel any different from before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen and then you furrow your eyebrows. \"Wait, then...wasn't my mom mostly in control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline hums, looking rather cute as she thought about it. \"Yes? No? I think she was already being influenced by Ariana and changing. If I hadn't defused, I would probably feel the same sense of self that I feel right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she leans forward closer to you as you back away, nervously. You try not to stare at her chest which she may or may not have intentionally revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it bothers you, why don't you call me mommy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp. \"W-what? No! That sounds-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline takes advantage of your shock to sneak in a kiss, cutting any protests you have. You melt as she wraps her arms around you and even slips a bit of tongue into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUttering pleasant grunts, you can't help trail your hand around her form and you are reminded of the sensation of joining with her a few days ago and felt like her curves were almost your own. Maybe this is the result of the necklace on your mind even though you hadn't merged with her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking away after a few seconds, she smiles warmly and brushes her hand over your cheek before giggling. \"I'm kidding. You can choose to see me as your mother or not, but what matters is that I love you, Scott. I never thought I'd exist again, but I can thanks to your willingness to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angeline...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like your heart is going to explode now. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Whether it's an aftereffect of the necklace is another question for later but you have to admit that you embraced her more because you were enchanted by her beauty and fell in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a pang of sudden guilt bestows you and you look away, biting your lips.

That seems to be a commonality when a new identity is born, ala mental merge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod hesitantly to her guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline smiles sadly and then cups your cheek. \"Hey, don't worry about her or Ariana right now.

How about we dod what we can now and worry about the future later, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod rather uneasily and before long, Angeline has managed to strip you of all of your clothes. You begin kissing each other again and fall to your bed with each other in arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet breaths and moans fill the house. As you thrust and perform all sorts of positions with her, you notice that she has a maternal aura around her when she calls out to you.

She suddenly felt nervous now that it has come to this, but she wouldn't back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...mom? or Angeline?\" she asks, knowing that this woman is a fully merged being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline giggles and smiles warmly. \"Call me whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-then, Angeline...may I merge with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes. \"E-emily, this doesn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask you, <i>brother</i>,\" Emily interrupts blankly, then smiles, \"...I know this is supposed to be a special day for you two, but I won't let you disregard my feelings. If you can resonate with Angeline who is also our mother, then I want in as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knows you'll be against it or trying to find an excuse for not to merge, but she won't hear it. She waits on Angeline who stares calmly back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide?</span></div></div>",

Until then, I won't bother you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes one last look at you who shuffles uncomfortably beneath the sheets, then smiles before leaving and closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you bury your face into your hands. \"I don't want to encourage this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline's eyes soften and she rubs your arm. \"Scott, why did you agree to the idea of my existence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...I didn't want to see my mom in pain like that. Even if it's wrong, I don't know what else I can do to reverse the damage and exchange of feelings that the necklace has brought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline frowns. \"You're partially lying. Do you think I'd accept such half-hearted feelings after what we did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught you and this might be the most troubling aspect. Lowering your head, you bite your lips. \"You're right, I...like you Angeline. I don't know if it was because what we did after I first saw you or the necklace, but I couldn't resist wanting to see you again even if you comprise of my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion smiles, relieved to hear your admittance even though it's clear. \"Then, why don't you be open to the idea of liking someone new? If I can exist and be with you, then others can as well. I'm not going to feel jealous or anything especially if I'll be a part of that new love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but if it goes in this direction with Emily, then it might be Rebekah next. I'll be fucking nearly my whole family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be your family,\" Angeline disagreed, \"...it'll just be a single woman. After that, you'll see your sisters and mother as before and even if things won't be the same and feelings don't change, they'll be there at least. You'll all exist in some fashion as a family and a fusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's messed up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm here, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm messed up too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline pummels you lightly in frustration, then kisses you a couple times while you wriggle in panic under her forcefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go, you and she let out a high-pitched gasp and she continues. \"You'll have to accept it, Scott because everyone in your family may be worse off if no feelings are answered. Whether you love them as family or personally, answer me. Do you love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arianna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...want to, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline laughs but continues. \"Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebekah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...well, if we're talking about family then yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline smiles warmly and cups your cheek. \"Just don't forget them or simply dismiss them, okay? Some things may not play out and relationships are like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving it at that, you hesitantly nod and then sigh, the unease in your heart still remains; however, you hold yourself not to run away at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what now?\" you ask, seeing that Angeline had some plans for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline grins. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she suggest?</span></div></div>",

Thankfully Ariana gave me all that I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrow as you leave the bed as well. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She bought some clothes, underwear, and so many dresses that would fit me. She was really looking forward to joining with your mother you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a mental note to get along with Ariana by herself. She might be the closest to a girlfriend you have now if you exclude Angeline and it wouldn't be good if you didn't spend time with her now that she's broken up with her previous boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you smiling on about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline narrows her eyes as your lips curl up on their own. Quickly, you reappropriate your face and clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the movie theatre, you stop to appreciate Angeline who is still looking fantastic with her large breasts that look tight in her new top that Ariana bought.

She holds your hand firmly to prevent you from leaving some distance so you can appreciate her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious,\" you begin, \"...what would you prefer? I know that mom prefers cheesy soap operas and Arianna prefers dramas and comedies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion smiles. \"Sure, but I also have a bit of you in me as well since both Ariana and Nicole have merged with you. So, I also don't mind your preferences. Let's just be honest and say what you really want to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweat, \"I'm not sure what you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avengers. I want to see it too. With Arianna and your memories, I know everything so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to suppress your childish smile and fail horribly. \"O-okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" you breathe as you exit the theatre with Angeline arm locked with yours. As it was a long movie, the skies are already darkening before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great!\" Angeline giggles, \"What did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly stop her from discussing various moments from the film. \"No, I need to process this better on my own. I loved it in general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline shakes her head at your over-dramatization and stares at the evening sun that's quickly disappearing. A sad smile forms on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have to go back home. We don't want to keep Emily waiting either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffen and being brought to the present, you wished Angeline hadn't said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, because Emily is in a way still my daughter...and I want her to be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh but before leaving the central crowd in front of the theatre entrance, she stops causing you to stumble. You're about to ask but she presses forward and wraps her arms around you, slipping a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the people surrounding you whistled causing you to feel extremely embarrassed but Angeline wouldn't let you go for several seconds as people past by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking away, she smiles warmly at you and ignores all others. \"This isn't the end, alright? All I ask you is to go with your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home, you find that Emily and Rebekah are in their respective rooms either doing homework, studies or likely just procrastinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your arrival, Emily is the first to jump out of your room. She looks elated to see you and Angeline. \"Welcome back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, sweetie!\" Angeline greets in a more motherly fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...hey,\" you greet as well, feeling a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your sister approaches, Angeline speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not beat around the bush here as I know you've been waiting for the opportunity, Emily. I want you to take in consideration of your brother's feelings though. If he's not comfortable, you will not push on him. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mo-I mean, Angeline,\" Emily answers, nearly forgetting who she's speaking to. It shocked her a little to see how much of her mother could be felt from this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Angeline nods and then sighs as she looks at the time, \"...I wish I could prepare dinner first though if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily waves her hands. \"That's not a problem. Rebekah already ordered takeout as she didn't know when you guys would be back. She would have cooked something, but she's also studying for an exam and didn't want to waste time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline felt a little proud and then narrowed her eyes. \"...and what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stiffens and then provides a weak smile. \"Oh! I'm good, trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I doubt that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Angeline and Emily, this is the most Nicole-ish you've seen her so far but you don't find that a bad thing. In fact, it's pretty amusing especially since you're not on the receiving side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline sighs and shakes her head. \"Whatever. You girls can take care of yourself. So, are you ready to merge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Emily respond?</span></div></div>",

You're so full of confidence and pretty. I'm afraid that I really won't match up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetheart, it'll be fine! You're beautiful enough as is. Besides, I think Scott won't be able to resist when we're together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying you and giving you a sly smile, you curl your lips and look away. All the fusions that you've seen had tremendous quality in their own way. You wonder if that's because the necklace took the best genetics of a person. It that sense, it might explain why you always turn out female when merging with one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you'd rather spend time with Angeline and not get to know another fusion. It's already a guilty pleasure that you have to involve Arianna and your mother to experience it. If you truly started to like this fusion that also comprised of your sister, then things might become chaotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Wait...wouldn't I become involved with a fusion harem?</i>' you think in astonishment. You couldn't tell whether you should be for or against the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to watch us merge, Scott...or are you going to faint in shock like last time?\" Angeline asks with a grin, causing you to return to your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...that a challenge?\" you return, narrowing your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it as you will,\" Angeline shrugs but you've already decided to witness the merging. It's not like all the other merging were as grotesque as Arianna and Nicole's first merge, but that might because there were more resistance and internal struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Scott?\" Emily calls on you, changing the topic. Her voice is a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been avoiding her gaze because it troubles you how forthcoming she's been, but seeing small guilt on her face, you force yourself to stare into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've been a pain and troubling you, but...you won't hate me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen and curling your lips, you shake your head vehemently. \"Emily, I would never hate you! You're my sister! I just...I wish I could return your feelings better, but...I just can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiles disappointedly but this was made clear when she confessed to you in detail, \"I know...but whoever will come out of this, I hope you give me a chance as part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and then rub your temples. \"God Emily, you just won't give up, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. That necklace Angeline is wearing has opened my eyes and others and I'm now certain we should embrace the love that comes out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said, sweetie!\" Angeline praises and then approaches you one last time, connecting her lips against yours. You groan and wrap your arms around her waist for a few seconds before she pulls away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a motherly fashion, her hand draws on your cheek as she caresses your face. \"Like I said, simply open your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and then cough. '<i>That's so cheesy!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing away from you, Angeline returns to her daughter who is ready. Right in front of you both of them begin stripping and you gulp, standing awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Emily stops as she realizes something just as she is about to remove her bra. \"Wait, you guys went to the theatre, right? What movie did you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avengers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's eyes widen and then she slowly back away. \"U-um...hold on, I didn't think about this. I want to see that movie too! If we merge, then I'll be spoiled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a cheetah, Angeline grins and quickly wraps her arms around her daughter, removing her bra along the way. Emily's eyes widened in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!\" Angeline announces evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly struggling, both wanting to relinquish to the merging but not be spoiled, Emily couldn't have it both ways and eventually stopped resisting as Angeline extended the necklace around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious artifact glows and you watch with some amusement at your sister's fallen expression as both begin to sink into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe progression is far smoother than the last fusion you witnessed as both girls' meld together into one amorphous shape that looked sort of human but without the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear grunts and moans of both Emily and Angeline as they are processed by the necklace. You couldn't even begin to think on how the fusion would turn out but you are stunned when there's a sudden growth within the figure. Angeline and Emily are around 5'3\" or 5'4\" but for whatever reason, they grew to 5'9\", making it three inches that you'd be looking up instead of down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...<i>Scott...</i>...baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver as you hear Angeline and Emily's voices meld together and call out to you with much love. Taking a deep breath and hardening your mind, you try your best not to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you begin to see the color returning to the figure and the blonde hair that Angeline originally had now becoming fuller and a little darker. The fusion would definitely be blonde and it would seem that Arianna dominates in that aspect even when there are two non-blondes in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face quickly forms and then the rest of the body causing you to hold your breath. Only when the necklace stops glowing and the new fusion opens her eyes do you let out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c846121/v846121058/1e48b7/cOQMBlLXrMU.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c846121/v846121058/1e48b7/cOQMBlLXrMU.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue eyes, a more prolonged face and a fuller chest, the girl before you is nothing short of a beauty. While you could see more maturity in Angeline's eyes, it isn't completely lost in this girl as she stares at you like she's known you for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott...\" she breathes, joy in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou greet awkwardly as you're more confused than anything now. What's certain is that you can feel your lower member reacting slightly to her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles at your hesitancy and then steps forwards. You come to see her large chest jiggling and a warm smile plastered at her face. She then raises a hand and measures the distance between her head and yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange. Looks like I'm taller than you,\" she hums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you seem happy about that...um...can you not flaunt your figure in front of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to look away and take a step back, but then her hands wrap around your back, preventing you from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving one hand, she tilts your head to force you to see her and before you know it, she leans down and kisses you gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes for a moment but rather than pull away, you close your eyes and grunt as she moves her lips against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you're harder than you were ever before. You're enjoying this even if you want to take a moment to cool down. It's only a few seconds before she pulls away and then grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've won you over, big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver and want to deny that. It can't be that easy for you to fall for a new girl in such a short time; however, the slyness and confidence of Angeline are there but so is your sister's cheekiness. Her personality would be far more playful than Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat and try to change the topic. \"H-how about you tell me your name first and put some clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion smirks and rubs her hand over your back, sending shivers down your spine. \"How does Ellie sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like you really don't need my opinion, but I like it,\" you return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hums, pleased and then without warning, she kisses you again. You groan and your hands move on their own, wrapping around the fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What...am I doing?</i>' you think, wondering why you can't resist as much. When it was Emma, despite acknowledging how beautiful your sisters were together, you couldn't give into their approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, this Ellie is just taking what she wants! What happened to your mother's warning about not pushing on you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's enough! Can we slow down, please!? I...I need time to think! This is...too sudden.\" you break away and gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie lets you go and rolls her eyes. \"Am I not Angeline?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and then furrow your eyebrows. \"W-what do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie crosses her arms and sighs. \"I'm saying that I feel like we've already been together and just went out to the movies. Holding you and embracing you, it feels natural to me as if I had been Angeline this whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but, you're not Angeline,\" you reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie nods. \"...I am and I'm not. In the end, I'm not far off from her but I feel like I can be more daring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs your hand and then smiles slyly with a bit of a blush. \"So...maybe we can go to the bedroom and see just how daring I can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opens as you stare in disbelief. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Grunts come out of your mouth without your consent as you feel a rising pressure growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-ellie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion hums in acknowledgment, finishing up. Closing your eyes, you let go with a shaky breath and groan. To your surprise, Ellie doesn't leave any to waste as she finishes below your eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she giggles and slides up to meet you in bed. With her chest in front of you, she extends her arms around your frame, pulling you to your side and nestling your head between her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh rather content even though you kept questioning whether you're moving forward too fast. It's been an hour since Ellie pulled you to bed and you've entered her at least once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to stop and slow down to think but Ellie's eyes and warm smile wouldn't let you go. In the end, you've left yourself under her care and it's been nothing but sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel her heartbeat, moving according to her feelings. It's not three separate heartbeats, but a single one that seemed to be stronger than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calls to you as she brushes through your hair. You hum in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is she asking that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull away from her chest wondering if your confusion and small bouts of hesitation could be seen during bed. Looking at her, she gazes back with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yes? I think so, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs at your indecisiveness. \"You're weird, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes. \"I'm weird?! Look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. \"Well, I've got my feelings checked out. I comprised of three people who love you dearly and yet you seem to have trouble accepting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...not true,\" you return then blush, \"...you're beautiful and overall, I'm happy but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pursue your lips for a moment as you think, then sigh. \"I just...wished I had more time, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were gradually accepting of Angeline and her love for you which extends off of Arianna and Nicole, but now you're faced with a new woman who involves your sister. You wanted to resist in some ways and you did it before with Emma who just comprised of your sisters, but with this new girl, it felt impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and now, it feels like your cheating even though Angeline is the one who pushed merging with your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a moment, you nod. \"Yeah, I'm weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie giggles and leans forward, kissing you for a few seconds and breaking off evenly as you kiss back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this...let's merge together,\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and continues brushing through your hair. You didn't stop her because it felt really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we merge, I'm sure we can come to an understanding. It's been a while after all, right? Even though we've been connected, we haven't been as close as we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates for a moment before adding. \"To be honest, I don't want to merge so soon. If we merge, it'll be the greatest thing but I won't be able to speak to you like this or hold you. It would feel rather lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I want to sort out our differences so that we're not regretting. I love you...Angeline loves you...everyone here loves you. You've become the center of our world and you should understand that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses before her lips upturns. \"...or we could keep fucking and go on a date tomorrow? Maybe you'll sort yourself out like you had with Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough and laugh hard at her bluntness, but you're sure that if you get to know this woman like you had with Angeline, you'd feel better overall having a relationship with her and Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

She can be pretty adorable too, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you want to understand her and yourself, you voluntarily advance on the fusion. Before, you could only let Ellie take control of the flow and situation only because you weren't sure if you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no doubt that Emily has won in her idea of placating her feelings by fusing with Angeline. You can see some of Angeline still inside of this woman along with a playfulness that you don't necessarily dislike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding your hands across her curves, you shuffle your hips between your legs, putting you into a spooning position. Slowly, your revived lower member enters her and she lets out a small gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurriedly wraps her arms around your back and pulls you to her breasts as you thrust. Groaning as you flush yourself as deeply as possible into her soft skin, you couldn't help yourself to latch on to one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...my baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie couldn't help but let some of her maternal aspects of herself leak out. She leans her head down to kiss you on the head as you grunt with heavy breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace on Ellie's neck soon reacted with her and your desire as it touches you. Like quicksand, you feel your thrusts becoming slower and your body sinking further into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not at all painful. In fact, despite losing some physical senses, the pleasure you feel has suddenly doubled. Ellie's desire can be felt and so can yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you let out your voices and scream in joy, unable to think of each other and instead of what you and she will become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah's eyes twitch as she loses her place in the paragraphs of her chemistry book. The screams of both Ellie and you can be heard plainly and although she tolerated, something appears to be making its peak and she cannot study in this sort of environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from her chair, she exits her room and stomps her way towards your bedroom where she can hear you and Ellie's loud moans. Although she's frustrated, she also feels a tinge of jealousy but she knows she must be stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loves Scott, her little brother and Emily, her little sister. She loves her mother too. In general, she loves and appreciates her whole family and that feeling has only become stronger thanks to the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, perhaps she's mentally stronger because she has goals in her life that she does not plan to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door, she growls. \"Hey! Can you guys take a break at least! I'm studying here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, yours and Ellie's moans end and the whole room becomes quiet...too quiet. It's as if the two people had suddenly disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried now, Rebekah turns on the knob. \"Hey, guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room, you and Ellie are nowhere to be seen however, she hears some noise in the nearby bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing uncertain, Rebekah isn't sure why she's feeling nervous but she pushes forward. \"...Sis? Bro? ...er, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she peaks into the bathroom, a new woman stands near the bathroom who can only be evidently a fusion between her brother and...whatever Ellie is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer a blonde, it would seem Arianna's genes have been finally suppressed although the blue eyes remain. Her form is more petite and her chest size has reduced by a bit, but still overall big and firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c845018/v845018024/144001/13z7xcW_uoU.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://pp.userapi.com/c845018/v845018024/144001/13z7xcW_uoU.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, sis,\" the woman smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...I guess I can't be too surprised,\" Rebekah mumbles to herself and then addresses the fusion, \"...Hi! Would you mind keeping it down? Who are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about that. How does Selena sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah shrugs. \"At this point, I'm going to forget a lot of names. It sounds nice though. So by now, you're comprised of my brother, my sister, my mother, and Arianna, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena hums. \"That's right. Scott needs to sort out his feelings and merging is the best way. That said, I'm the result of their love and it's confusing to me, if I'm honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah raises an eyebrow, interested. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena blushes and looks into the mirror. \"I want to unmerge so everyone can find happiness and understanding in each other, but at the same time, I want to live as myself for a little longer. I too love Scott and everyone, but I can't exactly love myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...well, um...good luck solving your existential crisis, but I can't help you there. Besides, you will have to unmerge sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena closes her eyes and sighs. \"I suppose so, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes and then smiles, opening her arms wide and beckoning Rebekah to come to her. \"...we might as well complete our family now. Let's merge, sis. This can help sort out your feelings too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah widens her eyes and then curls her lips. \"Not that I don't want to, but...isn't this a little risky? For the first time, we have four people fused and if I'm added, it'll be five! How do we know if we're pushing the limit sof the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena shrugs. \"No way to know if we don't try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah grows shaky. \"W-what if we don't unmerge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena provides some consolation. \"I don't think that will happen. Each part of me has something they want to do. Come on, just for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Rebekah do?</span></div></div>",

Luckily, Rebekah had some that would fit her since she's around the same height as her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the bedside of Scott's bed, she takes a look at the necklace she and her comprising parts have held throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I'd...like to meet him and the others somehow</i>,' she wishes, thinking of Scott and the rest that are a part of her existence. She somehow didn't think it was odd to think of herself as an individual. It was the same with Angeline and Ellie. As a fusion, even though they are aware that their existence is connected to other individuals, it doesn't fee like she's beholden to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be very well that she's influenced by them subconsciously, but it's hard to be aware of that since it feels like she 's acting through her own will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, unable to bother Rebekah and not being able to do much unlike her counterparts, it feels rather bittersweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile holding the necklace, she proceeds to read a book until her eyes begin to waver.

It's hard to know where it comes from so you rotate in all directions, only stopping when you see a surprising female running up to you, nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you're nude too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is approaching?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up with a splitting headache, one that causes you to grunt in pain and try to curl into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh hell! This is hell!</i>' you cry out in your mind as you feel your head crackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only issue is that you're immobile and forcing yourself to lift your head, you see that your mother and sister have locked your arms while Arianna is nestled on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is nude of course but you can hardly dwell on that fact or try to figure out what just happened. The first priority is to break free and get some pain medicine, pronto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, you slip your arms away from Nicole and Emily, then roll Arianna to the side causing her to push into Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls start to stir due to your commotion, but you can't bother with them. If anything could be told from their expressions as you whizzed out of bed, they were in for hell too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, just as you exit your room and descend into the kitchen, you start to hear the girls groan and some foul language passed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked but without care, you walk slowly into the kitchen while trying to make sure you didn't slip in your effort to maintain concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding yourself a glass of water and rummaging through the cabinets for Acetaminophen. Once you found your savior, dropping other plastic bottles everywhere in the process, you quickly open it up and fling two capsules in your mouth, then lurch your head back as your swallow with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrinking the entire glass, you find the cold water helping a little and proceed to grab another glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna becomes the first after you to successfully get out of your room and enter the kitchen. Leaning against a wall, she groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh god...this is...bad. I'm in hell...I'm in hell. This was not worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, rather amused but them a sharp pain hits you as a reminder that you haven't recovered and the pills wouldn't take effect immediately. Not wishing to see a fellow comrade in pain, you grab another glass of water and two pills, then give it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe college girl takes the pills and water, not wasting anytime before swallowing. She glances at you with a forced smile as the pressure continued on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank yo-shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curses, grabbing her head and the glass she held would have crashed into the ground had it not been your quick reflexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you take the glass and fill it with more cold water before returning it to the girl. \"Here, it's better you sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna nodded and then curled her lips before she leans forward and pecks you on the lips. You are initially surprised, but you quickly calm and kiss her back with a smile. After everything so far, it shouldn't be surprised to see some affection from the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile rubbing her arm as encouragement, Arianna settles down to the living room couch and then curls into a ball, waiting for the pain pills to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, not feeling quite well yourself but you have to remain strong knowing that your sister and mother are probably in a living hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, they couldn't even make it to the kitchen as both of them were still writhing in your bed. You went ahead and grabbed some glasses of water with some pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn arrival, they desperately took anything they could get and gulped down the pills within seconds at your bedside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them gasps at the same time, refreshed but not yet in the clear of the unexpected hangover. Emily is the first to speak, grabbing her head while one eye is closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...ung....don't get it. Is this because of the strange dream world or the fact we all fused together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widened your eyes at her question and realized she's asking her mother, yet the implications are clear to you. Despite not seeing them, they were somewhere in that strange white void too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I was there too! Where were you guys?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole winces and then waves her hand at you, grunting. \"S-sweetie, not so loud. L-let's talk after we've all recovered, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack your forehead, bashing yourself for being so thoughtless. Seeing that everyone would be able to think better, including yourself, you nod and leave your mother and sister alone in the room as they get their bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, everyone had recovered and lessened their headaches to the point where they could think a bit clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing into some clothes and taking a shower, everyone waits in the living room and an awkward silence slices through the room. Each one of them shifts uncomfortably, especially when you come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips and break the silence. \"Uh...where's Rebekah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole speaks with a dry smile. \"She's gone for a study group during this morning. Truthfully, I'm glad she didn't fuse with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are glad as well that Rebekah declined Selena's offer as it could mean that the splitting headache for everyone would be much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded and then Emily spoke up, causing everyone to flinch. \"So...what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your sister incredulously. After that hangover feeling, you were reluctant to do any further fusion. Before you could open your mouth, Nicole switched topics while clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should talk about that dream world. If I'm not mistaken, it seems we were all in the same white space, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded and you furrow your eyebrows. \"...but I didn't see you guys. I only saw...um...Angeline and Selena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing you hesitate, each female narrowed their eyes at you. Emily is the first to beckon you to continue with a small smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and then shake your head. \"It's not important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily frowns. \"Aw, well...it's okay. It's quite obvious based on your face, you pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>She's calling me a pervert?</i>' you think in disbelief but see that she's clearly teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on our side,\" Arianna spoke up, \"...I met up with Nicole and Emily and surprisingly Elle. We figured you might be somewhere, but we couldn't find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you, Angeline, and Selena weren't loud enough,\" Emily quips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily!\" Nicole calls out disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily glances away, but you can see a tiny blush on your cheeks and a small pout. You really don't want to think on what her expression means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what I've learned from talking with Elle is that our fusion forms are more separate than we thought,\" Arianna explained, shuffling her legs together. She held a cup of tea in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't figure out any other explanation either and it's difficult for you to conjure any implications this knowledge might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole hesitates before staring into your eyes with a small blush on her face, \"...I truly enjoyed being Angeline. I know this is strange as I'm your mother but...thank you, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your mother's words cause you to blush. The more you look at her, the more you notice how much better her complexion is. It's like she shed five years off her age and either that's just because she's feeling happier than she's ever felt before or the necklace is working its magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turns a little red and drops her cheeky act, growing serious. \"Scott, me too. Thank you for loving all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd rather not think about it too much but hearing such honest feelings makes you doubt less the events that occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Arianna, Nicole, and Emily, you force the words out of your mouth. \"I...love you all too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look at each other, then giggle to themselves causing you feel more self-conscious. Quickly wanting to return to the matter on hand, you clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I guess we should take a break, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are the girls' response?</span></div></div>",

Isn't it too soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna is rather surprised by Emily's request as well; however, having merged with her, she can understand Emily's feelings. With approval, she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily expresses her gratitude. With the weekend coming to an end, she doesn't want to waste time embracing her desire to not only merge but being with her brother without the sense of moral responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole frowns, feeling a little jealous now. She too feels a little uncomfortable not being merged but she bears with it knowing that she can't ignore her own life and duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loves her son, now more than ever but she can't exactly approach him the same way as she is now. She understands what Emily is feeling and going through right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, Arianna...I'd like to remind you that we should all take Scott's feelings into account as well. If you're merging just for him, then that would be a little selfish wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Nicole says that, she knows she isn't one to talk. When the time comes, she couldn't back down from merging with Arianna despite her son's initial discomfort and conflicted emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna and Emily look at each other, hum and then stare at you with expectant eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel suddenly pressured but you have no doubt that if they were to merge, it would produce a beautiful fusion and you could get along with that girl easily if history is to be accounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying it as non-committal as possible, the two girls smiled widely and then giggle towards one another in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the amusement park then!\" Emily suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna isn't against the idea as she sighs. \"That sounds wonderful actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, feeling left out, tries to bury her emotions and coughs. \"You two can merge after we eat breakfast. Then, I want you back here before it gets too late. Both of you have your own school and I need to make sure I have time to drop off Arianna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls hum and respond at the same time, \"Yes, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna pauses and blinks a few time before blushing as she realized her error. \"A-ah, I mean...Thanks, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole feels rather uplifted by the pleasant accident and chuckles. \"Dear, you don't have to worry. In a way, you're part of our family now so you're like a daughter to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna lowers her head in embarrassment but hums with a small smile. \"Um...thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, taking in this sight. '<i>She's...actually quite cute.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's definitely a far cry from when she threatened your mother to merge although, you had a feeling that was the necklace corrupting. Now that there's an embracement of the necklace and understanding of one another, you can perhaps see why someone would want to date her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the plan set, Nicole prepares breakfast for everyone. Given that you were going out, you rechanged into something more suitable and while Emily and Arianna were in another room preparing, you see your mother staring absent-mindedly into the television as it plays some drama. It doesn't appear she's really paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, feeling like there's an elephant in the room that needs to be discussed. Taking your mother's feelings into consideration started this whole thing as you didn't want her to be hurt. Now, it feels like you need to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blinks and then snaps out of her stupor, then forcing a smile towards her son. \"Oh! You look quite handsome there, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush but not letting yourself get distracted, you press on. \"Mom, no matter what, I just want to let you know that I love you. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles sadly and then turns off the television with the remote with a sigh. \"I...I know this is fucked up, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her being up front, you widen your eyes and step forward. \"N-no! It's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, you don't have to cover for my selfish feelings,\" she interrupts with a hand raised, \"...I want to say that these emotions are brought on because of the necklace, but I sometimes wonder if that's false and I'm just a...horrible mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you shout, not wanting to see her wallow, \"...you're not horrible! You raised all of us and I...I couldn't be more proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole lip's curl and her eyes warm, \"Sweetie, thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then shivers and hugs herself, emitting a deep sigh before continuing. \"...but I'm...scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nods. \"Being with you as Angeline felt like a dream that I didn't want to wake up from. Even if Angeline and the other fusions exist more individually than we thought, it doesn't feel like we're completely separate. I've had the thought to throw everything away in my life to become Angeline. She can provide you more love and care than I can ever hope for. As I am right now, I'm just your mother but as Angeline, I'm more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself shake and you could understand her completely well; however, you couldn't let her despair like this. Forcing yourself to move forward, you give her a surprise hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sweetie,\" she shakes, her hands sliding over your back and her voice cracking, \"...please don't worry. I'm strong, I promise! I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently pecked her on the lips, causing any further words to fall. Pulling away while your face deepens red, you hoped that would ease some of the discomfort she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole lets out a shaky breath and stares at you, her face conflicted but she smiles easier now as her heart relaxes. Both of you struggle to say something but ultimately, Nicole speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, wondering if you did the right thing but seeing your mother relax more, you feel like your actions are justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActions speak louder than words and no matter how wrong, you couldn't allow your only mother to let her existence be second to a fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...\" you begin, trying to find the right words, \"...my only mother and you can't be replaced. Believe me, I won't allow it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole feels tears welling her eyes and she rubs it, trying to laugh it off. \"You...look at what you did! You're making your mother cry here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and hug her once more, feeling a small weight gone on your shoulders now. Breaking this touching moment though, you clear someone new clear her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, you and Nicole turn to face a new girl who is standing near the doorway with an expectant smile. Once more, you feel your breath taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wallsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Helga-Lovekaty-Desktop-for-iphone.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://wallsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Helga-Lovekaty-Desktop-for-iphone.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your reaction, the obvious fusion between Arianna and Emily hums, satisfied. \"Well, I was going to ask how I look, but I guess there's no need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take into her form, you could only comment on one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...I figured you'd be blonde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion widens her eyes incredulously. \"Seriously? Is me not being a blonde a problem?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head quickly and stutter. \"N-n-no! I mean, all the other fusions up until Selena were blonde, so I figured that Arianna would dominate in that regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion chuckles at such minor detail. \"Who knows how the necklace determines our forms. Now, let's not waste any time here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being older and more mature, Nicole could feel her young spirit rising as she pouts in jealousy. She tugs on her son's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember sweetie, Angeline is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, the fusion scoffs. \"Oh screw you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the disrespect, Nicole laughs and then shoos you and the fusion away. \"Just go you two. Have fun...but not too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling self-conscious now that your in the midst of another beauty, you try to not to freak out or grin stupidly as you approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels as if the fusion could see through you though as she smirks and takes your hand, pulling you closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp in response as she flushes against you and presses her lips upon yours. Letting out a pleasant grunt, your stupid grin reveals itself as she breaks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself now,\" the fusion begins with a twinkle in her eyes, \"...I'm Emila. Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmila...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat the name in your head and then nod dumbly as she locks her hand with yours. On her other hand, she has the keys to your father's car. It would seem she's taking it upon herself to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst impressions matter and Emila definitely didn't fall behind in that aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore closing the front door, Emila calls out to Nicole. \"Oh, I left the necklace in Emily's room by the way! Maybe you can spend some time with Rebekah when she gets back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gasps and widens her eyes. \"N-no, how could I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door closes before she could finish and she frowned in dismay. Jealousy begins to fill her as she wanted to go with the amusement park with you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head silly, Nicole sighs. '<i>What am I, in my twenties? Get it together, Nicole. Let's just clean up the house for a bit then maybe take another nap. Ugh...I feel like the pain medicine is starting to wear off.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having arrived at a popular amusement park, you find Emila just as dreamy as the other fusions. It occurs to you that between every fusion so far during this weekend, your inhibitions towards them have been low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, despite Emila being a half-sister to you, she doesn't feel like she's related to you at all. The same goes for Angeline who despite retaining some of that maternal personality, she too doesn't feel like your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna and potentially other strangers might provide the catalyst in suppressing that sort of familial aura. Honestly, it's hard to gauge whether or not it has nothing to do with Arianna presence and only changes in yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you thinking about?\" Emila asks, her head nestled on your shoulder as she grazes your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, you bring her in closer to you as you watch the sky grow bigger and then smaller. At the moment, she and you are on a Ferris wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" you answer, not wanting to spoil the mood with your ever-growing curiosity of the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmila hums, not satisfied. She draws her finger along your stomach causing you to jump and try to suppress your own giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, cut that out!\" you gasp as the fusion laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she begins, drawing her face closer and sneaks in a kiss which you accept gratefully, \"...even though we're not merged, I'd like us to be open to each other's thoughts and worries just as if we had exchanged our minds with each other. Besides, at this moment, I'm your girlfriend, right? Don't you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirlfriend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like such a happy dork to hear that from this beautiful girl. If she weren't a product of the necklace, you might never have the confidence to approach her or any of the fusions for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her persuasion is top notch or because you can't resist her charms, you give in to her easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you begin, \"...I was just thinking that between you, Angeline, Ellie, and even Selena, I haven't felt truly uncomfortable around any of you. When I think of how I tried to resist Emma's approach, I wonder if Arianna is the reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmila hums, suddenly conflicted now as you revealed your thoughts. Thinking on it, she gives her own opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think that's bad. I'd like it if there weren't any boundaries between a fusion and you, but if it means Arianna becomes part of our family, I'm for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks and kisses you again, causing your mind to fog. \"Silly, because then I can exist to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, then try to cough the feeling of embarrassment as her words struck you deep. Ending on that note, you hear the Ferris wheel operator call through intercoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, folks! That's a wrap! Hope you enjoyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Emila is rather disappointed and then sees the sun beginning to set. Time really flies when you're having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her disappointment, you try to cheer her up. \"Hey, we can go on one more ride at least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the cart, you and Emily ignore the bewildered and jealous stares of those waiting in line. Thinking, Emila suddenly stops and then smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...I do have one ride I'd like to try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes and feel an auspicious delight about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final ride begins in the parking lot as your father's car begins to creak. Inside, you and Emila become one in the best way possible without the power of the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of your lap with her bottom sufficiently flushed your crotch, she bounces while producing sweet breaths. While your hips move on their own, you take pleasure in wrapping your arms around her petite form and burying into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Scott! Yes! I love you! I love you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her affection, the result of many fusions and pleasant memories cause you to gasp and your mind to cloud so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding out your best, eventually, both you and she reach the climax and your voices sync together as you groan loudly inside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose passing by on the outside could easily hear the noises even if the windows were tinted. It was obvious what is going on and especially those with families made sure to steer clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Emila suggested this final \"ride\", you wanted to chicken out as you worried about getting into trouble. This sort of near-public affection could only be called risky and you had a feeling it was brought on through your sister's influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you couldn't resist the fusion and the opportunity to dig in just as you had with the rest of the fusion girls. After ten minutes, both you and Emila finally finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, she kisses you deeply for several long seconds before getting off of you.

Staring out in the window, her face fills with pain at the thought of the company party she attended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt unreal, but the conflicting emotions in her heart proved that it was real. In just a few hours, she had learned to appreciate her new son who had become smarter thanks to the incident. While he couldn't speak, his eyes were filled with understanding everywhere he looked. He cried less and although he couldn't control certain aspects, it was getting better at an abnormal rate thanks to the awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her, she also found a new love for Scott...one that cherished him as the one responsible for gifting such a beautiful perspective for her and her baby boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis presence became like a brother to Chris and...she wanted him to join her family on an official level. She could become his mother...and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt its peak, that desire had costed her and only after a day of wallowing and getting through the aftereffects of the necklace did she realize she went overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did she not chase after them? After all, she had memories of their address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was only her, she might have chased them like a madwoman but thankfully, Chris reminded her that she couldn't ignore what bond she already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...she couldn't forget about them. Even though how she went about forcing the marriage of their family was wrong, she still wanted to integrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she decided she had to act carefully. She had to find the right opportunity to appeal to Scott, Nicole, and their family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Chris who was suckling quietly, she smiled warmly at him and cooed. \"Don't worry, baby...our lives will become more complete. Isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris giggled incoherently as if acknowledging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between her workdays as a receptionist and taking time off, she would drive by their house and monitor their movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe understood she was stalking, but she wasn't sure she should be walking up to the door and knocking...no, not after what she has done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf preferrable, she wanted to find time to meet with either Nicole or Scott alone, but there wasn't much opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she found herself watching what could only be Scott and another girl making out in their car. Although it was hard to see, there was no doubt what was going on with the rocking movements of their vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at least glad she left Chris with his nanny. The one thing she swore to herself was to at least protect him better given she made some irresponsible decisions in the past. Merging with Nicole for those few minutes had given her some insight into being a proper mother, which she'll always be grateful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that though, she was feeling rather jealous of what was going on. It might be wrong...disgusting even, but she wanted to be in that place with Scott. The feelings were complex, but the necklace left her wanting some form of bonding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited patiently as the sun was drawing down when suddenly the door opens. The woman got out saying something incomprehensible given her distance, but it looked like the girl was going to come back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widen. This might be her only chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car, she stopped from shutting the door to notice gleaming on the girl's neck as she traveled across the parking lot. Her heart beat as a familiar sensation filled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>The necklace!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt which meant that girl had to be a fusion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lips, Gina had a choice.

In that case, leaving her with Gina will be dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also an emotional response. Even though you thought you could forget her, seeing her now makes you reminded of your bond with her. Even though what she did was wrong...you were even worse for nearly following along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you step out. Although you were nervous, you felt emotions bottling up that would explode if you didn't face her properly. You'd definitely not be able to sleep if you tried to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, um...hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou greet her awkwardly and tried to ignore the fact that she could've had her eyes on you for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina fidgets. \"Scott, I'm...sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that came out of her mouth wasn't an equal awkward greeting but a straight-to-the-point apology. Seeing her expression filled with regret and sadness, you couldn't hang on either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I'm the one who should be sorry! I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlurting out so suddenly, Gina was surprised as she blinked but quickly regained her composure. Almost losing it, you hold yourself back and grow red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence descended between you two before Gina forced a laugh. \"What's done is done, right? There are also things I have to thank you and your mother for. My relationship with Chris has become much better. Before meeting you, I was filled with stress and anxiety but...I've come to enjoy being a new mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah, that's good,\" you answer, forcing a smile, then look behind her. \"Uhm...did you bring your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina shakes her head. \"I left him with his nanny. Moreover, I wasn't sure if meeting you like this would be safe but I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath, shakes, but resolves herself. \"...I had to meet you. Scott, I...these feelings inside me won't go away. When I see you, I...I feel like I'm seeing a long-lost son of mines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gina...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sympathetic and understand that it wasn't her fault. The necklace affects everyone differently and brings out emotions that don't seem to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina shakes. \"I...I'd like you to give me another chance. What I did was wrong, but my intentions...I want our families to be closer. I can't help it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath, then gulp. Unsure of what to say, you only stare dumbly at her, trying to formulate a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you thought back, you had to accept your actions. Angeline and the other fusions helped you understand yourself better in regard to the bonds that develop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I wanted that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmitting it to yourself, the sensation of being bonded with Gina and then having her fuse with your mothers brought a scary acceptance that haunted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope fills Gina and she stepped forward. \"Then-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you raise a hand to stop her. \"...W-we can't do things willy-nilly though! I...I've decided that we can't lose ourselves in the process of bonding. So, I can't make any decision by myself...no, I refuse to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina pauses and hearing your honest feelings, she could admire it. Taking a step back, she sighs. \"I understand as well. Then, we can take things in step, can't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuirking your eyebrow, you looked on at her expectantly as if she had a plan in mind. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina hums. \"I...owe your mother an apology. If I could meet her even if she rejects, I'd be satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understood. If you thought about it, you and your mother gave Arriana a second chance which turned out producing a beautiful batch of fusions. If that were to mean anything, then it might not be far to see Gina truly integrated with their family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice breaks in between the mood and you see Emilia back, staring at Gina with suspicion. At first, Gina remained silent, unsure how to react but soon Emilia widens her eyes as her aggregated memories recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you're Gina, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia smiles, her expression friendly. \"Emilia...I'm a fusion of Scott's best sister and Arianna...you know? The one who you were going to eat up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay...maybe not so friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina froze. She took a step back. \"I-I wasn't myself. I just wanted to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her shaking, you felt the need to intervene. \"Emilia, it's fine. We both regretted some things and she had a lot of time to reflect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia crosses her arms and rolls her eyes. \"Whatever. Let's just leave her, okay? She's not part of our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips, then decide.</span></div></div>",

Also, Arianna also forced our hands, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia widens her eyes, shocked. She wanted to argue but had nothing to refute given how things indeed turned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing, you stare at Gina who couldn't help but avert her eyes. \"It's not my total decision, but since she was already influenced by the necklace, I want to give her a chance as well...just like we did with Arianna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia sighs, \"So what? We're going to add another person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina finally speaks up, not willing to play the third wheel like this.

At least, I would like to leave with a good conscience on my mind, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gina only wanted to tie loose ends, something deep in you was perhaps desiring more. This line of thought is quickly squashed by you though, knowing it might not be any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me call mom. Maybe...you could join us for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina blinks, surprised by the offer but she shakes her head. \"I don't want to impose, Scott! I want to apologize for your mother, but that doesn't mean it has to be now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia agrees and grabs your arm, stopping you from picking up your phone. You are about to protest until you see her pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bites her lips, then lowers her voice. \"Scott, I get it. You...feel something right? For this woman? As a fusion with Arianna, I admit it, okay? I'm glad that Arianna wasn't shunned because that means I can be with you in this world. I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates and sighs. \"...it just feels like, the family plus Arianna is becoming a little more stable. I'm worried that if we bring her into this mix, it'll become more unstable. Aren't you concerned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips and nod. \"I am, but...both Arianna and Gina had time to adjust after the effects of the necklace. We all did, in fact. Something is telling me it'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia hesitates before glancing at Gina, clearly troubled yet undeniably hopeful too. Even though she didn't want to impose, she knew she'd feel at least better at night knowing that she at least apologized to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, Emilia lets go of you and crosses her arms. \"Fine, do what you want but let's not waste too much time...after all, my time here is limited as you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, Arianna couldn't stay at their house as she had university studies. You give a sad smile before calling your mother. Gina tried to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press her to wait at least. Now that you met Gina, you don't want this to be delayed. The sight of her was enough to rekindle bonds created by the necklace and you might end up losing sleep just as she did if you prolonged this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sweetie, hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sounds a little frantic on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just woke up from a strange dream...yes, that's it. Forget about that, is everything okay with you and um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emilia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Nicole grunt and sigh. It would appear keeping track of the fusions is beginning to strangle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your sister and Arianna, right? Everything is alright? You two should be coming home by now. I have to drop off Arianna soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum. \"Right, but um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at Gina who stood uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, we met Gina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear silence from the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gina? N-no, are you okay?! I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom, hold on!\" you cut off before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...wants to apologize. Maybe I can put you on speaker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-apologize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment of silence, before you hear her hum affirmatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly put in the spotlight, Gina is shocked but can't do anything to prepare as you place the phone on speaker and she hears Nicole's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumbling for a bit, Gina finally found her footing as she let in a breath of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole! I'm...I'm sorry for approaching your son, but...I want to apologize to you and him. Trying to force myself upon you was inexcusable and for that, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, you add. \"Mom, I've already accepted her apology but...she's not at fault compared to how I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie,\" Nicole's firm voice rang causing you to flinch, \"...you've blamed yourself enough; I get it. Gina, I will also apologize to you for how things went...after all, <i>I</i> was the one who allowed my son to merge with the first person in that bathroom at the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina freezes then let out a breath of relief. She felt like crying but held on. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like some of the weight on her shoulder will have eased. Now for perhaps the hard part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this may be sudden but...maybe we can invite her for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, this might be a more reluctant case but you had a stronger bond to this woman than Nicole did. To both you and Gina's surprise though, Nicole agreed easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...I think that's for the best if we all got together and talked things through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some silence between you and Gina, Nicole asked. \"Is that alright with you, Gina? I know you have a baby to take care of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's fine! Thank you! I'll bring my son along as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 180 in attitude surprised you, but considering she had been hoping to meet in person, it seems she would gladly take the offer now that it was available to her despite thinking she might be imposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole let out a chuckle, \"Alright then. We'll be glad to have you! Scott, Emilia...come home safely, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, we will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reassuring, you end the call and look at Gina who was a great happier than she had been before. It just showed how much the necklace bonds she had been forcefully removed from had been eating at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your hands suddenly, you gasp but couldn't pull away as Gina held them warmly. \"Scott...thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her smile, you blush a little, then cough. \"Um yeah. We both should get going. I don't think I need to tell you our address, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina chuckles. \"Of course. I'll be there in a couple hours! Thanks again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young latino mother leaves with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back with a sigh, you catch Emilia staring at you, peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just can't be satisfied with us, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, you play dumb and enter back into the driver's seat of the car. \"Not sure what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia uncrosses her arms and scoffs, leaving it at that as she walks the other side.</span></div></div>",

Her heart beats frantically with anxiety and yet...excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange dream she had was none other than the same void she shared with her other children, except all of the fusions she and Arianna were a part of had come together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather odd...but fun. They played some cards while talking about life, their existence, the necklace, and various theories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Angeline, Ellie, and Selena being fusions, they had as much clue as their family regarding the necklace. Where had it come from? Who had used it before? What will their family life be like from now on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne big question was whether if there were more fusions in this strange mindscape. The commonality between all three of them was Arianna of course, but why would only their branch exist so far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena appeared to have more insight given she composed of Scott, one who had questioned the most...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe...we can exist because we've been accepted? I feel like Arianna and your family will remain close from now on, so we'll come back in some form again, I'm sure.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena's words in the shared mindscape struck a cord with Nicole, one who had been struggling all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Acceptance</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly, she had accepted Arianna despite what she did. In such a short time, the girl became almost like a daughter to her. Another reason perhaps is thanks to her son's acceptance and the love that came about between him and Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to that, she almost wanted to merge with Arianna forever, just so she could exist as a girl and relive this feeling of love, one that just felt...right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would mean losing herself. What about Daniel? What about being a <i>true</i> mother to her son and daughters? Angeline would never be able to take on that role because of Arianna and her feelings for Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while she could accept the fusions and Arianna who had blessed the newfound life, she had to...no, she <i>must</i> coexist along them for the sake of her family...and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, leading up to the problem that she is beginning to regret: Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she may have forgiven Gina, only because she couldn't blame her, there is a part of her who is scared to completely accept her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the feeling when Gina forcefully fused with her and then, \"her\" words to Scott:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Scott, my son\u2026 I feel whole again. I will be your new mom</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that moment, she could feel her son's unwillingness to accept this change but it didn't last too long. She could see it in his eyes that after becoming part of Gina, he wanted it...he wanted this new perfect mother. Compared to Angeline, the desire and love that formed was much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone, Nicole could never be this perfect mother and she certainly couldn't be someone like Angeline either. Perhaps that's why she slowly felt herself swaying...nearly mentally merging with Gina so it would be all finalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Scott pulled away from his selfishness, bringing Nicole back into the world. Still, he blamed himself, but knowing the joy of merging and beauty of these fusions, she couldn't blame him. Perhaps that's why, Nicole thought it would be best to invite Gina over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugs herself and shivers, staring into the hallway leading to their front door. Curling her lips, she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did I make a mistake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps wondering until the door knocks where her son and Emilia comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some reluctance to part, but not nearly as bad as previous fusions. Nicole watched as her daughter and Arianna split inside of Emily's room given the likelihood of one of them being naked. As she watched them unmerged, she wondered if she would see Emilia in the mindscape next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibility that there would be more names to remember made her sweat a little, but she decided against thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing out as if being reborn, Arianna slid to the floor nude and coughed while Emily swayed a little, but remained on her feet with the dress of the former fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole quickly moved to support Arianna. \"Sweetie, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe college girl coughs again, then stands back up on her own, waving Nicole off. \"I'm...fine...Just dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked to be stabilizing much quicker and blinked a few times before she pouts. \"This sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna simply laughs as she goes to take back up her clothes left on the couch. She understood Emily as if she were still a part of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun, but your mom is right. I do have classes tomorrow and so do you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having the stamina to argue, Emily let it go and washes up in her bathroom leaving Nicole and Arianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lips, Nicole asks worriedly. \"Will you be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna hums as she pulls up her underwear and slips on her previous jeans before turning her head towards the mother. She gives a crooked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll manage. Don't worry. That said, I really wish I could stay for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole curls her lips, wishing as well but she knows that it might be dangerous, especially since Gina would be arriving soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Arianna understood this as well but seeing Nicole's reaction, she provided some reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'll be fine with Gina, Nicole. With your daughter, Emilia was a little harsh, but I'm thankful for having the chance to be with your family. Gina looks like she would feel the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Arianna. Truly, being with you has become one of the happiest moments in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna blushes a little and then clears her throat. \"It was mine as well. Scott too...he was lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt proud and ashamed suddenly. Not wanting to dwell on memories fused, Nicole cleared her throat and left the room. \"I'll be out in the car when you're ready, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna hums in response, watching the mother close the door behind her. Only a few seconds after she finishes changing, Emily busts out of the restroom crying, clinging to Arianna who quickly became like another sister to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don't want you to leave so soon! This really sucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna laughs nervously as she tried to pry off Emily. \"I-It'll be okay! We'll find some other time real soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't stop Emily from wailing comically and preventing Arianna from leaving the house by a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

Immediately, she sweats but takes a deep breath, forcing herself to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's the one who agreed to inviting her. Just like with Arianna, Nicole knew she had to resolve any lingering feelings. Although Gina might have calmed, she had knowledge of the necklace. They had to at least agree to keep the nature of this necklace a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her home, her heart beats slightly nervously. The feeling of her body being taken over, no control, and nearly losing her mind to Gina still stuck with her. Just thinking about it makes her equally guilty for taking over Arianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home!\" she calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her eldest daughter, Rebekah call out, Nicole enters the family room where she sees everyone sitting at the couch. The necklace lies on the coffee table in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Nicole thinks it's risky to put such a powerful item in front of Gina, she sees the young mother wasn't too focused on it. Rather, her attention was all on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up with her baby in her arms, she lets out a silent gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles wryly, but knows she can't let her inner feelings go on display. Rather, she sees the mother a little shaken and it's clear she was unsure how to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a mother herself and her maternal instincts kicking in, she opened her arms and hugged the woman, to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's fine,\" Nicole whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina takes a shaky breath before she places one hand around Nicole's back and keeping her baby, Chris close to her. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nicole and Gina caught up with what occurred after they separated, you and your sisters began to look at the baby Chris intrigued and worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby stood tall and proud, pointing at a block of numbers they had in their closet. He could understand their words and they were testing in him with simple arithmetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a problem, the baby pointed at a number or flipped the block to the correct number without fail after each one of them asked them a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took a breath and leaned back. \"Wow, this is...kinda scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he became a genius after fusing with this guy?\" Rebekah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, rather guilty because you had encouraged it when you were fused with Gina. \"It looks like it. I think we gain more than memories, but we can also increase our knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah hums, then nods. \"Well, that makes sense. I mean, our knowledge comes from memories. That means you guys have my knowledge too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this, Emily widens her eyes. \"W-wait! Th-then, doesn't this mean I can pass my class easily? You were an honors student, Rebekah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Rebekah has an idea and stand up. \"Here, let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping away for a moment, she then brought out an assignment of hers in her college statistics class. Quickly, Emily pulls away. \"N-no wait-I'd rather not do any math right now! It's my worst subject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah smirks, \"Well, if knowledge is shared, I think it'll become your best subject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing the paper on her, Emily reluctantly views it and you slide by her, interested if you might understand some of the problems on this assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Emily's eyes slowly widen with astonishment. The expression causes Chris to enter a fit of giggles and even Rebekah to curl her lips in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, I...I can understand this shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're cleared!\" you agree, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah clears her throat. \"Hey, don't get too cocky! This is MY knowledge you guys leached off of...all of my hard studies. It's unfair really. I haven't gained anything from you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, oh sister!\" Emily lets go of the paper and hugs her sister, now faithfully worshiping her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's merge after this, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say things like that so casually! I've got exams tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch your sisters banter, then focus your attention on Chris who looks intrigued at Rebekah's assignment left on the ground. Quickly, you pull it away causing the baby to whimper, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we're not trying to make you a super genius here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris huffs rather cutely, then half walks before crawling back to his mother. Gina picks him up and holds him closely as she continues talking with Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to be honest Nicole, I did dream once where I met Erica. It was strange to see a form of yourself and unfortunately, I can't remember what we talked about. I never had seen as many fusions as you had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina smiles sadly, rather jealous. She tries to hide it, but Nicole picks it up. \"Answer me honestly, Gina. Do you still want to merge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina hesitates before glancing at you. Embarrassed, you turn away, returning to your conversation with your sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina sighs and equally returns her attention to Nicole. \"I do...but I don't mean to force it! I get these...aches sometimes, making me want to merge with you or your son, but after a day, I'm perfectly able of controlling myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole bites her lips, then speaks more softly. \"I get it, Gina. If it weren't for my son, I'd...probably not be here speaking with you. To become another person is just a free feeling...but we can't let this get to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't rejected the necklace either though,\" Gina points out, \"...and it seems that you and your son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina didn't outright say it, but Nicole understood, taking a deep breath. \"Maybe it's just an excuse for my own sanity, but I didn't do anything...rather, I had become a different person when I was with Arianna. It didn't even bother Angeline that she might be his mother, she just...easily loved him more than I could as if she was unbound. It's a relieving feeling, but coming back...I know our family won't be the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole waves her hand. \"It's fine! Our family is working it out somehow and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Nicole holds Gina's hand. \"...I'd like to work it out with you as well, Gina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying, as long as we agree that we'll unfuse, if you really want to fuse with me, we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina takes a shaky breath and breaks away from Nicole's hands. She holds Chris more firmly. \"But...what if I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles. \"I think it'll be better this time. We all have a good understanding of the necklace and I'd rather not let you struggle with this for too long. Before that though, I want my son and daughters to agree as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina breathes in, trying to calm herself down as she feeling her heart beating excitedly. \"I...of course! Nicole, I'm so grateful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pats the young mother on the shoulder, then goes in to tickle Chris in her arms, her motherly instincts rising as she sees Chris giggle and swat her finger playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's discuss this later. I think my stew is ready now,\" Nicole hums as she stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, Nicole discusses to her children the desire to bring Gina into the family just as they did with Arianna. Generally, what was the consensus?</span></div></div>",

In turn, you flinch. Although it was apparent that inviting Gina here meant that there could be fusing, to see it was going to occur started to make you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott,\" Nicole addresses firmly, \"...I know that things have been...awkward between us, but becoming part of Angeline and being with you was a dream and you accepted it so well. It made me feel so happy, even if I still feel guilt now after the fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom, this isn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is different though,\" Nicole cuts off, \"...Gina affects you differently and it might be due to how you became a mother yourself. Even if you don't want to admit it, I can see that she has made you more comfortable than I've seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips quiver, but you don't say anything. In the awkward silence, Rebekah coughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we expect? I guess this will make Chris our new baby brother? How will you and Scott...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina blushes and lowers her head. \"I'm not sure. Back then, I desired Scott to be my n-next son after being one with him. He and I were a pair and took care of our...I mean, my baby that I felt...a bond with him. I'm not so sure now though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily whistles, grinning. \"Let's assume things will remain pretty strange in terms of relationships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah nudges her sister and glares at her. \"That's not something I want to hear from you, of all people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shrugs. \"I think it'll be okay, regardless of what happens. I mean, our dear brother and Angeline are already an item, so it can't get any worse than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah narrows her eyes. \"You're forgetting someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turns away, feigning ignorance. While this talk was going on, you couldn't stand it anymore and stood up from your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm going to h-head back to my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get away, afraid of how even more twisted your family will end up. Yet, you couldn't take back your consent. Your mother is right, you felt something instinctual with Gina, both pure and twisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Scott!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Nicole's worried voice, but you didn't turn as you left the table, quickly closing yourself up in your room so you could think more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, you'd get used to it just like you got used to Arianna joining with your mother and sister. Although there was a tiny bit of guilt for taking advantage of your family, it never felt like you were doing something unforgivable. Rather, Arianna felt like the catalyst that made things feel okay; as if there wouldn't be any consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina might be like that too, but this is a young mother, not a college girl who was only a few years older than you. Things would naturally turn out differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door causes you to gasp, then you notice that Gina had come up to you alone. Feeling obligated to address her as a guest, you allow her to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Gina's nervousness in her voice, but she also sounded so hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering, you see the latina girl and in the background, you hear Chris in the background giggling as your sisters played with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, if you don't want this, it'll be okay. I...I don't want you to hate me. If this feels uncomfortable, I'll just leave. Thanks to you, it's already enough that I was able to sort things out and talk honestly with you and Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips, before sighing. \"I...I'm worried obviously, but...I'm willing to try just like how things turned out with Arianna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina smiles easily, her heart singing. A little of her maternal affection for you leaks out as she breathes. \"Sweetie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow embarrassed and on cue, Nicole comes in, then slowly closes your door. \"Scott-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you quickly interrupt, knowing she's worried and steeled your heart, \"...l-let's just get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was taken aback, but seeing her son's eyes, she nodded and took out the necklace from her pocket before facing Gina. </span></div></div>",

Having witnessed Arianna and your mother merge for the first time and momentarily looking like a ghoul which scared the living shit out of you, the imagery has caused some fear of seeing future fusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't be able to stop yourself from seeing this one however and while not as grotesque, there was something disturbing as you watched Gina and Nicole blend together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was their heads as their faces flew into each other, becoming abstract and less defined as their hair dissolved. Despite the lack of mouths, you could hear Gina and Nicole's moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking its magic, the necklace then pushed together the rest of their bodies. Either still aware or the doing of the necklace, Gina and Nicole wrapped their arms around each other. Slowly, you could see the clothes of the two women being stripped by the same invisible force that pushed them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sc...ott...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice croaked from the amorphous flesh being, a blend of Gina and Nicole. You tug on the bed, unable to stop staring as your heart beats faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully together, yet with no definitions, you flinch as the merged flesh of the two suddenly slam into the wall, then drip down into a puddle of goo with no end to the moans of pleasure between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the first time you saw the foundation completely lose itself. They were both at a perfect point where they could start reforming, yet they suddenly went kamikaze!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What the...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unsettling feeling inside of you grew, now regretting allowing yourself to give into these emotions of desire. It was obviously too late to stop anything though as the fleshy puddle that is your mother and Gina let out another groan in sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you hear Gina's voice...not aloud but within your mind, echoing without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Yes...yes! Nicole, your memories...I feel them...oh...your family is so...warm.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver, wondering what's going on. There's no answer, but you feel a higher sense of awareness to both Gina and Nicole...having been a part of them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Our sons...daughters...are beautiful</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you hear Nicole's voice, hearing affection from her so rare that you had to do a double-take. This only makes you grow even more worried about the merging process which is becoming more bizzare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I have to move...this is getting crazy! Move Scott!</i>' you scream in your head, wanting nothing more than to bolt out of the door before witnessing what might come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if hearing your voice, both Nicole and Gina called to you in your head and in sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Where are you going, sweetie?</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp, then look to the puddle which had disappeared in your moment of distraction. You feel power returning to your legs and try to move, but then a shadow entered your range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet frozen again, you feel your body being pressed and suddenly pushed to your bed. Before you could scream, something slithered over your mouth and between the creases of your clothes, removing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it's the blob that is your mother and Gina, you panic and try to wriggle free but it's futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Shh....it's okay...oh...my sweet son...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Gina and Nicole's voice again, but more melded now. Mentally, they were almost there to completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't match any sort of beautiful form you expected and instead felt like something out of a horror film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to scream, you let out a weak gasp as your view is covered in darkness by the both of them in their undefined, yet malleable form. Enveloped by them, you start to hear something familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ba-thump...ba-thump</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh...it's a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo loud, yet oddly soothing, your mind tries to recall this familiar feeling. It's almost as if you are in...a womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you're just hallucinating or perhaps you're just unconscious and dreaming. Either way, you hold no more power to struggle and let yourself relax to the beating heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sensation you could feel before your mind drifts completely is a soothing warm hand on your forehead, traveling through your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you find yourself...</span></div></div>",

To your further surprise, you see Angeline adjusting her hair from behind, then smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVnAzNnVMAAJQAb.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVnAzNnVMAAJQAb.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrow and the edges of her lips turn to form a smirk. The dumbfounded look on your face explains everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, then shake your head. You couldn't even form words to express your confusion. You were certain that you were in the middle of witnessing Nicole and Gina's merging which really went south...or at least you thought so. Now, you're at some beach with Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you could see some buildings in the distance. It appears you are in some sort of coastal city. The next thing you also notice is that aside from the ambient noises and the ocean, it's oddly quiet. There wasn't anyone on the beach except for you and Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline hums, then giggles. \"How about you first guess where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...California? Did I just get drugged and flew away here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beauty laughs, then shakes her head. More serious this time, she stands up and gazes out to the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the same dream-land that is created from the necklace, Scott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes, then stand up as well, taking in the world around you in more detail. While you couldn't believe it as it felt so real, there were also odd details that you couldn't ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo people on this perfect sunny day, no apparent cars driving in the distance. It appears just solemn and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline doesn't answer immediately as she frowns, then stares at you bitterly. \"Well, it sort of just happened after you allowed your mother and Gina to fuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her in disbelief, but she had no reason to lie. Explaining properly, she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was with my fusion sisters. We even talked with your mother earlier and played some cards. If it isn't obvious now, it seems we're able to exist beyond Earth which is nice considering I was afraid I wouldn't exist after I defused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...things changed. I <i>really</i> want to punch you for letting Gina enter our inner circle! Neither you or your mother heeded my warning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Angeline's sudden frustration, you step back and raise your hand in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what warning?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline grumbles in disgust before raising her voice. \"Just letting new people fuse into existence! I can tolerate Emilia because this is your sister and Arianna, but...not this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice grows quickly soft. A sadness envelops the girl and you feel your heart tighten in guilt. Unsure what to do and still very confused, you take a step forward to try to console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-angeline, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl quivers before taking initiative, burying against you and wrapping her arms around your back. You are surprised at first, but quickly comfort her and wrap your arms around her, trying best to ignore her large chest smooshing against your bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only notice it now, but it appears like Angeline, you have popped in with a suitable swimming trunks. It of course does nothing to hide your arousal as you feel your third leg bumping against the girl. Your best attempts at ignoring her round globes proved to be an instant failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing embarrassed and cursing yourself, Angeline lets out a short laugh, then breaks away and wipes a small tear from her hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft....you really know how to read the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding your boner, you sputter. \"S-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lame as you are, Angeline seems to not mind and laughs easily. Of course, this girl knows you very well thanks to your mother such that she loves your faults too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering, Angeline grows quiet, then breathed out some honesty. \"I really missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhaling, you hold your breath, trying to hide an upcoming embarrassed smile. Clearing your throat, you hum. \"Yeah...me too. So, you were saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline nods, feeling less irritable than before and continues. \"Right, after Gina and your mother merged, the rest of us got separated as we were thrown into this new expanded world. It was frightening, but I was able to gather what I could do here and what changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's all sorts of shops and places here, yet nobody to operate anything. It's strange and lonely, but I have a feeling that within this city, the other fusions are out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, you feel rather overwhelmed with this new information, only proving that there's so much more to the necklace that you aren't aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline grabs your hand and squeezes. \"Scott, somehow...I was able to sense that you were around and found you lying on this beach. I was so relieved! I want to find my other sisters that were developed from me, but so far I haven't had any luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how much time had passed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline bites her lips, then shakes her head. \"I...I don't know. It's never gotten dark around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no night time?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down, taking a deep breath. It would seem the mystery to this necklace would continue. Trying to think on it wouldn't help a lot, but you knew you'd have to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how you'd explain this to your family or even if you needed to if they were to appear in this world after they fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face grows trouble as you thought about Gina and Nicole, the merging process already turning out wilder than you expected. Now along with this change in the necklace's world, you wonder if this is a good thing or bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking to yourself aloud, Angeline answers figuring you are referring to the new fusion in the real world. She sighs, then sits next to you, her hand gracing your thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's done is done, right? This Gina...who is she to you? Who will this fusion be to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding more questions doesn't help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...complicated,\" you simply answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline hums, then glides closer to you. \"Then...what about Arianna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions stumps you and furrow your eyebrows. \"I...I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not think about Nicole since that's pretty obvious since she's family, but...don't you think it's impossible to love me without loving her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips, but considering how unfair it might seem to use Arianna just to be with Angeline and the fact that Angeline is a blend of personality between Nicole and Arianna, it might be that you technically love Arianna as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you getting at?\" you narrow your eyes suspiciously at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline chuckles, then leans against you causing you to fall onto your back with her snuggled against you. She slides her hand across your chest sending shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're thinking too hard...just like when trying to sort yourself out for me and the rest. Keep it black and white, Scott. The necklace allows us to exchange our identities and learn about each other. Don't you think that means you have everything to know about the person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep that in mind, though I'll admit...I wish I could just keep you. It's not good to create competition for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fakes a pout causing you to look away, rather guiltily. Getting the appropriate reaction, she chuckles then tilts your head back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing her face, you see a warmer gaze on you. Then, she lifts her hand to brush through your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, finding this sensation familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't able to dwell on it though as the girl leans forward and locks her lips with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, you wrap your arms around her and your \"third leg\" revives as the ocean roars around you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, this \"dream\" just turned into paradise for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"dream\" would have to end though as you slowly wake up. Angeline's words and moans echo in your head for a little while before you realize...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A-ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you regain consciousness, you hear a sweet moan fill your ears, then comes a relieved sigh. It's clear that a girl is next to you, a fusion if things were to be determined after the events outside the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that is if you are still in the necklace, but somehow you doubt that. Being pulled away from Angeline's warmth was disappointing and you aren't sure when you left the sunny beach of the mysterious dream land persisted by the necklace, but you know you definitely aren't on a beach as you hear the low humming of a ceiling fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you are awake, but something prevents you from opening your eyes. Rather, you notice something dribbling into your mouth and a cool pressure against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking, you notice it's warm and sweet. It almost wants you to continue to taste it without questioning it. While in your thoughts, you indulge in this liquid and then come to a realization as you feel a hand at the back of your head, holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're being breastfed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like an idiot for not recognizing it sooner, yet you don't stop suckling at this unknown breast. Before attempting to move and finally gaze at this fusion, you hold your position as you hear your mother sigh and whisper to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie...will this work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is definitely not of Angeline or anyone else you know of, so this must be a new girl that has popped into existence...a fusion of Nicole and Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to arouse suspicion that you're awake, you listen calmly, both feeling guilty pleasure and a little nervous. It sounds though from her voice that this woman is equally nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will he hate me?\" she asks herself and then travels her fingers through your hair causing shivers to travel down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be fine, right? I'm not his true mother. I wish...no, it's a good thing because I wouldn't be allowed to love him like this. What could he be dreaming about to cause such a mess on me though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMess? What is she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, he's hard again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says it so casually and you haven't even realized coming after indulging in Angeline in your sleep. It occurs to you that you are naked and hard below as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, the woman uses her free hand to gently wrap around your member, then rubbing it slowly and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there...From now on, I'll be here for you. Our families will be closer than ever before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch, then unable to prevent yourself from pretending to be asleep, you grunt and unlatch, causing her to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sweetie?! W-wait, you'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip tightens and you lurch, unable to handle the sudden stimulation. She gasps as you unleashed on her legs and you have only a moment before you feel her grip loosening and then your head spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thud!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall off the bed in your haste and bump your head. Suddenly any sense of pleasure turned into a headache as you rolled on the floor and grabbed the back of your head which impacted to the carpet. It's not anything serious, but still unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? Oh, sweetie...please say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer maternal instincts were alarming high that she would worry over a small fall like this. You could hear her about to shuffle out of the bed but didn't want her to approach you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToughening it up, you shake your head and finally open your eyes, wanting to gaze on this woman who was both mother and yet not true either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, she's <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sun9-15.userapi.com/c836621/v836621925/46b4f/XJUbwFiQuuY.jpg\">gorgeous</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://sun9-15.userapi.com/c836621/v836621925/46b4f/XJUbwFiQuuY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> with a slightly tanner skintone, brown silky hair, and a rather cute face. It's a little harder to tell, but she sports some of the green eyes that your mother has while losing the red hair to Gina's brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her large breasts on her petite body dribble, you gulp and stare dumbly at her, trying to find words. \"Uh...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman furrows her eyebrows before smiling worriedly. \"Are you....okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I'm fine! Rather...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman widens her eyes, before smiling more confidently. \"Ah, sorry! As you might have figured, I was born from Gina and your mother. My name is Nina. Easy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs at her own naming sense but in truth, it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Angeline who could pass as a college girl while still looking mature at any time, Nina could pass as some of the young school teachers you remember having a crush on...in other words, mid-twenties to early thirties but it's hard to put an age to these fusions given every one of them had been beauties in their own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, it comes apparent that she's not the same person as you saw before when Gina forcefully merged with your mother. You wonder why, but right now, you don't question it as there are bigger things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...s-so, w--why were you breastfeeding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force out the question, feeling somewhat discomforted and strangely aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina pursues her lips. \"Why? Because...it felt right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like a mother, yet I don't feel like anyone's particular mother if that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it doesn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you aren't convinced, Nina hums, rather confused herself on how better to explain. \"Um...I don't feel like yours or Chris' mother, but I want to take care of you...your sisters...Chris...this whole united family. Do you...hate that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't able to respond. Angeline mentioned to keep things black and white but that's pretty difficult. What Nina is claiming is a grey area which doesn't help sort out your feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, you can't say that her sudden envelopment of you was disliked given how you indulged in it a little while regaining your thoughts. So of course, you don't want to act hypocritical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't hate it! But...it's surprising, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Angeline spurred confusion, things got better when she became a fully independent being and she didn't care to be considered a mother or not. She just expresses her existential love for you and that's all it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, that can only be said because of Arianna who had her own independent goals and life. Gina and Nicole are both mothers however, so there would be a more definitive nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this then?\" she points and smiles warmly, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fidget, embarrassed, but despite the nature, you must figure that she's the same as Angeline even if she expresses differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adds. \"Ah! If it makes you really uncomfortable, I'll unfuse-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" you blurt out, unwilling to see her near sad smile popping up, then you sigh. \"I just need to get used to this...that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina hums, then stands up. You freeze, unsure what to do but the woman confidently strides up and hugs you. In return you gasp, feeling her mammaries squishing up against your chest. You see that she's only a couple inches taller yet it makes you feel short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, it'll be okay, I promise. You gave me this chance to exist and...I'm so grateful! I feel so much at ease and I want it to be the same for you and the others. Before long, I think you'll prefer me over Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your dumbfounded look, she then pulls away and grabs your hand with a wink. \"Let's take a shower together, okay? Both your sisters popped in and found you quite adorable at my breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a panic attack at your heart. Your sisters saw that?! You would never be able to hear the end of the amount of their teasing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you feel yourself being led into your bathroom with your head in the clouds, but as you realize your already entering Nina's pace, you curl your lips wondering if you should be letting yourself led by her. Things already got somewhat crazy and your heart still hasn't recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

While you aren't sure how it starts, you're certain it has to do with Nina's initiative and your horny state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fusion, while sweet and endearing towards you, is surprisingly aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she kisses you, she had one hand with a bath-bom, slowly sliding soap down your back with her other hand on the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you feel out of breath, you pull away and leave your dazed expression on Nina who smiles warmly, then pushes you to her left breast. With no reason to deny, you latch on and suckle, drawing plenty of milk in her large breast while she continued to scrub and keep you close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much, sweetie,\" she whispers, kissing your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver at the amount of maternal love overflowing from her, completely different from Angelina despite involving Nicole. It simply meant that most of this nature came from Gina which isn't surprising given she is a new mother, one who hasn't even seen her kid grown up...well, sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>This won't cause problems, right?</i>' you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlatching, you force yourself to think clearly and cough. \"This...I think this is enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina smiles devilishly and then her hand brushes to your lower half. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, unable to answer nor refuse. Instead, you divert the question and back away. \"Is....is this what a mother should be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina hums, moving closer to you. \"Of course not, but I'm not bound to it because I'm not really your mother. Haven't I said that before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Nina would end up existing in spirit within the necklace, separate from Nicole and Gina somewhat proves this fact...yet the experience still is shared, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, this is water under the bridge. Everything you've so far committed with Nina has already applied to Angeline. Knowing this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell,\" you curse, pushing back at Nina. Angeline is right, there's no point to thinking about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you give in, she chuckles and envelops you once more. Her sweet breaths fills the steamy air. She finds herself glad that she called up your school to tell them you're in sick. Of course, you had no clue of even how long you were even out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it sweetie...right...there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your cock, she positions it just over her nether, then you find yourself carrying her weight as you slam into the tiles, suckling her chest again as her moans grow louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Although she was the foundation to which they are able to exist, she preferred to see them as fellow sisters of the same branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie is the fusion of herself added with Emily and then Selena is Ellie added with Scott. Despite being \"sisters\" though, they didn't feel like they were particularly related. Perhaps it's that lack of instinctual sense of familial relations that allowed them to feel free to love whoever they want, particularly to those that their shared memories are fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Angeline watches on in a rather nice apartment complex where Selena and Ellie had made their home. It appears they had already found each other far easily than Angeline had which made her rather upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, she had also met you once more, something of which Ellie and Selena were particularly jealous of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unfair,\" Ellie frowns, \"...you could have told us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat together on a couch, each one of them dressed. Now that there were clothes in this world, they didn't have to roam around in an endless void naked, but even then, they only did that because they felt weird going through the empty streets naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline narrows her eyes, peeved. \"Well, excuse me for being unable to find you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena waves her hand, giggling. \"It's fine, it's fine! It's good that you were able to meet him. Ellie and I had plenty of our own fun, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks suggestively to Ellie who grimaces. \"Do you have to put it that way? How is it that you're able to be so bold anyways? I would have thought that you having some of Scott's personality would make you a little more careful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena shrugs and changes the topic quickly, \"I guess Emily's personality is just too strong. You should know too. By the way, you're looking really fine in that dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie completely gives up as her heart beats. \"Oh you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline watches exasperatedly as the two shares a kiss on the couch, then clears her throat. \"Excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls giggles, then stare at the base of their existence with a smile while Angeline only glares. At that moment, it looked like a mother looking harshly at a pair of daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Angeline relaxes and slouches down the couch. \"Well, whatever. We're together now, but...there might be others here too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena pursues her lips. \"That's right, Emilia must be somewhere around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie groans, grabbing her head. \"Um...remind me who she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the fusion between Emily and Arianna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline hums, not too worried about that fusion anymore. \"Well, I'm sure she's looking around for us as well. Call it a hunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they all shared a form of connection with at least Arianna or Nicole so call it instincts, but even in this empty city there was a subconscious feeling of where everyone is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of connection, there was one more: Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina would of course not be found in this necklace world since she now existed outside. Thanks to their connection to Nicole though, they would receive these jolts of flashes in their heads, giving them updates of what is happening with the family outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, there's a feeling that they were making love just as each of them had done. There should be some acceptance and happiness as this just means that their existence as fusions are being accepted more, not only by the family but by the current sole male of the family who is endearing to their hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, it's also bittersweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline shuffles uncomfortably with a sad smile and her emotions could be felt by everyone in the room. They too smiled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...I could be there with him too,\" Angeline states, something of which everyone could agree with. While it's nice that they could exist with their own sense of self and awareness, it's lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this apartment complex, their feelings are one and the same and unbeknownst to them, the world...the necklace responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

It was the end of their classes, so they took the time to catch up, even though it's only been a day of separation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's...wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah nods in response to Arianna's discomfort after relaying what she and her sister saw after Gina and Nicole merged. There, her little brother was nursing on the fusion known as Nina. It was clear, you had fell unconscious but you were still suckling the woman's large breasts like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina offered to nurse me and my sister as well, saying it would be a bonding experience. I'll pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna sipped some of her tea before clearing her throat. \"This um...never happened when I was with your mother though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well um...we're passed the phase of being spoiled and babied and my mother is strict anyways. From what I know, Gina had a desire to make Scott her new son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not at all platonic,\" Arianna curls her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah sighs and leans back in her chair. \"Well, clearly fusing with others strengthen our emotions to the other. As wrong as it is, it seems to be all lost on the resulting fusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah had a new thought, then stares at the girl in front of her curiously. \"That said, can you really say that you have suddenly liked him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReferring to you, Arianna blushes and understands it's strange. \"I mean...I felt everything with him. I admit I was pissed but when I also merged with your mother, I learned more about him and it just...developed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna sighs, burying her head. \"I...know this is fucked up. Desiring to merge with another family's mother just to...to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey! I get it! Don't force yourself! It probably was hard to break up with your ex after all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna lifts her head and sways her hand with a dead-panned expression. \"Oh no, I was thinking on breaking up with him anyways. This just put the nail in the coffin. Turns out, he felt it was best, so no loss there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...okay,\" Rebekah answer, slightly taken aback before , \"...well, maybe you should go out with him on a date during the weekend...no fusion...just you and him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna had a conflicted expression. \"I mean, I get what you're saying but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, it's just when I'm sharing conscious with your mother, becoming Angeline just feels...right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but it's clear now that Angeline is not you or my mother since she's somehow existing separately, so how is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah was quite disconnected from the merging and for good reason, she's glad. The last merge with her mother and Arianna resulted in some feelings that she was still working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we're completely separate. Actually, only when the fusion is asleep do I feel my own sense of self returning. When we are mentally merged, it's like...Angeline is the one in control, but we have influence and we share the same sense of feeling, taste, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna pauses, seeing that she's gone ahead of herself and chuckles nervously. \"A-ah, nevermind. Anyways, I'm just not feeling that confident. I know Scott is still trying to sort out his feelings as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah rolls her eyes. \"I think he's sorted his feelings. He's probably making love with this new quote-unquote mother of his as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna frowns. \"...I don't like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah shrugs, knowing it's just how it is. Just before she could take sip of her coffee, her phone buzzes. Taking a look, the caller screen showed her sister, Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, it's my sister, I have to take this call-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter briefly taking her eyes off Arianna, when she returned, the girl was suddenly sweating like buckets and hunched over. Quickly, she didn't bother answering her sister and took off to the girl's side, placing a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-arianna?! Hey! What's going on?! Are you okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna lets out a raspy breath and coughs, shivering uncontrollably. \"R-rebekah....I don't feel so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sploosh!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single second, Arianna melted into a thin puddle of liquid matching her skintone and leaving all of her clothes on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah couldn't do anything as she froze, her voice stuck in her throat as the liquid that was Arianna spilled down and began to travel around, sneaking away before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence before she snapped out of her stupor and looked at the rest of the sitting students in the cafe. Some of them hadn't noticed the disappearance of the girl but for others who caught it in the corner of their eyes, they were shocked with some of their own drinks spilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekkah's lips twitches and she smiles curtly. \"S-she's a magician! Nothing to see here folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pants in pain as she stares at her phone annoyed. Her sister didn't pick up and here lying in the bed of the nurse's office, she's feeling like she's dying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the curtains out of the way, the head nurse peaks in, concerned. She brings another wet towel and places it over her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious! Should I call your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no real mother at this moment which is why Emily opted to get her sister to come here since she knows she'd be out of class. \"U-um, no. My sister will be picking me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse hums before nodding and turning away to prepare some notes for the various teachers. \"If nobody comes in about thirty minutes, I will call the ambulance, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's silence and the nurse pauses writing her notes before coming back to the bed. \"Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the curtain, she gasps to see the girl suddenly gone and quickly looked around, finding no evidence of her leaving. In such a small room with no windows, how could she just disappear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the nurse, a sticky puddle slides on the ceiling above her, slithering its way to home by the will of necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

Then, all she could do is scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nArianna opens her eyes, her mind momentarily foggy before she shuts her eyes tightly and shakes her head. She isn't sure what happened, but she suddenly felt sick without warning and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings became unclear afterwards but now appearing in white space with no clear end, it recognize the area similar to the necklace world except she felt like she was floating this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking aloud, she could only hear her own voice echoing into the undetermined distance. Furrowing her eyebrows, she assumed that something happened related to the necklace, except she and Rebekah were no where close to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or perhaps did she die?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought terrifies her because it happened all too fast. There was still a lot things she wanted to do in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing worried, a little hope fills her as she hears a new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Anyone-oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFading into her view, Arianna widens her eyes to see Emily, whom is equally surprised to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arianna!? W-where is this?! Are we in the necklace?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily rightfully panics, having also been suddenly sucked into this strange white place without warning after blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna bites her lips. \"I...I don't know. All I remember is that I suddenly broke into a sweat and began to feel awful all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's eyes widen further and she places a hand to her chest. \"Me too! I was at a nurse's office trying to get a hold of my sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna holds her breath, finding that this meeting and circumstances could not be coincidental. She speaks carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...something happened to us thanks to the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily grabs her head, huffing distressed. \"Shit! Isn't the necklace still with Scott, Gina, and my mom? How could we be involved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna had no clue, so she could only tighten her face with worry. Before she could open her mouth, another voice entered the space with a scream, startling the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating to them just as Emily had, the high school girl opens her mouth in shock to see the head nurse, Vivian Tran shaking with fearful eyes. Only when she noticed Emily and Arianna did she calm down a little and gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-emily! Oh god, what happened?! Where is this place?! W-why...that thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-ms, Tran, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse shakes and is trying her hardest to calm down, but having not experienced anything related to the necklace, both Arianna and Emily could understand. If it were only them, then maybe things would start to make sense later but seeing an unrelated person spelled troubling news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian grabs her head and finally answers, chocking up. \"It...was this strange slime blob. It...it hung over me a second and then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianna and Emily glances at each other for a moment before their faces pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Vivian raises her head up and stares at the two with quivering eyes. \"Do...do you know what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Emily bites her tongue before she decides to play dumb, \"...I'm not sure either! That blob must have ate me as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me too!\" Arianna adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both pretend to quiver but the two of them now are certain. While in this astral space, their real bodies are out there as formless monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Wood is the CFO of a relatively large accounting firm across the states, McGraw &amp; Lily. After a long day of work, the twenty-eight-year-old single woman was eager to get back home and relax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...safely that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the blood rushing to her head and the sounds of crackling fire, Sarah wakes up upside down with the air bag pushing her against the seat and her seat belt keeping her from falling to the ceiling of her car, now at the bottom as her vehicle was totaled; the events of which she couldn't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing it would be dangerous to remain like this, she grunts as she tries to wriggle her way out of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a pained groan and noticed that some blood was spilling from her forehead. It was just a cut but she realizes she might be in worse condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, despite her heart beating rapidly, she tries to wiggle her fingers and feet. To her relief, she had complete feeling in her body and didn't feel anything cutting her circulation although things would start to feel numb if she remained upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curses as she manages to find the seat belt clip and release it, then slowly slides down with her coat dragging against the air bag fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping down, she winces as some glass cuts a little into her skin but she otherwise ignores the pain, more determined to get out of her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully making her way out of the window, she notices that her hearing was a little deafened but it begins to return as she pops her head outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings seems to be looking so far good, but then she hears a man panic a few meters away from her, followed by...something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Slurpt!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is enough for her to pause, but not willing to keep her from escaping. She might be one of the lucky ones though because as soon as she finally reaches the cement road and gets up, her breath leaves her as she sees multitude of cars slammed into each other, some of them flipped like hers and others with no escape path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few cars on fire making her sure she had to escape fast before any explosion could reach her. Yet, before she could, something whizzed past her line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she sees another woman like her who managed to get out of the car. She was stuck further in the middle of the chaos and looked to be in worse condition than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bites her lips before deciding to help her. It might put her at risk, but she couldn't ignore that someone might need help more than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on miss, let me help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could attempt to make her way to support the stranger, she stops as the lady looks around, then screams, her hands to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's words stop in her mouth as something incomprehensible appears, a tan blob that shoots out from the crevices of a car and envelops the woman in one fell swoop. The woman's screams were completely silenced as soon as she was engulfed and the blob slithers through the mess of cars faster than she could blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart beating faster than before, Sarah turns the other way and runs without another word. Her eyes tears up and breathing becomes pained as she does whatever she can to escape whatever that...thing is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, she doesn't even get to see the blob nor hear it coming as her world blackens without warning. All she took is a few steps, but it seemed not even that was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the necklace's world where Angeline, Ellie, and Selena sat comfortably on their couches, Angeline chuckles silly as she shakes her head, having made her obvious wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...of course, that'd be impossible. We can't exactly exist there without Arianna or Nicole, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie nods. \"Yeah, but...at least, we can exist in some way after the fact? I'm glad that there's other fusions that I'm able to talk with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena snorts. \"Pfft...we're basically talking to different versions of ourselves, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline laughs. \"That's true, but it doesn't feel bad. I guess...I shouldn't be so greedy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena crosses her legs on the couch as she had a thought. \"Just imagine it though. If we could exist there on our own terms, wouldn't that be great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, obviously! But, I also don't want to disrupt Arianna and the rest. Besides, aren't we here in the necklace's world on our own terms? Who's to say this place isn't as real as over there?\" Ellie questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena laughs. \"Whoa, you better stop there, We're getting in some real Matrix territory here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Ellie and Selena are both science fiction nerds thanks to the personality of Scott and Emily, so Angeline could only shake her, rolling her eyes over their theories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on it though, she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there's clearly more to this necklace and world. Just as long as nobody gets hurt, I hope things will remain fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your home, you let out a sigh as you lie on your bedside, dazed. Nina had left the bathroom and your room to attend to Chris who began to cry downstairs. After the merging, Nina apparently took out one of the cribs you or your sisters had and used it to give the baby some sleep. After that, it was all attending to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had to attend Chris, you had time to think more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut think about what? Nina, although truly affectionate and even a little uncomfortable at times, is as lovely as Angeline and the other fusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, there hasn't been a bad fusion! Could there ever be?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>No, no-I should stop there</i>' you think to yourself, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

What about my 6:00!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs panic surrounded them in every direction, Emily and Arianna kept mum, their face growing paler and paler the more people that started to pop up. There were people who seriously thought they had died and others who were still in fright over the \"thing\" they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Emily nor Arianna could count...no, they didn't want to count. This is literally the worst thing that could have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...excuse me? You two are rather calm.

How foolish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse fidgets, clearing her throat before she calls on the woman. \"Um...you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businesswoman blinks before growing embarrassed and laughs. \"Oh! Sorry, I'm Sarah Wood. I was caught in what I think was a car accident caused by that blog thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the dire situation, somehow...this woman was still able to laugh. This surprised Emily and Arianna,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Arianna recalls she heard that name somewhere ago. After a few seconds, she gasps. \"W-wait, I know you! You were presented in The Seaside magazine as one of the top ten women in business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily eyes widen and the nurse quickly composed herself as well, recognizing the woman in front of her as a positive advocate for getting women to start their own businesses. Before being hired as the CFO for one of the largest accounting firm, Sarah had helped shaped up all sorts of startups as an accelerator and guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiles, somewhat embarrassed by the amount of her publicity. \"Well, you haven't told me your names. It seems you three have been here a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...I'm Emily, in my third year of high school at Josselin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Arianna, I'm a student studying in finance at Clarke University.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Vivian - just the head nurse at Josselin high school. Emily and I were together before we were taken by the blob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiles sadly. \"I'm sorry. I really hope this...place isn't what I think it is. I'm glad you three are composed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and looks at the various people, some of whom were relieved to find their families that had also been taken in. She speaks softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right now, I think the most we can do is stay calm. We have no clue what's going on and causing panic is probably not the best thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Arianna nodded, but her words only make them guilty as they might be the only one with a better clue what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily...Arianna...you're fading!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian gasps as she calls to them, her panic coming back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other for a moment, seeing that they are becoming increasingly transparent. What shocks them though is a growing shared sensation that only existed when they were conscious and fused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only shared a breathless sound before they completely disappear. Seeing their empty floating places, Vivian quivers and Sarah let out a shaky gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers witnessed the disappearing two and thinking it might be them next, some of them cried...truly believing themselves to be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream was sharp as you heard Nina downstairs. Your heart beats fast before you quickly rush down to the first floor, only to witness two blobs attacking Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggles to shake them loose, but in front of Chris, who begins crying in his crib again, she is unable to resist as the blobs envelop her curves and start fusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina's screams turns into muffled moans before her human form began to disintegrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare in shock as the blob began to kneed itself, looking like ball of dough. Between its self-kneeding, two different moans sounded out and he recognized them to be Arianna and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but express his disbelief. Quickly, he looked around for a necklace and then saw the glowing jewelry glowing on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nif the necklace was here, how could Emily and Arianna returned? He understood a lot of time had passed since he woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so many questions racking his brain, his attention was brought back to the ball of growing flesh and then, something unexpected happened.</span></div></div>",

It's power, it's reach, it's consequences...there were still lots to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when you witness the formation of not one, but three separate fusions splitting from the blob and becoming more humanoid, it left your jaw open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina had disappeared and if you were to believe Arianna and Emily had become the two blobs, then you would have expected an entirely new fusion, but as the details of the forms emerged, you see a familiar pair of blondes and one brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline, Ellie, and Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one completely blows your mind, considering Selena is supposed to comprise of you...and yet, here you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare dumbly at the three as they slowly open their eyes, confusion overwhelming their expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-scott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them turn around, confused by the sudden shift in location and by the familiar person they all developed to love. Angeline is the first to get her bearings, somehow excited to see Scott again yet not enough to keep her from first questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we were just talking to each other in the necklace's world. If we're all here...are we still in the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know,\" you answer, still dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre <i>you</i> in the necklace world? That would make sense, but you don't remember falling unconscious or being transferred. As far as you know, this is your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie furrows her eyebrows and examining the familiar home, she then places her hand on her stomach. Slowly, her eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...Emily...Nicole...Arianna. They're...we're one again. Their minds, their presence...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline gasps, feeling the same thing with the exception of Emily. \"H-how? How can we both feel Emily and Nicole?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, except...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena looks up at you anxiously and the answer is clear, she too feels Emily, Arianna, and Nicole...but not you. Her existence just complicates everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to laugh, rather distressingly causing the three to feel startled. Angeline quickly rushes to your side, seeing that you're about to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, don't go out like this! We can figure this out! What happened before us appearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, trying to find words. After taking a breather, you and the three settle on the couch. While being surrounded by naked beauties is great, you hardly had the time to get excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...two blobs came, I think Arianna and Emily. They...they ate Nina and split. I...I don't understand! My sister and Arianna, they were nowhere near the necklace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigns and the three fusion sisters looked at each other before some idea comes to their mind. Ellie is the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angeline, didn't this happen right after we all wished we could exist here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Angeline asked back, curling her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through, Selena came up with a theory. \"I'm noticing something...while I do feel Nicole, Arianna, and Emily, it's not a strong sense of feeling. In fact, I feel more like we do when we're in the necklace, separate from everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel this as well,\" Ellie answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline closes her eyes and sighs, placing a hand over yours then smiling apologetically. \"Sorry Scott, it seems we greatly disrupted something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well um...it doesn't look like you guys knew. So does this mean, even any of us could be far away, the necklace will respond to your guys' wills as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it. Seems far too coincidental considering we all were together at the time,\" Selena hums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Scott...this is great news though!\" Angeline cheers, moving in closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, growing aware of her body. Coughing, you try to remain composed. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More of the fact that Selena is sitting here with us proves that our existences aren't dependent on you or anyone! We could be with you on a more permanent basis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea causes your heart to beat - to be with these three beauties and others? Could it be possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie frowns, then clears her throat. \"I...don't think so, Angeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline widens her eyes and stares at her fusion sister surprised. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could we form our bodies from nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions stumps everyone in the room. Where would their foundation be to exist on a physical level?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena nods while humming. \"I think we can agree that the necklace at least creates a copy of us. That's why we can exist within the necklace, but since we were born from Arianna, Nicole, and Emily in some fashion, we would need them as part of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you two with your geeky theories are ruining what's present!\" Angeline shouts, growing frustrated before she locks your arm, trapping it in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver and after thinking you might be done after Nina, your lower half creates a tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-angeline, I think we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline presses a finger to your lips, then smirks. \"I think you should call me Mommy, since it seems you swing that way after what I saw with Nina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choke and Angeline giggles, caressing your cheeks. \"I'm kidding, Scott...come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the lead, you could only grunt in exasperation as Angeline gently locks her lips with yours. Meanwhile the other two frowns, jealousy emerging in their hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie speaks up first with a growl. \"Oh come on, Angeline! You had him before and even went on a date with him! Let us try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unf...\" Angeline moans a little as she breaks away from you, leaving a bridge of saliva between you and her. As you sway, dazed and stupidly happy, Angeline turns to Ellie with a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Am I not technically the oldest one here? You and Selena are still children in my eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop it with that mother card. You've already played that once! Also, I'm taller!\" Ellie bites back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, wait!\" Selena shouts, her eyes rather distant but seeing the two banter, she felt frustrated. Something inside she was feeling worried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone quieted down, staring at Selena as she furrows her eyebrows. \"I...think our fusion and split caused more of a mess than we realized. It's disconnected, but...don't you feel others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisconnected, as in they weren't part of their core pieces that make up themselves, yet...there's still an attachment. Searching themselves, Ellie and Angeline widens their eyes in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorny, you manage to try to remain calm amid the seriousness then look at the three confused. \"W-what? Hey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline curls her lips before looking at you with a nervous smile. \"Um...Scott, I think Arianna and Emily engulfed some others along the way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, the meaning of their words very clear to you. Twitching, you try to smile but your heart is panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked at each other. Between the three of them, they internally counted in their hands based on the various sensations and disconnected memories that flowed within each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating as you watch the numbers go past the number of fingers, your eyes roll up. You hear your name being called in panic as your vision grows dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Turning to her fellow sisters, Angeline had another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should bring back Nina as well,\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena curls her lips. \"Is that wise? I mean, I know we disrupted their little evening, but wouldn't that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her words fall out of uncertainty, Angeline still understood what she was implying and nods. \"Yes, it would mean that we would have to thin out Nicole even further between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie frowns. \"Angeline, isn't this risky? We're barely able to feel out Nicole and the others as is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid fusion sighs in response, \"I know but...something inside of me is telling me that she should be released. Either that or Gina herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena and Ellie blinks before agreeing somewhat. Actually, this can only be the influence of Nicole which bodes well that it doesn't seem splitting has affected her consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Angeline continues, \"...only I need to split her out somehow, so Nicole will still be majorly maintained by you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...but we're not sure are we? How will you even be able to split only a sixth of yourself out?\" Ellie questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline bites her lips before her eyes stares at the necklace on the kitchen counter. \"Worst case, I lose myself and become someone or something else. We're already in a mess, so can it get any worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the others that we involved?\" Selena asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline lowers her head, but she had no good solutions now. \"Right now, it's like their in limbo. If we bring them out, there'll be questions. For now, let's just try to get either Gina out by herself or through Nina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing to that, Angeline picks up the necklace before glancing at your unconscious form. She smiles a little and pecks you on the cheeks before she holds the jewel part of the necklace tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, she tries to will Gina and part of herself out. How does one split part of themselves? Before any of this, she would have no clue but now that she does feel part of Nicole, it gives her a unusual sense of awareness and how it can be divided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis revelation is a big understanding that could lead to advance fusions, but she has no idea if it will even work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Ellie and Selena's gasp, Angeline is tempted to open her eyes, but she remains focused. The fact that she hasn't lost awareness of herself is a good thing but she does feel Gina emptying out, becoming more front and center. Nicole starts to fade from her awareness, but she can still feel a tiny of it lingering...making herself still feel connected and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...w-what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a new voice really close to her ears, Angeline opens her eyes. For a moment, she's hopeful that everything has worked out, but turning her body around shows no new fusion. Staring at Selena and Ellie, she raises her eyebrows in confusion as they stare agape. Oddly, their stares aren't quite pointed directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head as another groan fills her ears, she gasps as she sees Nina's head grown out from her own neck, dazed and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot expecting this conjoinment, Angeline screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft...haha! The look on your face!\" Ellie sputters and laughs, unable to help herself. Being comprised of Emily who would make fun of this, it isn't surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Selena is better, but even she couldn't help keep a straight face when thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile peeved, the conjoined state wasn't permanent and all Angeline needed to do is focus longer to fully have Nina form and split away. This process took a long time though and it was excruciating to Nina who's maternal instincts didn't lessen when it came to your health. She panicked more to see you unconscious than her own conjoined state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being reassured, Nina rudely pushed Angeline away to get to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCradling you close to her on the couch, she tries to wake you up. \"Scott, Scott? Sweetie, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline furrows her eyebrows and huffs, but she could understand Nina's concerns being part Nicole. It's just she also know that this is likely not going to be the first time you'd pass out either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine, Nina. More importantly, I think you should check up on Chris,\" Ellie points to the master bedroom where they relocated Chris' crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina gasps before moving to her other \"son\", her heart in disarray after being engulfed. With some of the maternal air lifted from their position, Angeline breathes a sigh of relief, wondering if bringing Nina out was the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's done is done though and Angeline sits by you, nudging you a little, seeing your face twitch. \"Hey, wake up Scott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving recovered a little, you groan and slowly lean forward, pressing your fingers to your temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happene-oh god...\" you remember easily and sigh, \"...t-the others that are part of you...just how are we going to fix this mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the most biggest challenge and Angeline worried what might happen if they wait long. According to Emily's and Arianna's memories, the people seem to be in some sort of limbo. It's not like they had influence over their consciousness, but each of them could pose a risk to their identity if they aren't careful. If time went on, who's to say that one of them could spontaneously induce a merge from within?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had a sense of these people in limbo, it would only be a matter of time before they realize there's someone watching them as a whole...and they too would have a sense of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that, they could try to split out the people, similar to Nina but then comes the question on how to explain this whole situation. Also, could they really just spend time pushing people out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or could they assimilate everyone and force them to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes Angeline shiver, only because with so many panicking people and various temperments, it's very well possible that Scott and others may get hurt. There's no telling who Angeline and the others might become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we maybe...transfer them somewhere?\" Selena suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo where though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace world? How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes her freeze. If it were possible, would it be great? No, it's only trapping them in a much better environment but their bodies...their flesh is somehow still part of each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, it might give them time. Time to perhaps slowly bring everyone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is decided?</span></div></div>",

The more it is used, the more of its power and nature is revealed. It does not just save the resulting fusions, but it can even store consciousness of others!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that, is it possible to remove the consciousness of the many people they absorbed into the world of the necklace? It's not ideal but it would give them some comfort that they wouldn't be taken over if one of them figures out how to break through the limbo space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to try, otherwise the only other option is each of them trying to force them out. Who knows how they would react and if it would be possible to control the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo people stands out in Angeline's mind according to Emily and Arianna - Sarah Wood and the school nurse, Vivian. Perhaps, they might be the two they could reveal first and hopefully gain their help. From her memories, she recalled that Sarah especially was quite calm and collected. She definitely seemed like the leader that could bring people together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline sighs, palming her head. \"We have to try something. I...I'm not sure if it'll work, but we can't stand any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pained expression, she looked at you apologetically. \"Scott, I...I didn't mean this to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl your lips and move to hug the naked woman, unable to help console her. Despite being now comprised of partial people, she didn't feel like any less of the individual Angeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the fact that their consciousness remains in the necklace world, it only adds to the conclusion that only their physical presence requires others...otherwise, they were their own person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" you breathe, trying to act calm but in truth, you were worried. Was it foolish to believe that the necklace could be kept a secret so far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away, you clear your throat. In front of so many beauties, it would be impossible not to be aroused, yet you had to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...so what now? Maybe you all need to go to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is silence before Selena hums. \"Maybe we should all merge together first, then sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline gasps. \"M-merge?! What are you thinking?! There's only a large group of people behind our consciousness and you think we should just merge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena frowns but before she could argue, Ellie steps in. \"I think Selena is right! Besides, we have to do it anyways, right? How else are we going to piece everyone's consciousness we gained back together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is true. They couldn't exactly defuse with only a portion of the family. Even if they could, it might turn ugly real fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline sighs before nodding. \"Sorry, you're right. I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it,\" Ellie interjects, \"...we all wanted to remain here as ourselves and be with Scott, but we have to sort out this mess first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Nina comes back in carrying the baby Chris in her arms. He absolutely looked horrified to see other fusions staring back at him. Not to allow himself to cry again, he turned his head and nursed back onto Nina's chest as she cradled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard, are we going to have to merge again? I just got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be done,\" Angeline explains sadly, \"...besides, what happened after...um...we ate you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded, Nina furrows her eyebrows. \"Oh, that's right! You interrupted my bonding time with Scott!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena groans, \"Oh come on! It was beyond our control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina harrumphs before she gazes at you, still worried. \"Scott-sweetie, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffle uncomfortably. The amount of maternal love overflowing from Nina really hammered you and potentially brought a side to you of wanting to be spoiled by her. Yet, you couldn't let yourself being drawn to her pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you answer, clearing your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline narrows her eyes at Nina, feeling annoyed and also a little jealous. Unlike Nina, it's not like Angeline doesn't feel a maternal love for you, but she knows that your a grown man. It's fortunate that Nicole is past the age of coddling her children otherwise, she might end up like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina, please...what happened afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina held in her complaints before sighing as she felt expectant stares. \"...After taking me away, everything went dark. I felt...my grip on Nicole being lost...taken away. Then, Gina also disappeared. After that, I found myself into the necklace world but I had lost my connection to Gina and Nicole. I was about to lose it until I felt myself return!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it didn't go completely dark, you should be glad that you were still able to exist like the rest of us!\" Selena snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Nina shouts, causing everyone to flinch, \"...what could I do without being next to my familia? I don't want to be separated from them ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Ellie hesitates before opening her mouth, \"...you won't? We'll find a way to be together and you should know that Scott can appear in the necklace world too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Gina?\" Angeline presses, \"...did she join the others in limbo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina breathed in before sighing, knowing that she was scaring Chris, she calmed down quickly. \"Yes, but there's nothing to say except she was confused and worried like everyone else inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, let's try not to contain them any longer in empty space. It's not ideal, but at least they might have some working time on their feet in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina remains silent for a moment before eying you. \"I'll only merge with you all if Scott and Chris is joined with us as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's eyes raised alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Scott is perfectly fine by himself. We should not need to complicate this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what are you thinking?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina defends herself. \"We should be together! That's how it should always be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be Scott's decision, not yours! YOU are not his mother! Nobody is!\" Angeline exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina is taken aback before she pleads with you. \"Scott-sweetie, I...I know that I may be overbearing, but I do love you! I can't help but feel this way due to my nature, but I...just want the best for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, \"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your hesitation, Nina sighs. \"I'll...merge with you all alone if he doesn't want to. At the very least, I want to take my baby Chris-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resistance is fiercer. Even Chris looks unsure if he wants to be part of these women.

She lowers her head and sighs. \"Alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline nods in approval, though a tiny bit of her wouldn't mind merging with you, but now is not the right time. She addresses everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have another chance if everything goes right. The last thing we want to do is bring him down with us if it goes wrong,\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone could agree to that. Even Nina who held you and Chris dear to her didn't want to cause more problems. Knowing this, she silently brings Chris back to his cradle, away from whatever would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shaky breath, Angeline moves to the kitchen to grab the necklace and then brings it over. Seeing that she's nervous, you want to console her more, but she tries to put up a strong front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's all remember, even if we fuse, we would still need to figure out how to bring everyone that we absorbed back for real. Let's not forget about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded. At this point, fusing parts to become a whole is only the first step. Nobody had a clue as to how to move the people behind their consciousness. They could only hope there was an easy resolution after becoming one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising the necklace, Angeline clears her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, um...fuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically, the necklace would just respond to their collective will yet it's been seconds too long while holding it. Angeline thought she might have to explicitly declare, but still nothing. It just left her feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, now it decides to stop working!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to sweat, wondering if the splitting of fusions was perhaps too much. Just before you could say anything, the front door slammed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god, the fucking traffic! It was accident after accident getting here! Scott, where are you?! Arianna, she just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah came in, frantic but all of her next words comes to a halt as she sees Nina, Selena, Angeline, and Ellie standing together, equally surprised by her sudden entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister blinks a few times, wondering if she's seeing things. \"How is...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings would not make the situation easier for Rebekah to swallow as the necklace finally started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline ignores Rebekah for the moment and scoffs. \"Oh, now you decide to work, huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena hums worriedly. \"Er...maybe we should fuse one at a time-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly without any control, the girls gasps as the necklace began to levitate in the air in between them. It's at this moment you decide to step far away from the living room and Rebekah does the same, her eyes wide with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wind tears through the house and causes all four fusions to rise a few inches from the ground. This causes all of them to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to remain calm any longer, Rebekah screams as the wind howls around them like a tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SCOTT, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T KNOW!\" you cry back, feeling helpless. Neither you nor Rebekah seem to be affected by the necklace's pull but that doesn't make you feel any better about the sight you are seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, stop! Not like this!\" Ellie yells, trying to pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, Rebekah...get away!\" Angeline warns, her eyes quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the fusions tried to pull away, but it was difficult when they were levitating without any control. Their protests were cut short though and you stare in shock as they are all pulled together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir flesh joins instantly and they quickly become undistinguishable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace then falls to the ground and with it, the wind that flowed through your house slowly begins to die down. You stare as the figure touches the ground too, slowly reforming into a new fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare, bewildered, you feel something hit the back of your head just a few seconds later. Naturally, things black out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...it's not exactly clear, but you think you just got slammed by a kitchen toaster that was picked up in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott...Scotty-dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScotty-dear? That's a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you feel a cold press against the back of your head and a pair of hands brushing through your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you see a blurry image that slowly focuses, then see yet another blonde gazing at you lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sun9-16.userapi.com/c824601/v824601182/1837ff/xbX-nPelp9s.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://sun9-16.userapi.com/c824601/v824601182/1837ff/xbX-nPelp9s.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" the woman smiles, \"...welcome back to Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare, blinking a few times and then let your jaw open a bit as you admire who you can only assume to be the resulting fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...fusion of fusions? Or is it technically just the fusion of Gina, Nicole, Emily, and Arianna?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion giggles at your expression. \"Are you going to act like this with every fusion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, closing your mouth. \"Um...excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stays silent for a bit, not ready to answer your confusion. She continues brushing through your hair eventually causing you to feel restless as you recall the events from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I remember! Rebekah! Is she okay? What about the others that were absorbed? What happened when I was out?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you try to get up, you feel your head thump due to the crash and flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion quickly pushes you back down and you notice you've had an ice bag underneath you this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hushes you and gives you a stern look. \"Easy there! Rebekah is alright. After things calmed down with the necklace, she brought me this bra and went out to buy some clothes for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel relieved and allow her to comb through your hair again. You know you should feel more alert, but somehow when you're underneath this beautiful and unsurprisingly busty woman, you feel calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Nina, she has this motherly aura about her but one that has returned to feeling experienced and more certain about your well-being. Of course, it's too early to tell what her personality is like, but you feel that she's more closer to Angeline so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no...you couldn't get too relaxed. There's one important thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...the others that were picked up. Are they still in limbo or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion surprises you with a smirk, causing you to widen your eyes. \"Why are you worried about a bunch of strangers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you see? I've fully consumed them so that they could be a part of me. This is the best way so that our lives aren't disrupted anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you are hearing. Quivering, you shake your head slowly in disbelief. \"N-no, how could you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause as the fusion's expression broke a little and you could see that she was trying to hold her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fucking lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion finally breaks out with a small chuckle, then leans forward to kiss you on the forehead while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to break away, but moving only seems to make you hurt in the neck, so you take her scheming affection with a big frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it, I actually thought...\" you mutter, yet you feel relieved an evil fusion hadn't spawned. If anything, it shows that this fusion also maintains the playfulness that you expected of your sister Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing out with a satisfied breath, the fusion finally apologizes and continues to stroke your head. \"I'm sorry, Scotty-dear...but you were too serious. I had to break up the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, but wonder if her relaxed mood is a good sign that things worked out. Before confirming, you decide it's best to figure out how to call her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...fine. Don't scare me like that again though! What should I call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fusion hums, curling her lips a little. \"I'm not sure. Why don't you give me a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your eyebrows, thinking a bit. \"Er...Jane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane sounds lovely,\" she whispers, her lips rising warmly. It's enough for your heart to skip, causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a gulp, trying to calm your nerves. Now that you've been underneath her for a while, you start to feel your lower member tingle. Yet, not wanting to let yourself go too out of control, you press her for a more serious answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, Jane...what about the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Jane's answer?</span></div></div>",

I don't feel them behind my consciousness before. Now, I only feel your mother, sister, Arianna, and Gina in whole...their memories...their feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer touch grows softer against your head and you clear your throat. \"S-so, you think their in that strange dream world now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...while you were out, I took a nap. Keeping myself hidden, I saw that all the people that were entrapped have appeared. They're still confused as to where they are and why they're in an empty city, but...I don't feel at risk that one of them will break out and figure out what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe only a little easier because they are still trapped, but you'll have time with the others to formulate a proper plan. \"Well, we're heading in a safer direction...hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that! You think this is safe?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah enters the house again with a bag of clothes, not only for Jane but for the other fusions as well. Her eyes looked quite heavy and seeing your elder sister so stressed fills you with regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Scott. God, do you know what a mess you made?\" she directs as she drops the shopping bags to the side and approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this isn't my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverprotective, Jane pulls you closer a little and lifts her hand in your defence. \"Rebekah, this is my fault, if anything. Not Scott. There's still a lot of things we don't know about the necklace and its powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah fumes, clearly stressed. She walks around the living room with no aim, her thoughts all wild before she slowly forces herself to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching the bridge of her nose, she lets out a long breath. \"I know...you've told me before. Still, I wish you all had waited for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt immensely guilty and opened your mouth. \"Sis, I'm sorry...it's just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Rebekah cuts off, \"...sorry for blaming you, but it just seems that everything is focused on you, so I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get it, unbelievably happy that you're the center of attention when it comes to the fusions but clearly it's not without its consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking another breath, she picks up the TV remote. \"I already learned everything from this fusion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jane,\" the fusion corrects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah rolls her eyes a little. \"-Jane, sorry. Yet another name I have to remember. Anyways, we need to fix this fast. We've just trapped a number of people in the necklace if what she told me is correct, but that doesn't help us with the people that are worried here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the TV, your heart beats heavily as the newscaster appears on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and we're still waiting to hear updates regarding the cause of a massive traffic accident on I-48 and the mysterious disappearance of twenty to forty people, including Sarah Woods, advocate for women in business and current CFO of GoldTime Inc. We do have eye-witnesses who have seen something that is described as a monster. For new viewers, we will replay some of these accounts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt switches to a prior recording of a woman interviewing a scraggly man with a trucker hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw it with my own eyes, man. It was like...the blob...but scarier. I only saw hints of it in my truck as I managed to hit the brakes before adding to the crash but...it was like crazy! I didn't see how any disappeared, but I am not crazy, I tell you! There was this blob that moved between the cars!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news switches back to the newscaster who clears his throat. \"...and as we were saying, we are still waiting to hear from the city and police...as well as any other witnesses that may have a more formidable account of what caused the disappearance of many who disappeared from their cars and nearby areas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah turns off the TV knowing that you already knew of the damage but she really had to make sure you understood the effect on the world already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching your pale face, you open your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah went to grab some more items, particularly some baby items to take care of Chris, seeing how he'll be sticking around for a while.  She also wanted to prepare herself to nap in order to travel to the necklace world as she wanted to at least monitor the people and situation...get a feel for their personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though things needed to be resolved fast, Rebekah was aware that might be difficult. It may be entirely possible to spit out everyone from Jane but then...how would they face the inevitable questions about the necklace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why, Rebekah is taking the responsibility of attempting to blend in with the groups to see if she could find people who could at least empathize with the situation or understand if they might cause trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for for you, you watch as Jane dances adorably in front of your bathroom mirror as she tries various new bras and clothes Jane brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imagefap.com/photo/1491543801/?pgid=&amp;gid=8090588&amp;page=0&amp;idx=29\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.imagefap.com/photo/1491543801/?pgid=&amp;gid=8090588&amp;page=0&amp;idx=29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this is certainly pleasant to watch and you only followed her because she asked, you were still in some deep thought about this whole situation and about Jane herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>So...this is what everyone who knows about the necklace besides me and Rebekah is like?</i>' you thought, unable to pull your eyes away from her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your eyebrows, thinking about Selena. \"But...if Selena is supposed to represent me in the fusions, did she then just disappear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you just spoke out loud, you flinch and Jane turns around, her eyes widen a little at your thoughts. \"Oh, Scotty-Dear! You just brought an interesting point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane giggles. \"While I feel for the most part your family, then Gina and Arianna, I actually do have some sensation of the other fusions, including Selena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you raise your eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really surprising,\" Jane admits, \"...since I'm just the next person in line to derive from them but I think as long as I have support to exist from a majority, it's fine if one brick is missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand that brick being you in the analogy of a building structure. When it is put like that, it makes some sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane comes closer to you and you don't exactly have time to react as her face is inches away from you. Before you could open your mouth, she touches the back of your head with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your head, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...it's fine,\" you answer, pulling back a little with a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane hums, still worried but doesn't address it again. Instead, her expression then shifts with a playful smile. \"Why don't we get comfy together. I got too lost in all the clothes Rebekah brought but we should be traveling together to the necklace world again to understand the current situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-comfy, you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane chuckles at your one-raised eyebrow. \"You know exactly what I mean. I like these clothes, but I think skinship is best performed without, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, she unclasps her bra and let it dangle to the ground giving you a first look to her huge chest in proper fashion. In turn, you gulp as you stared dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guides your hands to her chest and you could feel yourself sinking into them. The sensation immediately produces another rise in your lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't think we should be doing this now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sweetie,\" she whispers, pushing closer to you and slowly taking you and her out of the bathroom, \"...we're going to have to sleep anyways, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a conflicted breath. Yes, you wanted to do it, but if Rebekah discovered you were fucking in the middle of this situation where people are missing, she might kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Probably not, yet you weren't sure how long you'd be able to experience with this new woman and it's clear she's eager to make love to you, just as her predecessors had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her tits with your hands, you feel them sink in and let out an amazed gasp. She giggles and wraps her hands around yours, trapping you to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your eyes fall down her form and then gulp. Unlike everyone before who was fairly slim, Jane was thicker in all the right areas. Still, the Law of Conservation of Mass doesn't seem to apply to fusions. Every fusion so far never equaled the mass of its parts. If it did, Jane would practically be a blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules of how fusions are developed remain a mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scotty-dear,\" Jane sighs lovingly, \"...you're so wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow a little embarrassed by her praise. \"I'm...not. We shouldn't be doing this now, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but it'll be okay, right?\" Jane finishes your sentence with a smile, \"...I may not be here for long, so while we're finally alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets action finish her own sentence as she pushes closer to you and topples you on your bed. Once down and your hands really restrained to her chest, you could do nothing but groan as she kisses you, inserting her tongue into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reciprocate, feeling her large chest, the largest so far now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a few minutes, the two of you make out while a wall clock ticks in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scotty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her call out your nickname. You have no idea how this fusion decided to come up with one, but it felt good to hear her say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exhausting your lips, you gazed into Jane's warm eyes. Within the time, you hadn't noticed that she had slipped your pants away, revealing the throbbing pole of your desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I love you,\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffles higher over you and takes away you hands. Once off, you felt a wetness that is only confirmed when you see a little river of milk dribbling from her nipples as it comes to your alignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what you had to do as you opened your mouth and buried you face deep into her pillows. She flinches and tries to stifle a tickled laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping you close to her, she wraps one hand around your head and the other reaches for your cock to give you a nice massage to your pained lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou utter a pleasant moan as you feel her sweet milk enter you mouth. It was just as sweet as Nina's milk but this time you felt like you were drowning in marshmallow heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body gave off a feeling of warmth and cushion that made you feel more content and sleepy. Perhaps this is intentional given you and her would have to drift off to the dream land soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile nursing, the ticks of the wall clock began to go in and out making it difficult to know how long you'd be together with this fusion. You hardly could think about any of the issues happening in the news. All of that worry was being temporarily silenced by Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ejaculate a little and Jane takes that as her cue to stop stroking your cock and move on. She shuffles her legs over you and suddenly, you feel your head being buried into her chest further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't stop suckling though even as you feel your member enter her. With the warmth increasing, you let your pleasure known in your muffled noises while Jane lets out sweet breaths and touches you everywhere she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jane wanted, she could easily envelop you further using the necklace and bring the bond with you to a new climax, but despite knowing it would be wonderful, she felt a tinge of selfishness in her heart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No, her <i>hearts</i>. Knowing that a fusion like Selena would exist, more connected to you than anyone before, she didn't want the competition...not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers rang the same feeling. It was already crowded enough as is so just for a little while, they wanted to avoid a better fusion that could trump them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was funny because Jane could feel some animosity growing within her...jealous that she could be with you and was providing a much better experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, they were satisfied...<i>she</i> felt satisfied. That's because like the others, you were content and loved her just as you had loved the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cum, my boy....my dear...my love...\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to escape from the confines of her chest to breath in. You felt your hands grabbing her ass as you felt your hips peddle faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Jane!\" you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane jiggles with excitement and buries you once more, not wanting to have any bit of you outside of her. This skinship...this connection is the best thing before literally connecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping this connection, you let out a powerful grunt and let yourself go inside of her. In response, Jane melted and came too, letting out a scattered laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jane kept going as long as you could until you both remained cuddled into each other, drifting into sleep. The shared feelings, influence of all the consciousness would also drift, regaining their individualism as they follow into the mystery of the necklace.</span></div></div>",

Despite that, the mother tried to take her mind off of the necklace and small jealousy in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all her children out, Nicole cleaned up the house where she could and then watched some of her favorite dramas to help pass the time. Ultimately, she doesn't feel like she has the same energy she used to have when she was younger which adds to the desire to being part of a younger form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer son doesn't want to see her gone though and ultimately, Nicole knows that it would be irresponsible of her.

Even though the necklace is in the hands of that dastardly Emilia,  it seems we can convene to our connected parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all that bad, Angeline,\" Ellie comments with a frown, \"...besides you were the one that encouraged Emily to fuse with you which allowed my existence to be formed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and mine!\" Selena raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...except now my sweet Scott is being lured by a different fusion branch!\" Angeline growls, frustrated before she turns her attention to Nicole and points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you allow your daughter to merge with Arianna?! You can be a little selfish you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole is stunned and ignoring the fact that somehow her fusion derivatives are all in one place in such a strange congregation, she tries to defend herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't say no anymore! I'm in no position to discourage the use of necklace between my family and Arianna at this point. Besides, it can't be that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" Angeline's eyes saddens as she shakes her head, \"...it's one thing if it involves you, but now you've allowed a separate branch to form without us! We don't need to create competition within the family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie objects. \"Hey, there's hardly competition here. Just because Nicole isn't part of the fusion having fun with Scott doesn't mean Emilia is someone we should be hostile with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline sighs. \"Well, you have Emily part of you, so you would say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I approve even more!\" Selena agrees, \"...I know Scott better than any of you now and he's become more comfortable with fusions. Honestly, this should be thought as a win-win for everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Why the hell am I here?</i>' Nicole couldn't help but think as she watches the fusions argue amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Angeline cuts off before focusing on Nicole, \"...the main point is to not let us be forgotten. I want to spend as much time with Scott along with others especially since each one of us relies on the presence of Arianna. Given that she's going to college, we don't have that much time in general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...suppose,\" Nicole answers hesitantly, \"...I'm sure we'll find a way to manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so too,\" Angeline hums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence drift between the fusions and Nicole. At this point, it would be a really good time to wake up but Nicole isn't even sure how. This is rather awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cough, Selena pulls up a deck of cards. \"Well, how about a little game to pass the time while we're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

I was...weak to your advances and in some ways, I wanted to merge with you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and so we crossed a line, wanting to merge but not wanting to truly lose ourselves even further,\" Angeline recalls and leans forward, staring at the ground, \"...but the thing is...I didn't mind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your eyebrows, but she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...In this body, It felt okay. Since I'm fused with Arianna, It felt like I'm only mother in name despite being the dominant personality. I was also shaken when Gina fused with me. Her love for you was non-platonic as it was maternal. I couldn't shake that feeling off after freeing from her which only added to my weakness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe in, holding the air in.

Arianna wanted to merge with you but is it true that she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline chuckles sadly. \"She actually did enjoy the feeling of when you were Celestine, even if she was mad at being forced into it.

For a moment, you felt she\u2019s going to punch you again. But in the end, she buried her head into her hands and began sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised. In fact, you were dumbfounded and had no idea what to do. This is not the violent and agitated Arianna you remembered. In fact, now she looked as fragile as any other girl, if not more. Just then did you realized how bad everyone\u2019s been treating her: you merged with her without her consent; Nicole merged with her and repressed her personality; Rebekah and Emily didn\u2019t even meet her and just accepted the status quo.

Your crotch presses firmly against hers. She gasps, her hand running up and down the small of your back, one finally resting on your waist and then resting against your bulbous backside. The other hand traces lines along the edge of your clesvage revealing dress. She says nothing but you know she is not opposed to another merge. <br>\r\nYou reach down and unzip the side slit of her red dress, so her legs can splay apart. You push your hips up against her as she wraps her thick shapely legs around yours. Slowly, you begin to grind her. She gasps again, with a slight moan. One of your hands holds her full butt, squeezing her against you.the other caresses her lovely face. Your dark lipstick stains her neck, the dangling curl she of her up-do disturbed by your sweet, heavy breath. You press your books agianst, into hers. The necklace glows. <br>\r\nShe moans louder, feebly trying to push away before changing her mind and squeezing you against her harder. Her breasts squish and envelop yours, the pressure between your bodies producing heat and sweat. <br>\r\nHarder and harder the two of you press, the barriers between your two voluptuous bodies dissolving. She gasps again, squealing somewhat as your crotches fuse, producing an orgasmic effect.

You aren't Scott and neither are you the daughter of the apparent president of the company, DoveSoft, which is hosting this company dinner, but you feel...complete. It's like not being on either side of glass wall separating two beings. Instead, you feel like you <i>are</i> the glass wall, being able to view both sides of yourself while feeling impartial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the feeling that a fusion is more successful if one isn't dominating the other which makes sense. Collaboration is key to any success as your father, Dave would say. That's right, Dave is the president of the company and you don't feel strange considering him to be your father. Likewise, you don't feel strange to consider your other father, Scott and your only mother, Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put up a lovely smile for the rest of the guests as you stroll between the employees wearing their fancy suits, mingling with their co-workers and wives. Despite your smile, you honestly didn't want to mingle with anyone right now. As you've heard, Nicole is your only mother. Your other mother, Alicia died when you were three years old due to cancer. Being an only child, your wealthy father raised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...raise isn't the best word. He supported you and hired multiple nannies to take care of you. That's not to say he's a terrible father, but being a businessman, you're not that close to him. In fact, you really didn't want to come with him to this event, but it's important for \"presentation\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, you feel annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you aren't here now as Sabryna; you're somebody else and brings some relief to you. Thanks to your physical transformation, nobody would recognize you anyways. That aside, you think of giving yourself a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause and shake your head sadly towards yourself. No, creating a name for yourself will only make it harder when you do have to defuse. Sadness fills you similarly before you had to defuse from being Nicolet. The only difference is that you'd be together with your mother again, but being with Sabryna doesn't hold that possiblity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and cheer up. Some of your friends are here, so you'll definitely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...oh, that's right, they wouldn't recognize you. The only person you could get attention from is your mother and she would certainly learn quickly who you are since she's now familiar with the necklace.

Fortunately, you don't need to explain yourself as she quickly realizes who you are, at least partially. She turns back to the woman she was speaking to and they both excuse themselves. Nicole quickly faces you with a mixture of surprise and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-scott?

Seeing how it's no good conversing around other people, she pulls you away to somewhere more private. After coming to a less crowded hallway, she observes you, a little jealous that her son is merged with someone else. Yet, she can't feel too bad as the result is beautiful and it makes her want to know what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs and grips your hand. \"I was a little worried to be honest, sweetie. I left you naked in the stall, but that might not have been the best decision. The last thing I'd want you to become is a sex-offender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes, incredulous at your mother. \"No, of course not! He did the best thing possible and now...I've never felt more complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole is becoming more confused, especially how you are referring to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, you're confusing me. You're still my son, right? Who did you merge with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only natural she would be confused. There are tons of things you can't explain very well, but you try your best. You were hoping that your mother would be able to grasp quickly who you've become having experienced it, but it's clear that it's not that easy when looking at it from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess you could say that, but it's better to say I'm your daughter. Scott merged with Sabryna, the president's daughter and so, I'm here. I was hoping you'd understand as it's kind of hard to explain, but I...I feel like a new person. You should know the feeling after becoming Nicolet,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole takes a deep breath and places a hand to her forehead, rubbing it. \"That's...I'm not sure how to respond to that. I wasn't trying to think about what happened before, but I understand what you're getting at. It makes me worried, sweetie because I was hoping I'd get to speak with my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile reassuringly. \"You are, mom, it's just as I'm as much of Scott as I am Sabryna. I hope that make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nods and when she thought of how she felt trapped while being merged for the first time, she feels that the shared sensation she felt the second time is the better alternative. She doesn't feel right having her son trap someone's consciousness and roaming around, even if temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, at the same time, she feels scared. She loves her son, but part of her wonders if she'll lose him like this. It was okay when she was merged with him because she knows him, but her son had to merge with a complete stranger, even more dangerous, the president's daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your mother's worries, you can't help but hug her and console her. \"Don't worry, mom. It'll be alright. Whenever you're ready to leave, I'll defuse and we can be together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shivers upon her your contact which is unfamiliar. Yet, she can only trust your judgment that everything will be fine. Taking another breath, she hugs you back and kisses you on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie. Although I'm worried, I can't deny this is simply beautiful. What should I call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, having questioned yourself in regards to the name. You shake your head and back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I figured it's not right since I won't be here for long. Don't worry, just enjoy yourself, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nods and returns back to the crowd. You feel a lot better now that you have someone to understand your own existence. You are surprised to feel yourself tearing up. Perhaps it's because until now, Sabryna never had someone she could call mother. As yourself, she had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the tears away, you decide it's best to eat away at the snack table. Before that...</span></div></div>",

You gasp embarrassedly and Daniel chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to talk to you later after this,\" he requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only nod in response and start moving, not wanting to test the person's patience next to you. It doesn't take long for you to grab what you want to eat, which is mostly assorted cheese and crackers. It really isn't possible for you to hold back after seeing the variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunnily enough, you don't feel ashamed at all. Looks like neither Scott or Sabryna has to worry about their diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeting Daniel quickly, you find that he's quite shy despite the one to initiate a conversation. Even though Sabryna knew him, there isn't a lot she knew about his history. He apparently does well in his classes and is working for his Electrical Engineering degree at the same college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assumes that you're in college as well and asks where you're studying and your future career. Scott is still in High School and currently hasn't decided where he wants to study, but Sabryna is taking after her father and taking classes in finance and accounting. As such, you explain where you're going and what you plan on doing for your future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised I haven't seen you around campus before though...I mean, it's impossible to know everyone, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel chuckles nervously, feeling a little stupid now that he thought of his words, but you don't mind. If you were still Scott, you might be feeling nervous too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Now that I know your face, there's a chance we'll see each other again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the corner of your eye, you see your mother in your view and nodding away. It seems it's time she feels they need to go. As much as you enjoyed talking with Daniel, you knew that it's not possible to get too close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour existence is only temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up from the table you've been sitting at, you hum sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go now, but it's been nice to chat with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel widens his eyes and stands up. \"Ah, wait. I don't mean to pressure you or anything, but I'd really like it if we could talk with each other again. Would you be willing to exchange phone numbers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to bite your lips as you hear his interest in you. Part of you wants to exchange numbers, but the other part of you doesn't want to let things become complicated because truthfully, he won't be seeing you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you end up doing?</span></div></div>",

Why can't you remain as Gemma forever? There's nothing but positive outlook on life that you hadn't experienced before if you remain as you are. You finally have a mother, you have a huge chance with your crush, Daniel, and you can be free from your other father's obsession with presentation and work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you in deep thought, Nicole begins to worry. \"Sweetie, what's wrong? Hurry up and defuse, so we can go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't want to defuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blinks a few times to hear her son...or daughter state herself. She begins to chuckle a little, a bit more nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you saying? You know you can't keep the president's daughter! Do you realize how much trouble will occur when he realizes his daughter has gone missing? This was supposed to be just a temporary thing, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eye twitches a little as you hear your mother reject such a notion despite saying fusion is a beautiful thing to experience earlier. What bothers you the most is that she's talking as if you're still Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd understand. I'm <i>not</i> Scott, mom and I'm <i>not</i> Sabryna either. I've been forced to name myself Gemma and I've come to realize something with the few hours I've spent in this event, I shouldn't need to hold back if I want to be happy. This is something Sabryna and Scott wants...this is what <i>I</i> want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole is speechless. In the back of her mind, she actually was fearing this outcome because as Nicolet, she didn't want to defuse from her son and neither did her son, but the only consolation was that they'd be together again. If this existence Gemma is anything like Nicolet, it alarms her to see such a decision from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression softens and you give a sad smile. \"Is it wrong to have a new daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole feels like tearing up as she feels like she's losing her only son, but she decides not to panic. Despite you saying it is your decision, Nicole is certain that the girl, Sabryna has a heavy influence in your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gemma then, I'd love to have you as a daughter, but what I want right now is my son...the <i>only</i> son I have. I don't need another daughter and furthermore, it feels like you're using yourself to simply run away. How will your other father feel when he realizes that his only daughter is missing. I've spoken to him and he takes so much pride in her. Why would you want to become someone else? What about my Scott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hit hard by your mother's words. It's true, you're only thinking about yourself. You're only thinking of what benefits Scott and Sabryna, but if you remained like this, they wouldn't exist no matter how much you'd spin it and you can't change reality. A part of you knows that your mother is telling the truth and that Sabryna is simply trying to run away, yet another part of you fears never being able to experience so many events and possibilities. A new life as a new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Had it been being merged together that had grown Scott's maturity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped her chin in thought, a nervous habit that Nicole and Scott had shared, amplified by the merger as just a general gesture of thought. It was an interesting question. Plus, now as Scott being part of the complete Nicolet, she had a rather good view of what being Gemma had been like, and while it had been a similar whole feeling as being Nicolet, it was definitely a different experience. As Nicolet, she felt... whole, like two suns that had once been the same sun merging together to form an even larger, greater one than even the original. Not too dissimilar to being a mother and giving birth, she surmised, as that was exactly what Scott and Nicole were to each other. But it was more than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the merge necklace off and slipped it into her purse, for the time being making her a permanent merger of Nicolet, until such time as she put the necklace back on and wished to be Nicole and Scott again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave herself a look in the mirror and blushed at the attractive woman there. Even when Nicole had been the slightly younger woman that Nicolet appeared, she hadn't been quite so lovely. Was it Scott's handsome showing how it'd magnify as he got older? If so, he was going to age wonderfully. Or was it the part of her that was Scott being able to see and accept what an attractive woman she really was, something Nicole had kept herself from seeing. She wondered about to check this... other than perhaps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea struck her mind as she walked back out into the party, it winding down around her, as she made her way out of it and two her car. What if she merged Rebekah? Rebekah had a bombshell of a figure, and could only emphasize what Nicolet already was. Plus, would it add to the feeling she felt as Nicolet that had been similar, but absent to what Gemma had felt, or would it bring about a new third feeling? Were mergers like flavors?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid into her seat and sat her purse on the passenger seat beside her, the necklace contained within. She glanced down again at her wonderful, soft breasts, the teenage part of her heart and soul wanting to squeeze them, see what they felt like, what they were. The mature adult part of her wanted to sample the tantalizing feeling the slight sway in the tight dress held them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and started the car. So many questions... She had to get home before her husband, Daniel, and then decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

Their plump thighs, inherited from mother to daughter, and well worked calves blended perfectly, and other than a few blue veins fading away happily she'd have never known they'd blended at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole bit her bottom lip as their upper torsos met, Rebekah's large breasts and Nicole's mammoth ones melded together into a pair even larger than when she'd been Nicolet, shockingly large and dominated her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a sudden thought as their heads neared each other, Nicole slipped the necklace off and made to slip it over both women's heads, the only part of them not merged yet.</span></div></div>",

With sleepy winky cat eyes, she smiled ruefully at the mirror, asking her reflection, \"Aren't you just spankable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe debated the whole 'necklace around both heads' things, wondering if it was really necessary, but decided she had more important things to worry about. \"Like where the hell am I going to get a bra to fit these?\" She hefted her melon sized breasts, and cocked an eyebrow at her mirror, biting her lip and twisting her hips just so. Internally, Nicole and Rebekah were still integrating. For a few moments, one of them was shocked to find the other was no longer a virgin, but in pulling up the memory, it was of her own first time nearly thirty years ago, or was it the other... her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikki shook her head, which made her a tad dizzy, an inner ear problem that had kept Rebekah off the cheer-leading squad, as it had her mother, rearing it's head that Nicolet had not missed in the slightest. But it seemed to do the job, dropping the last incongruities into place, and making Rikki... well, Rikki!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug through Rebekah's closet, frowning at some of the clothing options, and rolling her eyes at the others. Deciding a loosely bound corset was probably the best way to support breasts of this size, she carefully cinched herself up, proud of her own limber joints, something Nicole had been missing in recent years. She nudged over to her makeup counter and lightly touched up her own. Not the full effect, it was getting late after all, but just enough to see how the two looked merged together. She compared herself to Nicolet, the only other merger any part of her had recently been part of, and decided that while they could pass for sisters, there was a different flavor to the rambunctious dark amber haired woman with the flashing green eyes she saw in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole sex kitten thing was ruined a bit with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she undressed again, feeling it had been a bit of a waist to get dressed in the first point, but then Nicole had been so... but she was Rikki now, not... But Rebekah had class in the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk so maybe not all the pieces had fallen into place yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly debated crawling back into her own bed, or going to her own bed down the hall... that is to say, Rebekah's or the soft snoring room down the haul that she knew Daniel was already occupying and fast asleep in that awaited Nicole.</span></div></div>",

Deciding to remain in Rebekah's room, she lies down and closes her eyes. She wants to show her son and brother the result of her fusion, but she'll figure you'll either be content to wait till morning or try to knock on her door, in which case, she has no problems having you cuddle next to her though the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes you smile a little and snuggle deeper into your pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a mother, Nicole and Nicolet's memories and feelings flows through you, bringing about a higher level of maternal love.

Every aspect of themselves mixed with each other. Their bodies morphed into a new female form. Unfortunately, Scott's clothes have already fallen off, but that was the least of their concern. With the merger almost done, they bumped into Rebekah's dresser. A picture frame fell, causing an audible thump that alerted Emily from the other side of the wall. With an annoyed yawn, she got out of bed. She is unaware of what is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Trying to sleep Bek,\" said Emily.

It's only natural she would want to keep existing, but she has to acknowledge those that comprise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, amidst some fear of losing herself, she relaxes on the bed and once again, falls asleep into a deep slumber. From there, how does she defuse?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scott groans out loud, feeling himself become more self-aware as he is pushed out from the many beautiful and busty girls he was a part of. The many feelings and sensations he felt has burnt in his mind and he feels it is unfair that the necklace has pushed him out first. Just as his naked body is splitting from his family's fused form, a new busty female comes to form as he splits from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman groans, holding her son and brother close to her as he leaves her body. Likewise, she shares Scott's disappointment as she feels like she has lost an important piece of herself. Oddly enough, she feels also renewed leaving conflicting feelings. The renewed feeling must be thanks to the fact that she is now composed of the entire female population of her family and hasn't existed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scott fully leaves the new busty woman and finally opens his eyes, he becomes aware towards the fact that yet-another beauty is in front of him who is both his mother and his sisters. She sports blond hair, brown eyes, and a smooth complexion that screamed mid-twenties. Said woman holds him close to her with her eyes still closed, trying hard not to cry at the loss of the closeness of her son. Taking a deep breath and not letting go, she opens her eyes and gives a sad smile to her son and brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott can only open his mouth in awe to see such a new form in front of him. Part of him wants to merge back with her to become Ariel but then he certainly wouldn't be able to observe any of the different combinations that were in reach thanks to the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is another problem though. He's tried to hold back long enough but naturally after becoming a girl and experiencing a shared sensation with many of his female family members, he can't help but grow erect. It doesn't help when the woman in front of him is holding his body close, causing his crotch to poke at her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this woman in front of him doesn't mind. Scott knows it as well that such matters are trivial. After merging with a majority of his family and becoming one, there's hardly anything that can bother each other after this. Everyone's secret is known and accepted which includes lust and desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Scott can only apologize. \"S-sorry...um...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman blinks for a few seconds and gasps, pulling away and composing herself. She stands straight and smiles slightly at Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s004.img.yt/big/2016/05/21/5740b2796bd18.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://s004.img.yt/big/2016/05/21/5740b2796bd18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, you're still a teenager, after all. I guess you call me Amanda, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott nods and tries to cover himself up with the bed sheets. He frowns towards the girl, feeling jealous that his sisters and mother are able to enjoy the shared sensation for a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was I the first one to defuse?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grows sympathetic and cups her son's cheek, \"I don't know, sweetie, but don't worry, after your school, we'll all come back together, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott nods, knowing that they'd be able to become whole again once more without a doubt. Still, he can't help but wallow in some impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looks at the clock and frowns. She didn't have much time to exist or talk to her son and brother. She lets out a grunt of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really sucks, but I guess I can't be wasting any time. Just...one thing so I'm more than just a memory,\" she begins and takes out a phone. She didn't care whose phone it is because it really doesn't matter at this point. There's certainly no worries of any pictures to be deleted, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could take a selfie, she stops and glances at her brother. Smirking a little, she nudges her head over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you may as well be a part of the picture too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott is embarrassed, but obeys, entering the naked woman's arm as she snuggles close to him. Extending out her other arm, she focuses the picture on her and Scott before taking a snap. Looking at the photo for a moment, she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott clears his throat. \"O-of course! We're both naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda chuckles. \"Well, I think that's to be expected more often, huh? Don't you lie to me and say you don't like it, alright? Now then, why don't you go get changed. As much as I hate it, everyone will be back to themselves and...I'm sure there's going to be a lot of questions and complaints between everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott curls his lips as his face grows red. He wonders exactly how meeting with his individual sisters will go now that they'll be aware of the necklace's powers and all the shared feelings and awareness that flowed through their many incarnations. It'll be definitely interesting and crazy, to say the least. It appears Amanda knew far more what would happen and it's at these times he wishes to merge back with everyone so that everyone's thought process is synchronized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" Scott agrees, understanding that he does have to go to school, even if he feels like skipping today. If it weren't for Rebecca and Nicole, he's certain Ariel and furthermore, Amanda wouldn't go through defusing for the sake of school. Just like with Gemma, Scott understands that while there isn't a loss of awareness or feeling of being trapped, there is a whole lot of subconscious influence that can affect judgement and personality. It's only that after he regains his own individual sense of self, he realizes how different he is as an individual than when he was part of merged entity. It's both fascinating and also frightening which is perhaps the risk in attempting a shared fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Scott left Rebecca's room and Amanda. With more privacy, Amanda closes her eyes and sadly lets herself defuse.</span></div></div>",

She smiled, as she split into the people that comprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There, lying in bed, was a mother and her two daughters. They panted a little. Nicole's sweat dribbled down from her forehead. She wiped it off wither hand. Her palm smelled of perfume. It felt like she gave birth all over again. Her body ached with minor pain. She figured it was due to being merged with more than one person. She was glad to not have a pair of breasts that could rip a shirt in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her daughters were quiet. Emily moved a bit to readjust her posture. Rebekah placed her hands on her chest. A gentle sigh escaped her mouth, coupled with a blush. Her relationship with her mom and siblings will never be the same. She felt a little disgust about it. However, just like everyone else, she felt saddened about being apart. But, she knew that they can go back to being Ariel as many times as they want. Naked, cold, and wanting answers, she was afraid to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Girls,\" said Nicole. She covered her chest with her arm. \"Get dressed.

She laid on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It will stay with me. Don't worry about it.\" replied Nicole. She knew how her daughter felt. The amount of sensations and feelings was overwhelming. It was also frightening to think about it. But, this can pay off in the end if they know how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay mom. I understand.\" said Rebekah. \"Come on Emily. I'll drop you and Scott off.\" Emily nodded. She remained silent after this event. It was unheard of. She left her sister's room to change into her school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey mom?\" said Rebekah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes dear.\" replied Nicole. She could tell that her daughter had quite the night. \"Go on.\" She smiled as she laid on her side as well. Some of the makeup smeared on the mattress cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That, was the most weirdest thing that we've ever done. I don't know what else to say.\" Rebekah scratched her head. \"I felt, different.

Sorry about that.\" Rebekah returned the expression. She got out of bed and proceeded to get ready for her morning class at her local college.</span></div></div>",

As Amanda, it was okay.\" Emily munched on the last bit of food in front of her. \"Sorry.\" She left the kitchen to brush her teeth. Looking at the necklace in her hand, she shivered. She remembered the feeling of becoming one with her family. She grunted as she walked upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, come on.\" you said. You shook your glass of orange juice. \"That's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Scott. You know the rules.\" Nicole kissed your cheek. Gathering up the plates, she begins washing dishes. \"Rebekah, drive safe okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I will mom.\" replied Rebekah. She burped after finishing her glass of water. \"Excuse me.\" She chuckled as she ruffled your hair. \"Come on little brother.\" Rebekah's teasing brought a small smile to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Take care now.\" said Nicole. She hummed as she continued to wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is 6:12am. Before leaving the driveway, Rebekah received a text from her classmate. It was Sabryna, the woman that Scott met last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Class got canceled due to Mr. Skylar getting sick in such short notice.</i> Rebekah said in thought. \"Well guys, I don't have a class today. I'm free until 11:30am. My instructor is sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Bek,\" said Emily. \"Scott, stop leaning on me.\" Emily would have pushed you away but, she didn't mind. She found herself cuddling with you. You shifted your weight, allowing her to lean on you instead. \"Uh, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You guys, what are you doing?\" Rebekah chuckled at such childish actions. \"Aw, little Emily likes her brother now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bek, I know you want to do this too.\" you said. Smirking, you laid eyes on hers in the rear view mirror. You laughed at her expression of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott, shut up.\" Rebekah smiled, knowing it was true. \"Okay, I admit it. But, this whole merging thing is still new to me.\" Rebekah started the engine, letting it warm up before driving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Since you guys won't have class until 7:45am, you guys want to relax for a bit?\" asked Rebekah. \"It's only 6:15am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Like what?\" asked Emily. She clung onto your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott, I know how much you want to use necklace so, let's merge ourselves together.\" said Rebekah. Surprised, you wanted to lean forward. You held yourself back, not wanting to hurt Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you serious?\" Overjoyed, you looked at Emily. \"How about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But mom will know about this,\" said Emily. \"Are you sure? I'm still new to this too.\" She grew worried. Unlike her older siblings, she is reluctant about this. However, a part of her doesn't mind. As long as it's just them together, there shouldn't be any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's okay. It will just be us, right Scott?\" Like Nicole, Rebekah gave you that look. After becoming Ricolet, she knows all to well about your own desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I promise.\" you said. Even though it feels unfair, you knew why. \"So, how are we going to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have an idea.\" Rebekah drove to her neighborhood center and parked in the lot. \"Give me the necklace sis.\" said Rebekah. \"Okay, I remember how hard mom was trying to make the necklace work for her.\" Rebekah wore the necklace around her neck. \"Maybe, I can merge us together at the same time. That way, we don't have to wear it around our necks. Seriously, that's just waiting time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, deal,\" you said. \"Ready Emily?\" You smiled at her. Merging with both of your sisters excited you. Perhaps, a bit too much. Downstairs, you felt erect. <i>Damn it, again?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess. But, let's just keep it to ourselves okay?\" Emily tugged on your arm. \"I don't want to merge with anyone else. Also, can you do something about our clothes sliding off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Got it.\" said Rebekah. \"Time to become a, <i>single child</i> guys.\" She chuckled as she focused. The necklace let out a dim glow before it became brighter. You and Emily were drawn to it like magnets. Touching Rebekah, all three of you started to merge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your bodies twisted, turned, and morphed into a new form. Several groans were heard. All three of you continued to come together as the body of a single female took shape. Long legs, a good tan, dark amber hair, all were attached to a amalgamation of a brother and his sisters. With Rebekah's figure taking dominance, the girl's breasts felt tight underneath her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ow,\" she said. \"If only we can fix this pain too.\" She moaned. Closing her eyes, the sensation and feelings of being a brother and two sisters was enough to get her excited. \"Damn, I thought this happened when I defused.\" She began to touch her chest, careful not to arouse herself too much. She moaned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I look fine. Holy smokes, okay pervert. Stop.\" She shook her head. Clearing her throat, she noticed her attire. \"Really? I thought they were fused together.\" Blair wore a serafuku, a Japanese school uniform. It consisted of a long sleeve black top with a yellow scarf, a grey skirt, black knee-high socks, and black high heels. Blair turned around. Your clothes were lying on the floor, along with Emily's. On her lap, laid Rebekah's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatever, I need to make use of the time I got.\" As usual, the sudden sadness of defusing made her reluctant. But she knows the complications and dangers of staying as she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No worries Blair,\" she said. \"You will be complete again later.\" With a smile, Blair drove off. </span></div></div>",

More importantly, you received a few emails from Sabryna, writing an apology to you and your mother as well as asking when and where you'd be available. It's clear that she wants to spend more time with you and honestly, you can't help but grin stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, the girl is six years older than you, but you'll be turning 18 soon and legally speaking, it should be fine. Erica is the first to notice your stupid grin and she doesn't have to even look at your phone screen to see what you're thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabryna, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finch and you see Rebecca catching interest as well as her eyes widen from the reflection of the rear-view mirror. Even though she's not saying anything and focusing on the road, it's clear that she's interested as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you-Oh right...fusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you aren't fused with anyone, you're not aware of each person's memories and feelings, but those memories never leave if you shift through them. Essentially, each person has a copy of everyone's memories they fused with recursively. As embarrassing as it is, you knew that being forever open and losing your sense of privacy is a sacrifice to merging with your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica hums and stares at you with an amused smile. \"So, it's clear that you like her, right? Even though she must be at least six years older than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. \"You should already know the answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica pauses. Once again, having fused with Scott in some fashion through another, she does have the answer after thinking upon it. She chuckles, feeling silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course you would after merging with her and not wanting to defuse. Still, I think you should forget about her. It'll be easy for us to fuse anytime we want because we're family and we live in the same house, but it's not going to be as easy for others outside,\" she warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrow your eyes and curl your lips. \"You sound like mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we all became mom at some point, right?\" Rebecca quipped from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum in deep contemplation. That's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her throat, Erica continues. \"Anyways, I have to agree with mom, though. I don't want to see my only brother be influenced by such a selfish girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little surprised to hear such concern from your little sister. Although you and she were on good terms before, she rarely has shown much familial affection compared to your older sister and mother. Perhaps it's because she's a little younger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the rare show of concern, you couldn't let her comments move pass. If she has the memories of Gemma and subsequently, Sabryna, she should know easily that's not true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not selfish, Emily. I'll admit that back then, my sense of self was flooded by Sabryna, but you should know what kinds of feelings she held. Honestly, she leads quite a boring life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca hums, adding her own opinions to the mix as she closes up to the school. \"I do agree that she's not a bad girl, but I have a feeling she's just a bit insecure and who can blame her. Anyways, I could be wrong, but I think she's in one of my classes! I know what she looks like thanks to Scott, so if I get the chance, maybe I can invite her over for dinner? Dad's not going to be back for a little while, so we can definitely afford someone over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica's eyes widen. \"W-what? Isn't that a bad idea? Won't mom disagree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you're shocked by the possibility of meeting Sabryna sooner, but you recognize that there are some worries amongst your family. It appears that Nicole's worries and fears are being mirrored through Erica and only Rebecca expresses differently from the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca hums in thought as she pulls up to the curb. \"She already knows about the necklace and furthermore, if she fused with Scott, then she knows about us as his sisters. Even if I don't approach her, she'll definitely be approach me since I'm almost positive she's in one of my classes, if not college. After fusing and becoming a part of something new, don't you think it's unfair to deny a person who has already experienced that? I think all that's required is some mutual understanding, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's clear Rebecca is far more open to the idea of fusing than Erica or Nicole is which is honestly relieving. Seeing how it's time to head to school, the oldest sister urges her siblings to move out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not think too hard about it. I want to fuse with you both so much right now, but I think we need some breathing space for a little while, right? For now, try to avoid revealing too much information to Sabryna until you hear from mom or me. I think we all agree that merging with anyone isn't something that's wise at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Erica nod, agreeing on that note. That isn't to say you wouldn't merge with a hot girl given the chance, but you recognize that you should probably keep yourself in check for the sake of preventing another incident where you might completely lose yourself without even realizing it when becoming a new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the day continues. What happens?</span></div></div>",

It was still quite early. About 30 minutes were left before class. You and Emily sat down by a table underneath a tree. You heard the maintenance staff cutting see bushes nearby. Looking back at Emily, she was eating an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still hungry?\" you said. She nodded as she chewed. You can the crunch as she took another bite. The wind wafted the apple's scent towards you. It was sweet, fresh out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you have any more of that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott, you just ate.\" said Emily. \"You literally mopped your plate before we left.\" She took another bite. You became hungrier by the second. Looking at you, she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, fine. Here.\" Reaching in her lunch bag, she took out another apple. However, she toppled her school bag. It's contents spilled out. \"Great.\" As the both of you gathered her things up, you notice an obvious item on the ground. The necklace was in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily,\" you whispered. \"You took the necklace with you?\" You looked at her as if she committed a crime. Emily put on a face of innocence before telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I asked mom if I can keep it with me for awhile.\" she said. \"All because, it felt nice being merged with all of you. Including you Scott. I don't want to lose you to Sabryna.\" Emily grunted as she stood up. Her expression turned to sadness as the thought of losing you filled her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily,\" you said. \"It's okay. That will never happen. I promise.\" You wiped off some tears that trickled down her cheek. You placed your hand on her shoulder. You smiled, knowing that you can finally use the necklace again. However, you will need her approval. Instead, you asked her if she will use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott, I'm going to be naked after being merged together.\" she said. \"Also, I promised mom that we cannot merge with someone else like that. She doesn't like it but, if we really want to merge with someone, we can only merge our bodies together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" You groaned. \"The first time I did that with mom, it didn't work.\" You frowned. \"Okay, justerge with me then. We have time, come on.\" You took Emily's hand and lead her upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott, now? We'll be in the nude.\" Emily protested. She does not want anyone to see them as a single naked person. \"Can we at least go somewhere private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, right here.\" You and Emily went into the science lab. Locking the door and closing the blinds, you hugged your little sister. \"Emily, thank you.\" The feeling was hard to resist. Emily only smiled as she hugged you back. She snuggled as you shook her gently. \"Let's see if we can keep some of our clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay.\" she said. \"Let's make it quick. I don't want anyone to come in and see us.\" Emily brought the necklace out of her bag. Wearing it on both your necks, she hugged you again. The need to be together with her brother, the feeling of being protective of him, the desire to become one. All of this made the necklace glow as the merger started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her short body melded with yours. Pressed against each other, some clothes slid right off. Her chest joining with yours, her legs blended with your own. You felt her fit yet petite physique working yours up. You put up a physical struggle, but you became erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-Sorry.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's okay,\" said Emily. \"I don't mind.\" She smiled. She knows how hard it was but, that was nothing compared to being together with you. At least, temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You start to feel stronger and flexible as a new female body formed. It looked like Rebekah's, but smaller. Smooth light skin, a modest pair of breasts, dark red hair. All attached to a cute body with a face that held two aqua colored eyes. It seems Emily might have inherited Nicole's looks in her teens. Or, it could've been due to you aging into a fine man fit for a princess in the foreseeable future. You closed your eyes as your sense of self faded. With the merger done, you opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/wqpHZHB.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/wqpHZHB.jpg</a></div></span></div></div>",

Not only that, she kept up with her studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Brains and brawn.</i> Like dad would say.\" You took a photo of yourself. It, joining the many photos of merged incarnations that would soon fill it up to the brim. \"How many more combinations can we make?\" Before you could think, you looked at the time. You had around 20 minutes left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This really sucks,\" you said. \"I want to stay like this a little longer.\" As Ariel and the others, defusing was accompanied by sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I can't. I wish I could though. So much things to explore now that I'm merged together.\" You paused. Along the lines of what you just said, reminded you about what happened last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no. Get a grip Selina.\" You sat on the floor. \"This is why mom is worried. This is why, <i>I'm</i> worried. How could I forget that?\" You remember what Emily said. She doesn't want to lose her only brother. Scott is irreplaceable. There is no other person like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right.\" You stood up. \"Being merged together has its perks but, nothing beats a brother and sister hug.\" You chuckled and snorted. \"I'm such a dork.\" Rubbing the necklace in your hands, you closed your eyes. Defusing not with sadness but, with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started to groan. Your sense of self as Scott returns. Being pushed away from your sister, you hugged her. She did the same. No tears were shed after splitting apart. However, embarrassment took hold when you looked at yourselves. This time, all clothes have slid off. You sighed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I really hate that,\" you said. \"At least it worked for awhile.\" You put your clothes back on as Emily did the same. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine Scott,\" she smiled. \"Thank you, I needed that.\" Fully clothed, she gave you one last hug. You kept her close to you. Being able to share this experience between two people. It helped you and her better understand each other. Knowing your faults and how to fix them. Remembering all the good things and bad things. Merging with your sister brought a good deal of positive outlook, should the both of you merge again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We should get going,\" said Emily. \"You have a test today.\" You nodded. With the door unlocked and opened, you and Emily went your separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was 7:57am. Your first class was biology. You finished your test with no problem. The amount of studying you did prior to this helped you. Done, your teacher let you out to a small field in front of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Time to relax.\" You sat in the shade by a tree. It's bark felt warm. Some of it chipped off when you laid your backpack beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good old tree. Wait a minute.\" You felt something on your chest. It was hard and smooth in the middle. Looking down, you saw the necklace hanging on your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, that's why some of the girls were giggling.\" You flicked it with your finger, producing a dull sound. \"A promise is a promise. If I merge with someone right now, I need to be better at just merging our bodies together.\" You rubbed the necklace with your thumb. You see more of your classmates leaving. Some hung out by a table, another small group was by a large rock. You saw a girl with glasses reading a book, while another one was on her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Time to practice. But how?</i> You thought about. The first time you tried this fusion, ended up as a failure. Again, you felt cheated by the necklace. <i>I need this to work.</i> The bell rang, signaling a short passing. You gripped the necklace as you went to your history class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>How should I do this?</i> you thought. <i>I'm making this hard for myself.</i> You played with your pencil.

Who will you merge with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Merge?\" said an unknown voice. You turned around to see a girl coming out of the restroom. \"Oh, um, sorry.\" She rushed back in, embarrassed. She doesn't know what you meant but, she figured it was private. You stood there in shock, hoping she will forget this. </span></div></div>",

The pungent smell caught you off guard for awhile. The necklace jingles as you walked in. Going in front of a mirror, you washed your face. The dirt from outside was from the maintenance staff doing more yard work. You wiped your face and threw the paper towel away like a basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hope that girl forgets. Otherwise I have to merge with her and make her pretend it's a dream.\" You rubbed your chin. It was smooth with some facial oil. Looking at your face, you wondered if you will look much better in the future. As Nicolet, that thought ran around your head like a track runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wonder if Sabryna thought the same when we were Gemma?\" You leaned on the sink. Looking at your phone, Sabryna was emailing you once again. This time, it was about being invited to your house for dinner. She accepted the invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes!\" you said. Your heart felt like it melted. \"Okay man, don't get too excited,\" you said. \"She's older than you. She's a woman and your still a boy. I hope I can date her.\" You smirked. \"Damn it, of course you can. Who will stop you? Mom? Emily?\" You thought about it. If you can't date her then, can you at least merge with her again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah,\" you smiled. \"Perfect idea.

It looked like a herd of animals at a watering hole. Students lined up to pick up their meals. It was baked chicken with gravy today. Picking up a plate, you sat down near a wall. Emily was waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Little sister,\" you greeted her. \"So how's your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Boring.

Hey.\" Emily smiled as you swiped another apple that she took out from her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You missed me.\" You teased her, bringing a much bigger smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott, people will see us like this.\" Emily said. \"Plus, my friends think it's weird that I like you.\" Emily took a bite of her chicken. The gravy was warm and just right for her taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing wrong, you're my sister.\" The crunch from the apple was pleasing. \"Also, I got an idea about me and Sabryna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hm?\" Emily's mouth was full. All she could do was listen and chew. She swallowed with worry. \"Merge with her again? Scott, don't repeat what happened last night.\" she protested. \"We almost lost you for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Relax, that's not going to happen again. I promise.\" Emily squeezed your hand before being gentle. \"Emily, don't worry. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You better,\" she warned. \"Sabryna's old crush was that Drake guy. How can I deal with the both you being with him? Yuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emily's comments about that probable event sickened you. You gulped down some orange juice. As Gemma, Sabryna was happy to have a mother, family, and a new identity. You and her felt confident, but for the wrong reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry, we won't end up with him.\" you said. Finishing up your meals, the both of you leave. Some of Emily's friends saw you both walking side by side. They smiled, thinking that you might be a good brother to her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As lunch continued to march on, you and Emily went to your next class; piano. Inside the building, there were several electronic pianos at the side. An old fashioned grand piano was situated in the middle of the room. You and Emily set aside your bags and sat in front of it. Pressing a key, the piano produced a gentle sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, we got time to become Selina if you want.\" You nudged your sister. \"Maybe you can impress--ow, okay!\" Emily pinched your side like a crab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm starting to hate that, <i>I know everything about you</i> part.\" After pinching you, she gave you a hug. \"So much for working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just talk to him then. Or, you can merge with me and get rid of your shy--uh?\" Emily grabbed you by the collar of your shirt. \"Right. Sorry,\" you fixed your shirt. \"Just a suggestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well guess what? If we do that, and he hits on us, you will regret it.\" Her serious look reminded you about that problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right. Got it.\" You felt uncomfortable about that. \"Well, how about we just merge right here before the bell rings? Our classmates won't arrive until lunch is over.\" You wrapped your arm around her. \"Then, we can just unfuse ourselves when the bell rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, let's do it.\" Emily sat on your lap. Her back was facing towards you. \"Ready.\" Nodding your head, you wore the necklace around both your necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The merger was smooth. Emily's legs sanked into yours. Her torso did the same. Both of you see the same breasts that are a little bigger than her own. Strong yet slender arms formed as the familiar feeling of flexibility took hold. Lastly, your heads merged together. Your mind joined with Emily's. Her experiences, emotions, memories were shared with yours, as the both of you turned into Selina once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perfect,\" you said. \"But, what should I do now? Go outside as this?\" You thought about it. As Gemma, you thought the same way due to Sabryna. Although, you hate to admit it, you wanted to explore something else besides being a new person. You shook your head. The Emily part of you felt like rolling her eyes. \"Pervert.\" Looking at the time, at least 20 minutes has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess that's a plan. No one will recognize me. Perfect.\" You smiled.

Friends were socializing as teachers came by to pick up their food. Some security guards were on duty. Food fights will not be tolerated. Outside, students were walking around. Some went to the library to do homework. Others just stayed in their classes to pass the time. Just another day at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Still, it's a Monday.</i> The thought never escaped you. <i>Whatever, I need to enjoy this before time runs out.</i> You walked in the hallways. Several boys took notice. You ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I guess Scott isn't the only one. Gross, if I were to tell them the truth...</i> You made a sickening expression. <i>Not gonna happen. I have to be careful about this. Then again, no one will know me.</i> You quickened your steps until you bumped into Allen, Emily's crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! Sorry!\" A rush of nervousness rushed through you. <i>No, it's just like with Drake. Damn it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I should be saying sorry instead.\" Allen is a member of the volleyball team. Tall and tanned, his brown eyes reminded Emily of chocolate. That makes sense due to his polite attitude. \"You remind me of someone.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, sorry. I'm Em--\" You stopped. <i>Don't you dare. Emily, you really need to work on this.</i> \"Sorry, I'm Selina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi, I'm Allen.\" He stuck out his hand. You shook it, being polite. \"You remind me of a girl that I like.\" The sudden sentence made you attentive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I bet she's cute.\" You laughed, knowing it to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not only that, she takes care of herself. Also, it seems that she and her brother are sharing a moment right now.\" Allen leaned against the wall. \"It must be a phase. I hope nothing bad happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Dude, if you were to use this thing around my neck, you would understand.</i> \"Maybe. It's a brother sister thing.\" you smiled, feeling calm. \"What's her name?\" You blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Her name is Emily. Why? Are you her cousin?\" Allen chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I'm her but, I'm also her brother too.</i> \"No, I'm her friend.\" You cleared your throat. It was hard to contain yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cool. Anyway, I should get going. Nice to meet you Selina.\" Allen shook you hand once again. He left the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I want to scream. If only I wasn't merged together right now.</i> You grinned. Emily has a huge chance to be with Allen now. You continued walking around the campus.

She parked her car and sets up the sun shade. The day will be warm for awhile. Not an inch of rain has fallen. Getting out, she spotted a person walking out of the parking lot. It was Sabryna. Her red Hawaiian styled sun dress danced in the light wind. Rebekah kept her distance, forming a plan on how to invite her for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How should I talk to her?\" Rebekah said to herself. \"Maybe somewhere along the lines, <i>hi Sabryna. I'm Rebekah, Scott's sister. Would you like to come over for dinner?\"</i> Rebekah paused. \"Maybe I should've planned ahead for this.\" Rebekah hummed, trying hard to think. If it not for the rising temperature, she would've stayed there. Giving up for now, she left for her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Sabryna Boon, daughter of Dave Boon, the President of Dovesoft.

I shouldn't risk it.\" Rebekah reminded herself about Gemma. She almost lost you, her only brother. As she kept walking, a sudden downpour rough relief to the parched ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Darn it.\" Rebekah ran towards the center office building. \"Great, my dress is darker.\" Rebekah wiped her face. Her own blue dress was stained with dark patches of water. Looking at her watch, she had around 22 minutes left before her class starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I, am so glad my class is nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excuse me,\" said Sabryna. \"Are you Rebekah?\" Sabryna walked up behind her. \"Scott's sister right?\" She caught her off-guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Right.

To be honest, although she knows what Sabryna looks like in her mind, it's a little surprising to see how beautiful she is <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/Elle/2016/08/18/97125/GettyImages-532060404a.jpg\">in person</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/Elle/2016/08/18/97125/GettyImages-532060404a.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> and the fusion that is Gemma is equally beautiful in her own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight feeling of jealousy stirs within Rebecca, but she knows that she is 4 years younger than this girl which means she has plenty of time to grow and mature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning a little, Rebecca fakes confusion. \"Um...how do you know my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna widens her eyes a little and it appears that she is reminded that she hasn't met her sister, even if it feels like she did thanks to Scott's memories. She recomposes herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, he was at my father's business event yesterday with his mother. I remember hearing your name being mentioned and I recall having you in one of my classes,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca hums internally, pleasantly surprised how smooth she's explaining herself. Clearly, she's a person who had to get on stage many times before and communicate a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca feigns surprise and smiles warmly. \"I see, I'm guessing you're my senior, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna nods, \"Yes, this is actually my last year. Anyways, I just wanted to chat with you. Maybe after our class, would you like to have a coffee together? I'll pay. I hope this isn't awkward or anything since we're just meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Rebecca never had time to make new friends in college. Everyone was moving around too fast, doing their own things. She can only hang out in her own personal circle, but even that is limited thanks to how spread out her friends is from her classes. Although she knows enough of this girl's personality, she can honestly say that this girl needs a friend as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this girl does concern her in regards to her brother, there's no denying she's a good person who is frustrated with her life, at best. Plus, it will be good to keep an eye on her since she was also affected by the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProviding a welcoming smile, Rebecca hums positively. \"Sure thing. I can't say no to free coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Rebecca can't help but feel glad that she has an hour before her next class or else she wouldn't have been able to meet up with Sabryna so quickly. Naturally, there's a Starbucks on campus. Being the less than wealthy individual she is, Rebecca happily takes the coffee that Sabryna offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I'm assuming you talked with my brother. Is there something that piqued your interest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sabryna's smile falters for a moment and she blushes a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...well, to be honest, I thought he was a really sweet guy. I'll be straight-forward with you, but we've exchanged numbers and...I'd just like to really get to know him and his whole family, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's definitely not creepy at all,\" Rebecca quips. Although saying that, she understands what Sabryna is going through. It's just that she can't allow her to get any ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being offended, Sabryna takes the quip well and chuckles. \"Maybe. I'm not sure what's going over with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>You absolutely do</i>,' Rebecca thinks, amused how Sabryna thinks she's playing her for a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking...probably, but you do realize my little brother is four years younger than you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna seems to know that quite well and holds herself from going into a defensive mode. \"I do, I'm not blind, but...there's just...something about your brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a moment of silence before it appears that Sabryna decides to change the subject. She smiles brightly again and decides to talk more about the person in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough about him, I guess. It's rude of me to talk about your brother right before getting to know you. What's your major here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca knows Sabryna already has the answer, so she decides to lie, just to see her reaction. Her major is actually Biology, ironically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accounting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna isn't able to help but raise an eyebrow, but quickly adjusts her expression. \"Oh...um...I see. Why accounting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Rebecca feels guilty for misleading this girl because it seems that she's becoming quite uncomfortable with the conflict within her own mind. Regardless, she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother was formerly an accountant before she decided to work as a consultant in her leisure time. I became interested in it, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a solid reasoning, but Sabryna seems to not enjoy this difference. Although it might be rude to doubt someone's major, she couldn't help but question it by wording herself carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just that...I'm sure that your brother mentioned you being interested in Biology?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well I am, but I decided Accounting would be a more realistic career choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe composes herself well. Truly a president's daughter. All this idle chat is only going to make her feel guilty now if she keeps testing her like this. It's clear that she means no harm, but if she approached her, then who is to say she won't approach you directly? She could easily retrieve the company directory of employees and find the house address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, she decides to go to school and meet up with Rebecca instead. If she's this cautious and perhaps, considerate, maybe keeping her within the loop won't be bad. Perhaps she learned to be more accepting of who she is than to try running away. It's clear she still wants to meet you again and no doubt fuse, but maybe it won't be so one-sided last last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also a hint of jealousy within Rebecca. Ever since fusing with Scott in some form, her sisterly love for her brother has risen. It's hard to explain, but she wants to be with her brother. If the feeling is the same within Sabryna, it could grow to dangerous results if left untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Rebecca proceed?</span></div></div>",

While Rebecca doesn't blame you, she recognizes that this kind of fusional relationship is better off coming to terms and accepting so that it is more difficult to lose the individual sense of self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Rebecca decides to come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...actually, you're right. Sorry for lying, but my major is in biology. I was just...testing you, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna slowly widens her eyes. Although she feels a little upset, she quickly understands the situation based on Rebecca's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, then that means you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca shamefully nods her head. \"Yeah...that little twerp fused with all of us...except for my father. He left for a fishing trip and maybe that's for the best, right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's was now Sabryna's turn to take a deep breath. Her face lights up and it doesn't appear that she is the least repulsed by the fact. She leans forward and grabs Rebecca's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thank goodness! I....I really wasn't sure if it was right to approach you, but I just...I felt like I had to when I realize you were in one of my classes. This may sound weird, but...it almost feels like you're my sister, if that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looks around, hoping that they weren't causing a scene, but it appears they were just quiet enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it's the same. I'm sorry for misleading you, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna cuts in, knowing exactly the concerns Rebecca is feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking, Rebecca. What happened at the company gather last night was...my own selfishness. I'm more aware that I can't run away, even if I feel like running away from my problems. I won't lie though, I want to...fuse with Scott. I want to fuse with you now! I just want to be a part of this beautiful magic that comes with the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca can't help but feel excited herself thanks to the perspective of Sabryna. It completely matches her own line of thinking and she wonders if that's due to the necklace affecting their minds. It can't be that everyone that is merged would accept this like it's a beautiful course of nature, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing herself, she tries to quiet the rich girl. \"I get it, but...I'm being honest with you here in hopes that you understand and be discrete about all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rebecca smiles. \"Well, I guess this means you're an official part of our family as we are to yours. There may be some bumps and I'm sure everyone will get mad at me, but I can tell you that Scott wants to merge with you too. Just don't try to go after that crush of yours, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna blinks for a few seconds before chuckling. \"Actually, I'm over him. If you merged with Scott, you should know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca grins. \"Oh, let me rephrase that. Aside from merging with your <i>new</i> crush, keep your hands off of him until his birthday, next month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna raises an eyebrow. \"That's a conflict of interest, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a much more invigorating talk and discussion with Sabryna, Rebecca knew that she'd be taking her over to her house. Compared to you and Emily, Rebecca and Sabryna both finished with their classes sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much anticipation, Rebecca and Sabryna arrive at your house.

It it weren't for her personal problems in the past, this would not have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alicia was it?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. She was my mother. Even though I was only three years old, I miss her. I've seen her video journals.\" Sabryna felt like crying. \"But, I was raised by nannies when my father wasn't available. You, remind me of her.\" Nicole allowed Sabryna to rest her head on her shoulder. \"When I was Gemma, it was so amazing. It felt like all of my problems have gone up in smoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sabryna, you are a strong and successful young woman. When I pleaded for you both to defuse, you complied. As I've said before, your father takes so much pride in you.\" Nicole hugged her tight. \"I hope that you understand the consequences if you two were to remain as Gemma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do. I want to thank you for that.\" Sabryna wiped her tears away. Her troubles felt like unneeded memories. \"I feel so much better now. It really felt like I was talking to my mom instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, when you became Gemma, I <i>am</i> your mother.\" She smiled. \"Anyway, will you be going with Rebekah soon?\" Nicole asked. \"I'm sure Scott would love to see you again. However, I must warn you about Emily. Rebekah texted me that she was being overprotective of him after what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh no. Say it isn't so.\" Sabryna frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, it is indeed. It's quite all right though. She will understand.\" Nicole rubbed Sabryna's back. She still felt cold. \"Look at you, we're talking in such a chilly place. You're cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, sorry. I forgot my jacket in Rebekah's car.\" Sabryna chuckled. \"Maybe, I should borrow one of your sweaters. I just like the feeling of wool against my skin. It feels so cozy.\" Sabryna tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know how you feel.\" Nicole smiled as the two women were enjoying this chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebekah brushed her hair. It smelled of grapefruit, gardenia, amber and vanilla. She looked over herself. Her fair skin, her gorgeous eyes, her overall appearance screamed of a wonderful woman that any man would love to go near. She smiled and winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can't believe that little twerp has a girlfriend,\" she said. \"I guess it's for the best. Especially since we have that thing now.\" Rebekah took out a pair of jeans. She slid one leg one by one and buttoned it up. She reminded herself about last night, when she was fused with you. \"I can't believe we wore that before fusing with Emily. Oh my God Scott, you were...\" Rebekah couldn't say it. With everyone merge together that night, it was shocking to know each and everyone's secrets was being shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, it makes sense. I became Rikki, then we became Ricolet and Ariel later. I really loved that purple dress on us. Damn, we were...\" Rebekah stopped talking. \"Just get dressed girl, they're waiting for you.\" With a final check in the mirror, she was ready to go. Leaving her room, she overheard her mother and Sabryna. She froze in place. She was shocked. She didn't know that Nicole was home all along. She is glad that both women were enjoying each others company. She sighs with a smile. It felt as if she really does have a new sister. She left her room, ready to pick you and Emily up from school.</span></div></div>",

That connection though remained and it felt like a missing piece of the puzzle, begging to be fitted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing the necklace probably doesn't help that urge as it amplifies the feeling to be one, though Nicole didn't know it. Even though she tried to remain composed and enjoy talking about each other's life, it's nothing compared to becoming each other's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Sabryna felt the same urge though it was not as strong as Nicole, perhaps since she's not the one wearing the necklace. Though, if she were asked to merge, she knew there would be no greater pleasure than merging with a mother figure she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they take the opportunity to merge?</span></div></div>",

Although their talk was nice, she isn't able to ward off this feeling to become one with this beautiful girl and it's certainly not helped by the necklace she thought she was keeping safe. In the end, she can't help but break her own rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing something wrong, Sabryna cocks her head and furrows her eyebrows in concern. \"Is...there something wrong, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opens her mouth and places a hand on the girl's hand. \"I'm sorry for being so blunt and I feel bad since I wanted to prevent any merging until we all got this straightened out, but...would you like to merge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna widens her eyes and the words come out of her mouth much less composed. \"Oh god yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling back, the girl puts a hand over mouth and grows flushed at her sudden loss of composure. Nicole chuckles a little, unable to blame her for reacting in such a way. Rather, she feels more ashamed over her own lack of self-control, but is happy that Sabryna is more than willing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" Sabryna apologizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand to her shoulder in comfort, Nicole breathes an easy sigh of relief. \"That's alright dear. Let's head to my room. I'm a terrible hypocrite for this, but I'm sure that everyone will be pleasantly surprised when we greet them, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I would hope so,\" Sabryna smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their intentions made clear, they move into Nicole's bedroom and take their clothes off. Although it was embarrassing to strip in a stranger's home, Sabryna is unable to hold her anticipation. She really wanted to merge with Scott, but becoming his mother also is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna feels ashamed. In some ways, this is wrong but also feeling more connected to Scott through the person who raised him makes her all the more excited. In fact, she wanted to merge with the whole family and truly be a part of something beautiful. She doesn't have any sisters, so she's eternally grateful for Nicole, Rebekah, and even Scott for giving her this chance to feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she's getting ahead of herself a little here. For now, Nicole is offering her the second chance to merge with someone. With both of them naked, Nicole can't help but feel some form of motherly love for this girl who should've been no more than a stranger, but has already become close. Now...they would become even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her arms, Nicole motioned. \"I don't understand this necklace too well, but let's just both hold each other and relax, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabryna shivers and nods, hesitantly entering Nicole into a hug. This should've felt more than awkward, but it didn't. To be able to have a mother to even hug is something that she couldn't dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her arms around the petite girl, she takes a deep breath and holds her tightly against her. Feeling their will to merge sync perfectly, the necklace glows and lets each of their bodies pull into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore each of them knew, their consciousness begins to fade and their bodies begin to form into a mass of flesh. Sabryna and Nicole is unable to help but groan, their voices synchronizing as their bodies and mind come together, forming a new perfect being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you invite her? I still don't like this.\" Emily lamented to Rebekah as they park the car in front of house and walking to their front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebekah shrugs. \"Let's not be naive here, this girl is essentially part of our family now. While we need to careful in the future, we can't ignore the damage that was done. Instead, we'll figure out how we'll manage and what to do from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were estatic to hear that you would be seeing Sabryna again. Not only was she gorgeous by herself, the thought of having a chance with her invigorated you. You're normally a shy kind of guy, so to be able to have a non-familial relationship made you giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the truth would be far more complicated than you realized as someone completely different than your mother or Sabryna showed herself to greet you and your sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.foxhq.com/xenia-wood-more-busty-pics/4.jpg\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://www.foxhq.com/xenia-wood-more-busty-pics/4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Rebekkah, and Emily all widen your eyes at this busty brunette greeting you. The woman expected such reactions and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain everything, but please come in already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your mouth, you and your sisters enter carefully. Rebekah could immediately guess who this woman is comprised of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Nicole and Sabryna?\" Rebekah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hums as she begins to set the table, acting as if her presence was completely normal. \"Yes, I've decided on the name Sierra, but I'd like it if you all continue to call me mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this right? Give me back our mother!\" Emily shouts, surprising you and Rebekah. Although she was against the idea of letting a stranger like Sabryna join in so easily, you didn't think she'd be this fiercely against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Sierra doesn't take too kindly to her outburst and glares at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> your mother, Emily. This is not Sabryna's fault but rather this is something that both of them agreed to. I'm ashamed to say that it's hypocritical, but you need to keep an open mind, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily freezes at such a tone she would normally expect from Nicole. Although she had her reservations, she kept it to herself and decided to excuse herself to her own room without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her off, Sierra knew she wouldn't let her daughter remain in her room but since there was still time before dinner was ready, she allowed her to reflect more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she apologized to her two other children who were silent and observant. \"I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted is to chasitize Emily like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...it's fine...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stumble in your words, admittedly staring at her large chest for too long as her attention was focused on Emily, Sierra giggles at your natural teenage behavior and smiles warmly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie if I'm distracting you, but I thought this would be nice to wear. I'm glad that you're not opposed to this form though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself blush and try to look away. Rebekah can't help but feel amused and decides to check up on Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know when dinner is ready. I'm going to check on Emily,\" she declares, leaving you alone with this busty woman who couldn't be a more awkward combination of your own mother and a girl you've quickly grown to like. Then again, you feel like you can hardly talk about awkward when you've merged with your whole family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you alone with this busty woman, you feel like you should leave to your room as well, but then Sierra gently grabs your hand and smiles beautifully at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, would you mind helping me finish up cooking here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

You're my mom and a girl that I really like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deep down, you were jealous. You wanted to merge with Sabryna again someday. You even had the idea to merge with her on your first date.

Anyway, would you be so kind to help me with this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sierra pointed at a couple of ingredients on the counter. It was on top of a small wooden cutting board. A generous pile of shrimp was standing beside a small knife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI've decided to make Alfredo pasta. Emily will love it. You should know, after becoming three other fusions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUhh, yeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just do these and, keep an eye on the pot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You tried your best to ignore this moment. You readjusted your pants. Your erection was slowly going down. <i>We should have merged together.</i> You sighed as you started to clean the shrimp. Sierra smiled and leaned her head to the side. She watched you with her loving eyes. That of a mother and a girl that wants to be with you. She took the necklace off and place it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I know you wanted to merge with me. I felt it when I touched your hand. It might be nice though, I need to average these things on my chest.</i> She clasped her hands together. <i>Anyway, I should stop while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at it.</i> Watching you helping out, she resumes her other duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she got busy, you took another glance at her. This woman is your mother, but also a potential girlfriend. Deep down, you really wanted to merge with her. However, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like a good idea at the moment. Emily was in striking opposition of this. This was understandable. Merging with Sabryna that one night was quite dangerous. Your sense of self was mostly her\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Was there a fault in the fusion? Or was it your own inexperience using the necklace? You turned away. As you poured the shrimp meat into the pot, Sierra turned around. Your back was facing her as she comes over and hugs you. You flinched, feeling her gentle touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh, y-yeah?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You panicked.

Merging with Sierra would've been better. After becoming Nicolet and Gemma, it made sense. You had a loving familial bond with Nicole, and a sudden surge of happiness with Sabryna. You didn't bother to oppose Sierra's decision. You're wondering if Emily has finally accepted this as a part of her life.

At least Rebekah is okay with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That dress felt way too tight on us.\" You adjusted your posture. Thinking about stirred your arousement.

I hope Emily won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind if it was just us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You paused. Something lit up inside your mind. You had an idea. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr maybe Emily and Sabryna should merge? The rest of us will stay as ourselves for tonight instead of them. Yeah, that should do it. And-and maybe, her dad will let her stay. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on a business trip tomorrow anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Your enthusiasm sunk. Maybe it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?

There is no way that Emily will agree to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Turning it around, you see the same message from before. \"He who wears this necklace has the power to merge,\" you read. \"This could be a clue.

Maybe she's afraid Daniel won't like her, maybe she just felt it's not time to confront him yet. Right now what she needs the most is someone to talk to, someone who would definitely accept her. It didn't take her long to figure out who that person is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opens her door and shocks to see a stranger in the house. The woman looks strangely similar to her mom and sister, but she couldn't figure out who she is. \"Who are you and why are you in our house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikki sighs. \"I know this is hard to believe, but I am Nicole and Rebekah merged together. I found a necklace that... combines multiple people into one. You would believe me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore explanation took place as Rikki finally convinced Emily that she is both her mother and sister. However, Emily quickly became even more frustrated than Rikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what am I supposed to call you now? Mom? Sis? Are you still the person who gave birth to me? This is messed up. We should find a way to undo this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily has a reasonable point, Rikki does not want to undo the merge. She would rather keep merged and figure out the moral dilemmas rather than unmerge and end the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to. See, I feel better merged than being Nicole and Rebekah separately. I have a lot of questions now too, but I hope you understand my feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was utterly shocked. \"What, I don't even know who you are anymore. This is so messed up...\" She starts weeping, which surprises Rikki. She never thought Emily would react this way. Indeed, every daughter would get nervous when they see their mother and sister merged int a single person and develop a new personality. Just then Rikki came to an interesting thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily, how about we merge together with me so you can feel what I'm feeling right now?\" Emily looked up for a moment, apparently nervous at the proposition. \"What? I don't think we should do that...\" Her voice trails away as she went back into weeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I reckon this would be a good chance for us to know each other a little better.\" Rikki hold the necklace in hand as she caressed Emily's back. \" You'll know once we are together...\" Emily looked at the necklace in fear as it glows and their body softens into sludge-like texture and melds together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn't get much chance to resist as she and Rikki clashed into a single pile of flesh and reshapes into a new person. As the new person's figure became clearer, it is evident that she bore features from both Nicole and her daughters. She has brown hair, dark brown eyes, b-cup breasts, and a healthy skin tone. She slightly moans as a tight black dress forms around her followed by black tights. Lastly, on her hands rings and a bracelet appeared, inherited from Nicole and Rikki. The new woman opens her eyes and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great! How about this boy now...\" She takes off the necklace and proceeds to inspect her body. Her skin is soft, telling of the youth and vitality of a young adult. As she sits down on a couch, she wonders what to do next. \"I guess I'm Remi now. Perhaps I should go to bed now and worry about other things tomorrow. Yea, that seems like a god idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/oWlllBW.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/oWlllBW.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemi continues to Emily's bed (well, technically her bed now) and falls asleep immediately. What awaits her next morning?</span></div></div>",

Soon you start running and rushing through doors: the urge is so strong that you have lost the sense of direction. As time passes you realize that you probably won't be able to find Nicole in a while, yet the urge is becoming unbearable. <i>I just want to find someone to merge with!</i> Who it is is no longer important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotel is almost empty of people outside of the event hall where the crowded dinner is taking place. Desperately trying to find people to merge with, you rush out of the hotel into the street opposite to where Nicole's car was parked. You look around, only to find a woman in tight black leather dress, fishnet stockings and heeled sandals. This is it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you rush to the woman. The woman only had a second to turn around and look at you in shock before you collide with her. The necklace immediately responded by releasing an engulfing flash, as the merging process is accelerated by your urge. Within seconds, a single new woman is standing in place of you and the victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from shock of the merge, you start to inspect yourself. Your new body is covered in a tight gray spandex dress, your leg in thin black stockings, and a pair of wedge sandals for shoes. Locks of hair block your vision, you brush them away. They are brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is still numb when a sudden headache strikes; a rush of memory follows. It's the memory of the woman you just merged...You cover your head in pain as you start to remember her life. Her name is Kim...Kimberly. She is 22 years old and she's not in college. She dropped out of college last year and she's now...The headache suddenly increased in intensity as you sense something bad. She now...dances in a strip club?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dumbfounded. <i>Did I just merge with a stripper?</i> You're even starting to remember some stripping techniques from Kim's memory. As the headache recedes, you take another look at your body: it's breathtakingly hot and fit at the same time. You take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first priority is to think of a new name. <i>Skyler. Skyler would be it.</i> Clearing off your thoughts, you consider what you should do next.

With some dresses being of similar color, it made it hard to locate her. You kept trying. You had to report to her about what happened. Your kept scanning the area until your eyes lined up with someone. It was Jen, Sabryna's friend. You became cheerful that she was here. Smiling, she walked up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi,\" she said. \"I love your dress. I'm Jen by the way.\" She offered you a free hand.

It encircled an area with two rock ponds on opposite sides, and a third larger one in the the middle. Two large lion statues are also adjacent to each other. \"See those canopy couches underneath the lion statues?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah.\" you said.

With a retractable canopy for privacy, your thoughts kept changing. You were trying to make sense on what might happen. \"Aren't you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Yeah, I am.\" Following her lead, you sat down. A green pillow laid by your side. You took it in your arms and hugged it. \"So soft.\" <i>What the hell am I doing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know right?

Being friends with Jen was the best decision that you made. You learned a lot about her. Every time you saw her face, you become infatuated. You described her as being a person with good taste and a bit of a tomboy at certain times. Your pounding heart filled you up with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still no answer?\" You flinched when she spoke. \"Where is she?\" Jen was worried as she looked at her phone. You knew why. She doesn't know that you and her are one and the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, this friend of yours. How is she like to you? You said I remind you of her.\" You waited. You held the pillow close to your body, before Jen uttered some words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's the most important person in my life.\" Jen looked into the night sky, reclining herself as she folded her legs. \"If you saw us together, you would see why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Aww, Jen.</i> Filled with joy, you wanted to hug her. You kept yourself at bay, for fear of scaring her. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you? An interviewer?\" Jen smirked. \"In that case, can you keep a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" You became attentive. Was she keeping a secret from you? \"Promise.\" You leaned in as she crawled over to you. She whispered in your ear about finding your diary. After reading it, she questioned herself too. <i>Jen. My diary.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not kidding. If I have known that she was falling for me, I would've hooked up with her sooner.\" Jen kneeled with her hands on her knees. \"I love her. I hope I can tell her that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>You have no clue.</i> \"Well, maybe in due time. Who knows?\" As you said that, the necklace let out a faint shine. Jen noticed it. Her eyes darted back and forth. \"Jen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That is a big necklace.\" she said. \"Can I see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The necklace.</i> You wondered if you caused the necklace to react to your feelings for Jen. Granted, you wanted to experiment with it some more. Becoming Nicolet offered an amazing feeling. You felt complete. As Rachyl, you had the same feeling, until Jen showed up. Perhaps this is the perfect time to use it again? . <i>Jen. I love you so much. We have to merge together. Mom, I'm so sorry. I need to do this, just this once.</i> You took off the necklace. \"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can put this on two people at the same time with this.\" Jen said. \"Let's wear it. You and I are pretty much friends now.\" She wore the necklace with you. You can smell the fruit punch from her face. \"Okay, smile.\" Taking the photo, you can't help it anymore.</span></div></div>",

Both your tongues swirled and danced in your mouths. You whined, wishing this moment won't end. The necklace complied, letting you both enjoy this for a little longer.

Being patient, you looked at your reflection again. Marveled, you smiled and lidded your eyes. Feeling whole, you daydreamed before someone caught your attention. You looked up. Your mother was looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a brief period of <i>introductions,</i> Nicole was astounded. She could not believe that her own son is merged with two girls. She felt okay knowing that everything turned out well. However, with Sabryna as a component of the fusion, things would get complicated should the president search for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott,\" said Nicole. \"I mean, Rachyl. Please understand this. This is only a temporary thing. After tonight, you will defuse. Okay? I want my son back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, I got this.\" you reassured her. \"I promise. But, it feels amazing. I feel, new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rachyl.\" Nicole became stern. \"I would love to have you as a daughter but, not as this.\" She held your soft hands. \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yours eyes were locked with hers. You can tell she is screaming inside her mind, begging for you to defuse. Your mother loved you. She cannot bear losing her only son. You smiled, wiping away her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I promise. But for now, I want to be me for tonight.\" You shook her hands, playing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, but if your other parents start to get worried, you know what to do.\" Hugging you, she is sure that you will keep your promise. \"Okay, let's enjoy the night. But first, give me the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, but mom?\" Putting an innocent act, you gave Nicole the necklace. \"Mom, don't use it just because you're jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me? Jealous? Rachyl, as Nicolet, I admit it. It was, enjoyable. However, I won't use this on anyone else.\" <i>Which is good. This could still be dangerous if more people were to merge with you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. Let's stay here a bit longer. I'm loving this party.\" You smiled as you rose up from your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both of you got up and went back inside. Just as before, several young men looked at you. You smiled as they smiled back. Deep down, you didn't want to get into a relationship with them. You main interest is with other girls. That fact didn't bother Nicole though. As Scott, you never had a girlfriend before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, what should I do?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're telling <i>me</i> this?\" she said. \"I know Sabryna. She's a wonderful person to talk to. Why not just mingle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you say so.\" Going your separate ways, you were glad not to have the necklace. \"Experimenting can wait. I don't think I should use it on myself anymore though. I'm already complete anyway.\" You wanted to hug yourself. You resisted, not wanting to draw attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calm down girl. You weirdo.\" You went over to the punch bowl. Serving yourself a cup, you can see, Samantha, Jen's mother talking to someone. \"As much as I like being merged together, having more than one parent is weird.\" You chuckled as you sipped.</span></div></div>",

Since the mess you place her with, she thought that you deserve a punishment, but of course she would not trap your mind, so the only solution was make your mind enter on \u201csleep mode\u201d. And it\u2019s work! \u201cThanks for the tip, Samantha.

You felt like you hit a dead end. <i>He who wears this necklace has the power to merge. What else does that mean?</i> You were feeling irritated. Drying your hands, you turned to see your sister Emily inspecting the necklace. She just came home from volleyball practice. You can tell from the sweat on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is this a prop Scott?\" she asked. \"Looks real.\" She drank what was left in her water bottle.

She and Rebekah were about to go out for the night. You grumbled, feeling left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Totally unfair guys,\" you said. \"Wait a minute, this gives me an idea.\" You hummed. While this was expected, you never thought about merging yourself with another person soon after. \"Okay, let's try it.\" Hooking the bra back together, you went to the hallway.

The constant chatter about boys and school, family and friends, all of that was drowned out by these images. \"Mmm, I should just go in.

Rebekah was busy cleaning her hair. Thanks to the blurred, private door, it was hard to make out her body. Your heart reacted with faster beating. It felt like it was going to erupt out of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rebekah,\" you whispered. \"Whoa, I feel it.\" Even though both girls are sisters, the thought of knowing this brought bliss upon you. The nipples on your female body were poking out of the bra. You unhooked it once again and stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hah, wow. Uh...\" You kept staring back and forth. From your chest, to Rebekah, and back to your chest. \"Okay that's it, I need to merge ourselves together.\" These conflicting feelings within you confused the necklace. Undressing yourself, you stepped into the shower. Rebekah was washing her face with soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily?\" she asked. \"Home already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" you said. \"Hurry up and turn around.\" Your eyes darted all over her body. You can't help but feel even more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sound different,\" said Rebekah. \"Did something happen?\" She offered her back to you, ready for scrubbing. As you stared, you can't help but think about anything that isn't sexual. With the necklace active, you clung onto her.</span></div></div>",

If this necklace could really do what it was supposed to, then it was time to have some fun whether he wanted to or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned on the shower and stepped inside you followed him inside, stripping as you went. Once you were naked you put the necklace on and stepped into the shower behind your dad. He was shocked at first seeing his naked son step in behind him but you quickly put your hand over his mouth to stop him from speaking and stepped closer to him. The necklace began pulling your bodies together like magnets. You could feel your legs start to merge into each other, drawing your hips closer. Eventually when you were close enough you reached down and grabbed his ample dick and affixed it to your own. You heard your dad whimper feeling his manhood being dominated by his son's. Your two penises slow merged into one as the process continued up your torso and pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it your two heads were sharing one body. Your dad was panting uncontrollably as the necklace slowly merged your heads into a singular head, your head. For all intents and purposes your father was now just a piece of you. Stepping out of the shower you were amazed at the results. You had kept your father's well muscled body but it was merged with your youthful one making for a mid twenties something body. You had never had this much muscle or looked this good. Smiling in the mirror you stepped out of the bathroom trying to decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Now that you were packing more muscle and were a bit taller, none of your clothes fit. Pulling out a pair of boxer briefs you pulled it up over your dick and ass before grabbing a pair of his jeans and a t-shirt and crawling out the window. The last thing you wanted was to have your family see you taking your dad's body out for a ride. You two looked enough alike that you could probably pass as your own older brother or your maybe even your uncle if you had to but for now it was best to just get out of the house ASAP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling into the garden you stand up and look around while finishing getting dressed. It was early evening meaning there was still plenty of light so you carefully sneaked out of the yard and started walking down the street. This necklace was was amazing. You could feel your dad's presence inside of you completely unaware of what was going on, while still stuck in a state of suspended bliss. Every now and again your dick was twitching in your pants as his pleasure seeped through. You reached down and pet your cock through your jeans slightly. \"Easy old man, the night's still early.\" Looking around you started to wonder what it would feel like to add someone else to the equation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought was your best friend Josh. He was like you, just an average teenager, but he'd been your friend for years. You two often wrestled and rough housed with each other. His hair was red/brown, his eyes were green, and he was a little taller than you were even in your merged state at about 6'1''. You two were close, almost like brothers. He could be someone your could try a complete merge with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your settled on Josh though, a loud engine revved in a near by garage. Looking over you saw your neighbour working on his motorcycle in his garage. His name was Caleb, who was in his early twenties and was definitely the local bad boy. He had a body not too dissimilar to your current one, except he had tattoo's on his arms and one on his back the showed just under his dirty white wifebeater, his longer brown hair draping over his face. He was always kind of a dick to you so it might make for some fitting payback to add him to your merged form. Although if your merged with his his mind as well he might know where you could go to have some real fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again fate intervened as your math teacher, Mr.Wood, ran past you, luckily not recognizing you while you were merged with your dad. He may have been just a math teacher but he didn't look the part. He was in his early thirties and a complete gym rat. Word was he was working out hard to train for a triathlon in a few months. He was sporting short cut blonde hair and had a killer smile. Of course in the class room he was a bit of an ass but if you had to teach a bunch of teenagers all day you'd probably be a bit of an ass too. He flashed his charming smile as he ran past leaving you alone on the sidewalk once again. Three choices, all of which would make fine additions to your body or potentially even your mind.</span></div></div>",

Josh jumped and removed his head phones. He had been doing some homework but was now making his way over to the window. Looking out he saw you standing there and was instantly confused. You motioned for him to open the window quickly and he cautiously obliged. \"Scott?! What the hell happened to you? You look older.\" He exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully made your way in side and caught your breath. \"Yeah you're not going to believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was looking at you up and down while he circled you. \"Try me, because this is freaking me out.\" He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this necklace on my way home. See?\" You said pulling it out from under your shirt. \"It gives the wearer the ability to merge with people. At first I didn't believe it but then I sort of...\" You trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Josh questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I merged with my dad. I saw him come home from the gym and decided to test it out thinking worst case scenario he'd just think I was high or something. Well it worked and he and I merged together so I ended up looking like this. Check it dude!\" You say flexing your firm biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was still stunned and reached out and grabbed your arm squeezing it to prove it was real. \"This is crazy.\" He said. It took him a few minutes to gather his thoughts. \"So wait, what happened to your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the edge of his bed and take off your dads shoes. \"Well the necklace lets you either just merge with their body, or their body and their mind. I just merged with his body so he's sort of trapped inside of me for the time being. He doesn't know what's going on though and won't remember anything about the merge later.\" You explain before rubbing your aching hard on in your pants. \"The not so cool part is that he's super horny about the whole thing so I'm tenting big time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat on the bed beside you still in a state of confusion although at least now he knew the situation. \"So what're you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanted to see if you wanted to merge in or not. You don't have to, I just figured who better to fuse to mind and body than you.\" You say.</span></div></div>",

So what do we do?\" He asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's ok with you I think we should merge completely, mind and body. That way we'll both remember everything that happens. We'll kind of share a body and a mind. It might be weird at first but I think we'll be  fine.\" You explain as you start to strip out of your dad's clothes. \"Oh you probably want to be naked for this next part. Makes it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obliged and began to remove his clothes until you were both sitting on his bed naked. Next to you Josh was shivering a little. You'd both seen each other naked before but this was different. Since he was still a little nervous about this whole thing you had to make the first move. Reaching over you pulled him closer to you so that he was sort of half sitting on your lap. The necklace, sensing your intentions, started the process. You both groaned slightly as your bodies started to push into each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time was different then when you had merged with your dad. When you merged with your dad you never lost control over your body but since you and Josh were merging as equals things weren't so simple. While your legs started to melt into each other you reached out and grabbed your hard dick and placed it against Josh's. You both felt a surge of electricity as your cocks slowly merged into one followed by your ball sacks and hips. You were both feeling the intense pleasure of the experience so much that your new cock couldn't hold back any more and shot it's load onto the ground. Slowly your taut abs fused together before your pecs did the same. Josh's concave pecs being joined by you and your fathers solid slabs. Reaching out you grabbed Josh's hands and held them tight while the rest of your arms merged. Your heads were the last things to merge. The two shapes pushing into each other as the features rearranged. You both gasped at the same time as your new body had finally taken shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes catching your breath you stood up and walked towards the mirror on the back of Josh's door. Standing in the mirror you were in awe. You were Josh's height now, about 6'1'' meaning your legs and torso were both a bit longer than before. Your skin tone was a little lighter than it had been and your hair was a dark, dark red, while your eyes were now a stunning bright blue green colour. You still looked like someone in their mid twenties so that was a plus. Josh's muscles had just added to the already nice body your father had provided making for a very toned strapping body. Your dick was even thicker and longer than it had been. It was a solid 10'' hard and only a little smaller when it was soft. After posing in the mirror for a few seconds you realized that the clothes you'd worn over wouldn't fit your new body. Luckily Josh's parents were currently out so you hurried over to his parents room and repeated the process of stealing some new clothes to throw on from his dad's closet. While you were grabbing some clothes out you realized that you would need a new name to go as while you two were merged since you were sort of operating as a new person who was 50% you and 50% Josh. After a few minutes you landed on the name Jace. Once you had a set of clothes you had to decide what you do next. </span></div></div>",

What good was being trapped in this hot body if you weren't going to do a little self exploration. Dropping the clothes on the floor you jumped onto Josh's parents bed and reached over to his dad's nightstand, Josh knew where his dad kept his toys. Reaching in you pulled out a bottle of lube and squirt some in your hand. You jumped a little when your cold slick palm greased your dick, your heart started racing as you started working your shaft. Even though you were just jacking off it sort of felt like you and Josh were having sex since you were sharing a mind. It didn't hurt that you could still feel your dad writhing in ecstasy inside of you. With each stroke all three of you felt the warm wet charge riding up your core. You couldn't help but moan a little as you edged your dick closer and closer to the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you stopped stroking, feeling the urge to try something different. Josh was always bragging about how he could suck himself off and this was the perfect time to test it. Rolling backwards you grabbed your legs and pulled your hips forward as far as they could go. With your new 10\" monster hard on it wasn't hard for you to suck your dick into your own waiting mouth. The feeling was electric to the point where you almost started to buck in your own grasp. Holding your legs tight you started to pulse your own manhood in and out of your mouth. Your mind was spinning as this was the most intense jacking session either of you'd ever had. Maybe it was because you were sharing a dick and there were more nerve endings than normal, either way you weren't regretting your decisions at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this was just too hot for your to take. Whether it was Josh's flexibility or your dads taut muscles, the idea that the three of you combined were doing this right now was intense. Then it happened like a chain reaction. You felt your dad climax, then Josh climaxed, then you climaxed all in quick succession. You barely had time to get your dick out of your mouth before an eruption of spooge shot out of the tip and splattered all over your face. Feeling exhausted you released your legs and lay still for a moment before wiping your face off with a tissue from the nightstand. You were satisfied for the moment but you had three men's worth of testosterone running through you so it was only a matter of time before you were horny again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you sat up you heard the front door of Josh's house open. It turned out that... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing his father come home was an unexpected turn of events. He usually didn't get home until late on Friday. You stopped to think about what to do. While you were thinking Josh suddenly wanted to split the merge and you were pretty sure you knew why. Since you were equals in the merge there was really nothing you could do to stop him from leaving. A surge pulsed through you and suddenly your two bodies separated. You felt the entirety of your body pull and stretch until you were both standing naked in his parents bedroom. Your dad was still fused with you and Josh had returned to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, let me borrow the necklace.\" Josh pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to merge with your dad?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could feel how horny your dad felt inside of you, I want to feel that too.\" He explained. \"Please Scott, lets take our dad's out for the night and have some real fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really fault him, it was pretty incredible how you and your dad felt while you were sharing a body. With a sigh you took the necklace off and handed it to him. \"Be careful with it. If we lose it, I'm not sure me and my dad will ever be able to defuse from each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry so much. I got this.\" Josh said with a smile. You could hear his father coming down the hall towards his room. Josh hid behind the door and had you dodge down under the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh are you home? Did you eat yet?\" His father called out. A moment later the door to their room creaked open and his father came in. He immediately saw the bottle of lube on his night stand and bee lined straight to towards the bed. \"Josh! Have you..\" He was cut off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly ran at his father and wrapped his arms under his fathers. His dad was a well built man and Josh was still just a gawky teenager, but that didn't really matter once the green gem on the necklace started to glow. His father quickly dropped into a state of ecstasy, while Josh started unbuttoning his shirt and pants. \"Help me out Scott.\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up you hurried over and helped to strip his dad down. When his shirt came off their upper bodies immediately began to merge into one form. When his pants came down Josh was all to happy to press their dicks together. They both moaned as their cocks throbbed and became one. His father didn't understand what was happening or why he felt like this but he didn't seem to care. His and Josh's heads slowly fused into one and morphed to reflect the change. Just like when you had merged with your dad, Josh looked like an older version of himself except his hair was lighter like his dad. Josh's dad wasn't nearly as buff as yours was but he was still in decent shape. Just like that Josh was standing in front of you with a massive erection. He took the necklace off and tossed it back to you. \"Thanks for the lend. Damn that felt good.\" He said running his hands down his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It's Friday night, we'll say we're a couple of frat guys in town for the weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were both dressed you headed out and climbed into Josh's father's car and set off for the night. \"Where am I driving?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bar downtown, the Grainery.\" You replied rolling your window down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh laughed a little. \"I don't know if getting drunk and playing around with that necklace is such a great idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude we look like we're twenty five and it's Friday night, lets not waste the opportunity.\" You smile over at your friend. At worst you would get drunk and strike out, at best you could be in for a hell of a night. You drove for about ten minutes when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To your dismay a pair of flashing red and blue lights ignited behind Josh and a few whistles of a siren rang out. \"Shit, damn, shit!\" Josh cussed pulling onto the shoulder. The car screeched to a halt and he turned off the ignition. \"This is bad, I don't look like my ID and I don't look old enough to use my dad's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch seats with me quick.\" You replied unbuckling your seat belt. Josh was confused but obeyed and moved to the passengers seat while you took the drivers side. You just got situated when you saw the cop exiting the cop car behind you and begin moving towards your window. The man tapped on the glass and you rolled down the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys missed a stop sign back there.\" The Cop said leaning towards the window and placing his hand on the door of the car. \"License and registration.\" He commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Josh started fumbling through the glove compartment, you decided to make a daring move. Reaching up you grabbed the deputy's hand. The green glow of the necklace immediately putting him into an almost trance like state. \"Let's you and me get in the back seat deputy.\" You smile. The aroused man eagerly agreed and moved to the rear door and climbed into the back seat of the car. You got out and followed him. Once you were both in the back seat you looked up front to Josh who was already climbing back into the drivers seat. \"Let's get to that bar. Oh and deputy I'm going to need you to strip out of that uniform.\" You instruct as you both start getting naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude are you really going to abduct a cop?\" Josh asked putting the car in gear and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the now naked deputy in front of you. \"In a manner of speaking.\" The amulet glowing green was once again in full gear. He was just a young cop, maybe 30 years old. He looked like he might be Latino, at least a little anyways. He had a little dusting of dark chest hair and a treasure trail leading down to his dick. He was even good shape too. Most cops were a little pudgy from too many doughnuts but not this guy. He clearly took care of himself. He had some nice sideburns and a solid five o'clock shadow. Not wasting any time you brought him close and sat on his lap. The necklace went to work drawing him into your body. He groaned under you as your back slowly pushed into his abdomen. As your torso's began to combine you reached out and placed your hands over his and let your arms start the process as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but keep looking at you two merge in the rear view mirror as the car swerved a few times in his distracted state. With your heads slowly fusing into one you moaned. \"This is the best part.\" You sighed as you reached down grabbing your dicks and holding them tightly together in your grip. The deputy bucked wildly feeling his dick being taken over by yours. A moment later you felt the cop retreating inside you just like your dad. And just like your dad he was now stuck in a suspended state of arousal at least until you decided to let him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was even buffer than before and had also taken a little of the deputy's chest hair and his treasure trail. Your skin tone was a bit darker now too. You and your father's clean shaven faces were replaced by a solid coat of stubble and your jaw line was a little squarer than it had been. Aside from that you still looked like you for the most part. You still had your short dark hair and your deep blue eyes, you and your dad's genes were winning out overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Josh pulled into the bar you got dressed again in the back seat and then climbed out. Josh was still flummoxed that you had just merged with a cop. \"I can't believe that just happened. We could go to jail Scott! If he has a dash board cam or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who needs to relax? He was driving one of the old squad cars, they don't have dash cams. Now can we please go inside and have some fun? I have two guys inside of me aching to blow off some steam.\" You smile adjusting the stiffy in your dad's underwear. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Grainery was busy most nights and tonight was no different. The parking lot was packed. Luckily there wasn't much of a line up as you and Josh walked over to the door. Since you had acquired your new muscle mass you no longer looked like a teenager. The bouncer at the door quickly waved both you and Josh through barely even glancing at your ID's. Stepping inside you looked back at Josh who let out a huge sigh of relief. \"You gotta loosen up Josh. This thing is the best thing that's ever happened to us.\" You said with a smirk. \"Besides, I don't know about you but my dad and that cop are literally cranking my hormones through the roof. Feel like I could jack it for days and still be good to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stopped you with a hand on your shoulder. \"That's not the point dude. You absorbed a cop! This is serious!\" His voice quivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could help but roll your eyes at Josh. Merging felt incredible, not only during, but afterwards. You could feel your dad and the cop having orgasm after orgasm inside of your consciousness. It rolled through you like waves at the beach. Plus you had muscle now! You had been a scrawny kid for too long when all you wanted was to have a body more like your dad. Now with the necklace, you actually had your dad's body. The more guys you merged with, the more ripped you became, the more handsome, and the better endowed. Your bulge was way bigger than it used to be. You didn't really share Josh's concern. \"Well then go home Josh. I'm going to keep enjoying this necklace and I think you should too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked disappointed at you. \"No way Scott. Keeping my dad under control is hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine suit your self. There's some frat guys in the corner. I'm going to go see if I can find an opening.\" You said patting Josh on the back and walking away. Josh was being a buzz kill. Leaving your friend at the bar you headed over to the group of jocks drinking in the corner. At first they seemed a little taken back by your sudden appearance but they were too drunk to really care that much. After you offered to buy them all a round they quickly welcomed you to the table. There was four of them total and they had just got back to town after winning a Football game a few towns over and were celebrating their win. You quickly set your eyes on one of them though. Jeff was their 6'2\" quarterback and was one of the best looking guys you'd ever seen. His debonair looks matched his attitude perfectly. His short spiky brown hair matched his light brown eyes and light facial hair. He was definitely the one you wanted to merge with but you needed to be patient and in the mean time play some drinking games with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange but you weren't really getting drunk. You were drinking sure, but having three metabolism's was making short work out of the alcohol. After a few rounds of shots and a game of flip cup the jocks were all blatto. One of Jeff's friends was passed out while the other two went stopped at another table to talk up some pretty girls. Jeff managed to get to his feet and stumble towards the rest room and you decided it was now or never.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you were about to step into the restroom behind Jeff, someone tackled you and you both flew into an open utility closet. It took your a few seconds to realize who was grappling with you but eventually the look on your face said it all. It was Josh. He was furiously grabbing at the necklace around your neck trying to pry it off. He had a deviant grin on his face as he kicked the door to the closet shut behind you. \"You're right Scott, I should get some more enjoyment out of that necklace. How about I take you for a spin huh? How would you like to be a part of me?!\" He shouted almost pulling the necklace free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled and managed to flip him off you and push him back into the door. \"What the hell Josh?!\" You retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wiped some spit off his lip. \"Sorry Bud, don't know what's come over me but I just know I want to merge you into me.\" He said lunging back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Josh you were stronger than he was and the cop you had merged with had self defense training. It didn't take long until you had your friend on his stomach with an arm twisted behind his back keeping him from moving around. As you sat on top of him panting you felt the gravity of the necklace starting to take effect. At first you wanted to resist it, Josh was your best friend after all. But then you started to think about how hot you would be with your best friend and his dad merged into you. Reaching down you un-buttoned your pants and kicked them off. \"You know what Josh? You wanna merge so bad I'd be happy to oblige but I'll be the one in control not you. This is my body and you're lucky to be a part of it.\" You said with a grin as the green glow fired into full gear. \"Time to strip bud!\" You teased slapping his ass before stepping back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was now locked in a trance. He couldn't really control himself as he tore his clothes off piece by piece. Soon you were both standing naked in the utility closet with huge wood pointing at one another. Josh barely broke from his trance to mutter some words of resistance. \"Ugh! You don't have the balls to merge me!\" He spat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile you stepped in and turned him around so that you were facing his back. Leaning in you whispered in his ear. \"I'm about to have 5 pairs actually, yours included.\" With that you twined your legs together and let the necklace go to work. Josh moaned passionately so you reached out and covered his mouth with your hand. The last thing you needed was someone walking in on your right now. While your legs and hips began to fuse into each other Josh was busy pumping out load after load of his pearly white spunk onto the floor. Once your legs were under your control you reached down and cupped your nut sack and Josh's in one hand. With a playful squeeze you forced them together before reaching up and repeating the process with your cocks. Josh spasmed wildly feeling your manhood taking control over his, cumming a huge load in the mean time. The merge continued up your torso as your right arm and his left disappeared between you. You smiled and looked at your friend who was clearly enjoying this as much as you. \"See Joshy? My cock feels amazing don't you think?\" you said reaching down and stroking yourself. Moments later you gained control of Josh's right arm as it was now yours, just before your heads began to merge. Inch by inch his face became one with yours. As his consciousness was seconds away from dropping into the depths of your mind you felt him give one last blast of cum onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all finished you were standing naked by yourself in the utility closet with your new cock dripping. It was even bigger and thicker now. in fact pretty much everything was. You were taller and your muscles seemed leaner than before. With a huge grin on your face you reached down and grabbed your dads underwear and pulled them up over your bubble butt. Your new junk barely fit inside the pouch at the front but they still looked pretty good on your ever growing form. Getting dressed you stepped out of the closet leaving Josh's dad's clothes in a cum soaked pile on the floor.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You left the janitors closet behind you with Josh fully merged into your form. You felt stronger and more in control that ever. When you had first got started earlier you constantly felt like your Dad or the Cop might break free. But now something unusual had happened. It was like each guy who was joining your collective form was making the bonds of the necklace stronger, holding them tighter in the depths of your mind and body. You quickly realized that you wanted to keep adding guys to you. You wanted some real muscle. I mean you already looked great with four bodies plus your own. But that Jeff guy looked like he was carved out of marble. Adding him to your body was your top priority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking your head into the bathroom you found it still locked and occupied. Heading back out into the bar you scanned the room and saw what you were looking for. Jeff was stumbling drunk and heading out the side door. With a smile you walked over to the door and headed out behind him. You saw Jeff propping himself up on a dumpster while preparing to take a leak. He turned and barely noticed you. \"Occupied dude!\" He shouted before bursting into a fit of drunken laughter. Not wasting and time you quickly peeled your clothes off and rushed up behind him. You slipped one arm under his locking him in a half nelson while using your other hand to grab his dick while his stream off piss was blasting out. \"Dude! The Fuck!\" He shouted resisting your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he got far however the green light of the necklace took hold and he started to become more docile. His heaving muscles stopped trying to break free as he was caught in the erotic vortex that the necklace had locked you into. \"That's right, you're going to be my crown jewel for the night Jeff.\" You said taking your hand off his now piss free dick and running it up his deep v cut abs. His cock was already hard as steel but he still had too many pesky clothes on to complete the merge. Releasing your grip on him you peeled his tight shirt off his muscular lean torso and dropped it to the ground. You then repeated the process with his underwear and shorts and dropped them around his ankles. Feeling a little kinky you decided to try something different. Rather than getting dressed after the merge, why not use his clothes as a sort of restraint to keep the merge tight. Stepping behind him with your cock sticking under his legs you bent down and pulled up his boxer-briefs over both of your bodies so that the pouch was covering his cock while the seat was covering your ass. It was so tight you could barely get the thing pulled up but it stretched just enough as the merging started to happen. Knowing full well that he was about to start cumming you pulled your dicks out of the fly of the briefs just in time for the hot Jock to spill his first load. Your bodies slowly pressed together joining into one form. Jeff looked down panting as he watched your cock asserting control over his manhood. Slowly his 7 inch cock was enveloped by your now 11\" cock. He moaned passionately and pumped out another load while you embraced his hands with your own. You interlaced fingers slowly became one with your palms next as the process moved up your collective arms. You could tell Jeff couldn't tell what was happening but he was really enjoying himself. He kept trying to take control of your hands and stroke your cock but he couldn't understand why they weren't working. Laughing a little you decided to oblige your newest addition and his college jock levels of hormones. Reaching down with your left hand you began to stroke the length of your erection making Jeff sigh in pleasure. As your Torso's merged into one you officially had the leanest most ripped bod you'd ever seen. Flexing your right arm while you kept stroking with your left you and Jeff both shot and impressive load in unison with one another. Your heads began to merge and Jeff still didn't care, he was enjoying himself way too much to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept pummeling your dick until you felt Jeff blast out one last orgasm before sinking inside of you. Your once shared pair of boxer briefs now covered one nearly perfect ass and cock. With a smile and a grin you pulled Jeff's shorts over your ass and barely managed to get his shirt on over your body. Looking at yourself in a side mirror of a near by car you could barely recognize your self. Each new guy was changing your face ever slightly for the better. Your chiseled jaw, five o'clock shadow, deep blue eyes, spiked dark hair. Leaving the parking lot you smiled knowing the night was still young and there were many guys who you wanted to add to your body.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were still admiring your increasingly ripped body when the door to the bar flung open and a young man came charging outside. It was one of Jeff's friends from earlier, Alex. He barely made it through the door before throwing up onto the ground and falling onto his hands and knees. His hat fell to the side revealing his shaved head. He was too out of it to even notice you standing in the nude a few feet away. You stood there for a moment and examined the young buck thinking how badly you wanted to keep adding men to yourself. Taking them in as a part of you. Every guy that was joining your form was strengthening your bond with all the rest. Like they were all trapped in an orgy with one another and every time one of them started to gather strength inside you to challenge your rule, the others would gang up to steal his strength. Alex's college jock body would be a fine addition. He was smaller than his friends in height but was incredibly handsome. Thick stubble dusted his face and some light chest hair peaked out of the top of his shirt. He was deceptively in shape too. If you weren't close to him it was easy to miss it but he had an otter body which sort of made sense given that his sport of choice was water polo. He had a small tattoo on his left forearm that looked mechanical. As you approached him he wiped his mouth off and looked up at your strapping naked body. \"God damn, where'd you come from?\" His dazed voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smiled and looked down at him. \"What if I told you you can have a body like this yourself? That you can have a cock even bigger than this and be even taller than I am now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was still drunk and confused. He looked up at you in his stupor. \"What? Dude I'm not queer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying you are, I'm just offering you the chance to have a body like me.\" You said flexing your bicep and smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean, what do I have to do? I'm not taking any roids or anything.\" He said staggering to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the hormones surging through you prompted a new a devious response. \"Bend over.\" You said with a puckish grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you I'm not gay!\" He shouted and began to move away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know one when I spot one. You're too afraid that your friends will catch you with your pants down with another dude. But I can tell you first hand your friend Jeff spanked it while thinking about you more then a few times.\" You said dipping into Jeff's memories. \"One time while you were at a match he went into your room and got intimate with your jock strap. So do you want to impress him with a new body, or not?\" You asked. Alex stopped and turned. Slowly he moved closer to the wall and unbuttoned his pants and dropped them to the ground which was followed quickly by his shirt. His hairy chest was just as lean and taught as Jeff's had been. This was going to be fun. You going to screw him and merge him at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up behind him you kissed his neck and caressed his ass with your hands. He let a small whimper out as you started to feed your ever growing dick into his tight ass. He gasped when you had finally got it in all the way. Reaching around to his front you playfully stroked his cock while you rocked back and forth, in and out admiring your newest conquests back side. Neither of you even noticed when the necklace began to take effect. Slowly but surely you felt your legs drift into each other while your torso's did the same. Alex didn't even notice when you grabbed his hand and began to use it to jack his cock while it was slowly becoming yours. His solid 7 incher blossoming into a thick 12 inch monster that you could both feel as your strong grip worked it's girth. He grunted as you felt him purging a load onto the ground. You could feel his orgasm as if it were your own, because it was. Alex was starting to grunt madly now feeling himself locked in the most powerful orgasm of his life. Wanting to quiet him down you pressed your face into the back of his head. Slowly inch by inch Alex's face began to change as yours asserted control. Slowly his primal groans were locked away as your voice took over. You kept humping the palm of your combined hands until you felt him sink inside of you just before every man you had merged thus far busted a load in unison. You, your dad, the cop, Josh and his dad, Jeff and now Alex all peaking at the same time while locked together in one body. You gasped as you pushed out your biggest load yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back to catch your breath you looked down at your arm to see Alex's tattoo resting on your forearm, while some of his chest and abdomen hair had also dusted your body which was even better looking. You had 8 pack abs with deep 'V' lines running down to your groin. Your pecs, biceps and pretty much every other muscle was in peak physical condition and all you could think was that you needed to find some new guys to add to you asap. With a smile you grabbed Alex's hat and placed it on your head before grabbing Jeff's clothes and slipping them onto your body. Jeff was closer to you in size but even his clothes were still too small. You could go looking for someone bigger just for an attempt at better fitting clothes, or you could find someone wearing something with a little bit of stretch to it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your constant merging and absorption of men had made you nearly unrecognizable. Scott, the scrawny teenager was now a ripped, statuesque, Adonis of a man walking confidently down the street wearing a combination of your merging partners clothes as well as some of their attributes. Besides their muscles, you were taller, your cock was an absolute monster, their memories and thoughts were yours, plus you had a constant reminder of your latest addition in Alex's tattoo on your forearm. To make things even sweeter you could feel them all inside of your mind vying for control but finding themselves only stealing strength from one another instead of you. Every guy that joined you was making it that much harder for anyone else to usurp control of your beautiful new body away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately there was one problem that was pretty undeniable. None of the clothes you were wearing fit your new body. You were at least a foot taller than you were before you first stepping into the shower with your old man, not to mention all the muscle you'd gained. You needed to find somewhere to get some new clothes quick so that you wouldn't stand out so much. Luckily between all your merge partners you were in no short supply of cash. Already down town you figured it would be the best place to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly found your way into a sport shop that was just starting to close. Looking at the clock behind the counter you saw that it was almost 11. You needed to get this done fast. Rushing back to the men's apparel you started looking for anything that would give you the room you needed to be comfortable while giving you room to grow as it was needed. There weren't a lot of options. You grabbed a wrestling singlet and kept the straps down by your waist instead of over the shoulder. You also grabbed a pair of track pants and a sweat shirt and rushed to a change room. While you adjusted your singlet there was a knock at the door. \"Sir, I'm closing up now, I'm going to need you to bring your items up to the register.\" The voice curtly asked. When you stepped out and handed the young man the tags from the clothes you were buying, his jaw just about hit the ground. \"Oh...Um, uh this way.\" He stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed him back to the counter and payed for the clothes while he nervously punched things into the till. He was cute and looked to be your age, or rather your unmerged age. He had a streak of blue hair on the side of his head that Jeff recognized as his school's colours. His name tag read \"Tyler\". You knew what you wanted to happen but needed to make sure he'd be a good fit first. \"So closing up by yourself tonight?\" You asked with your handsome smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tore the receipt off the printer and handed it to you. \"Yeah, my co-workers bailed a little early for some party on the other side of town. I drew the short straw.\" He said walking with you to the front. \"Enjoy the new clothes.\" He replied while you smiled and headed out to the parking lot. Tyler wasn't a huge dude but there was something about him that just seemed too good to pass up. You must've waited 20 minutes in the parking lot for Tyler to appear from the building. He saw you standing there and stopped looking at you cautiously. \"Um, were you waiting for me or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Yeah I just wanted to ask you where this party was? I'm only in town for a few days and I want to cut loose a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, dude you should've just said something inside. The corner of McNaughton and Wallace. I might see you there but I gotta go home and shower up first.\" He smiled as he walked past you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he got far you reached out and grabbed his shoulder. \"Hey Tyler, I wanna try out my new clothes and I want your help to do that.\" You said as the green light of the necklace took hold of you both. Tyler turned and quickly began tearing his work clothes off. You bit your lip and took off your hoodie and track pants leaving you standing in your orange and blue singlet. You pulled the waist forward creating a gap at the front where your 12\" dick was resting. \"Hop in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grinned and you lifted him up with your powerful arms as he worked his legs into your singlet until you were facing one another while sharing the same undergear. His ass was where your cock usually sat but it was currently pinned between you and him dwarfing his 9\" cock in comparison. \"I don't know why I'm doing this but man this feeling is amazing.\" Tyler shouted as he leaned forward and started kissing your neck. You in turn pulled the straps of the singlet over your shoulders before grabbing his dark hair to pull his head back before kissing him deeply. Your tongues wrestling as you were wrapped in one another. Tyler barely even noticed when your faces began to merge into one another. The realization stunned him momentarily as you hugged him closer to you. Tyler wasn't sure what to do. The feeling was incredible but he was losing complete control over himself. He tried to push away slightly but you pulled him in tighter as his body slowly began to be merged into you. You could feel him having orgasm after orgasm uncontrollably as you began to share a cock. It wasn't long before his spunk was shooting out of your cock. You both grunted in unison as your bodies completely joined one another with yours dominating as usual. Tyler quickly faded into your mind joining the other men in the depths of your subconscious mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you were alone in the parking lot heaving to catch your breath. Bending over you used Tyler's work clothes to clean up a little before getting redressed and grabbing Tyler's car keys and getting into his car. As you started the engine you caught a glimpse of yourself in the rear view with a blue streak of hair on the side of your head. With a cheeky smile you flexed your arm a little and felt just how strong you had become. With Tyler on board it was time to go prove you were top dog. Deciding where to prove your alpha status was the real trick.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You drove off into the night at the wheel of Tyler's car. It was just a little junker car, typical of a college student. Either way the night breeze brushing through your hair felt great. You felt like you were almost buzzing feeling so alive, so vital. Every few minutes you could feel one of the men merged into you shudder and climax inside of your mind, sending waves of pleasure through your ripped body. Most of them weren't even aware of what was happening and the ones that were had begun not caring. They were all becoming submissive to the power of your mind and body as it dominated theirs. It made you want more. It made you want to be the top guy, a real alpha male. You needed a guy who was a challenge. While you drove you started dipping into the memories of the men you'd merged to and started searching for a rival. You paused at a red light as an image jumped out at you. It was Jeff's coach. He was a stern and serious coach on and off the field and had a habit of getting a little rough with some of his players. Coach Travis always made sure that his players knew he was running the show not them. He wasn't a bad looking guy but he had a furrowed brow line from his constant outbursts from the side line. He made sure to keep himself in shape to seem imposing too. He was the perfect choice for a little bit of a challenge and it just so happens Jeff knew exactly where he would be after their big game win. Turning the blinker on, you turned right and drove towards campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late so the campus was pretty much empty and there was very little open this time of night, one exception being the gym. Stopping in the locker room you used Jeff's locker to store most of your clothes except for the singlet that clung around your waist and the necklace of course. Walking into the gym with your near perfect body on display you saw only one man working a pec deck, none other than Coach Travis himself. He was eyeing you up the moment you walked in, no doubt noticing the outline of your massive dick in your snug under gear. \"Quiet night eh?\" You say sitting at the machine next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you? Something about you seems familiar.\" Coach Travis replies as he stops his reps and leans forward.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You smile and shake your head. \"Well you know a part of me, but I think you'll find out soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach shot you a glare and got to his feet. Standing in front of you now he started posturing to make himself seem intimidating. \"What's that supposed to mean?!\" He bellowed with his deep masculine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff's memories weren't lying, this guy was a powder keg just waiting for a reason to go off. His sweaty body was heaving and posing in front of you as Coach Travis tried to show you up. Even with his remarkable body he had nothing on yours and you both knew it. \"Geez coach temper temper. You should watch that anger or else I might just have to show you who's boss around here.\" You teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shade of Coach Travis's face after your taunt took a turn for the redder. His brunette hair was the only thing that didn't look like it was about to ignite and explode. He took a big step forward with his chest right in your face. \"I take down guys like you on a daily basis. They even pay me for it. So go a head and say something else. I'm the boss around here and some punk like yourself is the last person who could ever take me down. Understand!?\" The man shouted as a little glob of his spit landed on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly you wiped the coach's saliva off your cheek before swiftly reaching out and grabbing his nuts through his clingy work out shorts. Once you had them in the palm of your hand you squeezed as tight as you could without causing serious injury to the man. His stunned face wasn't sure what to do at first as the sudden pain shot through his gut and up his spine. After a moment or two though his grunts of pain had turned into a deep growl and seconds later he swung his closed right fist at your face. With the reflexes of the 8 men that you were composed of you easily dodged the blow and proceeded to tackle the coach to the ground. The two of you grappled for a while each taking turns on top as your interlaced fingers strained between the strength of each others arms. Eventually though it became clear that you were winning this contest of strength, but something else was happening too. Despite the fact that the necklace hadn't even come into play yet, the coach was tenting big time. He was getting off on having his dominance tested. Eventually you had him pinned and scooted up to lock him in a school boy pin with your crotch in his face as he laid pinned on his back. \"What's this coach hmm?\" You smiled your cheeky smile before reaching back and grabbing his stiffy through his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your hand on his cock sent him into a rage and he began thrashing to get free. \"I'm going to knock your damn teeth out you shit!\" He yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you had the strength advantage you elected to allow him to get free just long enough to get what you wanted. Once he was loose he tried to get to his feet but you pounced before he could. Locking an arm around his neck you trapped him in a dragon sleeper body scissor combo. His neck held tightly in the crook of your arm. He grunted and struggled feeling your powerful bicep flexing against his neck. After a few minutes of restricting his air a little Coach Travis started getting docile. \"Yeah that's right, time to end your reign as \"Boss\" coach.\" You gibed. Reaching down with your left hand you gently skimmed his abs until your hand slid under the waist band of his workout shorts. His weak groans of protest meant almost nothing as your powerful hand glided up and down his rock hard dick. It only took a minute or two before his body tensed up and he shot a load into his shorts. He let out a massive sigh feeling himself lose control to the mysterious stranger who had just dominated him. You pulled your hand free from his cum stained shorts and wiped his spunk on his abs. The question now was how far did you want to dominate him.</span></div></div>",

What the hell is this?!\" He shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Coach I wanna get bigger, bigger muscles, bigger cock, the whole shebang. So far I've merged seven guys into me and it's really shown up well, I mean I was strong enough to make a big tough guy like you my bitch. But I'm not quite there yet. I need a few more guys to reach my peak and you're going to make an awesome addition.\" You explain to your latest acquisition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell!\" The couch shouted trying to break free. He was strong enough that he managed to pull you both to your feet. He was strong enough that he could actually break free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to expedite things if you wanted to make his body part of your own. \"Sorry Coach, guess we're doing this the quick and dirty way.\" You smirk. Quickly pull his cum soaked shorts off before you force your entire body into his back from behind, like you were diving into his chiseled body. Coach Travis froze as he was overwhelmed by the lust and hormones of having eight other men force themselves into his body. His body began to change immediately as yours slowly enveloped his. Travis let loose a primal moan as he started to pummel his re-formed erection. His dick felt electric as the mass of your dick consumed and replaced his own. It wasn't long until it wasn't his hand stroking your dick but your own. Inch by inch you were taking him over, replacing him. His body ached and stretched as your muscle mass invaded him. All the while the Coach was spilling load after load of cum while his testicles became apart of your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" was all the big man could mutter before your head started to move into it's new home. Travis's face slowly morphed into your own, His face becoming less rugged and more square jawed. His hair turning darker like your own. One giant orgasm on both of your parts and you felt his subconscious slip deep into your own. Coach Travis was now just another piece of the fine specimen of man you had become. With and exhausted smile you reached down and slid Travis's cum stained shorts over your bubble butt and giant dick and walked out of the gym with another man in the mix. \"Eight down\" you mused to yourself. \"Should I push ten?\" You laughed. </span></div></div>",

You knew you wanted to add more men to your body but you needed somewhere to look. It was almost dawn now so you decide to get creative. Diving into the memories of one of your passengers could prove useful in finding another buff body to add to the mix. Taking a leap you delve into the memories of the cop you had absorbed at the start of the night. His name was Thomas and he'd been enjoying everything that had happened tonight. He was hesitant at first but was enjoying the sensations too much to keep fighting for long. Like most of the guys you had absorbed so far, was fine letting you have control since you were showing them such a good time. Josh and coach Travis were still vying for control over your body but they were vastly out numbered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a cop, Thomas had a lot of friends that worked int the system and some of whom fit the bill of men that would make fine additions to your ever more masculine and buff body. First was another cop who is a rival of Thomas. His name was Shawn and he was a lean fit kid who was fairly new to the police force. Like most rookies he was a show off and loved to talk himself up a lot. Thomas had seen him in the locker room and while he wasn't ripped he had a good body and nice sized dick to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy that stood out in Thomas's memories was a fire fighter friend who Thomas secretly admired. The dude was an all around athlete. He played rugby, water polo and football. His name was Davis and he was the poster man for the fire department. In fact he usually ended up on the front of their Shirtless Firefighter calendar for the year. Thomas buys one for \"charity\" every year but secretly kept it just so that he could see Davis when ever he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither choice would be a amazing but you had to make up your mind first.    </span></div></div>",

You had the ability to unite them and make their most primal urges a reality. Together you would all share one perfect body. It was getting closer to dawn so Davis would be just about to head home from the night shift at the fire house. With so many men already merged into you, your confidence had grown about as much as your anatomy. You pulled into the parking lot and watched out your rear view mirror waiting for the pretty boy to come out. While you waited it was hard to ignore your own reflection. You didn't even really feel like Scott anymore. Your face was so much different and sharing your mind with so many men made it feel like you had lead eight separate lives until tonight when they had all merged into one. You reached down and pet your crotch inside of your damp gym shorts and felt all of them ache through your dick, all locked in a state of erotic pleasure. Your once below average, teen aged cock was now an absolute monster that you could hardly clasp your hand around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could go any further you spotted Davis coming out of the back door of the fire station. You could see his ripped figure barely contained in his zip up hoodie. His short cropped blonde hair was dull in the early dawn light. You stepped out of Coach Travis's pick up with your dick tenting huge in your shorts. There was no point in hiding it now. You brazenly walked straight up to Davis who stared quizzically at the massive man that stood before him. \"Um, did you need something?\" Davis asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply smiled and twisted the necklace in your hands, activating the green glow. \"I like your hoodie.\" Reaching out your hand grasped the zipper and pulled it down revealing his undershirt. You could tell Davis was uncertain about what was happening but once the necklace had him locked in a trance, there was nothing he could do about it. \"Yeah here we go.\" You said pulling his hoodie off before slowly peeling off his undershirt and tossing both of them onto the hood of the pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis stammered and teetered on his feet. \"I don't understand, but I want to be close to you.\" He said as he started running his hands over your rock hard abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Davis, I have someone inside of me who wants to get closer to you too.\" You said pulling his jeans to the ground leaving him buck naked in the parking lot. Letting loose the draw string of Coach Travis's gym shorts you pulled the waist band out and dropped it low. \"Hop in.\" You smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both won't fit in there, will we?\" Davis asked in his dazed state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you're going to like the way you look in here.\" You smiled as Davis turned around and stepped into the leg holes next to your massive legs.Once the fireman was secure inside you pulled the gym shorts up and let the necklace go to work. Reaching into your shorts you pulled your massive dick under Davis's legs to the front of the shorts so that both of your cocks were at the front. \"Now let the magic happen.\" You moaned as your cock enveloped Davis's dick. He quickly became overwhelmed by the sensation of having so many cocks merged into one. Panting and moaning Davis reached down with both of his hands and started pumping your cock with his hands. You fell back against the truck enjoying the free hand job/jack off session. Davis was oblivious to the fact that it wasn't technically his cock anymore but was enjoying the feeling too much to care you expected. As your combined form shot out a torrent of cum Davis slowly started to disappear inside of you. His muscular form joining your even more impressive body. Slowly you reached out taking his hands and merging them into yours while you continued to jack yourself, feeling a cascade of orgasms every time you climaxed. Pulling what was left of Davis into you in a hug you forced him inside with a primal grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over you could feel Davis and Thomas inside of you finally together in every way two men could be, literally sharing a dick. Zipping your new hoodie over your ripped torso you got back into your pick up and drove off leaving Davis's other stuff behind. It was time to go find lucky guy # 10.  </span></div></div>",

You'd known him practically your whole life and ever since you moved in next door he'd always been a dick, especially to your sister Rebekah who was the closest to him in age. He worked for a local mechanic, and spent the rest of his free time partying with his buddies and training for his next mixed martial arts match. He had light brown hair which he was currently growing out and was currently hanging just under his jaw line. His body was partially covered in tattoo's chronicling his life and on a normal day he intimidated the hell out of you. But tonight with your special necklace and your dad's muscles filling out your body, you had no reason to be afraid of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrutting up to the entrance of his garage you casually lean on the wall and smile. \"Hi there.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb pulled his head up long enough to shoot you a dirty look. \"Who the hell are you and what do you want?\" He spat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to talk a little that's all.\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stood up cockily and wiped his hands on a dirty rag. \"Listen, what ever you're selling, I'm not buying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the time to make up your mind. Did you want to just force the jerk to merge against his will, or merge as equals and be a bit of a bad boy yourself? </span></div></div>",

This is all natural!\" He smirked flexing his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and step closer cautiously. \"Nah I'm not talking about drugs. It's temporary and you can back out anytime and it will give you literally double the strength, my strength that is.\" You explained. Caleb looked confused and a little defensive so you remained cautious. All you needed to do was touch him and the necklace would take care of the rest, of course considering he was a natural fighter that could prove problematic. \"All you have to do is shake my hand and trust me a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a small step backwards. \"I don't know about this shit.\" He admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels good, don't worry.\" You said lunging forward and grabbing his wrist. The necklace began to glow it's eerie green shimmer and you were both locked into the merging process. \"We should probably strip for this.\" You explain releasing your grip long enough to start removing your clothes. With the necklace in effect you both felt an incredible urge to press into each other and it took all of your will power to undress first. Once you were both naked you collided into each other. You wrapped your arms around his back and pulled his hips into yours. You dick's were shoved into each other and pressed between you. You both let out a primal grunt as your cocks slowly coiled each other then fused together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening!?!\" Caleb exclaimed. He was confused and a little scared but was turned on regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smiled as you felt your legs surging and fusing to his followed by your hips and ballsack. \"Just relax.\" Of course it was hard to relax while your new body taking shape. It was strange fusing to Caleb as equals. When you had merged with your dad you never lost control over anything, but now it was like neither of you could control your merged body parts. Slowly your torso's began to merge, your stomach and abs merging into a solid six pack. Four pecs becoming two well defined slabs, four arms to two arms and finally your head and necks throbbed into each other until there was only one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was finished you slumped forward catching your breath. Looking down you could see your dick was even longer now and was standing straight at attention. You could still feel your dad riding the pleasure waves inside of you but was still unaware of what was happening. Your body looked amazing, your father's muscles and Caleb's had merged into an Adonis like state. You had deep V cut abs and a nice wash board stomach. You also noticed that you had all of Caleb's tattoo's as well. Rushing over to the mirror on his motorcycle you looked in the mirror and were again impressed with the results. Your eye's weren't really blue anymore, they were hazel. Your short hair cut and Caleb's long hair cut had sort of met in the middle leaving you with a shaggy head of dark brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel Caleb taking up residence with your mind but it was different than you thought it would be. You thought that it would be more like you both were in control over the body but instead it was almost like you two were a different person that was half him and half you. You could at least feel that he was enjoying himself and had stopped freaking out over what was going on. Now you could have some real fun.</span></div></div>",

Deciding to use Caleb's underwear you are immediately aware of your throbbing erection. The feeling of the merge with the addition of you Father's ecstasy underneath was making you rock hard. You carefully tuck the boner into the pouch of his underwear and pull your pants up. Getting suited up you open the garage door, grab Caleb's gear bag and turn on the ignition of his motorcycle. \"Time to test this body out!\" You say to your self putting on his helmet and speeding off down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never even been on a motorcycle before tonight but with Caleb sharing your brain it was easy and a good learning experience. He was driving you to an underground fight club that ran down town on Friday and Saturday night. Caleb was prepping for his next league bout but with all this muscle and energy you couldn't resist testing out how well you would do in a fight. The streets were busy, it was Friday night after all, but one of the many benefits of being on a motorcycle was the ability to squeeze through tight spaces. A few tight corners and alleyways and you were there. It was an old warehouse that had been abandoned for years. The look out at the door gave you a once over before letting you inside. The current match was between two women who were pummeling the shit out each other. The crowds were roaring but even still it wasn't long until you found the organizer. He was the guy who set up the matches and ran the show. \"Hey, got room for another fighter for the night?\" You confidently ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organizer looks at you once and likes what he sees. \"Yeah sure kid, you wanna get your ass beat go 'head.  You're up after the ladies are done.\" He dismisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly head off to the washroom and get in your gear, making sure to hide the necklace in the pouch of your jock strap knowing that it was the safest place for it with this crowd. You come out in just your shorts, gloves and mouth guard. You head to the pit where the your opponent and the ref is waiting. It was an underground fight club so generally the rules were you fought until the other guy doesn't get up. Looking at your opponent you could see that he was a tough looking Asian guy with partially dyed blue hair. You hadn't seen him around but he looked like he might be a challenge. You bumped fists in the center and the ref signaled the start of the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was rumbling as you two circled each other trading jabs. You with your fists and your opponent with his legs. Caleb was best known for his ground submission game so he had to get this guy down to the mats to avoid taking a strong hit from his kicks. After exchanging a few blows a piece you saw an opening when he got a little sloppy with one of his kicks. Running in you nabbed him in a guillotine and hoisted him backwards in a suplex. You both tumbled back and rolled with you using the opportunity to not only get on top but grapevine his legs while still holding the guillotine. The hold was locked in so tight and the move was so painful you couldn't help but smile feeling your ripped opponent tapping his hand against your stomach to signify his submission. The ref quickly moved in to push you off of him but as you got off you noticed that the man was sporting a clear erection in his shorts. You were too but your jockstrap under your shorts was hiding it for the most part. You walked around the crowd with a hand raised in victory before the organizer came over and handed you $200. The man then shook your hand and pulled you closer to whisper to you. \"Come back next weekend and you get double that. Leoh was one of my best guys and you took him down quick. Always pay more to keep talent coming back.\" The organizer said before walking back towards his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only had you won but you had made some easy cash. Of course you'd have to split it with Caleb but who cares. Heading back to the locker room you got changed and grabbed your things putting the necklace back around your neck. As you went to leave you saw your former opponent in the showers. You could approach him or maybe go look for someone else to talk to or maybe merge with.  </span></div></div>",

Instead you toss your gear bag over your shoulder and head back out to the floor. It was pretty clear this used to be a factory of some sort judging by the set up. By the time you got back to the fight pit the next match was underway. Two heavy weight guys were beating the tar out of each other to the delight of the crowd. You watched from a distance until one of the men managed to clock the other in the head hard enough to knock him out. The ref ran over and that was that, another match over. You smiled to your self and turned to leave when you spotted one of Caleb's rivals standing out side with a few of his friends. Caleb immediately wanted to confront them but your cool head prevailed and you instead bide your time waiting for the group to break up. Once the coast was clear you headed out towards the parking lot. You were still packing a huge hard on since your dad was still riding the pleasure train inside of your collective body. Heading back to your motorcycle a voice called out from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad your opponent was such a pansy tonight Caleb. I was kinda hoping to see him wipe the floor with you.\" The voice said. It was Caleb's rival Kyle. He was about the same age as Caleb but had a shaved head and was always looking for a fight. \"Why do you look so different tonight? Did someone rearrange your face or something? I barely recognize you.\" Kyle taunted moving closer to you out of the darkness of the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to say, the last thing you wanted was to have him figure out what was going on. You decided to lie your way out of it. \"I'm not Caleb, I'm his cousin Mike. I borrowed Caleb's bike for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Then why is it you two have the same tats? Some sort of weird cousin bonding thing or something?\" Kyle said getting right in your face. He was clearly looking for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point there was really only two options, fight him or merge him.</span></div></div>",

Once he was close enough you reached out quickly and grabbed Kyle by the neck. The man instantly went rigid with fury but relaxed once the gem on the necklace began to glow, dropping his aggressive stance in favor of a nearly hypnotic one. \"Strip.\" You commanded him through your devious smile. The instantly aroused Kyle began to remove his clothing with lightning speed and you followed suit. The whole parking lot was dark so hopefully no one would be able to see what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kyle subdued in a hypnotic trance you stepped behind him and slapped his bare ass. \"Relax Kyle, you're about to be a part of a real man.\" You teased stepping forward letting your left leg merge into his left leg from behind. Feeling his leg being absorbed into you caused him to double forward a little with grunt. You weren't sure why but the feeling of merging with people felt better than anything you'd felt before and judging by the sounds that Kyle was making, he was enjoying it too. Not wanting him to fall down you reached out and grabbed him under his arms and pulled back while your right leg repeated the process. Bending down as much as you could you brought your erection under his ball sack and pressed your dicks together and let your cock start merging with Kyle's. The feeling made you moan and him whimper as some precum dripped onto the pavement. \"See Kyle? That's what a real man's dick feels like.\" You taunted as your dick began to assert control over his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't seem to care though as he was lost in the intense pleasure of what was happening. After a few minutes you were sharing a lower body while your torso's began to fuse into each other. Your right arm and his left vanishing between you as your bodies came together. Being another fighter Kyle was in incredible shape and all of his muscle was added to your already impressive body. By the time your abs and pecs had merged you looked like you had the body of a professional model or something. Both you and Kyle were breathing heavy while your heads merged into each other and the characteristics of your face changed for a third time. By the time you felt Kyle's consciousness retreat inside of you, you fell forward slightly and landed on your knees. Your dick was aching at this point and you had to take care of it before you went anywhere. Kneeling in the parking lot you stroked your sensitive dick a few times before shooting your hefty load onto the cool dark black top. You felt oddly satisfied seeing your combined dick triumph over Kyle in the best possible way. Way better than getting punched anyways. Standing up you could feel Kyle settling inside of you along with your dad. Both men stuck in a constant state of ecstasy while you and Caleb had complete control over your four man body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceeded to get dressed and tossed Kyle's clothes in your gear bag before getting on your motorcycle and driving off into the night.</span></div></div>",

He liked to wrestle and rough house with his friends when they were all hanging out but didn't really care for the hardcore MMA stuff that Caleb was into. Either way he was someone that you could lay this on and not have to worry about him freaking out about it or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short ride you walked inside and buzzed his door. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Caleb.\" You replied. Even though you weren't just Caleb it would be too hard to explain over the comm. A moment later the door clicked open and you stepped in. You knocked on his door and waited anxiously until he opened the door and stared at your blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you're not Caleb.\" He said getting ready to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you were twelve you broke your nose when you were bowling and I threw up when I saw the blood coming out of your face.\" You said kicking your foot forward to prevent him from closing the door. \"Just hear me out because you're not going to believe what's happening.\" You pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis reluctantly opened the door and let you inside and was regaled by the tale of the necklace and the rest of the evenings exploits. After a few minutes of looking stunned Travis finally managed to speak again. \"So you're four dudes in one body, but only you and your neighbour's kid have control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back in your chair and take a drink of his beer. \"Yeah that about sums it up. Feels pretty incredible if I'm being honest, even though I'm sharing my mind and body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who am I talking to exactly, Caleb or the neighbour kid?\" Travis asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both. We're sort of like a third person that only exists when we're fused together like this. Scott's dad and Kyle are just along for the ride and loving every minute of it. Check this out!\" You exclaim raising your shirt exposing your ripped stomach and v cut abdominals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Travis trailed off before reaching out to check that they were real. \"This is insane. You barely even look like yourself. I mean I see it but it's just a small part.\" Travis sat back down and polished off his beer. \"So what're you going to do now? I mean you can't stay like that forever can you?\" He inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well technically we could but I think people would start to catch on. Tonight we're just out to have some fun and wondered if you would be interested in joining in?\" You asked with a devious grin.</span></div></div>",

You were lost in your killer orgasm when all of the sudden a voice rang out in your mind. \"Well this is a fine mess you've gotten us into Scott.\" The voice stated. It was your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? Is that you?\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah It's me. I don't really know what's happening but I'm guessing what ever you did to me, someone did to you and now we're both stuck in someone's head.\" He groaned through his own intense pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all my fault. I should have never let Mr.Wood get a hold of that necklace.\" You said feeling your dad's presence getting closer to you. \"Now we're stuck in him for god knows how long. He could technically keep us like this for the rest of his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you could feel your Father's presence right beside you. \"Not necessarily...\" He trailed off.</span></div></div>",

You faded away into black while he surged with the mental energy he needed to usurp control over your collective bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside a hot blondish twenty year old Mr.Wood stopped dead in his tracks feeling an odd sensation welling up inside of him.

With him and Mr.wood still merged into one body he looked way different. His face was covered in a light brown stubble and his hair was lighter too. Both men had blue eyes so that was mostly unchanged but your dad's smile had been replaced by Mr.Wood's square jaw, dimpled, charming smile. His body was amazing with the two bodies merging into an amazing figure of manliness. His proud 11\" dick was standing at attention and sticking straight up. You'd be lying if you weren't a little turned on by him. \"I told you to trust me son. Listen to me next time.\" He teased you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly got to your feet still a little wobbly. \"How did you know that would work, you know with the mind merging and everything?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say it's not the first time I've come into contact with this necklace before. And don't think for a minute that I forgot you merged me against my will buddy.\" He said walking into the bathroom and turning on the tub. \"Now I'm going to stay here for a few hours and enjoy being merged with your teacher for a while. Which means you can take the necklace out for a spin for a few hours, but you had better be back here by 11 pm sharp.\" He commanded before tossing you the necklace. \"Be careful not to lose it again or else I'll be stuck merged with your teacher forever, and you'll be the one explaining that to your mother.\" With the necklace now back in your hands you turned to leave when he said one final thing to you. \"And once you find someone to merge with you can always come back and we can play in the jacuzzi together.\" he said with a wink.</span></div></div>",

You headed to the back and stripped out of your clothes, wrapping your torso in a clean towel thinking that it would make it easier when you found the man your were looking for. You didn't have to wait long until you found some options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men were in the locker room. One was leaving the showers while the other was just entering. The first guy was a shredded black man who was about 6 feet tall. He had a shaved head and an decent sized dick hanging between his legs. You'd seen him before but didn't know him all that well. You had heard that he was an investment banker and was loaded, not that you were after his money though. The man had an incredible body. Slab pecs, 6-pack V cut abs, a light dusting of chest hair. He was a solid choice that your dad would probably approve of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy actually looked a fair bit like you. He had short cut dark hair and a lean muscular build, but unlike you had dark brown eyes instead. His dick was just as ample as the black guy's was and he had a dark treasure trail running down his tight abs down to his groin. More notable was his height as the man was just shy of 7 feet tall. While he walked into the showers you caught a nice view of his tight bubble butt that had a little bit of hair on it running up from his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither choice would be a great addition to your body but you had to choose fast.The first guy was going to get dressed and leave pretty soon.   </span></div></div>",

I mean I'm trying to put on muscle but I'm just not having any luck.\" You lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shrugged and tucked his towel around his waist. \"Well it takes a lot of work but once you get it, you just have to maintain. How long have you been trying?\" He inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 3 months now I guess. All the jocks in my school have no problem with this stuff but I just can't seem to get it right you know? I don't even know where to start.\" You whined moving a few steps closer. He seemed fairly relaxed so he wasn't creeped out or anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you should try to focus on your core and then build up from there. Why don't you try..!!\" He gasped as your hand clasped his butt cheek from behind. The green glow of the necklace putting him into a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, you and me are going to have some fun tonight.\" You say with a cocky smile. Coming from behind him you reach out and grab his hands with yours. You were both immediately hard by the contact while your 20 fingers slowly fused down to 10. You slowly flexed your new hands while your body slowly merged into his back. Next you decided to expedite merging your heads together to prevent him from making any loud moans. Leaning forward you kissed him on the lips allowing your mouths to merge first while your heads slowly became one. Your face combined features with yours while you slowly took over his senses. Finally there was just your lower body and stomach. You watched as his dark complexion change as it merged with your pale skin, meeting somewhere in the middle between your skin tones. Slowly your skinny teen legs pulsed into his muscular thighs and calves. Last but certainly not least were your genitals. Looking down you saw your two ballsacks slowly merging into each other leaving just your two erect cocks sticking straight up. Reaching down with your new body you grabbed both of the dicks and pressed them together until slowly they twisted around each other and became one. You could still feel his dick enjoying the ride to the very last before his consciousness sank into you, trapped in a moment of ecstasy. Then it was just you standing butt naked in front of his open locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside his locker you first took a look at your new face in his mirror. Your skin was a true mix of both of your skin tones, landing on a caramel colour. Your hair was about the same colour but the sides and back were shaved like your unaware passenger's head while the top was still sporting your short dark cut. Your face had changed dramatically but in a good way. You were still sporting your blue eyes and and dimpled smile but the rest was a true merging of your face and his. Before you closed his locker you spotted the mans gear bag full of a bunch of stuff. Jock straps, thongs, he even had a few wrestling singlets. Deciding there was no harm in taking them you grabbed the bag before retrieving your clothes and leaving the locker room.  </span></div></div>",

We have these bodies for the night so lets use it to get those skills up. We'll have some fun with it.\" Your dad explained. \"What colour do you want, red or blue?\" He asked holding one in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, blue I guess. What do you mean the necklace can help?\" You ask taking off the necklace and setting on the dresser. It was clear that your dad knew more about the necklace than you thought but you weren't entirely sure what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and tossed you the blue singlet. \"I'll tell you later. Here's how this is going to go. We start off in singlets, when you get a submission or get the other guy pinned, the loser down grades their under gear. So if I pin you you lose the singlet and switch to a thong, if I pin you again you switch to a jock strap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what?\" You ask slipping into the singlet and pulling it up over your hard dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After jock strap is naked, and then you'll have to wait and see. Ready?\" He asks getting to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow suit and kneel in front of him. \"Ready.\" Just like that you two started your wrestling match. You and your dad used to wrestle all the time until you hit puberty and you grew a part a little. This was probably the most time you've spent with him in over a year. Your dad had been a wrestler in his youth so he quickly managed to flip you onto your back and pin your shoulder to the floor. You grunted while you strained against him but he tapped the floor three times with his free hand. Considering he was still merged with Mr.Wood he was even stronger than you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One point for me.\" He said with a devious grin before reaching up and slowly peeling your singlet off your body. Your boner sprang free and slapped against your ripped abs. You sat up as he tossed you a purple thong from the gear bag. \"Put that on. You got that big muscular body right now bud, you better figure out how to use it or you'll be naked before I'm even out of my singlet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into the thong you gave your junk a light rub. \"Ready when you are old man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" He said lunging at you again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you both locked arms and strained against each other. Eventually you managed to push forward and he fell onto his back with you on top. Getting on top of him you pinned his arms to the ground but he quickly managed to break free and began trying to flip you so he was on top. Not willing to give up you re-doubled your efforts and slid up him pinning his arms with your knees, leaving your crotch in its purple pouch sitting right in front of his face. Despite him trying to bridge up you used all of your strength to push down on his upper body keeping him pinned for a three count. \"Point for me.\" You smiled down at him. To rub it in you decided to lift his head up and force his face into your crotch for a second before you climbed off of him pulling his singlet off in the process. Walking over to the gear bag you fished out a silver thong and tossed it to him. You got back on your knees just as he slid the silver pouch over his stiff dick. \"Ready for round three?\"   </span></div></div>",

Your respective thongs were barely containing either of your manhood's. Deciding to have a little fun since you were both pretty horny, you reached around and grabbed the round orb of your dad's butt slowly moving a finger towards his hole. He reared up when you got close. \"I don't remember that move being taught in school.\" He chuckled. You used the opportunity to get your head free and wrestle him to the ground where you quickly applied leg scissors around his abdomen. Holding onto his left arm in the process you proceeded to squeeze your legs together as tight as you could. He tightened his abs as best as he could while trying to bridge out of the move but you kept the hold tight. \"You submit?\" You asked squeezing your legs together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" He defiantly spat. Of course a moment later he changed his mind and tapped your thigh with his hand. \"Alright! I submit!\" He conceded before you released the hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at your point you quickly pulled his thong off and tossed it on the floor. You noticed he was leaking a little precum.

You heard him moan as you started to pump his cock. You could feel him starting to writhe under your grip and leaned back. \"I think I have you now old man. Ready to give it up?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could do was answer with a primal grunt. A moment later his body tensed up and a steady stream of pearly white cum shot out of his cock and splattered on his abs. You kept stroking him until you were satisfied that you'd won. Your exhausted father laid in your grasp as you reached over to the dresser and grabbed the necklace. He saw you grab the necklace and nodded. \"A deal's a deal. You earned it Scott. Just don't get into too much trouble with my body. Oh and the last bit about the necklace is that you can make a merge permanent but it takes some practice.\" He said watching you put the necklace on preparing to be merged into your body. </span></div></div>",

Reaching down you grabbed your dick and brought it into contact with his. \"See that old man? Even your cock wants me in charge.\" You chuckled as your cock coiled around his and started pulling it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could do at this point was moan as he was under the necklaces spell. You watched as your torso's slowly came together. Your right arm and his left disappeared between you, then four pecs turned into two, two sets of six packs became one. You were both panting by the time it was just your heads that were separate. Using both hands you slowly forced your heads into contact with each other and they joined together. You could feel your dad slowly falling into the depths of your subconscious along with Mr.Wood and the gym goer. That was it, your dad was now completely merged into your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bathroom you looked in the full length mirror to check your self out and damn you looked good. Your skin tone was lighter now, you just looked as if you had a solid tan. Your eyes were a murky blue colour and your face looked fairly similar to you and your dad. Age wise you looked like you were probably just shy of thirty. You had the body of a fitness model and a dick that any guy would envy. You were so turned on you started stroking your dick while flexing your bicep and looking at yourself in the mirror. You grunted as you pumped out a massive 4 man sized load which splattered onto the mirror and slowly dripped down. You don't know why but having three men merged into you was hotter than you ever thought it would be. One of those men being your father was just the cherry on top. </span></div></div>",

Your dad used to have a merge buddy, and in addition to that let you know that it was possible to make a merge permanent. Unfortunately he didn't offer up any info on how, probably because he was afraid you would have done it to him. With your Dad now locked away inside of you, wrapped in an erotic embrace, the only one who could give you answers would be Ben Markham. It was time to seek him out. You weren't even sure if you wanted the merge to be permanent but the idea was too intriguing to pass over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the bathroom you stopped briefly to get dressed. Just touching your dick while you were getting dressed was enough to make it stand at attention. If it wasn't you that was turned on it was one of the men you had fused inside of you. Grabbing the gym guys phone you quickly looked up Ben Markham and found that he was still living in town and was a plastic surgeon of all things. You quickly found a link to his private practice and your jaw nearly hit the floor. Ben Markham, despite pushing 50, looked like a man in his mid thirties. He looked absolutely incredible and you could guess why. If he had perma-merged with someone the result would be just that. You would have to be cautious if you wanted answers, this guy knew his way around the necklace and you currently looked like a greek god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the hotel and grabbed a cab to Ben's work address. He must've been working late because the lights were still on. Paying the cab driver you hopped out and walked up to the doors and pulled them open. There was no one at the reception desk which was odd. A moment later the tall handsome doctor Ben Markham stepped out from the back room. He smiled and nodded at you. \"Hi there, sorry I sent my staff home early while I caught up on some paper work. Did you have and appointment or hoping for a quick consult?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back and decided to jump straight into it. \"My name is Scott, I think you and my dad used to be friends. Really close friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I think I know what this is about. I almost didn't recognize you Scott. I've been watching your Dad for a while. Keeping tabs on him.\" He said sitting behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little shocked that he knew your name. \"It wasn't a coincidence that I found the necklace is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and shrugged. \"Smart boy. Me and your dad were almost inseparable for 3 years. We spent as much time as we could merged together. We took turns at first but then we started little wrestling matches to see who would get to merge who. Then one day I won the match and merged with him and decided I didn't want to let him go. Kept him merged to me for just shy of a month and every day of it felt amazing. I could feel him in my every fiber, throbbing, almost electric. Sadly I made the mistake of letting him loose. He was so furious that he cut all ties and went and married your mother. I merged with other guys but none of them felt the same. He and I are linked. I want to merge with him forever but I could never get close until now. So I'm going to have to ask you for that necklace back, right after you release your dad and leave us to finish our business.\" He smugly stated stretching out his hand.  </span></div></div>",

You were thinking about how to handle the situation when you heard the door lock behind you. Turning you saw another young guy in his late teens early twenties standing at the door closing the blinds over the windows. You guessed by his appearance that he was likely Ben's son or relative. You weren't going to just hand your dad over like a piece of meat. If they wanted a fight, you and your dad would give them one. You slowly pulled your dad's consciousness out of the depths of your mind. \"You've been paying attention in here right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad was still feeling wrapped tight in his everlasting orgasm but managed to answer. \"Mmmm Hmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm going to let you out and hand you the necklace. I'll take care of his friend. You show Ben Markham who the real man is.\" You say in your head. A moment later you look Ben in the eye. \"You want him? You got him.\" And with that you begin the process of releasing your Dad's body from your form. It felt like your body was hooked up to an electrical socket. Everything was tingling as your dad slowly slipped away from you and landed on the floor in front of you. His hand slowly reached around his back and you handed him the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy in the back moved up to snatch it but you quickly grabbed him and began to tussle and restrain him. Your dad in all his naked glory stood up and faced his old friend for the first time in years. Putting the necklace around his neck he smirked. \"Hey Ben, it's been a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed to himself and shook his head. \"You can't just accept it can you? You were meant to be a part of me and you know it Daniel. Just give me the necklace so that I can complete our transformation.\" he stretched out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?!\" The man you were struggling with spurted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Riley. I'm the dominant one, always have been. Even if Daniel here doesn't want to admit it.\" Ben said stepping forward getting close to snatching the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou in the mean time had managed to wrestle Riley to the ground and pin him there in a school boy pin, with your crotch resting just south of his neck on his chest while holding his hands down. Considering you still had 2 other men merged into you, Riley couldn't really hold a candle to you strength wise. Looking over your shoulder you called to your dad. \"DAD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your voice, all doubt vanished from your father's face. \"No Ben you used to be the dominant one. I've learned a lot since the last time we saw each other. First and foremost my family needs me and I'm not letting you take me from them.\" Just then Ben lunged forward attempting to grab the necklace but your dad impressively subdued the beefy doctor and the green glow of the necklace had already locked them into a trance. \"Now why don't you take those clothes off so we can see who's really the dominant one.\" Your dad smiled while the necklace worked it's magic.In a trance Ben tore off his shirt and pulled down his pants. Both he and your dad were sporting massive erections already. Your dad moved in close and pulled down Ben's underwear before playfully spinning Ben so they were facing the same direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what was about to happen, Riley started thrashing as hard as he could but you knew there was no way he was going to break free. You watched as your Dad started to merge with his rival. Ben whimpered as your father pressed their cocks together. His dick began to pull Ben's in, making him spray a gusher of cum onto the floor. Both men moaned. Your dad was relishing the control while Ben relinquished it. As a set of arms disappeared between their torsos your Dad playfully reached down and squeezed their nutsakcs against each other. Ben let loose a small yelp before blowing a second load as his nuts became your Dad's. Inch by inch your Dad's domination of Ben moved forward. Their heads quickly fused together and slowly your dad was taking control of every muscle. Their fused body looked like Ben's ripped physique had only a little more pale then before. Your dad turned and looked at himself in the mirror while Ben only had use of a single eye remaining. \"You're right Ben. We do belong together. We're a fine looking specimen. The only thing your got wrong is which one of us deserved to be in control.\" Your dad said. Ben's control over the left eye was fading and it rolled back as he had his last and strongest orgasm yet. Your Dad grunted and the last of Ben Markham's cum pooled onto the floor. Your dad flexed briefly in the mirror before taking the neck lace off and scoffing. \"No one screws with my family.\" He said walking over to you. He handed the necklace back to you with a grin. \"Thanks Scott. I'm proud of how you handled that. How do you want to handle him?\" Your dad asks looking down a stunned Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile \"Oh I've got an idea.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Riley was around your age and had a modelesque quality about his appearance so the idea of merging him to you had piqued your interest. He was tall, lean and tanned. His hair was light brown and well kept and he had some light stubble. He was still struggling to free himself under your muscular body but having no luck. \"Let me go!\" Riley spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad took a break from admiring his new acquisition to his body in order to look down at the pinned young man on the floor. \"Let's see, you and your father lured my son here to perma-merge me and I'm guessing him too. Now I've settled things with your dad. He's quite content inside of me I can promise you. As for what Scott here wants to do with you, I'll leave that to him. What do you say Scott?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to take him out for a test drive, but I kinda just want it to be the two of us. You mind taking over here while I release the other two?\" You smirk up at your dad who smiles and takes over restraining Riley on the ground while you head to door and head outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much on, just a pair of boxer briefs, so the cool night air sent shivers down your back. You really liked being merged with these two but they were both older than you and it would be hard to explain to people how it is a 17 year old suddenly just woke up looking like he was in his late twenties. If you were going to make a move to perma-merge with another guy, Riley would be a much better fit. So that meant the other two had to go. Bracing yourself against the building you started letting go of them. First the Gym goer came out. Your two completely different skin tones separating into two bodies. His naked body slipped away and he fell gently onto the grass outside the building, unconscious. His dick was still swollen to it's limit even as he lay there in the cool night air. With one free it was Mr.Wood's turn. Your grunted and came as his cock slowly came free from yours as if they didn't want to part. After his dick was free the rest of him was released pretty fast. You sighed as he broke free and landed next to the gym rat on the lawn. His tight bubble butt resting right up against the gym rat. You turned and walked back inside leaving the underwear outside for them to fight over when they woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back inside you hit the lights and locked the door. Your dad was still sitting on top of Riley holding him down. He looked up at you and smiled. \"Back to your old self eh?\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clutched the necklace in your hands. \"Not for long.\" You replied stepping towards Riley and your dad. Your Dad climbed off and you climbed on. This time you sat on his stomach facing down towards his crotch. You reached down and stroked Riley's cock a little and watched it spring to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm! Please! I'm not my dad! I was never going to merge you forever. I swear!\" Riley pleaded trying to wriggle free from your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand on the necklace and the other grasping both of your cocks, holding them against each other, you looked back over your shoulder at Riley. \"Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. But I have a way to know for sure.\" Giving him one last smile you let the necklace get to work. The green glow lighting up the dark room. You heard Riley moaning behind you as your cock quickly enveloped his.You could feel the surge of his orgasm as he pumped out his load, spraying it up onto your stomach. It didn't take long for your genitals and hips to merge. With a look of ecstasy on your face you lay back on top of Riley. Your torso's immediately began to join together while your legs had already partially merged from four to two. Riley reached down half trying to stop the merging and half trying to enjoy it. Reaching out you grabbed his right hand with your left and held it tightly in between you letting them both disappear into your newly formed body. Riley was cumming every minute now and each time he lost a little more control over your combined body. Slowly you could feel yourself gaining control over the left arm that used to be Riley's. Once you had it, you reached down and furiously jacked your cock while your heads began to join. Riley grunted feeling your palm stroking your cock. He quickly jettisoned another load of pearly white semen onto your ripped lean body. \"Who's cock is it Riley?\" You smirked as your faces began to merge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whimpered slightly as you continued to stroke your dick. \"Ugh! It's yours! Oh god it's yours!\" He moaned shooting a final load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later you felt his consciousness drop into the depths of your mind caught in a never ending orgasm. You panted catching your breath before your dad reached down and gave you a hand up. He had grabbed a tissue from the desk and started using it to clean Riley's cum of your ripped abs. \"Damn Scott, you look good.\" He said directing you to the full length mirror on the wall. He wasn't kidding. Your and Riley's cocks had made a beautiful 11\" dick. Your skin was lightly tanned all over and your two young bodies merged together so well that you looked way more ripped than either of you had been before. You were taller now too, about 6' tall. Your hair was brunette and tousled nicely. Your faces merged together just as well, taking the best features of both of you and putting them on display. Impressed with your new body, it was time to decide whether or not you wanted to make Riley a permanent fixture or not.    </span></div></div>",

His consciousness was caught in a never ending orgasm and you could feel the waves of ecstasy washing over him. It made his mind an open book. Concentrating your thoughts you managed to push your way into his head and look at Riley's inner workings. It didn't take long until you found what you were looking for. It was a memory of Riley talking to his dad, Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that was a good idea dad? I mean trusting a novice with the necklace like that?\" Riley talked into his cell phone while watching Scott from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just laughed. \"Ha! Either way I'll get what I want. Giving Scott the necklace will eventually lead Daniel back to me so I can finally complete myself. He and I will be one perfect man again whether he likes it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley shrugged. \"Well if Daniel looks anything like his son, I can see the appeal. Scott's a looker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you might want to take the plunge too. I perma-merge with Daniel, you perma-merge with his son, sounds kinda perfect doesn't it? That way all of us can be together in a way.\" Ben droned on over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel Riley's excitement at the prospect of perma-merging you. He was pitching a tent in his jeans big time. \"How does it work? Making it permanent that is?\" His voice shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not hard kiddo. You just have to get their consciousness to trust you a little, then you give them control over your cock and don't stop stroking until they have no cum left to give. One orgasm with empty nuts and you can force their mind to fuse into yours. Two minds become one with you in the drivers seat. Think of it like a tree with a grafted branch on it. You'll just be grafting Scott into your mind like he was always there.\" Ben explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't people miss him? People don't just vanish like that.\" Riley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The necklace's mojo takes care of that. If you perma merge someone people just start to forget that they were ever even here. They could be looking at a picture of them and not even see them. My only regret is that I chose to let Daniel out after I had perma-merged him the first time. I should have just kept him a part of me but with any luck that will soon be rectified.\" Ben sounded dreamy and excited, lost in the prospect of re-obtaining your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley was still curious. \"Why did you let him go? It sounds like it was incredible so why would you give him up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed. \"It was a mistake. I was playing with myself and wanted to see if there was a way that he and I could screw while still being the same person. I've since learned how to do it with the necklaces help but back then I was clueless and accidentally set him free. It's a mistake I will not make again. Now keep your eye on Scott and make sure he doesn't get in over his head. You do that and I'll lend you the necklace for some fun time with Scott.\" Ben said before hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley tucked his phone into his pocket and continued spying on Scott. The boner in his underwear had not gone away and he re-positioned it for comfort. \"I'm going to merge to that guy tonight.\" Riley said with a dirty smile on his handsome face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back from Riley's memories you were angry that he had lied to you. Were you angry enough to perma merge him though, that was the question. </span></div></div>",

You sat in a chair in the corner of the room and started to do exactly what Ben had told Riley to do to you. You brought Riley's dazed mind into your head and let him get comfortable. \"Hey Riley. You doing ok in there?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt him sigh feeling wrapped tightly in an powerful orgasm. \"Oh yeah....I always forget how good this feels.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled to yourself. \"Yeah it feels pretty good to me to. But I got to say, it feels like you're begging for a release. You want me to take care of that for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley was aware of the process you were trying to get underway but he was powerless to resist. A slave to his sexual high. \"Ugh! Please...oh please let me cum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was exactly what you wanted to hear. Slowly you gave Riley complete control over your combined cock and just your combined cock. It immediately became rock hard and stuck straight out. You spit in your palm and reached down grabbing the shaft. It was strange to touch your own dick and barely even feel it. With him in control of your dick, you could only feel it through Riley feeling it. With your slick palm you began to glide up and down the length of your and Riley's cock. It didn't take long for Riley's first load to shoot out onto the floor. You kept stroking even though you could feel his resistance building. He was trapped now, All he wanted to do was cum but he knew that if he ran out of spunk to give you could force his mind to fuse to yours. \"Just give it up Riley.\" He whispered, biting your lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley's consciousness squirmed in your head as he pumped out a smaller second load. \"Mmmph! Come on Scott, don't do this. We can merge as equals! wouldn't that be better!?\" He pleaded while you continued to work his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and cum Riley.\" You grunted feeling another load building. His third load was his smallest yet. You both knew that he was running on empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of your powerful hand rubbing his sensitive member was too much. \"Ugh! Damn! Ah!\" You heard his voice in your head. Finally he gave up his fourth and final orgasm. This time no cum came out. He was empty and it was time to force him to fuse to you. Reaching deep inside of yourself you pulled his consciousness into your own. Suddenly all of his thoughts and memories became your thoughts and memories. Riley had joined you completely and he was even aware of what had happened. He woke up this morning as Riley, but he would be going to bed tonight as Scott.</span></div></div>",

At the very least, you managed to get the necklace back.<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I don't think we ever met.\" You continued, trying to get through the awkward situation. This would have probably gone smoother if your father was the one in control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wood smiled at you gently. Despite this wierd \"first\" impression he seemed to relax. This could be your chance to try and merge with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You had to make sure you wouldn't be interrupted for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the dog and kneel in near it, coaxing it to come closer.  \"Hey, boy!\" You call, getting it to wag it's tail and gently nuzzle against your leg. Well, he certainly is friendly enough. <br>\r\nYou take a second to scratch the back of its ears,calm him down, and check between its legs, just to make sure what were you up against. He is male, and lucky for you, he is not neutered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna, merge with me big boy?\" You say, while rubbing on the dog's furry back. He quickly reacts, getting excited at your friendly tone and playfully jumping around you. You smile at his enthusiam and guide him to a secluded spot nearby, already casting away your clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the necklace in your hand, closed tight around it. Your heart is pounding, the idea of merging with that dog is strange, but the thought somehow excites you. You cock hardens in anticipation of what you will become when you and that dog are one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down again near the dog, who eagerly strolls down to you. You take the chance to remove his collar, and leave both of you \"naked\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment has come. You hold the necklace in your hand and touch the dog on his neck. The effects are instantaneous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky emits a short grunt and immediately starts to pant. It's strange to witness the arousal in an animal. But you can certainly tell that he is excited. He almost pounces on you, licking your naked chest, neck and cheeks with his warm tongue before suddenly droping on the ground on his back, exposing himself to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see his cock, popping out of his sheath. Out of instinct, you lay down too, next to him, and press the side of your body to his. As his furry skin and yours make contact you feel the process starting. Side to side you begin to fuse with the husky, His left hind paws sink into your right leght, making your limb bulge out with new mass. You feel the bones and muscles transform and stretch. Your toes grow out into claws as a layer of grey fur starts to grow out of your skin. You right arm moves around the dog's neck, as you pull him towards your chest. The husky emits a pleased grunt as he pants even harder, and you suddenly feel a wave of animalistic lust invade your brain. <br>\r\nPrimal desire invades your now conjoined bodies, coaxing you to speed up the process. <br>\r\nOut of sheer lust, you reach down and press your leaking dick against the dog's knot and the two almost immediately melded together, causing you both to moan in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep pulling him towards you, allowing your body to absorb more and more of his. At this point, you are half covered in the canine's grey fur, and your muscles are swelling, taking in the animal vigor of the husky. Of course, you chose to absorb the mind of the dog, as sharing control with a dog would certainly put your cover at risk. That didn't protect you from experiencing the heightening of your senses and the increased sensitivity of your know knotted cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, only the dog's neck and head still remained unmerged, until with a last lustfull grunt, you forced them together. You felt your skull shift, pushing out into a muzzle, your ears perked up as fur creeped on your face and your fangs sharpen inside your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last moments of the transformation subsided, you felt the canine inside you climax, making you howl and cum through your hybrid cock. Thick streams of sticky cum splattered on your furry chest as you arched your back in sheer bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, exhausted by the intense experience as you feel the mind of the dog become locked in a state of permanent orgasm inside you. It resonates with your father's own, both of them linked by their mutual sexual drive. This merging was certainly different. The sensations were definitely stronger, probably due to the animal's senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you check yourself out. As you stand, you realize how much your body has changed. Your  frame is now completely covered in fur, which can't hide how <br>\r\nmuscular you've become. You flex your arms making your biceps bulge and then stare at your clawed hands, which now have pads on the palms. <br>\r\nYou feel a curly tail brush up against your back and your legs have shifted, your feet having become digitigrade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour senses have become more acute. You can take the different scents that float in the park. The trees, the wet grass, the crisp smell of fast food or the sweat of the night joggers. Your hearing has become more sensitive too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a familiar voice calling. It's a male voice. The dog inside you recognises his owner. He is calling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There is a man, standing in the middle of the way, looking around. He is holding a leash in his left hand. He looks a bit worried as he calls you again. He is your owner. Or rather the dog's owner. It's strange how the canine's mind can't provide you with a name for that person. You just \"feel\" the certainty that you know him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can pick up his scent too and the urge to come forward increases. You feel a strong need to come to his side and nuzzle against his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is smaller than you but now that you have increased in size that doesn't make him short. His skin is a bit darker than yours was when you were fully human. He's probably latino or half-latino. He stands around 6 ft, with a burly body. Broad shoulders, strong arms and toned pecs. He is sporting a good muscle gut which stretches his shirt with its firm roundness. <br>\r\nHis frame combined with his short black hair and manly beard suit his angular jaw and well balanced face, certainly giving him the appearance of the sterotypical bear.

He almost tears his shirt appart, quickly removing his clothes while you assist him in doing so. Each moment that passes you feel your father taking more control of your body but luckily you can still move. Maybe the necklace's magic is keeping him at bay while the merging process lasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular man below you now lays completely naked below you. His cock is already hard and leaking and startes up at you with a lustful longing in his eyes. <br>\r\nYou bring your chiseled beastly physique down on him, reaching for his hips and pressing your knotted cock against his own shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour members glue to each other, stuck by the necklace's magic until your bigger shaft envellops the man's own, becoming a thick sensitive rod of pulsing manhood. The rest follows suit. As you lean further down on him, you align your legs with the man's own pushing your hind paws against his feet first, then your thighs. Your legs merge quickly, becoming thick furry pillars of sheer strenght. You both moan in delight at the sensations while you can't help but thrust your hips at the man, causing your ballsacs to touch and subsequentily fuse into a pair of heavy testicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merging progresses further up as you are now pretty much laying on top of the man. You wrap your clawed hands around the man's own and your fingers fuse together. Your arms follow and now only the man's chest and head remain unmerged to yours. You quickly remedy that, leaning down to plant a wet kiss on the guy's  lips causing his face to become stuck to yours and mushed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as the process started, the merging is complete. Your features rearange taking in some of the man's traits. Your blue eyes are now a bit darker, while your fur has taken a light brownish tint. You have gained a scruffy line of darker fur on your jaw and on your head, mimicking the man's beard and hair. Of course you are now bigger, after absorbing the man's generous muscle mass and cock size. You stand a head taller than before and a round muscular gut curves above your thick knotted cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most importantly the plan worked. Now that you have the mind of the man on your side you manage to keep your father at bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...this is great!\" You say as you flex your bulging arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, in the confusion and panic of the moment one of the Zebras, a rather large and imposing male has become stuck with a rope that was laying close to the exiting door. The thick lace has become entangled around his neck and the more he bucks and tries to pull himself away the more he tightens the rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!

This time, it was simple given that the stripped animal seemed to be completely compliant. As the caretaker did so, the Zebra trotted around him happily, nudging his back with his snout in what seemed to be an affectionate gesture. Of course there was more to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could actually see the protruding equine cock of the Zebra harden and dangle down between his legs. The magic of the necklace was in full work now. <br>\r\nAlex seemed stunned by that, but as the Zebra insisted on rubbing his neck and nudging against his belly and back, he seemed to get what was happening. And he seemed to not want to fight it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Alex strip down, exposing his chiseled but rather lean figure to his soon to be body mate. You saw the human was actually packing. His cock was already hard and leaking and must have been at least a good 9 or 10 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, the Zebra lowered his head and took the human's cock in his mouth, causing Alex to gasp in surprise at the moist lips and warm tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh....ung...ooooh...w-what the hell am I doing?...\" You hear him moan as his legs trembled from the sensations. The Zebra seemed eager to pleasure the human and he kept sucking him off for a few more minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the equine pulled the cock out of his mouth and clopped around the human, this time presenting his rear to his caretaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex seemed hesitant at this point. \"Y-you want me...you want me to...?\" You hear him ask. The Zebra bucked his head and emited a short neigh of approval, almost encouraging the human to mount him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde man seemed confused but he complied. He reached down for a stepstool close by and placed it near the equine's behind. Then he climbed up and hesitantly let his lubbed hard-on rub against the Zebra's tailhole. Alex still seemed hesitant, but when the Zebra started to grind and massage his cock with his muscular cheeks, all doubt seemed to vanish from the human's mind. <br>\r\nAlex pressed the tip of his cock against that thick ring and without much effort, slipped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard him emit a pleased moan as he started thrusting in and out, fucking the Zebra, who seemed to be completely enthralled by that. <br>\r\nYou could smell the strong scent of equine musk fill the stable as you saw the stallion's cock leak thick goblets of precum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. The process started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex seemed to have increasing trouble pulling out his cock and ramming it back in. Tha magic of the necklace was making him press his firm pelvis harder and harder against the Zebra's backside, until he could no loger pull out. At that point he arched his back in sheer bliss as his legs became stuck with the Zebra's powerful thighs. They were finally merging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou witnessed the Zebra slowly move back, pushing his hooved limbs into the human's legs, making them obscenely bulge with new mass and muscle. The step stool shattered under the added weight and Alex could not help but moan again at the feeling of his lower body melding with the Zebra's ample rear. A long horse tail sprouted from Alex's ass as his asscheeks fused and grew out into two powerful stripped mounds of muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zebra continued to push back against the human, who was now merged up to his midsection with him. Alex was forced to lean forward, pressing his belly against the back of the equine which immediately became attached to his chest. You could see the equine shrink and adapt to the smaller human's body at the same time that the caretaker seemed to grow, finding a balanced size for their union. <br>\r\nAlex aligned his arms with the Zebra's front legs and those too melded together into a pair of bulging, muscular limbs. The hooves split into five thick black-hooved fingers while the now almost completed merger shifted his possition, standing up to rest his weight on his powerful legs. <br>\r\nYou could see his pecs and abs pushing out into a wall of strenght and muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the Zebra's remaining head and neck pushed back and melded with Alex's own and the equine's traits rearanged into the caretaker's own. Blue eyes, scruffy beard and a long black and blonde mane appeared on the now completely merged beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard Alex moan loudly as his equine cock flared up and shot a stead stream of cum. The merging had pushed both of them to their climax and now they kneeled down, exhausted after process finished, over the sticky floor of the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you had just dropped it in the Lost items department you would still be human!\" You reply. \"Don't blame me for your greed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex bit his lower lip at your comment, clearly trying to shift the blame back on you.

You gasp in sheer submission as you feel your manhood taken from you. His cock is dominating yours, using your shaft to grow bigger in the process. You glance up at Alex and you see him smiling in satisfaction at you. He has made you his bitch and you can't do anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex thrusts his hips against you and you feel your testicles smush against his and fuse together.

He manhandles you, pulling you to his side and forcing your arms to mush and mesh together. Then your chest, your neck and finally he forces his head against yours and merges them together as you cry in extasy and finally climax, sinking inside Alex's mind in a state of permanent extasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stand much taller than before. Your body is at least 8' tall, completely covered in rippling muscles. Your short furred black and white hide stretches around your thick pecs.

Being merged with an fully matured male equine provides you with an extremely explosive libido. Speaking of which, your zebra cock is back to full length and leaking profusely. With every step you take the sizeable manhood sways left and right, making you moan when it's tip grazes the fur of your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you pick up a scent. The smell of a human. You follow the trail, getting progressively excited about the prospect of merging with yet another man. The smell guides you through the zoo and eventually out of it.

The two men have barely the time to turn around and understand what is happening before your powerful hands come down on them. You grab them both by the neck and force them forward against the wall. The sudden movement leaves them confused long enough for the magic of the necklace to come into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point you are no longer in control. If you were already in an almost frenzied state before the necklaced triggered the merging, now you are pretty much going berzerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roar and pant as you thrust your massive muscular hips forward, wedging your enormous horse-cock between the thick legs of the black man.

Your equine cock that had been throbbing between the black man's legs has become stuck to the dangling shaft of the young man and has easily managed to dominate it. You feel your massive endowement feed on the masculinity on the jock as they become one, growing longer and thicker while the black man finally sinks between your pecs. You feel him climax inside you as your body bulges, growing bigger in every direction. Your fur becomes a momentarily darker colour before the white jock is forced against you too, following the black man inside your chest. You feel his ass collide with your hips and immediately fuse together while your now conjoined cock surges up against his chest. <br>\r\nHe moans louder than ever feeling your legs claim his own before you reach forward and force him against your enlarged pecs, quickly absorbing him into yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men are now one with you, and your body is aching for release. A torrent of sensations surges through your brain. Not only you now possess an incredibly massive muscular body, almost reaching the cieling, but you are holding the minds of several men and animals inside you. They all moan and roar in sheer pleasure, locked in a state of orgasmic bliss. Their climaxes reverberate inside your mind, pushing you into a loud orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall to your knees, with a loud thud just as your enormous cock explodes into a fountain of cum. Your seed paints the walls, the floor and even yourself. It splatters down your mountaneous stripped furry abs and onto the floor where the shower drain can barely take in such generous discharge. <br>\r\nThe climax goes on for a few minutes, until you feel your head spin. You fall to the side, leaning your massive back against the tiled wall and you stare down at your body. <br>\r\nYou now look like a furry version of the Hulk. Your fur has retained it's grey-white colour but those two last guys have added several inches of muscle to you. Not only that, but the addition in cock size is also very visible. Your enormous equine cock rests between your thick pecs, still gushing the ocasional glob of cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the necklace. It is still glowing green.

Sitting next to you is a massive, muscular man with dog and zebra parts. There is one other man there, a young man of your age, very handsome and very naked but he doesn't seem the least bit self conscious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive, muscular man says, \"Well Scott, you really went wild. I have to stop by the zoo to drop off this zebra before the zoo officials panic and call a search. This is my son, Riley. He'll keep you company until I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen leaves. Riley stands up and approaches you. He is wearing the necklace. You start to fight back. Riley says, \"Relax, I won't turn your mind off. I want to talk.

I guess we needed to give you better instructions when we left you the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You left me the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley says, \"I'll level with you. I need to move and won't be able to merge with my dad for a while. We thought you might be persuaded to take my place. We won't force you but we thought if you had a chance to play with the necklace, you'd see how great it is. Now give it a try. You can play with my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow and enjoy merging with Riley. He isn't as massive but he feels sparkly like a soda. You think about whether different men have different \"tastes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your merged mind, you continue your conversation. \"So why do you merge with your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley says, \"We started when I was twelve. I was having trouble in basketball and dad coached me. One day he suggested he could coach me better from inside me. It was hard to explain the sudden growth spurt but dad knew how to leave some of himself inside me so I didn't shrink. I improved in basketball so we kept going with other sports. I excelled at every sport I tried but my favorite is wrestling. My dad got a younger body out of the deal so we both won. He stopped hooking up with twinks since he only pursued them for their younger bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you start having sex with your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley says, \"No, until I was old enough, my dad would unmerge with me before having sex with the bigger guys he prefers. But when I became old enough, he would let me ride along inside him or I'd let him ride inside me. It's our body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley starts stroking your cock. You put your hand down to stop him. He says, \"Go on then. It's your cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explore your cock. It's bigger. Riley says, \"Dad left his cock with us too. All three cocks are ours as long as we're merged.\" You wrap your hand around your cock. Then you tickle your piss slit. You feel Riley's mind reach through your arm to tickle your piss slit with you. Soon both of you are acting as one. You run your fingers through your bush and don't care whether that idea came from you or Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we split them so we have three separate cocks between our legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad knows how to do that but do you really want that? Isn't it better to just have one with all the combined pleasure of three?\"</span></div></div>",

You enjoy his taste in food because you feel his pleasure as well as your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond and bigger difference, you feel a constant mild sexual tingling as if Riley kept putting his thoughts into your privates. When you are out of public view, Riley randomly grabs your ass or does something stimulating. It's unexpected and therefore playful and extra stimulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Riley, \"Is that all you think about is sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley says, \"No, but I haven't had a younger body in months and right now, I have the hormones of three men.

I used to force mergers on people but I find it much more enjoyable if they are at least a little willing. There are many who enjoy being dominated and then there are those who become dead weight because they become depressed. Scott, you got lucky. All the guys you merged with would be willing to do it again. Sam and his dog would enjoy it from time to time but Sam doesn't want to live that way. Alex likes zebras but doesn't want to be merged to one. The couple really are a couple. They enjoyed being merged to each other but did not enjoy the crowd. I tried merging a gangbang crowd once.

He kept wanting to merge at inconvenient times and then he dominated me for three months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen says, \"I was miserable those three months too. Your dad was depressed and therefore so was I. I felt his depression no matter how hard I tried to block it out. Even worse, he wasn't playful. He just hung there like dead weight that I carried around with me. Riley is playful and I'm hoping you will be too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask, \"How did you expect me to learn about you when you didn't leave a note.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen answers, \"I just expected you to enjoy the necklace for a while. I wasn't planning on merging with you until next month. Then again, I wasn't planning on you going wild with a zebra merger either. You really are playful. I would have called you in a month if you hadn't shown up ahead of schedule.\" As Ben speaks, Riley shares his memories which confirms Ben's words. Riley doesn't have to leave for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen says, \"How about we go with this change of plans. I'll let you have Riley for a month. Riley, be good to Scott, convince him how enjoyable this is. Learn from my mistakes and don't be too aggressive. Then in a month, I hope you would choose to merge with me. Meanwhile, Daniel and I will be rekindling our relationship without merging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put two and two together and say, \"Wait, if I agree to this, in a month, I will be having sex with my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen says, \"Well you've already merged with him. Can you get anymore intimate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say, \"There's a difference between being intimate and having raw, animal sex. Besides, Dad, your giving your son to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel says, \"I'll merge with you sometimes too. If you're truly disgusted, you could let Ben push your mind down until you lose awareness. Besides, I'm not losing a son. You'll be here,\" he points at Ben, \"with me.\"</span></div></div>",

They are no longer bound by your will, but by a common desire: To fuck and grow, to be bigger, stronger, manlier! They want to experience the exquisite pleasure of the addition, the echoing sensations of the merging. Yes...and you can't resist the allure anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the necklace crackle between your pecs, but it no longer matters to you. You know what you want now, and so, you finally give in. No more Scott, no more Dad...You are a beast, a being keen on feeding on sexual pleasure and all the beings trapped inside you finally agree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burst out of the shower stall, tearing down the feeble walls with a single movement of your heavy arms. The wood breaks into tiny splinters, obliterated by your strength. You step out into the locker room, and then up the stairs to the reception. You don't bother to conceal yourself anymore. Why would you? You doubt there is anyone who could stop you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear an alarmed shout to your left. There is a young white man behind the reception desk staring wide eyed at your massive form. He is lean and athletic, rather than bulky like a heavy weight lifter. His short brown hair and angular jaw give him a rather handsome appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood. Another one to add to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face him and your massive cock spurts thick globs of precum on the floor. You see his brown eyes dart down your pecs and abs and onto your member where they remain, almost transfixed. <br>\r\nYou smile with your canine snout, showing a sharp row of teeth and take the chance to move. You reach down and grab him, easily pulling him into the air. The guy doesn't even try to free himself. He is either too scared or suprised to react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you smush him against your pecs. And the necklace crackles brighter and louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the man moan as your musk invades his nostrils and you help him cast away the tight set of sport clothes he was wearing until he is completely naked. Now, he is ready to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of excitement courses through your being as the other personalities inside you get ready to welcome a new addition. Then you feel it happen. As you maneuver the young man down to have him lean back on your abs, he instinctively thrusts his already hard dick against the skin of your enourmous erection. You hear him gasp as your cocks quickly become glued together and you feel your member grow, feeding on the size of the man's virility. The rest of him follows suit. You roar and throw your head back as the newest addition sinks inside your body, merged into your chest and cock in a matter of seconds. <br>\r\nYou feel yourself grow already, but the sensations, albeit strong, are not enough to make you cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
