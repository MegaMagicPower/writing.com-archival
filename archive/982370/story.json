You're the one who killed Count Dooku and saved all our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I have faith in Obi-Wan. He will do his job well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk in silence to the office of the Supreme Chancellor. Chancellor Palpatine greets you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Anakin, Max! Welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Anakin both bow. You sense a tremor in the Force and start to feel cold. The Dark Side? Here? That was impossible. You think nothing of it and go on with your assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin says that he must leave for a little while to check on security. He tells you to stay behind and guard the Chancellor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, young Raven, now that we're alone I would like to talk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses as he sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have ambitions, Max, as does Anakin. I believe you have the potential to be the greatest of all the Jedi. Have you ever heard of the tale of Darth Palaguis the Wise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? I'm not surprised. It's not a tale the Jedi would tell. It's a Sith legend. You see, Darth Palaguis was able to manipulate the Force and was able to create life. In a sense, he was able to stop those he cared about from dying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He taught everything he knew to his apprentice. Tehn one night, his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, don't you think? He was able to stop others from dying, but couldn't save himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it possible to learn this power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from a Jedi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in all that was said to you. You always wanted to become the greatest of the Jedi. You wanted to become more powerful than even Master Yoda. </span></div></div>",

Anakin is very agressive, striking relentlessly, seeking a way through Windu's defenses. For a while it looks like the Older man is going to be backed into a corner and defeated. However the Master is steadfast in his defence gradually absorbing Skywalker's attacks driving him backwards with long, powerful and well aimed swings. Anakin fights back, fury pouring from beneath his brows,taking several burns but refusing to yield. Eventually Master Windu bats the younger mans blade aside and holding Anakin down with a blanket of the force points his saber at Skywalkers throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily he speaks;<br>\r\n'You fight well and with much passion Anakin. But remember you must be at peace with yourself to fully know when to put in the finishing blow and when to save you energies.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin looks livid and for a moment you think he will strike his instructor. But then he runs from the open courtyard heading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There is too much anger in that young man. It thwarts him in becoming one with the force.' Mace Windu looks troubled 'Go after him Raven and watch over him. I'm not sure what path the force has planned, and my heart fears for him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run after Anakin but despite your shouts he just lengthen his strides out of the Temple. Then with a look of contempt he vaults a nearby building and dissappers. Gathering the force to you you leap onto the roof also and see him getting into a sky cab. Following at a discrete distance you see Anakin land on the roof of Senator Amadala's quarters. Unable to control your curiosity you follow and are shocked by what you see. In the doorway leading from the balcony to the senator's rooms ANakin and SEnator Amidala are locked in a lover's embrace. And the Jedi's hands are lovingly stroking her obviously pregnant belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis clear breach of the Jedi code must be reported. But your feel for Anakin nevertheless. Going straight to the Council would see him expelled from the order.</span></div></div>",

Obi-Wan is just about to land on the planet Utapau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am troubled by your news Max, and suprised I did not see this for myself, although it does not altogether suprise me.' the general says 'In my absence you must be a friend to Anakin. If possible seek out Yoda's advice. I see the dark hand of the Sith in Anakin's actions.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the transmitter shuts off you hear a knock on your door. You get a shock when you sense it's Anakin.Had he heard any of your conversation with Obi-Wan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on Max?'<br>\r\n'Not much, you reply. Just checking up on the latest Holonews.' You try and reply casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin looks at you suspicously then says<br>\r\n'Hey, Chancellor Palpatine has appointed me as his personal representative on the Jedi council. Isn't that great? But they haven't given me the title of Master yet, despite the fact few of them can match me with a lightsaber!' He boasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Be patient Anakin' you reply 'You are not a Master yet'<br>\r\nHe looks at you sharply at hat last remark then changes tack.<br>\r\n'Anyway buddy'he says sarcastically 'The supreme Chancellor has ordered us to look into possible treason against the senate, right here in the Temple. Apparently some of the younger Jedi have been holding anti-republican meetings in the temple vaults. Lets go.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a chill run down your spine. The Jedi have always been the guardians of the Old Republic. If Anakin saw you following him to Senator Amidala's quarters this could be a trap. On the other hand someone needs to keep an eye on Anakin, otherwise things could get nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You feel nervous as you head down into the dark catacombs with Anakin, your thumb never straying far from the activation button of your lightsaber. In truth you are more worried about Anakin than the Jedi rebels. Pretty soon you emerge into a large room lit half lit with burning torches. No one is here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Let\u2019s lie in wait.\u2019 Says Anakin. \u2018My information indicated the traitors will be along soon. You sit opposite Anakin in the shadows behind a large pillar and wait. Stretching out with the force you try and find Master Yoda. Nothing. You heard that Kashyyk was under threat from a separatist droid army. Master Yoda must have gone to help the Wookies you realize. Come to think of it most of the experienced Jedi are scattered over the Galaxy leading the clone armies. The Jedi Temple suddenly feels very vulnerable. Nevertheless you take comfort in the solid presence of Master Mace Windu several levels above you. You think about contacting him through the force but are interrupted by Anakin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Wake up dreamer\u2019 He says cruelly, \u2018Our quarries have arrived\u2019 4 teenage Padawans have entered the room. Before they\u2019ve even had a chance to speak Anakin steps out and lights his saber. \u2018In the name of the Senate surrender!\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh look its Palpatine\u2019s lap dog\u2019 the lead padawan, a young human man of about 16 or 17 laughs. You think his name is Jeneel. The other three padawans are younger still and look nervous. \u2018We\u2019ve done nothing wrong says one of the boys, we just don\u2019t agree that the Chancellor has so much power. He wants to be Emperor!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Condemned by their own lips don\u2019t you think Max\u2019 Anakin sounds triumphant. \u2018NOW DROP YOUR LIGHTSABERS\u2019 His voice is dripping with the force and the three accomplices step back cowed. Jeneel stands firm however and raises his green saber. \u2018We will NOT bow to tyranny!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can stop them Anakin and the padawan have crossed lightsabers. Jeneel is good, probably not more than a few years from passing his trials and becoming a Jedi knight. But he is no match for Anakin Skywalker. Anakin easily blocks a high slice and with astonishing violence overpowers the younger man, driving his opponents saber down to their side and with a long stroke takes off Jewel\u2019s right arm above the elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Anakin no!\u2019 You cry. Padawan Jeneel faints in a pool of his own blood. Despite their youth his three companions light their sabers and step forward to protect their fallen leader. Before the battle can be joined once more, you thumb your lightsaber\u2019s ignition button and holding its pale yellow blade before you step into the centre of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018They\u2019re traitors!\u2019 Anakin screams<br>\r\n\u2018But they\u2019re only boys!\u2019 You reply<br>\r\n\u2018Make your choice Max Raven\u2019 Anakin spits \u2018You are either with me or you\u2019re my enemy and the enemy of the Senate!\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And that was confirmed when I sensed you following me to Senator Amidala's rooms. You will not harm my wife!' He steps forward suddenly and attacks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is very quick and attacks without pause, rage blazing from his eyes, which have taken on a strange yellow tint. You relax and allow the force to guide your defense waiting for him to tire. It does not happen however and you fell panic creeping in. Anakin has pushed you back from the room you were originally in, deeper into the catacombs beneath the Jedi Temple. Is is taking all your energy to keep Anakin at bay, you are too preoccupied to send a call for help with the force. Your only hope is that one of the young Padawans will raise the alarm before one of you gets hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill on the defensive you find yourself backing onto a thin stone walkway above a dark crevasse. The only light is cast by the blue and yellow of your lightsabers.Behind you at the far end of the rocky bridge, the passageway is blocked with rubble from a past rock fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're trapped now my friend!'Anakin smiles. 'And after I've killed you I will take my place next to the Chancellor as the greatest Jedi.If any other Jedi get in the way I'll kill them too!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger surges through your veins and your defense turns into attack. You both stand in the centre of the bridge refusing to give an inch,your lightsabers striking and blocking faster than the eye can follow. Calming your mind you have an idea. Feinting high with your saber you sweep Anakin from his feet and raising your saber high striking down for the killing blow. He rolls aside and your lightsaber sweeps through the stone of the bridge at it's thinest point. With a groan the rock can no longer support it's own weight and it splits and starts to breaks up. You call on the force to backflip into the blocked passageway behind you. Looking back you see Anakin get to his feet and just manage to makethe open passageway opposite befoe the bridge dissapears,  dissintegrating into the blackness below. Anakin's blue lightsaber dissapears as he runs back up the passage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and use the force to contact Master Windu but the darkside is clouding the force and you can only sense Mace Windu is worried about a plot to kill the Jedi. You try and reinforce that thought in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Master Yoda might struggle to make the leap to the far side of the crevasse,you think- so you turn around and start cutting your way through the rock fall behind you. Using the force to lift boulders out of your way you find yourself walking uphill until eventually, several hours later you come out into a room you guess is below the main Senate assembly chambers. You reach out with the force to open the door and dusting yourself off make your way towards the entrance of the building. The force gives you seconds of warnign and you duck into an empty doorway as Anakin rushes past loking haggard and shocked. He has evidently come from the Chancellor's private chambers. Carefull not to be seen you follow him back to the Jedi temple and confront him just as he reaches Mace Windu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll deal with you later' Anakin looks you in the eye.<br>\r\n'Yes we have unfinished business' You reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin speaks directly to Mace Windu.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'I have something terrible to tell you, the Chancellor is the Sith Lord we have been looking for'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMace Windu thinks for a moment then says<br>\r\n'Yes he is the one who is plotting to destroy the Senate. We are on our way now to relieve the Chancellor of power, Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grevious.' The Master looks at you and Anakin in turn. Finally he speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anakin remain here. I know Palpatine is very powerful' He says cutting off Anakin's reply. 'But we will prevail. Remain here until I return.' Then the Master regards you.'If you feel ready, come with me, Raven.'</span></div></div>",

On the way in the troop transport you fill the Master in on Anakin\u2019s actions and behavior whilst under your observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Palpatine has used Anakin\u2019s fears for his wife to turn him against the Jedi. I ordered him to remain in the council chambers until we return. If he obeys me we should be able to guide him away from the dark path.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMace Windu has a dreadful singularity of purpose as he brushes aside aides and functionaries as you make your way towards the supreme chancellors private chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018In the name of the galactic senate we are placing you under arrest chancellor Palpatine.\u2019 Mace says as the three of you trigger your lightsabers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Are you threatening me Master Windu?\u2019 Taunts Palpatine as he suddenly ignites his hidden blood red lightsaber. He lets out a terrible cry and launches himself at you and your comrades. How did we miss a Sith of such power? You think as the other Jedi brought with you is stabbed through the heart by the Sith\u2019s blade. You and Master Windu attempt to fall back to the corridor leading from the Chancellor\u2019s study to his larger audience chamber. For a minute you face the Sith Lord alone one on one down the corridor. He is relentless, his rage could fill oceans. His mastery of the darker passions is beyond understanding. Fighting the urge to turn tail and flee you block stroke after terrible stroke. Finally as you back into the main reception one pieces your side and you fall gasping to the floor. As the Sith Lord stabs viscously downwards the purple blade of Mace Windu deflects it, saving you. Holding your bloodied side with your left hand you use the force to throw a cushioned seat at the Sith. He slices the bulky chair in two but before he can attack again you have regained your feet and have retreated out of range. Mace Windu steps between you and the chancellor and the Sith Lord attacks him with the unbelievable focused aggression of one knowledgeable in the dark side. Mace Windu falls back initially but then he gradually masters the Sith Lords attacks, countering the increasingly desperate strikes of his opponent with long powerful but controlled strokes, like those you saw him use against Anakin in the Sparring ring.  One of those long strokes shatters the long transparent window letting in the raging wind of Coruscant\u2019s atmosphere.
