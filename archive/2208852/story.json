We are a rare lot so we tend to keep to ourselves in this over sensitive and defensive society we live in. I discovered my powers when I was around ten years old which was when my parents began their heated divorce. All of their fights were over having another child they really could not afford. Mom wanted a daughter and dad wanted a son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tore me apart to see them fight like that so, one day, my meta-human power activated and I became Hannah, the daughter mom always wanted. Since she wanted a child, I also became four years younger which was when the trouble started. It did not take long for mom and dad to figure out my ability and they used it to their full advantage. I would be Hannah during the summer break and Hanson during school to avoid double booking me as two people. At first, it seemed to be manageable but dad wanted more time with me as I got older and it eventually lead to their divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now live with mom as Hannah during the night and Hanson during the day. Again, it seemed like a good arrangement until I just could not hide it any longer to my childhood friend, Julia Summers. She was a friend to both Hanson and Hannah but she never saw them both together and I was running out of excuses for both. Finally, she saw me change during a surprise visit. We just stood there, staring at each other with mom holding up a little girl's panties and dress for me to try on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"It's just something I can do.

Hanson and Hannah are blameless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Julia handed Mom my Hanson underwear. \"You'll need that,\" she said.

Would I be stuck in one gender and age if I stayed like that for too long? Would I be forever stuck if I tried making love and got pregnant? Fortunately, mom cut in before I could find the words to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me on this, Hannah, you will want to wait a little while longer before experimenting with your meta-human abilities.\" Serious, she said. \"Pushing your boundaries can and will lead to injury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know, Mrs Hannah?\" Curious, Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, almost sadly. \"Please, it's Ms Hanson.\" Calmly, she corrected. \"I have completely severed ties with my husband and his name, minus my son... when he is around.\" She sighed, \"To answer your question, how do you think Hannah became a meta-human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia gasped. \"You're a meta-human too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I am though I prefer to keep my powers a secret for now.\" Serious, she said. \"Also, I will thank you to keep mine and my child's powers a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't tell anyone, I promise.\" Serious, Julia said. \"But... have you tried to make yourself older or live the life of a girl beyond home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Mom has been rather protective of me when it came to being Hannah.\" Blushing, I replied. \"Something about being too cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, rolling her eyes. \"As Hannah, she gives off an aura that attracts boys.\" Calmly, she explained. \"I have been helping her control that. You see, this attraction can potentially give her the power to persuade boys into doing her bidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which draws attention to the fact she is a meta-human.\" Sighing, Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can she do as Hanson?\" Curious, Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Well, you saw for yourself that as Hanson, he can swoon the ladies if he tries but he seems to only have eyes for one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia blushed at that then turned to me, a mischievous twinkle slowly forming in her eye. Seeing it, I took a step back, worried. \"I know that look, Julia.\" Wincing, I said. \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just taking my BFF shopping for a fashion up date.\" Grinning, she said. She turned to mom. \"Would it be okay if I promise to keep the boys at bay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"I have been a bit over protective as of late.\" Smiling, she said. \"I'll allow it so long as you don't embarrass her too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, I was still eleven year old Hannah and because mom's agreeing to me going shopping for girl's clothes worried me so, I found I could not change back to fifteen or to my male self. Before I knew it, i was being dragged out of the house to mom's car where she drove us both to the mall...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had never really been alone with Julia before as eleven year old Hannah so I had no idea what to expect. \"Um... where do we start?\" Nervous, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia smiled. \"We start by meeting our friends.\" simply, she said. \"i was going shopping with them today and you are an extra bonus.\" She then whispered, \"Hanson...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're having fun with this, aren't you?\" Blushing, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia giggled. \"It's not often a girl gets to show a boy her world.\" Bemused, she replied. \"Honestly, how much did your mom teach you about being feminine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed deeper. \"She sort of let me explore that on my own...\" Timidly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia nodded. \"I thought so...\" She then giggled again. \"Here comes my friends. Don't be too shy now... Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was blushing brightly at this point as our friends came into view, all wearing jeans, shirts and sneakers. The first to approach was a girl Julia's height with shoulder length brown hair and brown eyes. I recognized her as Tami Forest. \"Hey, Hannah.\" Seeing me, she said. \"Your mom finally let you out on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing, I could only manage to nod with a shy, \"Uh-huh...\" Tami was the head cheerleader of her class and very athletic. The last thing I wanted was to have her think I was in any way interested in cheerleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took a little convincing.\" Smiling, Julia said. \"As I told you, she's very shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing for you to worry about, kiddo.\" Serious, a well built boy said. \"We'll keep the wolves at bay for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was Tim Walker, the captain of the tenth grade football team. He had sand blond hair and wild green eyes. Again, I could only nod. \"Th-Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lighten up, half-pint.\" Grinning, a redheaded girl said. \"No one is going to pester you with us tagging along, you are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to look into the hazel eyes of the girl I knew as Chris Jones. She was the head of the school newspaper and always looking for a good story. \"It- It's not being out that has me nervous...\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia laughed. \"Her mom had always picked out her clothing for her but fashion is not her forte.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others laughed as I blushed even more, if that was possible. \"Julia is helping me find what is in... I think that's a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the others laughed. \"Don't worry, Hannah, we'll have you turning heads by the time we are done with you.\" Smiling a brown haired, blue eyed girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it will help you relax, Dana and I will take turns modeling the outfits for you.\" Grinning a brown haired, blue eyed boy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were David and Dana, the Woods twins, both co-leaders of the drama club. \"David had been known to play a female role when needed as he had the same doll like features as his sister and played the parts so well it was almost scary. Still, I was forced to give a small grin as I could picture David modeling a dress just for the laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we start with the basics.\" Smiling, Tami said. \"Undergarments, training bras, socks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I've never been measured for a...\" Blushing, I started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTami looked at me surprised. \"You were never measured?!\" She shook her head. \"Then that is the first thing we need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd start with shoes.\" Serious, Chris said. \"Those loafers so don't go with that spring dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, guys...\" Motioning to me, Tim said. \"The kid is nervous as it is.\" He then rubbed his stomach. \"There is nothing like a good meal before shopping to take off the stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always think of food first, Tim.\" amused, Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to you, waiting for you to make a suggestion...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was an average girl in her late teens, attractive but nothing special in my eyes. \"Every girl feels nervous about getting their first bra.\" Kindly, she said. \"If it makes you feel better, your friend can measure you and I'll show her what you can choose from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, I nodded and Julia ushered me into a change booth. \"There is nothing for you to worry about, Hannah.\" Soothingly, Julia said. \"As I said, its all a part of being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing brightly, I allowed her to remove my blouse and she measured my chest. Upon getting the measurement, she read it off to the sale lady. Within minutes, I was wearing a pink training bra which Julia paid for along with a few other pairs.

Just trust me when we say you need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, I followed the group into the store to find another young sales lady who greeted us with a kind smile. With her was a teenage girl, you assumed was her daughter. Both were rather tall with long auburn hair and green eyes. \"Good morning.\" Calmly, the woman said. \"I'm Rina Hans and this is my daughter, Frey. I'm teaching her the business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you both.\" Smiling back, Dana said. \"We're out giving Hannah a fresh new look and shoes are next on our list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrey smiled, seeing me. \"Welcome to our store, Hannah.\" Kindly, she said. \"You look great!\" She giggled seeing me blush. \"I can't wait to show you the latest fashions in footwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are shoes really that important?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia, Tami and Dana giggled. \"Her mother has kept her rather sheltered.\" Bemused, Julia explained. \"This is really her first taste of real freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina giggled. \"Well, shoe fashions really do not change that much from year to year for boys.\" Patiently, she said. \"For girls, especially teenagers, they are often judged by the shoes they wear and how they compliment their chosen outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before, you stand out like a sore thumb wearing those loafers with that spring dress.\" Serious, Dana said. \"That is why shoes are so important to us girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"It sounds a bit high maintenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled. \"Girlfriend, we are going to show you a whole new world.\" Bemused, Julia said. \"Don't worry though, we'll help you ease into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, my education on shoes began including how to walk in heels. Just as I thought I was getting the hang of them, Tami placed a book onto my head. \"Walk without knocking the book down.\" Serious, she said. \"Proper posture is a must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was again struggling to keep my balance while holding a book on your head and each time the book fell, one of the girls would give me a painful whack on the rear. \"Ow!\" Irritated, after the fourth whack, I yelled. \"Must you!? I'm telling mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all had to go through this, Hannah.\" Firmly, Julia said. \"Ask your mom, she had her turn when she was your age and now its your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to last forever though it was only really about a half hour before I was finally able to balance four books on my head back and forth across the store. The girls applauded me with the boys soon following. The books were taken off my head and I was given a pair of black mary janes to wear. \"I'm done with this.\" Grumpily, I whined. \"I want to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia sighed. \"I know this is wearing on your patience, Hannah.\" Gently, she said. \"It's time for all of us to take a break. I'm sure Tim is starving by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at Julia. The embarrassment of having to be a girl all day in public around my friends was bad enough. On top of that, I felt as if Julia was having too much fun at my expense. Now, both my bottom and feet were sore from learning how to walk in high heels with proper posture as they called it. \"I don't know how much more I can take in one day, Julia.\" Annoyed, I whispered. \"Just wait until Hanson comes back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are having a rough day, Hannah.\" Gently, Julia said. \"I'll tell you what... If you agree to keep shopping for a little while longer, I will help you pick something special out for Hanson and maybe get you something special too. A little something extra, just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of getting not one but two special things from Julia intrigued me but I was a little worried about that mischievous twinkle in her eye. She was waiting for something. Fortunately, she nor I had much time to wait as Tim blurted out, \"Why is she so huffed up about walking in heels, it can't be that hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slapped his hand against his face before shaking his head. \"Well, I did promise I would help model...\" Moaning, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana laughed. \"Only you already had your high heel training.\" Bemused, she said. \"Let's see how easy it is for Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help laugh before giving Julia a silent nod. \"Just remember that mom will be picking us up in about an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hannah.\" Smiling, Julia said. She then whispered. \"As for the time, I got that covered...\" she then pulled out her cellphone on speaker as Tim was being sized for his first high heels. \"Hello, Ms Hanson, you are on speaker... Hannah and I bumped into a few friends here at the mall. Do you mind if we all hang out for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me when you are done and remember to keep Hannah safe.\" Sternly, mom replied. \"You know how protective I am of her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that as Chris and Tami giggled. \"We'll keep her safe, Ms Hanson.\" Smiling, Julia said. \"We'll have her home before dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she ended the call and smiled at me. \"Relax and enjoy the show...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSighing, I turned and watched as Tim and David received the same treatment I got walking back and forth in high heels. David was doing well but Tim struggled. The girls laughed at him with each smack across the rear her got. Although I was soon giggling with them, I still wished for nothing more than for the day to end.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When I asked mom about it, she could only sigh. \"You are entering puberty, Hannah.\" Patiently, she explained. \"You will have trouble controlling your ability until it passes.\" Pausing, she asked, \"Remember when you went through puberty as as a boy, you were switching gender and age almost at random until it passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered why Hannah kept vanishing on us for a while there.\" Smiling, Julia said. \"I guess it's Hanson's turn pop in and out for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"I am a meta-human too.\" Smiling, she said. \"I have the ability to change reality to some degree. That's why no one saw anything strange about Hannah vanishing and Hanson appearing when he was going through puberty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you use it on me earlier?\" Curious, Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only works on those outside of our inner circle.\" Serious, mom replied. \"You of course remember Hanson's shy streak between his twelve to fifteenth birthday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia sighed. \"Are you telling me he's going to play shy again for up to five years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"It's that or she risks all of her closest friends learning her secret.\" Serious, she replied. \"She's still a shy little girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia could only shake her head before turning to me. \"I'll help you as much as I can.\" Calmly, she said. \"Only I don't see how you are going to keep this a secret for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was not happy about being sent back to seventh grade, stuck as Hannah Hanson for two to three years. Still mom told me that she can manipulate reality. She promised to make everyone remember me as Hanson Hannah once he came back. For now, everyone saw me as Hannah Hanson, the irresistibly cute eleven year old girl. Julia seemed to enjoy delivering me my school uniform which consisted of a dark blue pleated skirt, light blue blouse and dark blue blazer with a bow tie. \"I'll keep an eye on you as best I can... Hannah.\" Smiling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Now.\" Calmly, mom said. \"You knew that this might happen. Just be yourself and Hanson will return before you know it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was visibly nervous walking into my new class. The training bra and ointment helped the itching of my budding bust, as mom put it, but knowing they were growing on me made me feel more than a little awkward. At least I had the same homeroom teacher as last time I was eleven, Miss Mia Swan who was very kind and understanding. Miss Mia, as she liked to be called was tall and slender with long brown hair and brown eyes, wearing an adult version of the school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, we have a new student to our school.\" Kindly, she said. \"Miss Hannah Hanson, would you care to introduce yourself to the class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I stood up from my desk and walked to the front of the class before facing the students with a memorized introduction my mom had put together. \"My name is Hannah Hanson.\" Softly, I said. \"I just moved here with my mom lest week. I'm hoping to make a lot of friends here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students courtly applauded as I returned to my seat. It was basically the same routine for all of my classes only I was getting bored fast. I had already gone over the lessons and had aced them all the first time around. I went through all of my homework for the day before lunch which, unknown to me, was already catching the attention of the teachers. I did notice the boys were eyeing me with dreamy smiles, creeping me out in more ways than one. Julia gave me a bemused look as she met me for lunch in the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun, Hannah?\" Teasing, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Sighing, I replied. \"I'm bored out of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia giggled. \"Keep playing the brain child and you might get advanced into my grade before the year is out.\" Smiling, she said. \"Think you can handle the big boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes at that. \"I'm having enough trouble with the boys here.\" Softly, I said. \"At least none of them are flirting with me yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia smiled, shaking her head. \"They're likely building their courage, looking for their opening.\" Bemused, she said. \"Much like Hanson did with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that then sighed seeing a small group of boys approaching...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He jumped and blurted out, \"I was hoping you would like to go out and get a soda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that as Julia nudged me, making me feel awkward. \"I- I guess that would be okay... just a soda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia laughed and made room before patting the seat. \"Sit down, Tommy.\" Teasing, she said. \"Get to know us better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy blushed even more, hesitating while I threw her a surprised look. Rick gave Tommy a nudge and he slowly sat down between Julia and I. Rick and Glen then left him, making us both blush even more. Looking at Julia, I could tell she was really enjoying this but Tommy spoke before I could utter anything to her in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you move from?\" Trying to spark a conversation, he asked. \"My family is from Miami, Florida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Los Angeles, California.\" Softly, I replied. \"It's just as hot there, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the other side of the country...\" Surprised, Tommy said. \"What brought you to North Carolina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Divorce...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy winced. \"Ouch...\" He then surprised me by taking my hand. \"If you need anyone to talk to, I'll be here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed brightly, wanting to pull my hand away but I didn't as it might crush the boy's feelings. Instead I gave him a shy smile. \"Th-Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy then sloppily kissed my hand, imitating a gentleman of old. \"Until school ends, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had left, Julia laughed. \"I think Hannah just got her first crush.\" Bemused, she said. \"That didn't take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a lot of help...\" Annoyed, I spat. \"I thought you were my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hanson's girlfriend.\" Grinning, Julia countered. \"I'm looking forward to him coming back so I can show him that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"First day of school as a girl and I already have a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hardly a date.\" Smiling, Julia said. \"It's just a soda meet, something to break the ice in a new friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right.\" Worried, I said. \"I just hope I don't have a short switch back to Hanson during school hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
