They scurry around like little mice going after the cheese as you quickly are surrounded by them. You have little time to observe them, however, as your attention is quickly turns to the ship on harbor. Gargantuan compared to the ships around her, putting them all to shame. You look her over as she seems to go on forever, never before have you seen a ship of such massive proportion. You wonder how it is possible for her to get around without bumping into things. I mean surely man was never intended to make such a monstrosity? Her massive funnels stand proudly on deck as they bellow a black cloud of smoke from the mighty boilers within her belly. Her black coat shimmers against the morning sunlight, glimmering elegantly before you. Not a scratch on her, the paint seems to be very evenly spread as if every inch was inspected with great care. You look towards the bow, ah there it is. The name of this fine vessel, evenly spread and perfectly aligned in big letters:<b> R.M.S. California Iron</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your pocket one more time before the carriage takes off to make sure you still have your ticket. You feel the smooth texture of it as you slip it out of your pocket. You look over the ticket. It is the size of a dollar bill, with a nice golden, silky look to it. In the middle it features a grand ship surrounded by a wreath. The words Red Town are on each side of the face with <b>ADMIT ONE</b> in small print at the bottom.You decide to make your way to boarding. You weave your way through the crowd, bumping into a few shoulders and stepping onto a few toes as you tip your hat and apologize the whole way through. You finally break free of the crowd and approach the ticket-checker adjacent to the gangplank that leads up to the mighty ship. His uniform is a nice, navy blue. The buttons shine brightly, made of brass. His cap bears the Red Town logo proudly; a bright red ship steaming along a wavy blue ocean with a gold wreath going around. Ah yes, Red Town Ship Lines. How lucky you were to get a ticket aboard a ship from the finest cruise agency and ship builders around. For over a hundred years Red Town has been a company of legend. No  competitor came close. He makes eye contact with you through round spectacles as you hold out your ticket. He reaches out with a white, silky glove and grabs it. <br>\r\n\"hmm.... yes...\" He says, adjusting his glasses and stroking his white mustache. \"Can I see your I.D.?\"<br>\r\nYou take out your passport out of you pocket and present it to him.<br>\r\n\"Ah yes,\" he says, looking over the passport, \"you must be...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

California Iron it read. \"<br>\r\n- From the <i>Sinking of the California Iron</i> by Nicholas De Kruif<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive story is based off a concept that I had created when I was in 7th grade from a drawing that evolved into a poem and a short novel. The novel was lost and so now I bring to you the story of the California Iron in interactive form so that I may tell the story once more from multiple perspectives. Any additions you wish to add to the story yourself are highly welcomed but will be subject to review as there are a few rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep it PG-13, no sexual content or over grotesque violence or gore<br>\r\n2. The events onboard take place July 27th-July 30th 1927, keep it within that time frame (flashbacks are allowed) <br>\r\n3. Keep things realistic<br>\r\n4. No kinks or fetishes <br>\r\n5. No, you can't \"save the ship\" it has to go down<br>\r\n6. Yes, people have to die. This is a drama, not a fairy tail with a happy ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand over your ticket and climb aboard! The year was 1924 and the esteemed Red Town Ship Lines has just unveiled their newest cruise ship, the R.M.S. California Iron, the pride of the Red Town fleet. She was the first and only ship of Red Town's new line of luxury ships, designed not for speed, but for the enjoyment of the ride! She has made several trips of her three years of service across the pacific with a clean record. But that is about to change as you, a passenger, aboard this luxurious beauty are about to experience. Take on the roles of several passengers as their experience the horror of the doomed ship. </td>",
