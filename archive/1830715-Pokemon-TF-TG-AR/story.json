The sun was shining, Pidgeys where singing in the sky and Ash Ketchum aspiring pokemon-master and his constant companion Pikachu where... hopelessly lost. <br>\r\nIn an effort to catch-up to their other companions, that had traveled ahead, the two had left the normal route to take a shortcut right through the forrest. It had been going great and at the pace they traveled, they might even reach the next city first. The two where in high spirits, until a cry from above shook them. <br>\r\nThey had walked straight into a Spearow nesting-ground. Five minutes later, after a lot of running, pecking and getting sand in their eyes, the two found themself in their current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Spearows just attacking us! Stupid forrest that just won't end! And stupid friends just laving us behind, because I needed more than one try to earn a badge!\", Ash cried out in frustration, kicking a tree-stump to vent his frustration.<br>\r\n\"Pika Pi.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Pikachu, I know it's our own fault\", he replied, \"It just that... hey what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotten remains of the tree he kicked had broken apart revealing a strange stone. It was an opaque, oval jewel with, roughly the same size as a pokeball, but the strangest thing about it was the fac,t that there seemed to be a faint light emanating from deep inside it. It looked alluring, almost as if it wanted to be touched, to be held. Ash slowly extended his arm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika!\"<br>\r\n\"What? I just thought it looked cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Pii...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it valuable. Uhhh! Maybe it can be used to attract a rare pokemon!\"<br>\r\n\"Pikachu!\"<br>\r\n\"You don't have to touch it then. God sometimes you act just like mom.\", with that Ash shrugged, bend down and picked up the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a tingle, as if his palm at fallen asleep. Then the stone started vibrating, the light shining from it intensified. He had seen something similar before.It looked almost like a miniature Voltorb about to self destruct! Ash instantly dropped the stone and threw himself over Pikachu in an effort to shield the electric-type.<br>\r\nThere was no sound, even the ever-present noises of forrest seemed to vanish, as a wave of pure white light washed over the trainer and his pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow fast does the transformation occure?</span></div></div>",

He feel like he needed them, as his plan was just to out for hour or two. Surprisingly he noticed there wheren't any Pokemon around, he was disappointed. He wanted to see some and maybe make another friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh continued walking around for another few minutes. Then he spotted something strange, it was a Drowzee, but this was different. Instead of the normal brown and yellow, this one was Pink and purple. Cool, he thought as he slowly approached this unique Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hello there.\" Said Ash, in a friendly tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowzee turned and looked at this human boy, he looked him over and smiled at Ash. He thought this means they could be friends. What Ash didn't know was this Drowzee was unique in more then just color. Normal Drowzee feeds on dreams, but this one feeds on the masculinity of male trainers. Slowly turning them into girly girls, he took one look at Ash and decided that this trainer would be his next meal/victim. Drowzee loves very masculine males, they taste better and he enjoyed when they realize what was happening to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one look at Ash and he knew this was going to be funny and delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowzee went up to Ash and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Hypnotize him, giving him dreams about being a submissive girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2:  Hugged him, taking a small part of Ash's masculinity.</span></div></div>",

She was waiting for a Human with a strong and malleable aura that she could turn into her daughter. She had been waiting for 5 days now and not a single human that had passed had a strong enough Aura. As the sun was about to go down the Human she was looking for passed by. It has a Human boy with black spiky hair and a Pikachu sitting on his shoulder.<br>\r\nAt first Laura was disgusted that the Human she was looking for turned out to be male, but that lasted only for a bit since his aura was incredibly malleable, She could make him whatever she wanted.
