For the subjects of this scenario, though, puberty is going to occur much, much earlier - any age under about thirteen or so. Newly-born dragons find themselves looking way, way down at their parents, and being far stronger than they could ever hope to be; baby horses find that their 'equipment' is so large that even the biggest, cockiest stallion could never hope to match them. Small anthro children begin to tower over entire buildings as their cocks or tits block off all sight of anything in-front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan anything stop - or even slow - their rampant, berserk growth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Affection:</b> A lot of animals and anthros are affectionate. Some more-so than others. Some over-affectionate. And then there are those so, <b>so</b> affectionate, that giving or receiving even the slightest hint of affection forces their bodies to grow, and grow, and grow. And the bigger you are, the easier it is you show your affection to someone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You fall fast asleep almost as soon as your head plops onto the pillow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to the sun sneaking through the window blinds and stretch in your bed groggily.  You laugh quietly as you remember the most ridiculous dream you've ever had.  In your dream, you were surrounded by growing and already giant animals that would appear through the thick fog around you.  You weren't scared of them all in the slightest; you were more astonished and a little excited.  It was just too bad you woke up when you did; the dream was really starting to get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for fun, you roll over, grab the old teddy bear next to your bed, and hold it up in front of you.  You concentrate on the bear's small size; you've always wanted a bigger teddy bear.  It suddenly swelled to the size you were wishing it to be, about twice a large.  Astonished, you set it down and concentrated on it further.  It soon doubled in size once more, filling a large space on your floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've realized that you had the power to grow anything animal related due to your dream!

You walk to the back door and call your golden retriever's name.  He sprints out from the right, his tail wagging fast and his tongue hanging out.  He was about to come inside through the open screen door when you closed it, preparing to put your thoughts into effect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the door close, your dog jumped up on your legs and tried to lick you while you laughed.  He always was a friendly dog and you wanted to see him happy no matter what.  Sure, he had a yard to play in with a few toys; however, the yard was rather small and he needed new toys badly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will finally be able to give him his wish, as well as yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your dog as he looks back up at you happily, wagging his tail madly.  You concentrate on growing your dog with all your might, thinking of him growing a couple of feet.  Your golden retriever seems unaware of the changes to his body, but he soon realizes something's different when he becomes eye level with you.  Your now 6 foot tall dog licks you excitedly, covering your entire face in slobber; his tongue must have been as wide as your entire head! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour very pleased that he is happy with his new size and is going along so well with it.  In fact, it seems he has already found a new toy; he had already ran to the back of the yard and pulled a small bush out of the ground easily with his teeth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You leaned against the door frame, watching as your dog eagerly devoured the bush as his tail wagged furiously, shredding the leaves and shattering the branches into tiny fragments, which he happily swallowed. You were briefly concerned for him as he did so, but he seemed to suffer no discomfort or pain, despite swallowing what had to be rather sharp shards of wood. Either they weren't as sharp as you'd thought, or his greater size also granted him greater resilience, to the stage where they were completely unable to harm him, leaving his throat completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head as you tried to come to terms with just how unbelievable this whole situation was, yet it was happening right in front of you, before your very eyes! You could still hardly believe that your dog was so huge now, all because you had wanted him to be bigger! It was impossible, yet it was real. And all of this had been because of a dream, you'd developed this... supernatural power to make anything animal related grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced and shook your head again. You were a college student majoring in Biology, yet you had just seriously considered a supernatural power. But, what else could it be? Dogs couldn't just grow like that, not to that size, that quickly. Then there was that teddy bear, it wasn't even a living thing, yet it had grown to twice its size right in front of your eyes! You just couldn't understand it, you'd have to try and find some way to figure out what had happened because as much as the thought unnerved you, a supernatural explanation was all you could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention was drawn back to your dog as he barked cheerily, you looked up to see that the bush had been obliterated by his now much larger, and possibly sharper, teeth. He looked so happy, despite the fact that the yard was now considerably more cramped. Maybe being so much bigger gave him a new perspective on things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled your gaze away from him to look around the house. A sense of unease rose up inside you as you realised that the house was now so much smaller compared to him, it'd be difficult to move around now. You'd need to be very careful that he didn't end up breaking anything with his sheer bulk, given that he was so huge now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking back at him... You couldn't help but feel a bit of... excitement? The idea of your dog being so big that you'd need to make sure his sheer size didn't damage your home was oddly thrilling. And, since it made him so happy, well, maybe making your beloved canine companion a bit bigger still, wouldn't be so bad, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself off the doorframe with a sigh, focusing on your dog. It hadn't even been ten minutes since you'd gotten up, and you were already growing him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sitting there, still looking at you intently, his tail wagging furiously behind him. As you focused on him, you could see that he was growing again. It was slow at first, but it quickly picked up speed, his already massive frame stretching out in every direction! His ears rose higher as his tail and backside crept closer and closer to the fence. His huge paws swelled outwards, to the point where they had to easily outsize dinner plates, as his chest bulged outwards. As you watched his body grow, you took in a sharp gasp of breath. On his growing chest, you could clearly see the faint outline of muscles developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his height crept up past a staggering seven feet tall, the rest of his frame filled out in an equally impressive manner. His limbs thickened and bulged with cords of powerful muscle beneath the thick fur. His huge tongue lolled out of his mouth as he panted and huffed in bliss. He was taller than the average man by a substantial margin and far more powerfully built, and he was only getting bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golden Retriever continued to grow bigger and bigger, taller and stronger with every passing moment! It was incredible! He pushed outwards, surpassing a whopping eight feet tall. You could only stare in awe at how enormous he was, and how absolutely delighted he seemed! You were the one responsible for this, but you almost felt as though you couldn't stop yourself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, shaking your head as you took in a few, steadying breaths. You had to stop this. Your dog being big was incredible, but not when it was going to cause property damage. You swallowed thickly as you focused on your dog's growth coming to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few nerve-wracking seconds, you opened your eyes. The sight that greeted you drew a startled gasp from your lips as you stumbled back, gripping the doorframe for support. Your dog was enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over you at a staggering nine feet tall, his entire frame practically rippling with thick, powerful muscles, he looked down at you with an overjoyed expression as his tail wagged so fast it became a blur. He stepped forward, lowering his huge head to nose down on your comparatively tiny form. His nose had to be the size of your head! You gently raise a hand and place it atop his muzzle, gently stroking it for a moment before you step back to allow his massive frame to squeeze through the door. You hold your breath as the doorframe groans slightly under the force, but to your relief, nothing breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in amazement as your dog rises to his full height, his head lowered so that he can stand in the room, with his back pressed against the ceiling. You stumble over to the sofa and crash onto it, trying to think of what you're going to do now. Your dog is already nearly too big for the house, but he looks so happy, and he hasn't damaged anything yet and he seems to be taking care. However, he's still a giant of a dog, and you have no idea how you're going to adapt to this now. Not to mention, you have no idea how this works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run your hand over your face as you weigh your options. Perhaps you can take your teddy and your dog and call up your college? Maybe the University can start looking into this. Perhaps it's some ability your brain has gained somehow? Maybe a CT scan will find something odd. Or, perhaps it really is supernatural, and there's no explanation you would ever find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should head out and trust your dog to just keep himself calm, try and gather your thoughts, and hopefully, avoid making any other dogs or other animals grow. That said, trusting a massive, muscular, nine foot giant of a dog to not break anything is a risky decision, but so is taking him out on the street. for everyone else to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing is for sure: With such power, you had better make your choice wisely.</span></div></div>",

Some of them decide to go into the pool, not wanting to be seen, while some others just idly stands there. Not overly sure to pick which to mess up with, you sigh, and leans onto the barrier, when you hear one of them. Its mouth is wide open, and it faces you up, before it cautiously takes a few steps back, near the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast is roughly 9 ft long, and its dentition looked fine. You wonder if it was born in captivity, and isn't the biggest around, but it seems to be the most active around. You decide to concentrate onto it, trying to have a mental image of it, grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it starts to lengthen out, it takes a step forward, either asking to not being messed with, or out of its growing confidence. You couldn't tell. But even then the grow was going smootly, something unexpected occurs. One of the other crocodiles, the biggest one, wanted to pass, or to get the growing's one place. The latter walks backward, then both growls at each others. You inadvertly lose the control of your power and grow both! While the one you had focused onto grow faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the size difference became clear, the smaller grown crocodile growls again, seemingly annoyed and go into the pool, while the bigger one looks at you and.. Rush toward you! Out of shock and fear, you fall onto your back, before taking a few steps back, before you relax. The crocodile, now 30 ft long, couldn't,  regardless, get over the barrier. Or so you thought, when it started to.. Lift its body up..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up once more, and starting to regret your actions, given you thought you'd end up in the.. Changing crocodile..? Its legs and arms lengthened right before you eyes, noisily reshaping themselves into more humanoid shapes, its hands becoming strangely similar to human hands, if you exclude the claws.. The feet, on the other hand, remain more or less what they were, aside that they get lifted up in a such a manner that it forced it to stand on a digitigrade stance. Its neck lengthen slightly, becoming visible, before its head goes down, much like it would be for a human. As Seemingly, she was now 35 ft tall, with her tail being a good 20 ft long. And yet, the weirdest had yet to occur..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human-crocodile hybrid leans closer to you, disregarding completely the fact that you tried to flee, when you notice two bumps pushing on its.. Her..? Chest. Blushing madly, and shocked to the point of immobilizing yourself, you notice nipples making their way onto the crocodile's breasts, becoming voluptuous E-cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel lifted up, and.. Get gently kissed..? Then the anthropomorphic's mouth open up. Out of reflex, you whimper, 'Don't eat me! I-i'm not edible..!'. The crocodile giggles, before she gently kisses you. And says, 'Thank you.~'. Completely confused, you whisper, 'A-a t-talking crocodile!?', before you faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you let a 'hnnnng..'. Your bed felt..  Awfully warm. And comfy. And.. Scaly..!? You try to get off the makeshift bed, when you notice the bed is.. The anthropomorphic crocodile's cleavage. And you notice that she was nude, even around the groin. Blushing again, you turn yourself to face the crocodile's visage. She was smiling. And she says, 'How's my mate doing?~'. You stutter, 'M-mate..!?'. 'Something's wrong?'. 'Y-ye.. Err.. N-.. I-i mean.. Y-you're a huge breasted crocodile..! A-and.. You are actually cute.. I admit..'. She giggles, then she hugs you. You meep, shocked at first, but eventually relax, when you hear other crocodiles. For some reasons, you were <i>*in*</i> the enclosure. Thankfully, your new, albeit very tall, girlfriend growls, making them scurry off, aside from the biggest of the ferals, looking more annoyed than scared. Then she says,  'Don't worry, my little crocodile.. I'll protect you.~'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to persuade to make the crocogirl to step off the enclosure, so you'd speak more freely. As it turns out, she wasn't having a bad life, but the male she made leave was bothering her when she was smaller, and could only be grateful at the cutey that helped her. And while she didn't had a name per say, she had been named Brenda by the humans' working in the zoo. <br>\r\nYou say your name to the croco girl, then decide to..</span></div></div>",

You begin to walk through the pasture, taking note of all the horses until you spot one in particular that you makes you stop in your tracks and head over to it. It's a beautiful mare with a deep chestnut coat and delicate white markings near her hooves and on top of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grazes, you walk on up to her and pat her side affectionately. She notices, and with a certain degree of warmth she lifts her head and nuzzles you with her muzzle as you pet and hold her a bit. After a moment you take a step back and grin, deciding that she is a lovely mare in much need of some proper size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating on the mare, she starts to swell in size, first very slowly and then picking up. She grows and grows as you focus on her, soon reaching 7 feet tall, then 8, 9, 10...all the while you can't help but smile as she balloons up in size, the beautiful and kind mare finally getting some size she deserves, you think to yourself. You hug as much of her underbelly as you can, and soon her leg, as she grows ever bigger in size. The mare looks down on you with what appears to be a radiant glow in her eyes and an almost human-like smile upon her muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is that moment that you decide to increase her growth rate, concentrating even harder on her as she closes her eyes and raises her head back up high. You grin even further as you know she must be enjoying her growth, especially since you can hear her breathing deeply and nickering softly as well.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp and up the brown mare swells in the sun-soaked pasture, growing and growing quickly past 15 feet tall, then 20 feet, 25...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin as you keep on looking up and up at the massively growing mare, wondering if you should continue growing her for a while. </span></div></div>",

It was a small room, painted a dull white and slightly smaller than your bedroom. Usually it was piled high with boxes of this and that, but now they were somehow gone. The only thing in the room was a stone tablet, surely as large as your torso. It looked as if it had been ripped from a cliff surface rather than cut from stone, its edges rough and bumpy. Ancient, runic text was carved into the rectangular surface facing you, and the entire tablet glowed with a dull light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could somehow sense a presence next to you, directing you. Older than the stars themselves and commanding you like a puppet, it filled your head with its knowledge before retreating.

You gulp as your gazes meet, the bat having to look up a teeny little bit less with every passing moment. Clearing his throat  - surprising you even further than what had just happened - he begins to speak, in a scratchy, somewhat high-pitched tone. \"I-it's okay,\" He says, shifting awkwardly in place, surrounding his body with his wings - wings that, you notice, don't have a hand on the end, having maintained the same basic shape, albeit with a larger spiked 'thumb'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on his appearance, you'd guess that he's a fruit bat of some kind - hope, even; you'd rather not have giant vampire bats flying around. He licks his lips and clears his throat again, before continuing. \"I- I know you didn't mean to drop me. You don't have to apologise.\" You nod dumbly, still getting used to the idea of an animal... well, growing, transforming and then talking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks,\" you stammer, kneeling down to put yourself on the same level as the man-bat. \"I, uh- do you have a name?

He looks up and down at his body, before speaking once again: \"n-no...\"<br>\r\nHesitantly, you reach out with both arms, drawing him into a soft hug. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see the stone tablet glow again - and as it does, a feeling of... well, you're not exactly sure what it is you're feeling. You just want to comfort the bat... and mabe give him a name. Quietly shushing him, you hook an arm underneath his legs, lifting him up and holding him against your chest like you would an infant. The tablet blazes with light, but somehow you can't quite bring yourself to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to walk, you find yourself talking to him - \"Maybe we can come up with a name together? After getting you some food, of course...\"<br>\r\nThe bat nods, conflicting emotions on his face - happiness, and bewilderment.

You lower the bat down onto it, careful to avoid a repeat of the initial drop. \"Sit tight, okay?

You're filled with a sensation of comfort as you rub, and it takes an effort for you to pull yourself away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen's a couple of rooms over. You don't have a lot of fruit available to you, but you grab some strawberries from the fridge. It takes you that one minute to give them a rinse and throw them into a bowl, and before you know it, you're heading back into the living room. But you stop at the door, your eyes pausing when you see the bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat's hands are shaking, but they're moving over his own body, grasping at his own chest and fur. His breathing starts and stops with every touch, hesitating before he moves onto another part of his body. Every time he grasps something, he flinches, before his eyes widen again. Your curiosity rises as you watch it go on for a minute, but his voice finally ends that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Blake? Are you going to come back in here?\" Though his eyes never turn to you, his raspy voice is as clear as day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" You stride towards him, and it takes a moment before you're at the couch. \"I was just wondering what you were doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just... getting used to this. It still doesn't feel real,\" He mutters, one arm moving up so his hand can squeeze and feel the limb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda know what you mean. It's all really unexpected. I mean, I still don't know what's supposed to happen. You're gonna be... What was it, 'equalized' or something like that? Made non-dormant? I don't know what that means, but... Well, you're here now, so I'll help however I can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Blake.\" He smiles again, that warm feeling flowing through you as he does. You chuckle before you take a seat next to him, grabbing the bowl. \"Oh, food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had some around. Will these do?\" You pick a strawberry out from the bowl and hang it in front of him. In a second, you're just hanging onto a stem, his mouth snapping it away and munching it, juice spilling over his fur. His eyes sparkle as they meet yours, and his head bobs faster and faster. \"I'll take that as a yes,\" You laugh. He reaches for the bowl, his short limbs straining for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, relax, it's not going anywhere. In fact... C'mere.\" You place the bowl on the couch, before both hands tug the bat closer. His head turns, but you slide his body up to you and lean his head against your legs. \"Comfortable?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Single-minded, aren't you?\" You smile and take another strawberry. \"You don't need to snap up, alright? I'll feed you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, you grasp the stem of every berry and push it to his mouth. He twitches, visibly restraining the urge to chomp it the moment it gets close. But each time the berry pushes into him, he bites off the entire thing and mashes it closed before swallowing, a little squeal escaping him each time. His meal takes minutes, and though his mouth is a mess, he's more than contented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last bites are done...</span></div></div>",

A few days later, you noticed changes with the panthers as well when you fed them their meat.  They seemed a good half of a foot taller, but appeared to be acting normal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Wolves' Den feels like a good place to start today. You decide that it's a good idea to get started right away before anyone else shows up, so you immediately head for the food store. However, to do so you have to pass the Feline exhibits. That is when you notice that something is definitely not right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are already aware that, along with the Zebras, the Panthers seem to be bigger than they were when you first arrived. However, as you pass by the Lion's Den, the Cougar's Den and the Tiger Enclosure you suddenly realize that they are bigger too.  They have all surged in size by a shocking two and a half feet! You immediately dart over to put the Panther Enclosure into your field of view and you can see that they have swelled up another two feet too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is not the only change that has overcome these felines, however. The body of every single Lion, Tiger, Cougar, and Panther has experienced another drastic change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge, thick, powerful muscles bulge beneath their fur whenever they move, which allows you to see that their limbs appear to be as thick as tree trunks and their torsos are toned with what appears to be uncannily human musculature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back against the reinforced plexiglass wall of the Tiger enclosure and attempt to collect your thoughts so that you can try to figure out what is happening before you are interrupted by a loud and completely unexpected noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately turn around to identify the source of the noise and when you do, you can only gasp and stare in mute shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two Tigers stood behind you. She was very clearly female, judging from the particularly large breasts she is sporting, and she stood on her hind legs - on her hind legs in the same manner as that of a human! Bar the anatomical alterations that have resulted in a humanoid posture, she still had the phenotypic appearance of a tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall that her name is Jasmine, named after the colour of her eyes. And said eyes look down at you from high above the wall - you realize with a start that you only come up to her waist - and her face shifts into a huge grin of what seems like pure happiness. In the back of your mind, concerns over anthropomorphism make themselves known only to be beaten down with such ease it's almost as if the massive, muscular tiger before you had beaten them into submission with her own bare paws. These animals can walk on two legs and talk! They ARE anthropomorphic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are snapped out of your thoughts by her voice, her lovely voice as soft as velvet with a light purr underscoring her every word. She crosses her arms, her huge biceps flexing out to their impressive full size, and leans on the top of the wall which lets out a quiet creak of protest as the wall is subjected to the weight of a 12ft tiger's upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rests her breasts on her folded arms, the wall gives out a sharp squeal which settles down to a dull creaking before she gets comfortable with her position and stops moving which enables you to see something that takes your breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall's metal frame has buckled and bent into a perfect impression of her powerful arms.  Such a casual and unintentional display of sheer, raw physical power sends a stab of instinctual, primal fear through your body until your attention is grabbed by Jasmine asking if you are okay again. By this point, the other tiger in the enclosure, a male tiger, and Jasmine's mate Bruce came up beside her. He is as muscular as Jasmine, with a solid set of 8-pack abdominals below two thick pectorals which are between two bulging shoulders. As you take in his immense musculature, you also notice that he is a bit taller than Jasmine, coming in at 13ft. Although you are immensely relieved that it also appears that he is as friendly as Jasmine as his first words are about yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? You're okay, right?\" Bruce's deep, thundering voice asks to which you nod your head. You're not completely fine at all but you think that if you just get out of here and to the Wolves' Den you should just maybe avoid a mental breakdown. All the zoo's felines suddenly growing into huge, muscular, humanoid beings and calling you 'Master', was getting to be a bit too much to take in all at once for the moment, you really needed to get out of here and clear your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Bruce cheerfully bids you farewell with an assurance that the Wolves will be eager to see you. That makes you concerned as to how they know that but you have no time to dwell on that right now. You decide to make a quick exit for the food storage, observing Simba and Nala - the alpha lion pair - and Leo and Nova the other two lions who live in the zoo, also stand up on their hind legs ,the males reaching a solid 12ft and the females seemed to be about 11ft, Simba, and Nala putting their arms around each other and murmuring something to the Cougar, Wilson who at a quick glance, seemed to be around 13ft to match Bruce. However, in your dazed state, you didn't hear what was said but as you grabbed the food bags, you realized that you did notice two things. First, while you weren't sure of any definite way to determine by how much every animal would grow if this were to continue - which you had conflicting emotions about if you were perfectly honest with yourself. The second was that the animals seemed to have grown to heights which, comparatively, were relatively similar to their previous heights. It was certainly something that might help prepare you for the next exhibits you'd be passing through in a minute.</span></div></div>",

Usually, that would fill you with delight; you loved seeing those beautiful animals. Now, however, was a different matter. Now, you were filled with a deep dread. Had the bears also grown, like the felines?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, there's only one way to find out.' You think to yourself as you push the cart carrying the wolves' food stocks. You'll have to come back and feed the rest of the animals anyway, so you might as well see how many have grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the Ursine Enclosures is a thankfully uneventful one, leaving you to your racing thoughts. What if the bears have grown too? What if all the animals have grown? The thought leaves you dreading arriving at the bear exhibits, yet as you think back over what had happened to the felines, you feel an odd rush of heat throughout your body. A rush of... excitement?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your thoughts on that strange sensation are interrupted as you walk around the corner of the Ursine Exhibits, the tall trees no longer blocking your view, allowing you to see all the bears in their full glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou openly gape in awe as you gaze up at the towering titans. If the felines were big, then the bears were enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Ella - the two black bears - loomed over you, Ella easily reaching 20 feet, and Ben clocking in at 21 feet at the bare minimum! The pair were built like professional bodybuilders; their limbs thicker than the trunks of the oak trees they towered over, their broad chests heaving with every deep breath they took. Yet despite their immense size, their expressions showed not even a single trace of hostility or aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, they seemed downright delighted to see you, as they both crouched down into a squatting position, Ben bracing his huge paws on his even bigger calf muscles, which easily outsized even the largest of their namesakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!\" He smiles, his thunderous bass shaking your comparatively tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a hand in greeting, smiling nervously. It's rather difficult to not feel slightly intimidated when you're in the shadow of a bear the size of a large house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla reaches out, her thick arms easily reaching over the fence and, with a gentleness that something that size simply should not be capable of, brushed a massive fingertip over your head, ruffling your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a giggle powerful enough to shake the concrete beneath you slightly, bringing her hand to her muzzle as her face lit up with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sort your hair as Ben animatedly waves towards the Grizzly Bear Enclosure opposite them. \"Hey, Yuri! Anna! Look who's here!\" He yells, his voice putting thunder to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ground trembles beneath your feet, you turn to see the two Grizzly Bears padding towards the wall of their enclosure, the two of them even bigger than Ben and Ella, with Yuri reaching 25 feet and Anna reaching 24, at a rough estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin slightly as you greet the two titans who both smile widely at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! It's good to see you again! I take it you're on the way to feed the wolves?\" Yuri booms from up high, even though he's crouched, he's still taller than a single-story house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, looking down at the cart you're pushing, taking note of the many food bags, the zoo not willing to pay for either the acquisition or storage of fresh carcasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, by all means, don't let us keep you!\" Came another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to your left, down the road to the exhibit at the end - where the path split to the Wolves' Den and one of the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat exhibit was the Polar Bear exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA now 30-foot Polar Bear waved enthusiastically at you - Frost, the male bear - as another, 29-foot bear - Orso, the female - walked up behind him, beaming in delight at the sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Master! It's great to see you! I guess you've met some of the others?\" Orso called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod dumbly at the sight of them, their powerful, hulking frames rising into the sky, leaving you half-astonished that they hadn't been spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Wolves can't wait to see their favorite zookeeper again, especially now that they've changed! Lupus has quite the surprise for you!\" Frost beams, his eyes shining as if his namesake were in the path of the sun across the Arctic plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip at the mention of the wolves. You're anxious, yet oddly eager to see them now that they've surely undergone the same changes as all the feline and ursine members of the zoo. The mention of the pack Alpha, Lupus, also piqued your interest; what surprise could he possibly have to show you? What surprise could possibly be worth mentioning more than turning into an enormous anthropomorphic, talking giant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few deep breaths to steady your nerves, you bid your farewells to all the bears, who are all wide smiles and happy waves as they begin excitedly talking amongst each other, mostly about you, which you have to admit, is actually quite nice to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the cool, smooth metal of the cart's bar and begin to make your way to the Wolves' Den, having no idea what could be waiting for you.</span></div></div>",

The zoo thought it would be best to keep the heaviest animals in the same area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were warned on your first day to be cautious around Beth.

However, hippos were one of your favorite animals and Beth was completely docile as long as she was fed. You walk up to the exhibit where Beth was kept and saw the hippo's nostrils sticking out of the water while the rest of her body was submerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth!\" you call out as you hold up a pumpkin and a cabbage. \"Feeding time.\" The hippo gives a grunt and rises out of the water before walking up to the side of the hippo exhibit. But to your surprise, Beth looks bigger than usual and she was usually pretty big. \"Oh no,\" you think. \"Not you too, Beth.\" Beth is in fact so big that she could easily step out of her exhibit. And that was just what she did. Or at least half-way. The hippo's upper half was sticking out of the exhibit as her face loomed huge in front of you. Your jaw dropped because Beth looked like she was as big as an elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the hippopotamus grunted to remind you she was hungry and opened her mouth whole. It looked big enough to fit a family of four in it. You smiled nervously and then you placed 3 pumpkins and 5 cabbages into the hippopotamus's mouth, signaling her to shut her jaws and grunt. The hippo chews her meal and swallows before smiling. Then she did something that really surprised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Said the hippopotamus in a surprisingly high-pitched voice for such an enormous creature. You gasp. \"Beth?\" you ask. \"Did you just...?\" Without warning, Beth stood on her hind legs, looming three times bigger than you and then she suddenly grew long black hair and her body became more humanoid in shape, complete with.... more feminine features. She then blew a kiss at you and as you were wrapping your head around what happened, the hippopotamus grew bigger and bigger and in seconds she was...</span></div></div>",

All these horses must have been male due to their bodily proportions and distinct whinnies; you found this to be very odd, groups of male horses like this didn't exist anywhere else in the world, nor were they all so huge.

You do so, and once you are in the middle the other horses trot back slowly, forming a wide circle around you and their leader.  The both of you stare at each other.  This is the most interesting behavior you have ever seen from horses; they seem a lot more intelligent and adapted when it comes to humans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The herd of beautiful horses you have here is truly remarkable,\" you say to the large stallion, looking around at all the other interested horses.  \"I must say it's an honor to finally meet the legendary horses on this island!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the horses seemed to smile as you looked at them and the stallion gave a small snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What strikes me most about your unique species (you are a new species, aren't you?) is how you get so big.  You,\" you point to the huge stallion in front of you, \"must be at least 9 feet tall!\" you exclaim.  He seems to nod and then paws the ground eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around as one of the brown horses in the circle kneels down and motions eating grass with its mouth and then gets back up and shakes its head, snorting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't get so big from the food you eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you get so big from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon this question, the other horses seem to instinctively trot at least ten feet backwards in all directions.  Before you can even start to think how odd this is something amazing started to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome black stallion in front of you, already a good 9 feet tall, started to tense a little bit as a noticeable white glow surrounded its body.  Before your very eyes, the horse started to grow and grow for a good minute or so before it was at least 20 feet tall.  You barely came up to its knees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that is amazing!\" you say in awe.  Normally you would be scared of something like this but you can easily tell that these horses were used to humans and had no bad intentions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had also dawned on you that you had just witnessed the power of the enchantments of the legendary stallion! You just couldn't believe it; this was every biologist's dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is simply extraordinary...\" you breathe, staring up at the giant horse.  The horse  whinnies excitedly at your reaction and paws the ground a little; you can tell it enjoys being this size.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other horses seem a little excited too; they must be anxious for something to happen.  Apparently the stallion's powers excite the horses to this day, which is very odd considering the stallion is rumored to live forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly hit you why the horses were acting in such a way. After saving 5 people from death, the stallion was granted its powers from the spirit of Nature on one condition: it could only exercise its powers with the consent of a human being.  You realize that you are the human that the horses, and the stallion in particular, have sought for hundreds of years.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let me get this straight...\" you say in an attempt to take in all the mind boggling information.  It hurt a little bit to crane your neck up so high to look the handsome equine in the face. \"You, the legendary stallion, have been waiting for me to use your powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the stallion whinnied eagerly as well as the other horses surrounding the both of you.  They all seemed to radiate warm happiness; you couldn't blame them seeing that they had just found the one person that will most likely make their dreams come true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also realize the circumstances of the horses' mysterious size; the stallion must have received a certain amount of power upon its bestowing of its power and decided to share some of his power with the rest of the herd.  It was all making sense now.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I assume these powers allow you to change your size? And you can share it with the herd if you wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion nodded twice, snorting and shaking its head slightly and happily.  You grinned up at his huge frame, and looked around at the other excited horses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you all say? Should I keep on letting him enjoy his powers?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the 19 brown horses stomp the grass-covered ground repeatedly in the utmost excitement and happiness.  You know that if you grow the leader even more that he will most likely share some of his size with his fellow horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, here goes!\" Your starting to get a little excited yourself; who knows what this stallion is capable of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate hard on the stallion and wish that he would grow.  Sure enough, the white glow returns, embodying the horse once more.  He remains relatively quiet as he soon continues his growth.  However, there is still plenty of noise from the excited horses around us and the ground shaking due to the massive equine in front of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the white glow fades you attempt to look up at the stallion's face and can barely do so as you crane your neck to the limit; he must have been 100 feet tall!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the weirdest thing about this area was that you have not seen as much as a single insect after searching for a good half hour.  The deep silence is a little unnerving; the only sound you hear is that of your boots squelching up and down through the vegetation and mud.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a loud sound as though something was sliding through the marsh behind you.

You look forward timidly and gasp in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, lying right in front of you, is a section of the biggest snake body you have ever seen.  Its so massive that you automatically step back so you can see its entire body more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts body's incredible length seems to go on for miles as it twists and turns through the dense marshland.  Looking at the coil in front of you, the mere thickness of it is simply astounding; it must be at least 3 feet thick and 4 feet high!

She figured that they would be less likely to be hunted there and watching them would calm her down but she was greeted with a similar gruesome sight. A duo of humans were stomping through the forest as they chased a fleeing fox, firing their rifles wildly in it's direction while hooting and hollering. Mother Nature was livid, to say the least. The fox, a female with the most beautiful orange and white fur was running for her life as bullets narrowly miss her. Despite her speed, the humans always seemed to catch up somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mother Nature made a decision. She would give this fox a blessing so she could enact revenge against the humans. A blessing that would allow her to grow as big as she wanted. A blessing that would give her power over the size of every living animal of Earth, including humans. It might have been irresponsible to give a wild animal such a power, but Mother Nature decided that it was about time humans got their comeuppance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fox imbued with her new size-altering power Mother Nature implanted a thought into her mind that would help trigger one of it's effects. \"If only I was much bigger than them!\" She channeled to the fox, still fleeing from the pursuing humans. Just as she planned, a string of thoughts began to stir in the vixen's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I grew bigger than them or if they were the size of mice, I could easily take them down!\" The fox thought to herself, frustrated at her situation. Surprisingly clear images of her towering over the trees or the humans being shrunk smaller than her paw began popping into her mind as she continued running from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The vixen kept running for her life as the humans continued pursuing her. She cursed her small size, wishing desperately that she could be big enough to defend herself. As she ran she felt a strange tight sensation throughout her body as if her skin was struggling to contain her. As a gunshot whizzed past her head she ignored the feeling and kept running. Unknown to the vixen and her pursuers, she was slowly growing bigger and soon reached the size of a large wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her size increased so did the distance each step took her she soon found herself outrunning the humans as their yells grew more distant. To be safe, though, she kept running as fast as she could to the safety of her den. It was then the fox noticed that many of the shrubs she passed by were actually shorter than her. This caused her to slow to a trot as she tried to figure out where she was. She could have sworn this was the path she took earlier when she left her den but everything seemed different. Smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she reached a dense wall of shrubbery. Her den was like a fortress surrounded by walls of these tightly-packed shrubs, the only entrance being a small thoroughfare just big enough to fit her. It used to fit her at least. As she looked at the small opening it finally dawned on the vixen that she was much bigger than she was a moment ago. Crouching down she could barely fit her snout through the opening, she figured she must have been taller and bigger than a bear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail flicked side-to-side in excitement. \"My wish came true!\"  She thought to herself as she stomped around reveling the new power her legs contained. Her celebration was short-lived however as the yelling of the humans reached her ears once again. Standing as tall as a bear she was quite large but the guns the humans carried frightened her. She wished she could be even bigger so she could stand up to them. Suddenly her body shivered and the tight sensation she felt earlier  returned as her form began to grow once more. Inch after inch she grew until another foot was added on to her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA connection was quickly created in her mind. To test her theory she imagined herself growing even bigger and much to her surprise she shot up another foot. A flood of excitement overwhelmed her as she realized she had full control over her size. The hollering of the humans was getting louder but instead of fear the vixen felt anticipation. She watched as they weaved past a group of trees and shrubs into view. \"There it is!\" One of them smugly announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second pulled up his gun. \"It's standing still, shoot...\" The hunter trailed off as he looked through the sights. That was the moment the vixen was waiting for. The dread as they realized the small little animal they were chasing is now much, much bigger. Since they were frozen in fear and confusion by the sight before them the fox decided to make herself even bigger for them. Her vision rose as everything around her seemed to get smaller. Despite being a fair distance away, the hunters quickly realized that the beast had grown bigger causing them to quickly turn tail to run away from the giant fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was exactly what the fox wanted. Speeding up into a slow trot she actually found she was still keeping up with the humans on account of her size. As she got closer and closer it looked like she was twice as tall as the humans. Joyfully watching her previous hunters running away from her, she began formulating her revenge plan. Continuing her chase, she began making herself bigger yet again, slowly expanding as she followed the humans. She savored the look of fear on their faces as they turned around to see that their pursuer was even bigger than the last time they saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly stopped her growth as she felt the branches of the trees above brush against her back. The fox was about 20 feet from feet to shoulder and her bulky size was making it difficult to traverse the forest, her thighs and shoulders occasionally dislodging a tree whenever she bumps into one. Eventually the moment she was waiting for happened. One of the hunters risked looking back and caught his foot on an exposed root, causing him to smack face first to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over the human pulled the gun towards the vixen's chest and shot. The fox felt barely a pinprick as she went to stand over him, stamping her feet down to either side of his body causing him to release his gun from fright. With the human submitting the fox takes some time to toy with her prey by snicking her nose into his chest to smell his scent. The human whimpered as the fox opened her maw and a fleshy tongue dragged across the entirety of his body. After a barrage of licks she sneaks her tongue under his legs and starts to pull the man into her mouth sending him into a panic. Pulling his waist into her mouth the man screams as the fox lifts him up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFruitlessly punching the vixen's nose the hunter could only watch as the fox brought more of his body into her mouth. Almost at a painfully slow pace she brought inch after inch of the human inside her mouth. Before long the man was completely engulfed by her maw, his protests muffled as she closes her mouth. At 20 feet, the small man could just barely rest on the giant fox's tongue. Mercilessly the fox jostled the man about in her mouth as she tasted him all over, his sweat giving him a slightly salty taste. A growling sound coming up from the back of her throat signaled the end of her teasing though as she tilted her head up and swallowed. She could feel the hunter start the slide down her gullet grasping wildly at the fleshy surface. With a final swallow her prey began its descent, a bulge filling her throat before moving towards her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly distended a bit as the human reached her stomach. The vixen enjoyed how he was struggling in her belly, unable to get out. \"Serves him right!\" She thought to herself as she regained her composure. Looking around, however, she noticed that the only human near her was the one wriggling in her belly. \"I let the other one get away...\" She lamented. She had a plan for that one too! Crushing a small bush in frustration she suddenly picked up a scent. \"Maybe I didn't let him get away!\" Sniffing wildly at the ground she picked up a smell that was undeniably human. She began to move, sniffing and sniffing until she reached a tree. Moving her head closer to the tree she could hear the sound of someone breathing really heavily behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a foxy grin she snapped her jaws over the tree, her new size giving her the strength to completely dislodge the tree from the ground. Chucking the tree to the side of her wish a massive crash she could plainly see the other human crouched down with his hands over his head. Stamping her black paws to the side of him the man practically jumped in the air before landing on his back, his eyes meeting the vixen's. She almost wanted to thank him for not running away as she raised one of her paws above him before gently lowering it back down onto him. Her paw took up his entire chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApply pressure to the man's torso he lets out a sharp gasp. The fox was enjoying her display of dominance, applying pressures to different parts of his body to see what other sounds he makes. Unfortunately the fox overestimated how big she would be when she made her revenge plan. She was hoping that the human would be a bit  smaller so her <i>finale</i> had more impact. As soon as the thought finished in her mind however she felt the man's form under her paws get smaller and smaller. Shocked she looked down. She wasn't growing, the man was shrinking! He stopped getting smaller by the time her paws completely encompassed him. Lifting her paw she inspected her diminished prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So growing bigger isn't the only new power I got.\" She told herself as she watched the human. To test she imagined the human getting even smaller, making him yell out as his body started shrinking once again. She observed the human getting smaller and smaller until she had to crouch down to see him. To the man, the world around him looked foreign and strange, now standing only an inch tall small twigs were like logs and the small patch of dirt he was sitting on was like a massive hill. Looking upwards, the fox was impossibly tall. As the fox rose up to it's full height he was reminded of his first time in the big city, looking at the buildings towering over him in awe. The awe was quickly replaced with fear again as a huge shadow jolted him back to reality. Tumbling onto his back he watched as everything above him was replaced with a gigantic leathery pawpad. The leathery ceiling above him hovered for a second before abruptly smashing down on top of him. He didn't even feel anything as the fox squashed him flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the other hunter taken care of, the fox took a moment to appreciate her work. The hunters that had tried to kill her were now defeated, one digesting in her belly while the other was turned to a small stain on her paw. The adrenaline rush of complete dominance lingered in her mind. She wanted to continue her revenge! Not only have the humans tried to kill her, but they constantly damaged the forest and killed other animals for sport. With the power to manipulate the size of herself and the humans she figured that they would be powerless to stop her. If they did manage hurt her all she had to do was make herself bigger so they couldn't anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind set on destruction she began her journey towards civilization.</span></div></div>",

Ultimately, the scientists concluded that they grow about twice as large in frequent intervals after they are one year and four days old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I trust that you will bring the lion to school every day while you're on vacation so that the rest of the class and I can record down observations?\" asks the teacher rhetorically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, but it is mostly from shock.  Did he just say that he was giving you, and only you, another vacation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right,\" the teacher chuckles, \"as a special treat, you're going to get as much time off as needed in order to take care of and bond with the lion.  That way we can assure it's maximum growth and happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class gives you looks of utter jealousy and longing, and you smile knowing that the lion has chosen you to be its best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I want you to be especially careful and adapt along with the lion as efficiently as possible.  A growing lion is going to need more and more food, space, and companionship each and every day.  I'm certain though that you will do just fine.  Are you up to the job?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod eagerly, instantly becoming fixated on the clock, counting down the minutes until the end of the school day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't forget to bring him in every day so we can record his progress!\" he said, and you nod once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the end of school comes and you walk out of the classroom door with your new lion companion on his special leash that the teacher had designed for him just as a precaution.  You know that he will soon grow to about 12 feet tall by tomorrow since he is already 6 feet tall, and you are eager to go home and make the accommodations needed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get home, you head to your room to push all the furniture to one side of the room, lay the ground with blankets, and find huge watering tubs outside to put the lion's meat and water in.  There's now plenty of space for him to sprawl out on the comfy floor, and you are content that he is content.  He instantly curls up on the floor and falls asleep peacefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about what your parents would say, but luckily your parents were on an extended vacation too and wouldn't be back home for a few weeks, so you wouldn't have to worry about keeping the lion a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what should you do now? It is getting late and you're exhausted from preparing for your lion friend.             </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you read on, you learn some very interesting facts about your friend lion's species.  The web site says that, apparently, there has always been an ancient and mysterious artifact that has the ability to increase the size of the Colossal American Lion by the Chosen One of the species, and only the Chosen One.  It says the artifact has been hidden away \"in the birthplace of the Lions,\" but does not say specifically where it is.  In a side note though it says that if the Chosen One is ever alive anywhere in the planet all they would have to do is focus and believe that such an artifact exists and it will appear to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind races as you think back during school.  The lion did lie on you, didn't it? And no one else had any control over him, right? Then perhaps you were the Chosen One! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your excitement, you quickly log off the computer and nearly knock over the chair but soon gain back your balance.  You look over at your 6 foot tall friend still sleeping near the corner of your room, and your insides seem to swell with impending pride and excitement from just thinking about having the power to change your friend's size on the slightest whim.  An artifact must exist for your sole use, it must...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, your room glowed a pearly white for about a few seconds as an object the size of your wrist materialized in front of you.  You had to shield your eyes with your arm quickly as to not get dazed.  Once you open them, you find yourself looking at a thick, bronze-colored wristband suspended in midair.  It didn't seem to have an inclination of malevolence to it, so you decide to walk forward and investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dim red glow was encased around the ancient wristband.  As you got even closer you noticed unusual markings and hieroglyphs that completely covered its bronze surface.   The carvings seemed to have been cut out thousands of years ago, most likely by the  early American aborigines.  Running along the side of the bronze wristband as if telling a story, they depicted the struggle that both man and lion had so many centuries ago.  The first \"slide\" showed men attacking a defenseless adult lion.  The second showed a glowing object appearing between them, and the third showed what looked like a paw of the lion filling up the right side of the slide while all the men, except for one wearing the device, cowered on the left. Finally, the fourth showed thousands of men bowing down to a massive lion the size of a mountain while a tiny man sat on his bushy mane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued by these pictures and drawing a complete blank at the hieroglyphs, you decide to hop back online again to see if you could find out more about this.  Sure enough, there is a link on the left of the same page entitled \"The Great Device.\" You click on it and continue you to read while the lion behind you continues his peaceful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe website tells you that lions did indeed exist in America around a few thousand years ago.  Lions and humans lived surprisingly well along side each other and each species coexisted well for a long time.  However, once humans decided that they were a source of meat, their numbers were quickly depleted due to excessive hunting.  Just when hope seemed lost for the lions it is said that a Great Device appeared before the only man that fought for the protection of the lions that allowed him to change the lions' sizes.  He grew one of the powerful males to demonstrate the power of the lions, changed him back to normal size once the people respected the lions, and then hid the device so carefully that only the next Chosen One would be able to find it.  Only a few of the lions survived the onslaught by the humans and spent centuries deep in the American forests away from human eyes because of their habit of growing from any human interaction because of the after effects of the Device.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything made sense to you now.  This made you extremely excited and eager to test out the Great Device as the new Chosen One.  You get up, walk over to the center of the room, wrap the Device around your wrist, and are immediately overcome with a light feeling, a feeling as though you could do anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to your sleeping friend, scratch his mane, and see him give a huge yawn as he wakes up.  He looks up at you and stands up on all fours excitedly upon seeing your own excited smile; he must know that something is going on.  He gives a quick stretch of his front legs, his claws digging into the carpeted floor, and then fully stands up, becoming eye level with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I have, buddy!\" you say, holding your arm so he can see the Device.  His eyes grow huge upon seeing it and lets out a small growl of understanding.  He must know what it is because of his obvious eagerness for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You quirked an eyebrow as your teacher entered the room, and many of the other children in your class began to excitedly talk amongst themselves. Trailing into the class behind your teacher was a tiny horse, a leash around its neck. The tiny horse's coat was the colour of dark chocolate, its mane jet black. Fluffy white fur covered its hooves, reaching down from its fetlocks. By far the most distinctive feature of the tiny horse was, well, just how tiny it was. The foal was the size of a small cat, and so frail and thin that it looked as if it hadn't eaten a single thing in its life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher told your class to gather in a circle at the carpeted area in the class, and you as did so she began to explain what the horse was as she stood in the middle of you and your classmates. \"This,\" she said, \"is a Great Draft Horse.\" The eyes of all of your classmates - and indeed, yours - widened, all of them letting out a gasp almost in unison. Everyone knew about the Great Draft Horses. After all, why was the sky black or brown or grey sometimes? Because one of the immense horses was in your area and probably looking for attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's a baby boy, what's called a foal. I'm going to take his leash off so he can meet all of you - don't be scared of him, Great Drafts are incapable of being mean!\" Your teacher slipped the collar off of the teeny horse and it immediately began to nicker and snort, running off in random directions, constantly halting and cantering in another direction. Too many children to make friends with, too many children to snuggle with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal canters in a ring, brushing up against any of your classmates it can reach. \"Of course, he's only a baby, so he's going to get much bigger,\" you teacher continues. \"Contact with humans is extremely important for Great Drafts, so we've been allowed to take care of him. In fact, one of you will be taking him home with you!\" The class instantly explodes into s flurry of shouting and hand-waving, but your teacher quickly gets your classmates to quiet down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Great Drafts are intelligent enough to understand humans, the horse himself will be allowed to choose who he wants to go home with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the horse whinnied, twisting and turning his head this way and that. Your heart skips a beat as his eyes lock onto you, the foal slowly making his way towards you. You gawp, open-mouthed, as he settles into your lap, like a cat. You move your hands down to him, letting him all over. \"Great Drafts mature and grow extremely quickly, so he'll look different every time he's brought into the class,\" your teacher says. Attracting your attention, she continues. \"I'll tell your parents, though I have a feeling they'll be more than enthusiastic about this. They'll be getting food and water for the Great Draft so you might have to wait after school for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, though, you didn't have to wait after school. Immediately after getting home, you fed and watered the foal, and retreated to your room with him. You took your time playing with him, wondering if he'd get tired out - but the foal seemed to have limitless energy, and when not playing some game with you was cantering and bounding throughout the room, as if he's explode if he didn't use up some of the energy inside of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, however, the tiny Draft halted in place, shuddering as you looked on. Was he about to grow? Your teacher had said that'd happen when he went like this... As it turned out, he was going to do more than just grow. The little horse clambered up onto your bed, equine muscles all twitching, before his hide suddenly pulled tight, struggling to cover all of his body before it caught up. The size of a small cat moments before, the horse had leapt up in size to being about as big as a husky dog. He looked different, too. You weren't sure how to describe it but he seemed stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shudder, and the horse grew once more. His shining eyes met yours as he grew last your sitting form's head, starting to nuzzle down on you eagerly. His growth was accompanied by the sound of rubber being pulled tight. You liked that sound - it was nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew why the horse looked different, now - he wasn't just growing, he was growing up! His eyes shot open and his big muzzle swung around to look between his hind legs. Peeking around his body and following his gaze, you gasped. Two tennis ball-sized spheres hung from the underside of the horse's body towards the back, a fuzzy brown cylinder attached to them. As you watched, a bulge of pink flesh spilled out of the fuzzy sheath, limp and dangling free, before more hot-pink flesh began to push out, forcing the sheath to expand to contain its growing size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... Willy?\" you mumble as you look at it, the horse shuffling about in what seemed to be the need to do something with it. Not needing to pee - something else. \"Wow, it's so big...\" The horse's entire body let out a creaking sound as your eyes widened further, what you recognised as muscle freely swelling all over him. Existing muscles gained definition and size, booming larger, and his body packed in new muscles wherever they could fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse jumped off of your bed with a heavy thud, the little stallion taller than you when standing by now. He nickered happily as he looked at you, before looking back at his willy. Even soft, it seemed to reach halfway to the floor. It started to harden, and a sloshing sound came from his balls as he shifted about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to be a teenager by now, if not more! You realised then that you wanted him to be the biggest Great Draft Horse ever - bigger than any other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about bigness... How big is he by next morning?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It'd been a long, long time since you'd played with your toys. Things like plushies, stuffed animals and so on - you'd outgrown them just after childhood, but could never quite bring yourself to actually get rid of them despite never playing with them. Nostalgia, most likely. Too many fun memories of playing with them. There were three toys in particular that you played with almost constantly: three plush horses, named Maximus, Billy, and Colton. In the games you'd played with them as a child, you'd given them all distinct personalities to make them more distinct than their different colours would indicate. Colton was a farm horse with light brown fur and a black mane; in your games, he was a hard worker, to the point that anything stopping him from working on the farm either disappeared or caused him to grow bigger and stronger, to the point that he could simply disregard it. Billy - also known as Big Billy - was a dapple grey stallion and a racehorse. Not only was he the fastest horse in the world, but he was a serious contender for the second largest. Every race, whether a win or a loss, caused his body to adapt so as to make him more successful in future races - every race grew him bigger, stronger, faster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus, though, was something else entirely. Big enough to make houses look like toy models; strong enough to lift anything he could see. With a fur and mane as black as midnight, Maximus was so large that any area he was in was plunged into darkness, his shadow enveloping the ground beneath him. Not only that, but the black stallion was constantly growing. In fact, nearly everything he did only made him bigger - eating, drinking; even things like breathing and running only made him ever larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Yeah. Looking back on it, it wasn't unexpected that you were into macro. So many sessions playing with your toys and pretending that they were immense, evergrowing giants was probably an early indicator of your proclivities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about your toys, you were currently digging through a box of your old plushies. You'd decided to dig out your old toy horses and clean them up a bit, after so many years of them languishing at the bottom of a fluffy toy pile. It doesn't take long for you to find Maximus, Billy and Colton, as they were rather large toys - plushie horses that, even at your adult height, were still large enough to consider snuggling with. You arranged them in a row, in size order: Maximus, Billy, and then Colton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling nostalgically, you pick up Maximus, cradling the plush toy against your chest. Squeezing it tight, you lower your head into its mane, breathing in through your nose. You had expected several things when taking your old toys out of their box in the attic: that they'd be dirt or covered in dust, possibly damaged - but you had not expected for Maximus to lean into you and start licking your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut down for a second, trying to understand what is happening. Maximus, your toy horse - your non-living toy horse - is moving, and licking you, with a tongue that feels very real indeed. You blink once - twice - and then, with a surprised shriek, throw yourself backwards, away from the affectionate toy horse. Maximus falls to the floor with a soft plop, and you can see that he looks like a midway point between real and toy - real eyes; real tongue flopping out of his muzzle; real- real bits hanging beneath his back end; but his hide had a plush-like quality to it. As if he was still made to be picked up and snuggled. As you watch, he slowly transforms into an all-real horse - though a very small one, no taller than your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you look at Colton and Billy, finding that both have transformed into small, real horses. Before you can begin to crawl backwards, however, Maximus gallops up to you with surprising speed, placing a hoof on your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth, already open, only drops even further open, as the black stallion begins to speak. \"Owner! It's been so long since you paid attention to us!\" You but your lip at his words, as Mazimus climbs onto your chest, nuzzling and licking at your chin. \"Mmm, Owner, pick me up,\" Maximus demands. \"Hug me! Snuggle me! LOVE ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply with the horse's demands, hesitantly picking him up in your arms and squeezing him tight. The stallion huffs and snorts in joy, and you blush slightly as you feel him growing hard. \"S-so,\" you begin, almost tripping over the words as you stroke a hand through Maximus' jet black mane. \"Why'd you come to life, all of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColton answers this time, trotting up beside you: \"well, Owner, we... Though you could do with a lesson.\" You stop stroking Maximus and the stallion lets out a low-pitched whine of protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- what kind of lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColton paws at the carpet beneath his hooves for a second, before answering. \"Well... A lesson on why you should take better care of your toys...\" He giggles nervously as you quirk an eyebrow at him, prompting him to continue. \"Nothing violent or mean! We wouldn't dream of hurting you, Owner, but... Well...\" You can see Colton's penis, long, thick and mottled pink and brown; it's fully hard, out of its sheath, pulsing and throbbing insistently. \"Well, we've done some growing since you last played with us and thought that you could... 'Take care' of us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion bats his eyelids and gives you the best puppy-eyes he can, even as you feel Maximus sliding about some - your eyes widen as you look at him: he's growing! The black stallion's member insistently nudges into your chest as he lets out a little groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Time for your lesson, Owner!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maximus' body swells out in a smooth surge of size, a rubbery squealing sound accompanying his growth. Your eyes widen at the speed of his expansion, and you try to move - but the stallion's growing weight pins you to the floor, his rump squishing into your chest as it slowly rolls outwards, and his muzzle dipping down to nose on your head, his tongue lashing out to lick you even as he swells bigger. You can feel his member slowly stretching outwards along your chest - longer and thicker with every pulse of growth. You gulp, placing a hand atop the stallion's muzzle - which simply bulges larger, overfilling your palm and swelling around it with a happy nicker. \"M-Maximus,\" you stutter as his cock begins to slowly drool pre along your chest as it throbs larger and longer. \"You- what even is this lesson? And- are, are you really sure you have to teach it to me like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lesson is to take care of your toys, Owner,\" Maximus says, beaming down at you as he slowly spills off of your body with his continuing growth. \"And yes, we have to teach it to you this way! It's the best way to teach you! Now...\" The black stallion trails off as he shifts about. The pulsing tip of his grown cock bumps against your lips, smearing pre over them. You squirm uncomfortable as his flank presses down on you, getting heavier with each passing moment. His cock, pushing gently against your lips, continues to grow in pulsing spurts; the rod parts your lips even as you move your head backwards, Maximus' member growing into your mouth as you looked upwards, unable to see anything but his glossy black fur. Freeing your arms from underneath his bulk, you try to push Maximus off you - only for him to burst larger, his bulk soon covering the entirety of your torso. His member is so large that it can barely fit in your mouth at all, and even then a large portion of its fleshy mass was unable to - it was simply too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself swallowing almost constantly to deal with the stallion's flood of pre. Torso and arms trapped underbulk, Maximus' cock gently forced into your mouth, you wriggle about in protest. Up above, Maximus guggles, and cooing at you. As he speak, his voice is breathy and whispery, the growing horse almost brough to the very edge by your movement. \"Don't worry, Owner,\" he says as his balls bump your chin - and your upper chest as well, so large and full of cum were they - \"This bit of the lesson will be over in a little bit... Then the fun can really begin!\"</span></div></div>",

You were always a fan of inflatable toys, and had amassed a small collection over the years, but none of them would ever hold a candle to the toy you now possessed. The name on the packaging read 'Lumina' in large block capitals, the packaging itself previously hidden inside a large cardboard box to make the delivery more discreet. On the packaging itself was a picture of an inflatable anthropomorphic mare - Lumina herself, in all her rubbery, squeaky glory. A latex hide as black as a starless night, and hooves, eyes, mane and tail all a light, luminous green. Ripping open the packaging you retrieve the rubbery mass from within, flattening it out and finding the mare's nozzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already set up an air pump, and you connected it to Lumina's nozzle; you turned it on, and a flood of air entered the latex horse. Bit by bit, she filled out, resuming her proper shape - that of a large, life-sized, half-human mare. You giggled as she seemed to grow, sloowlyy reaching her full height of six feet tall as air filled her up. You put your arms around her thickening neck, snuggling the latex hide dearly. Not wanting Lumina to burst, you move behind her, grasping the air pump that was feeding her up bigger, and prepare to turn it off, as the inflatable toy was quickly reaching her full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do so, however, with a soft squeaking sound your hands are covered by a green and black rubber hand. A black hand, with neon green nails. Your eyes shoot open and you look at Lumina, whose green eyes are locked into yours even as she slowly grows. You stammer, head whipping left and right as you try to find an explanation. The hand silences you again, however, as Lumina moves it to cover your mouth. It bulges larger as it makes contact with your lips, latex grinding against the skin of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, good to be out of that box,\" Lumina says, stretching out all over as she pumps bigger, continually lowering her muzzle to keep her eyes level to yours. \"Thanks for inflating me, cutie. Heh, you're pretty small, aren't you?\" Her voice was like liquid honey - syrupy and sultry. You stutter as her pendulous and perky breasts reach their full size - and keep on inflating, puffing out bigger and bigger and threatening to engulf your head in their cavernous cleavage as, you try to come up with a response - before you dive towards the air pump, ripping it out of the wall socket. Lumina huffs, a little pout on her muzzle. \"Oh, why'd you do that, owner? Don't you want me to be nice and big?\" Nice and big was something Lumina already was, in your opinion. Seven feet tall at the eartips, the inflatable horse towered over you, green eyes blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you catch sight of something between Lumina's legs - it seems that 'she' wasn't quite accurate - Lumina was a shi! A pair of palm-filling balls swung beneath the horse's latex groin, attached to a sheath so overfilled that you doubt anything or anyone would be able to take the shaft inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumina slowly licks hir lips, a sly look on hit face.<br>\r\n\"Like what you see, hm? Well, that's good, cutie... Because my nozzle isn't the only way I can be inflated. Why don't you be good and plug the air pump into my... Other 'nozzle'?\" Shi pointed a finger towards hir overfilled sheath, and reached a hand towards you. Shi took your hand into hir own, and tugged you forward, before resting one hand on your shoulder, the other stroking hir sheath, which bulged obscenely as the tip of hir midnight-black cock poked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumina giggled mischievously at the stunned look on your face, and with a gentle downward push to your shoulder, sent you to your knees. \"Still soft, cutie,\" shi said with a false whimper, muzzle dipping down to nuzzle at the top of your head. \"I'm sure you want me to be... Mmmm, nice, and... big, so why don't you... give me a blowjob? Literally?\" </span></div></div>",

Hir beautiful neon-green eyes seemed to stare into your very soul as shi nuzzled down on you enthusiastically. You didn't know why or how any of this was happening, but... You couldn't quite bring yourself to protest. With even nuzzle, the underside of Lumina's muzzle bumps into hir overinflated, oversized breasts, sending a shiver through hir. Hir bright green tongue lashes out, licking at the top of your head. It's a strange feeling - it's not wet or slimy, but the material still feels strangely slick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your bottom lip as you look at Lumina's package. According to her, it was still soft - and even if so, it was ungodly huge. A thick, rubbery sheath that had to be a foot long if not more so, the very tip of hir vast member poking out as if saying hello. It slowly pulsed and throbbed, hir shaft slowly sliding out with a prolonged squeal. \"Mmm,\" Lumina moaned, rubber equine teeth biting hir bottom lip. \"M-maybe... you still need encouragement...\" And with that, Lumina seized the back of your head, dragging you upwards. Hir mouth met yours, hir tongue roughly probing the inside of your mouth and overpowering your own tongue with ease. The rubber mare breathes in hard through hir nostrils, latex hide squealing as shi pumps a few more inches taller, growing stronger with every small surge of size. Hir arms cradle you against hir form as shi leans down to kiss you, pushing you into hir immense breasts, the thumb-sized nipples fully hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lumina 'encourages' you, you feel something bump your chest. Directing your gaze downwards even as the growing mare draws out the forceful kiss, your eyes widen in shock. Lumie was fully hard, and- and- and utterly <i>MASSIVE</i>! Hir shaft was twice as thick as your arm, and so long it was a miracle that its length hadn't knocked you upside the head- its own weight dragging it forward to rest against your shoulders. Lumina shudders and nearly pulls away at the sensation of that alone, letting out a moan so loud that it reverberates throughout your entire house. Before you can do anything, however, shi drives hir tongue back into your mouth, its enlarged green form nearly stuffing itself down your throat in hir lust. Lumina's strong legs wobble cutely as shi goes quite literally weak at the knees, and shi falls backwards onto hir massive rump, the two football-like cheeks cushioning hir as shi reclines, laying you against hir stomach and on top of hir breasts - and indeed, on top of of hir pulsing shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the kiss ends, Lumie retracting hir huge muzzle with a gulp of air - which only serves to pump her up even bigger. Hir sparkling eyes fix onto your own, and you don't need encouragement this time. Hir shaft is thick enough for you to hug, and hug it you do, as you begin to kiss and lick at the throbbing equine cockhead. Lumina's pupils shrink to pinpricks, and all she can let out is a strangled \"fff--\" as you take the very tip of hir cock into your mouth - it's so huge that anythig else would be impossible. And then, you begin to blow into hir cockhead, as if you're inflating a balloon. The results are instantaneous...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lumina's eyes roll back in their sockets as you blow, the rubber herm-mare involuntarily clenches hir dainty hands into fists that swell larger, as almost unimaginable pleasure courses through hir as shi begins to grow all over. All shi can do is gasp for air - air that pumps hir yet bigger, even as you blow more and more down hir inflaating shaft. Hir shaft was utterly monstrous in size now, noteven the tip able to fit in your mouth like as before. Lumie's balls, larger that those used for basketball, swelled larger and larger, creeping across the floor with a rubbery squeaking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumie was growing all ove, now. Hir form swelled across the floor, limbs, head, hooves and genitals all approaching some new wall or ceiling trying to trap hir in, constrain hir size. Shi spasmed in pleasure as you blew again and again, hir body making a sound similar to a too-full balloon being blown up even larger. One hand pushes against your back, holding you in place against hir monolithic shaft, before slowly moving you up and down its length, using you like a hand large enough to grasp the pulsing, throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumie is slowly forced to scrunch hir body up as shi runs out of space, curling almost into a ball - were shi not so massively hung, she would likely have succeeded. Hir hand pumps you up and down hir pulsing shaft, but hir attention is momentarily taken away from you as hir cockhead thumps against the ceiling; it\u2019s grown so long, so thick, so big! The latex mare winces from the pleasure, letting out a quiet little moan - which slowly swells into a borderline scream of pleasure, as hir shaft keeps on growing and growing, the head exerting so much pressure on the ceiling that it begins to bulge upwards. Lumie\u2019s breasts and butt have more than kept up with hir body, swelling into vast latex globes that squeal and squeak with every small movement, every successive surge of size; Lumie\u2019s chest has grown large enough for the inflatable mare to use to titfuck hirself, the spheres snuggling around hir monolithic shaft, which fits neatly inside hir cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the ceiling begins to buckle, shi begins to go at it. Pumping you up and down hir shaft faster and harder - though making sure there\u2019s not a single bruise on you. Bouncing hir chest up and down wildly, one dainty hand and arm trying to keep hir breasts squeezed tightly enough together for the titfuck to actually work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumina moans, the sound almost shattering the windows in your house - and then, shi explodes bigger. There\u2019s a rush of stretching black and green latex, smashing your house to bits from the inside with the force of relentless expansion alone. Plaster, piping and furniture all go flying, or are crushed and flattened beneath Lumina\u2019s gargantuan body. By the time hir spurt\u2019s ended, shi\u2019s sitting exactly where your house was, crushing down on its remnants with her booty, which was, relatively, larger than a bean bag chair. Hir shaft throbs and pulses madly, having grown so large that it utterly dwarfs the rest of hir body. Hir wildly churning balls have grown so massive and so seemingly-full that, along with hir butt, they lift Lumie\u2019s body off of the ground. Hir legs simply aren\u2019t long enough to touch it, not when she\u2019s so amazingly disproportionate! Hir breasts have swollen into small hills, big enough to nearly swallow a good chunk of hir shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there\u2019s you, resting against hir rubber ballsack, feeling its vibrations as you look up at the impossible mare blocking out all sight of the night sky. Hir green eyes seem to pierce into your very soul; hir green tongue slowly licks hir lips with a prolonged squeal. Hir puffed-up green nipples look absolutely incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, cutie,\u201d Lumie booms, rattling the ground and shattering windows throughout the neighbourhood she so thoroughly looms over. \u201cSeeing as you don\u2019t have a house now, I\u2019ve got an alternative - you can stay with me! Where\u2019d you like to go, cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latex mare indicates two locations with a dainty, slender hand: first, the inside of hir massive canyon of cleavage\u2026 and then, hir gargantuan, throbbing, pulsing shaft. You\u2019re not sure how shi hasn\u2019t cum yet - maybe shi can\u2019t produce any due to being inflatable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the choice is yours, and it only takes a few seconds to decide...</span></div></div>",

You came home one day to find that Patches, your pet cat, didn't run out to greet you and beg loudly for food like he always does. Systematically searching the house, the backyard and even the nearby park you found no hide nor hair of him. After a few days you resigned to putting up posters of him in the hopes somebody found him. Thankfully, someone did. A call early in the night woke you from your slumber on the couch, the dim colors from your TV illuminating your room. Grasping at your phone, you finally hit the answer button and bring it up to your ear. Your drowsiness was quickly replaced with joy when you heard the lady on the phone say the words \"We found your cat\". The lady which worked at a vet halfway across town said that the cat he was identified as yours from the microchip in his neck and she continued to explain that he was found unconscious in an alleyway and made a full recovery at the clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing a cat cage into your car you set out into the night, thankful for the lack of traffic on the otherwise busy roads. A half-hour drive later you arrive. After asking about Patches and being ushered into another office you see your bengal cat sitting patiently on a steel table. When the cat notices you he runs over and rubs against your legs, giving you the opportunity to scoop him up in your arms. \"Oof!\" you blurt out as your adjust him in your arms. \"How does a cat that's gone missing for a week gain weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He's very lucky,\" the vet said, \"As I said over the phone we found him passed out in an alleyway. It was only when a tenant living next to that huge pharmaceutical company was taking out the trash they found him.\" Her face suddenly turned grim. \"I'm not saying it was those Factoreu Lab guys, but a whole bunch of animals have been going missing ever since they showed up.\" Clearing her throat and putting on a smile she pushed a clipboard and paperwork to you. \"Just sign these, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything in order you put Patches into the cat cage you brought and put him in the car and set off for home. On the way back you spot the alley the vet lady was talking about, right next to the pharmaceutical company. Dull lights shined ominously on the side of the rectangular building, illuminating the words '<i>Factoreu Labs. Groundbreaking Medicines and Advancements</i>'. The building seemingly popped up overnight one day catching everyone off guard with its sterile, brutalist design, contrasting  the old surrounding apartments. Shoving thoughts of the lab to the back of your mind you soon arrive back to your house and reintroduce Patches. Pouring him some pellets, you were extremely glad he was found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the time you found it was pretty late so you head to bed, leaving the door open a crack to let Patches come in and sleep on you like he always does. Before long you drift off to sleep, unaware of the changes that were starting to occur to your lovable bengal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stretch as sunlight beams through a crack in the curtains, signalling the start of a new day. On your chest a sleeping Patches lies, stirring awake from your movements. Holding him to your chest as you sit up you can't help but be taken aback by his weight. Holding him in your arms you take the chance to examine him. He seemed normal, though you could swear he was larger  and heavier than the average cat. With a meow Patches snaps you out of your daydreaming. <i>Right, food</i>. Chalking it up to the fact you haven't held him for over a week you just pin the oddity on your overactive imagination. Putting your cat on the floor you you head to the kitchen to get both yourselves some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he first went missing you quickly negotiated an early holiday break from work so you could find Patches. With Patches found, you definitely had to take the chance to be lazy considering you had another whole week of free time before you had to go back. Finishing your breakfast, you grab your phone and head to the living room, fully intent on being a couch potato. It wasn't long before Patches followed, the king of all couch potatoes. As he trotted over you his size caught your attention again. Standing up like that he must be close to 2 feet tall which your phone confirms is bigger than the average height of about 1'3 feet. You throw your phone to the side and turn on the TV as Patches jumps up on the couch with you. You got your cat back, no point in worrying you tell yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch TV for what feels like hours, absentmindedly stroking your purring cat's reddish-brown fur as he sits in your lap. You were about to get up to have a stretch until you noticed a strange shuddering sensation coming from your cat. Your eyes widened, Patches was getting bigger! The weight on your legs increased as the bengal slowly expanded, running out of rooms on your lap and spilling onto the couch to your side. Stunned, you locked eyes with Patches as his green eyes inched closer and closer to yours, the cat being completely unphased about the current predicament. You remember to actually breath when his growth finally stops, heart still drumming. Patches covered most of your legs with his chest, the rest of his body splayed out on the couch. You gulp as you look over his new frame. He no longer resembled your small cute bengal, but more of a huge jungle predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInching out from under him you escape out from under the enormous cat. With the couch to himself Patches stretches out to his full length, taking up most of the space on the three-person couch. \"P-patches?\" you manage to mutter. Patches just gives a small meow in response. <i>Great, at least he is acting normal.</i> What isn't normal however is a cat spontaneously expanding. Grabbing your phone you quickly dial the vet clinic you visited last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rings the receptionist picks up.\"Hello, what can I help you with?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Umm, y-yes...\" You stammer, \"My cat was found by you guys last night and uh, he's been growing.\"<br>\r\n\"Growing?\" she replies, unenthused. \"In what sense?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, this morning he was a little bigger than usual, I didn't think much of it but just now he grew more than a whole foot, even bigger than a large...\" Click. \"Dog.\" She hung up on you. Gritting your teeth you looked over to Patches, resting his massive head on the armrest looking right at you. <i>Yep, still big</i>. While you did sound crazy, it was not your imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you start to dial another vet. And another. And another. None of them believe you. Why would they? Even looking online you found nothing but the odd fictional story of giant animals. While frantically calling people for help on the phone you had measured Patches height when he was standing up, measuring at 3'4 feet tall, almost as large as a tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your options dwindled you gazed over to Patches, sitting on his hind legs in the middle of the living room. You were about to punch in another phone number when you saw him close his eyes and start to shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the cat leisurely stood back up from his stretching pose he opened his eyes and stared right at you. Your heart nearly skipped a beat when Patches took a step towards you, gaining a few inches. Again, another step, a few more inches. You can't help but feel intimidated and begin taking slow steps back as he approached. Eventually you back up against a wall, eyes frozen on the growing cat, his tail twitching from side to side, brushing along the ceiling. On all fours, Patches is currently eye level with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Patches reaches you his growth appears to be slowing down and you find yourself looking up to him. He had essentially doubled in size making him stand at around 6'8 feet.

As you headed home the light started to feign more darker. You walk briskly, reminding slightly of what you would give to have horses in this world again. \"What I would give to have another companion by my side.\" You talked back to yourself, which happened quite often, since there was no living creature living on Earth for millenniums.<br>\r\nYou stopped griping as you ran back to your cabin and hastily opened the door. Seeing the sun was still setting, you lit a candle and placed it on your desk. You set the satchel on your chair and opened to reveal a seemingly old book, yet it couldn't look more than a couple hundred years. \"Impossible.\" You exclaimed. You put the book on the table and carefully read the old English writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><span class=\"cbyellow\">Summoning Spirit Animal</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt plainly said with no signed authorship, as you opened to the introduction. Where it began to illustrate the beginning of this Earth as it was created, a story you should be very familiar. It explained Mother of Nature who was the architect to build this world and assigned it to one individual to take care of as long as it blossomed it's fruit. You smiled with a little self-indulgence as it spoke of you with high honor. This was weird of course since no living mortal man was to know the truth of the eternal plan. That was explained carefully as Mother never wanted anyone to know of Her. You began to remind yourself of the times She was here on Earth, and beauty that She saw in it. Tears fell trying to forget what would later happen with her. However the point was, who could've written this book. You began to think someone was still watching over you, maybe they wanted you to have this book.<br>\r\nYou read on. The Mother later feeling a force of fear of the creatures She created which was the Humans you knew so well, as they were so unrelentingly wicked in their deeds to one another. Heartbroken She fled her Light from Earth and carried out her work other places. You didn't want to read anymore since it was truly a dark time in your life when she left, Earth was just never the same without her. However you continued. She didn't leave the Earth without supervision of course, it began to talk about Her creating Spirit Animals that would watch over the world without Her. With the looks of the pages there were hundreds of creatures that She created, which was a thing you never knew about. Was this book for real? Were they still watching Earth even now? You had to know. You looked through the faded drawings as you tried to tell what they looked like. Some looked like a collection of different animals that had one body. However varying they were, you noticed that they all had one exact same feature, they were all female. It took a while of flipping until you realized that was the case. Even though you had both men and women relationships, you were happy to have a companion after so long.<br>\r\nYou came across one that looked more faded than the rest. You could make out it looked like the top half of a goat with horns, with yellow eyes and red pupils. The bottom half looked like a horse's. The more you tried to make out what the name said and the picture the more you wanted to know what it really looked like. You stood up and picked up the book as you read off the incantation to summon her. As you finished you didn't feel any significance of what you said. You looked around and even checked all around your house and yard, but no sign of a creature besides yourself. A little disappointed you were to tired to be angry. You shut the book and left it on the desk as you blew the candle out. You noticed it was dark and so you made your way to your bed. You lay there wondering maybe in the morning you find a Spirit Animal knocking at your door.</span></div></div>",

Your starter Pokemon had to be at least 25 feet tall now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world suddenly grows dark as Inferno uses his hands to press you against his belly in an enormous hug, his head bowing forward, snorting with happiness as his back reaches the edge of the tree line. You let yourself sink into his swelling form, your finger stuck against the grow button, grinning as you hear the trees creak and groan as they are slowly but surely overpowered by the enormous dragon's rear. You can hear his whole body rumbling and creaking with muffled, organic sounds as it grows and swells against you, Inferno snorting and huffing just behind you. Soon the trees are overwhelmed, snapping at the trunk with loud, sudden cracks or ripping out of the ground by their roots. Inferno releases you as he pulls up to roar in victory, spreading his wings, his voice so deep you feel it reverberate in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fall back onto Inferno's leg in a daze your finger slips from the button and the Charizard shudders to a halt at just over 30 feet, dominating his immediate surroundings. You smile as you enjoy how happy your Pokemon is, growling and huffing with happiness as his huge eyes meet yours again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your snout, on the other hand, shorten almost imperceptibly, while giving your mouth more flexibility, allowing a greater array of emotions, readily doable on an easier mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a last effect, your sense of vision becomes more sharp, as you suddenly manage to notice things and details that you wouldn't be able to tell, especially as your growth turns to an end, making you snap from your trail of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is, you <i>*did*</i> reach the town you had intended to reach, but at a much quicker pace than intended..

Causing you to remember that you had a passenger onto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a good news, your clothing had grown with you, even if your shirt felt tighter, and that two bumps were now visible despite your breasts, where your newly grown nipples had sprouted.. As for the human, you had taken the time to make of some kind of harness to maintain him onto you safely. And while he wasn't strapped to you per say..

You got as close to the black dirt but far enough away from what was traveling along it when you realized what the black dirt was as you scarfed it down it was road the humans like to use this with there vehicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell know you know what was traveling down the road it was a human vehicle, one that was a bit bigger than you were used to be shouldn't be any trouble for you.

You catch up to the vehicle and got half of it down and sent to your stomach before quickly sending the other half down not realizing the screaming and now you were trotting your way over to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take that long made a few minutes and now it looked a bit smaller as now you were 175 feet, but now that made the building easier to tackle. With the first bite you had nothing, but concrete and in a few more there was more it was meat, but not that you were paying much attention to what you were gobbling up. Right now you were about 185 feet and a little more than 1/3 of the building had been eaten and the rest was being eaten faster and faster.

Then looking left you saw one fairly large town and just looking at it made your stomach rumble with excitement and best thing was it was maybe two or three steps at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached the poor town and started. You downed two houses before humans tried to run this making you angry didn't they know there place. You decided to suck up a few before they ran into the biggest building in town. You could eat the building now, but no you decided to use it strategically if the humans felt safe for now you could eat the rest of town. As you put another house you got a mother ideal you should block the entrance of the building with a home before taking it. The rest of town didn't take that long and people had to watch as friends and family went passed your throat of course as the town became the town hall and one other house they realized that after that house they would be next. You felt your self expanding stopping at 270 feet making the task of eat the biggest building easier you put your plan in motion picked up the home and tried not to swallow drool pooling over it and even into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to leave the town hall but you got there before any real number got out those that were pretty far out decided to book it you ignored them for now. Dropping the house right in front of building crushing a few humans not that you cared, there were more inside. There were a \"lucky\" group of humans outside that thought that they made it passed you sight and of course they didn't deciding you hammered them enough you want to play with these a bit before eat the building. You wanted to see how fast humans were with out anything so you started to trot away giving the humans plenty of time at least to you and then you thunder full speed at them with just one hoof you decimated there numbers before there was about 13 now there was only 4 you decided to leave them even though your stomach disagreed but maybe humans could be smart for once it you mind and tell others were they rightly belong in your stomach that was all they were good for now in your eyes.

(The survivor hearing your maw picking up dirt, houses, people, car anything they banged on the door to warn the scientist that were there). (Ok I coming, the scientists open the door and he regretted it as he saw a massive horse digging into a town behind the 4 survivors, and they heard under his stunned slightlece oh dear god what have we done). In only a few more minutes the town was gone, but this time you were making sure no survivors were left and yes none were left and as you got closer to the building you realized what it was the research lab that made you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would miss this place, but then again if you allowed anything out of this place the humans might be able to stop you from growing and your hunger and that wouldn't do. You started to eat and unlike any other time you were growing while eating and not after a bit werid, but it did help in destroying this building as now you were 290 feet big. (Um come on dude the first survivor said she eating the building and I dought if she will let us escape this time as she was pretty pissed at us trying to save people in the town, the scientist shot back if we gave any hope of slowing that thing we created we need this data, but the others got the bright idea to try and leave out the exit that lead to the road a smart plan they thought as you were focused on eating the building and that would hold you and they horribly wrong as \"you saw the frist truck leaving and crushed it underneath your right hoof trapping those unfortunately enough to not be the back of the convoy they found out just how strong you had become as the roof collapsed in killing every one,but those in the last truck and you quite quickly found and did the same to second way out and then getting back to the building\" ok she blocked two of the exits we need to go now another survivor said and this the scientist agreed and lead those who were still alive to the secret exit under ground and to \"safety\"). The last of the building vanished beyond your leathery lips, but you weren't done you started to slam you hoofs into the concrete foundation of the building it also shock the tunnel, but the tunnel didn't collapse and neither did the foundation, but you grew a bit more now 320 feet with more power your hoofs now smashed through the concrete and collapsed some of the tunnel, but the survivors in them knew if you traveled south the might not be survivors for very much longer, but  that won't happen for a few minutes at least as you were digging up the remains of the building foundation and now you were on the search for more food again and you search lead you <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
