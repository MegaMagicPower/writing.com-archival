            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David was walking along in the woods behind his house, sulking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just at home, sitting at the kitchen table, doing his homework, when his brother Wes, and his friends Mark and Josh came home, went downstairs and started lifting weights.  He snuck downstairs after them, stealing glances as they took off their shirts and started working out.  He was envious of them, sure, but couldn't help but be turned on by their muscled bodies, and loved to watch them sweat, Mark especially.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark finished with a set, he sat up and noticed David staring at him, and started laughing.  Wes and Josh then noticed him, and started laughing too.  \"What's the mater, Tiny\", Wes mocked David, \"wish you could lift with the big boys?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid hated when his brother called him 'Tiny.'  He was rather tall for his age, already 5'10\", but he was part of a freakishly tall family, so that didn't help much.  Wes was 6'4\", their dad, Doug, was 6'6\", and even their mom, Gena, stood in at an impressive 6'1\".  He didn't have much muscle, yet, but every day after Wes and his friends would finish, David would sneak in and try lifting too.  He never got anywhere close to the level they were lifting at, and he worried that he never would be able to catch up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this afternoon, David didn't want to face their laughing faces.  Embarrassed, he ran upstairs, grabbed his red windbreaker, and stormed out of the house, slamming the door shut behind him.  He would always go to the woods whenever he wanted to be by himself and clear his mind, and that's where he found himself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate my life,\"  he muttered to himself.  He was holding back tears as he hiked along, and the brisk October wind was stinging his already red cheeks.  \"Why do they have to be so mean?\"  He wondered.  \"Just because they're older and bigger.  I wish there was some way to change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, David's feet got caught up in a gnarled branch in his path, and he tripped and fell face down to the ground.  Frustrated, he let out a yell of pain and anger and pounded the ground with his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sobbing for a few seconds, David then sat up, noticing that he had torn a hole in the knee of his jeans.  \"Dammit!\" he said, \"These were my best pair, too!\"  He checked his knee to see if he was bleeding, and luckily he was not.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a glimpse of light caught his eye, and he turned to the side to see what it was.  Buried halfway in the mud was some kind of pendant.  He brushed it off and picked it up.  It was about the size of a silver dollar, and, though it was coated in dirt, he could see that it was made out of some kind of hard white substance, possibly ivory or an animal's horn.  David could also make out some kind of writing on one side, but it was obscured by the muck.  He shrugged, and put the pendant in his pocket; maybe it was worth something.  \"Who knows,\" he said to himself, \"it might even be my lucky charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly better, David brushed himself off and stood up.  It was starting to get dark, so he decided to head back to his house, before he got lost.  When he returned, Wes and his friends had left, so David decided to head upstairs and take a shower.  As he cleaned the grime and sweat off of his body, the steam cleared his head, and he started to feel better about himself and the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was finished, he towelled himself dry, and then put his jeans back on.  He reached into his pocket, and fingered the pendant he had found.  Curious to see if he could read what was written on it, he brought it to the sink and washed it clean.  He then brought the pendant close to his eye, but the markings did not look at all familliar to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of the sudden, the pendant began to glow a bright, brillant white.  David almost dropped it out of shock, but kept a grip on it.  He shielded his eyes, and watched in amazement as the squiggles that were on the pendant reshaped themselves to form words.  After a few seconds, the pendant stopped glowing, and David brought it up closer to his eyes to inspect it.  This time, he could read the inscription perfectly:  \"Whoever wears this pendant posesses the perfect power given from the depths of the earth.  Whatever he wishes, when he speaks, that will become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's jaw hung open.  He didn't know what was more amazing; what the pendant said or the way it suddenly changed to say it.  He stared at it for a solid minute, trying to comprehend what it said, and secretly hoping something else would happen with the pendant to clarify the situation.  But nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid thought about what he wanted to do now.  He had to show this to somebody.  Two phone calls and twenty minutes later, Sam and Paul, David's two best friends, had arrived and come up to David's room, since he refused to move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, David,\" Paul asked, \"Why are you sitting in your bedroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam said, \"What's so urgent that you couldn't tell us over the phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" David answered.  He pulled the pendant out from his pocket again, and showed it to Sam and Paul.  \"I found it in the woods this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul and Sam read the inscription.  \"...The perfect power?\" Sam said.  \"This is a joke, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  When I found it,\" David said, \"that writing was in some other language.  It changed to English when I cleaned it off, and glowed white, and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul scoffed.  \"Yeah, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, man,\"  David said.  \"I know what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sam said, \"Prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says you can make a wish, or something,\" Sam said  \"Try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" David said, \"I have to be wearing it.  I don't really know how to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that chain necklace you got for Christmas last year?\" Paul asked. \"Can't you put it on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" David said.  He got up and went over to his dresser, and pulled out a box.  In it was a chain necklace, a gift from an eccentric uncle who thought he was hip, but just didn't share David's sense of taste.  David took the necklace out of the box, and held it up to the pendant.  \"But how do I attach it?  There's no hole in the pendant or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pendant began to glow white again.  Sam and Paul turned their eyes away, and when the glowing stopped, the pendant was attached to the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Sam said.  \"How'd ya do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, guys,\" David said, \"This thing is magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put it on!\"  Paul said, \"Try it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid wrapped the necklace around his neck, and clasped it in the back.  It fit perfectly, just the tightest bit snug.  \"Now what?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\"  Sam shrugged.  \"Wish for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid thought for a moment.  He didn't want to begin too big, so he had to wish for something small, but what would it be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wish I was six inches taller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first nothing happened.  David sat there, blankly, starting to grow embarrassed as the seconds ticked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you it was a joke,\"  Sam said.  \"C'mon, Paul, let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to leave, when the pendant suddenly shown bright.  But this time, instead of the light radiating outward, it started to spread through David's body, starting at his chest, where the pendant was resting against his bare skin (he'd never bothered to put a shirt on after the shower).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, David felt frightened, but the spreading light warmed every part of his body, and filled him with pleasure.  He sat down on his bed, closed his eyes, and felt his muscles starting to stretch, and his jeans, the only thing he was wearing besides the necklace, getting tighter.  After about thirty seconds, the light gradually went away, and he opened his eyes back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he asked, \"did it work?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer was given by the stunned faces from both Sam and Paul.  \"Holy crap!\"  Sam exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Paul said, \"David, you're as tall as your brother now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood up, and he could definitely feel a difference now.  He was a good eight inches taller than Paul now, and almost a foot taller than Sam.  He turned around and looked at the full-length mirror in his bedroom.  He noticed that his jeans had started to rip, and the fly had popped open.  Everything had grown in proportion, so his body still was skinny, but he definitely could feel that he weighed more.  \"Let me check something out,\" he said.  He went into the bathroom and stepped on the scale, which read 172 pounds.  The six inches had added almost 30 pounds to his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is freakin' awesome!\" he exclaimed.  \"Wes  will definitely take notice of this!\"  David snuck into his brother's room and searched for some clothes there.  The only clean clothes he could find was a pair of slick, black basketball shorts and a white tank top.  He slipped them on.  They definitely fit, though they were just the slightest bit baggy.  David may have matched his brother in height, but the years of working out and lifting weights had given his brother a much thicker, stronger frame.  If Wes were to come home now, he could still outmuscle David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid went back to his bedroom, where Sam and Paul were waiting for him.  \"David, this is amazing!\" Sam said.  \"It's like you've gone through a year's growth spurt in less than a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" David said, \"but Wes is still a little bigger than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have to be,\" Paul said.  \"You've still got this!\"  He pointed at the pendant, which had also grown slightly with David, still fitting comfortably around his neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right!\"  David said.  \"I could be any size I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what'll it be?\"  Paul asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid thought about it for a moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David thought for a second.  He initially wanted to be huge, but he then realized that he didn't want to outgrow the house, at least not yet.  He decided ten feet would be a good height, the same height as his house's extra tall ceilings.  He quietly wished, \"I want to be ten feet tall.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he spoke, the pendant began to glow, and he could feel his muscles tense and begin to stretch out.  The clothes he was wearing stretched and finally ripped apart, and fell to the ground.  After ten seconds, the deed was done, and he stood in front of Sam and Paul completely naked, with his friends only coming up to his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, that felt great!\" David said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"  Paul said.  \"You're huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sam said, secretly disappointed, \"he could have grown a lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked down at his body.  He was still as skinny as he was before, but everything was now a lot longer and bigger.  He flexed, revealing a little bit of muscle on his arms and pecs, but nothing major.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? Should I go ahead and try to scare Wes like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Paul exclaimed.  \"He'll shit his pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, David formed a plan in his mind.  Wes was out at the gym playing Basketball with Mark and Josh.  He would be home in about a half hour, and the first thing he always did when he got home was to go upstairs and take a shower.  That would be the perfect place to surprise him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying goodbye to Sam and Paul, he quietly walked upstairs, making sure not to be heard by his mother, who was in the kitchen.  He went into the bathroom, leaving the door open halfway behind him.  He climbed into the shower and sat down, filling the tub completely. Looking up, he saw that his head was about four feet from the ceiling.   He decided that it would be even scarier for Wes to see his little brother completely fill the shower, up to the ceiling, and besides, he wanted to experience the thrill of growing again, so he whispered quietly, \"I want to grow till my head touches the ceiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pendant around his neck glowed again, and David felt his muscles begin to burn again and his skin was tingling.  He decided to try to have some fun with the growth, and he breathed in heavily as he grew, pretending he was growing bigger by his own power.  With each breath, he grew another six inches, until finally, he felt his head bump against the ceiling, and the growth stopped.  He looked down at his body.  He was now very cramped; his knees were at his chin, and his ass was wedged tightly in the tub basin.  Normally, this would have been an uncomfortable situation, but David was loving every minute of it.  He leaned back, reveling in his size, and as he did so, he felt his member begin to pulse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have enough room to stretch out and really enjoy himself, but he leaned back and began to fantasize of looming over Wes, having his older brother tremble in fear at his massive size, and having him and Mark and Josh worship him and do what he commanded. And then...  what next?  With this pendant, he had the power of a god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped back to reality when he heard a car door slam outside.  Wes must be home! David quickly pulled shut the shower curtain, trying to be as inconspicuous as a 15-foot tall 14-year old boy with a 2-foot throbbing erection could possibly be.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, he heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and the bathroom door swinging open and then closing.  He heard the sound of pants unzipping and clothes rustling while coming off, and then saw the shadow of a figure before him. This was it!  This was the moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure's hand reached out and pulled open the shower curtain, and David heard a cry of shock come from...</span></div></div>",

At 17, he is a star linebacker for the high school football team, but is also a bit of a goof.  He has a medium-light complexion and short, light-brown hair.  He is very popular at school, and, along with Wes, gives David a hard time over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark is 6' 0\", and has a skinnier, though still impressive frame.  He's 18, and plays soccer at the school, a starter on the same team where David is a reserve.  He has a pale complexion and shaggy, bright red hair.  Though he hangs out with the popular crowd, he is more laid-back and humble.  He actually is more friendly with David than Wes or Josh, and partly because of this, David has developed a major crush on Mark, though, as far as David knows, it is unrequited.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, yeah, again, which of Wes's two friends was it?</span></div></div>",

His skeleton began to crack and stretch outward. His skin expanded, like a balloon as his body expanded upwards. His jeans seamed to burst outwards, revealing his hardening member.His vision passed the second floor, over the house, higher still. Down on the ground, Sam and Paul jumped back to avoid the expanding feet. Finally, he stopped at over ten times his original height. He sat down carefully, not wishing to crush his action figure sized friends. His massive penis bobbed, now five feet tall and not completely erect. Sam and Paul fell over as he sat down, shaking the ground beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grinned down at his tiny friends, who picked themselves up and stared at him in awe. They were so small now, barely over six inches each. Sam grinned back, eager to play with his titan of a friend, both because they were good friends, and because they were both gay. Paul was less eager, averting his gaze from the massive cock.</span></div></div>",

This gave Sam confidence to wrap his arms around the member and start to rub his body up and down. David had a much louder series of moans from this of course and his cock was rapidly hardening to its full length of seven feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this was taking place, Paul was still trying to keep his attention on something else which is easier said than done. Not wanting his good friend to miss out on the fun, David picked Paul up and set his friend on his massive cock along with Sam who was now riding the shaft like a horse. With his cutest face, David begged Paul pleasure him. Though Paul was straight, he didn't want to upset his best friend who also happened to be a sixty-foot giant. After noting that it may not be a good idea to say no to someone who could crush him, he happily obliged. Paul and Sam continued to jack off David 's massive cock with David thrashing around and uttering ear-piercing sounds. Unable to take it any longer, David let out a scream and shot his hot seed into the air only to come raining down all over his friends. Sam had the widest grin on his face of pure enjoyment while Paul looked he was about to vomit and David had a look to match Sam's.</span></div></div>",

I wish you could experience what I just did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pendant started to glow, and David prepared himself to start shrinking, expecting to return to normal size himself and for Sam to be 60 feet tall now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pendant had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't change size.  Instead, Sam started to shoot up rapidly.  Within ten seconds, he had shredded through his clothes and was twenty feet tall, and David had to set him down on the ground.  Ten more seconds passed, and Sam was now nearly as tall as David.  David turned his head to look at Paul, who was standing on David's stomach, and noticed that he was growing too, but not as rapidly as Sam.  He was now passing ten feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned back to look at Sam, and was shocked to see that Sam was now twice David's height, and was continuing to grow fast.  Sam called down to David: \"DAVID, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted up to Sam.  \"I don't know, but it's fuckin' awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's growth continued to accelerate:  200 feet...300 feet...400 feet.  Finally, Sam stopped at an amazing 600 feet tall, exactly ten times taller than David.  David stood up, and only came up to Sam's calves.  He looked up, and saw Sam's massive cock and balls dangling above him, sticking straight out.  He loved what he saw.  Paul stood next to him, also sixty feet tall and naked.  Normally this would be staggering, but standing next to the mega-sized Sam, Paul didn't get to enjoy his size as much as he should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid called up to Sam: \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam responded: \"GREAT!\"  He then looked down and noticed his giant manhood. \"AND HORNY!!\" he bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grinned.  He wanted Sam to experience what he just did, but Sam might have other ideas.</span></div></div>",

Right away, his calves started to inflate and grew from their modest size until they were as big and as round as oranges!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Yeah! Come on!

His legs grew thicker and wider and deeper, practically expanding in every direction! Layers upon layers of muscle piled up on his legs just above the knees, making Sam take notice of his increased weight. Not only that, but he had to stand with his legs spread apart a little more, since his legs had become so thick and wide! They were rubbing up against each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Keep it up, Dave!\" Sam shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, the tingling traveled up his body, and concentrated on his torso. Sam's flat stomach was now a washboard or powerful abdominals, which had formed into a nice series of rows and columns of muscles, which had neatly lined up and covered his stomach like tiles on a kitchen floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the tingling traveled upward and filled out his chest. His pectorals expanded like two mighty balloons, and he instantly ripped out of his thin, cotton t-shirt. His mighty pecs continued to inflate, pushing forward and sideways, almost like Sam now had two large bricks implanted in his chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhhh I'm getting HEAVY!\" Sam groaned. \"But it feels GREAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the tingling traveled up his shoulders and his arms, making him have that thick, powerful look that all bodybuilders crave. His neck and shoulders were broad and thick, with mighty delts, lats, biceps, and triceps covering his arms. Sam had slowly transformed into a big, junior muscle boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YESSS!!!!\" Sam cheered, as he struck the most muscular pose, making fists and flexing every muscle in his fantastic body, before his two best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!

I feel awesome!\u201d Sam grinned, as he flexed his arms. \u201cThat pendant is fantastic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to buff up some of our friends!\u201d David said, as he carefully rubbed the pendant, which was hanging from the necklace around his neck. \u201cI wish the necklace was made of titanium and it could never be removed from my neck by anyone but me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin necklace glowed and was suddenly transformed into a thicker metal chain which hung around David\u2019s neck. David looked down and realize that the pendant was now permanently hung from his neck, giving him the power to change anything and anybody he wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay dudes! Let\u2019s find somebody to change!\u201d David grinned, as he spotted a young boy walking down the opposite side of the street. The kid was probably about eight years old and had short blond hair and blue eyes. He wore shorts and a tank top, showing his thin arms and legs. Dave figured he was probably walking to the playground at the park which was down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! Watch what I\u2019m gonna do to that kid on the other side of the street over there!\u201d David whispered to Sam and Paul. \u201cI\u2019m gonna make him buff up a little!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the kid across the street felt his legs tingle. His calves began to bulge a bit, as they inflated into massive footballs! His biceps swelled to the size of melons and his pectorals quickly pushed out from his chest, until he looked like a junior muscle kid! His chest made his shirt fit tight while his bulging arms and legs made him resemble a young muscle boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! He turned into a muscle kid!\u201d Paul gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave just grinned, as he turned to face his buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the mall after we walk past the park, and have some more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the young boy on the street was gawking at his bulging muscles, wondering where they came from. The boy\u2019s muscles just bulged out of nowhere, leaving him standing there, bigger than a gymnast. The young muscle kid just continued walking, enjoying his increased strength and muscle, even though he had no idea where the muscle had come from\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In his mind, he had always wanted to see his friends larger, especially Sam, who he had a bit of a crush on. He wasn't sure if he'd truly like them being a <i>lot</i> bigger than him or not, so he had decided to start out small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched the figures of both boys begin to inch upward. Paul, being the bigger, stockier friend, had his clothes begin to get tighter first as he neared David's height. His stomach began to peak out from underneath his shirt and his pants' button popped open. Looking down at his body, he was both shocked and thrilled by his new height. \"Mark's never gonna be able to beat me in wrestling again!\" he grinned, thinking about how he now outsized his older brother by over half a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid liked Sam's changes even more. Sam had always been a skinny, kinda lanky kid, a little taller than the rest of their classmates, which David liked about him. Adding on another several inches in height only served to emphasize that lankiness, his long, skinny arms and legs now looking extra-ridiculous sticking out of his shorts and sleeves, while his shirt started to cling snugly to his torso. Looking at Sam's pants, much tighter due to the growth, David noticed that he must've been pretty excited about something happening here as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the growth stopped, David tilted his head up to look at his friends, both of whom were a good head taller than he was. Sam was eyeing both Paul and David, equally as impressed with the height increases. Paul couldn't help but look at his own body, marveling at how much further the ground looked now and how everything seemed to be a little smaller in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Sam said to David with a smirk on his face, \"you're now 'Tiny' again, compared to the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long,\" David beamed, holding the pendant. </span></div></div>",

Then, without warning, all his muscles quickly began to inflate, until he had gained another 30 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh!\" David groaned, as he felt his muscles increased rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! It really works!\" Paul gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's arms thicked as his biceps grew like balloons, which had air blown into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's pectorals suddenly pushed out further and sideways, straining his t-shirt so much, that it started to rip from the collar all the way down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRIIIPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's bursting out of his clothes!\" Sam noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's legs thickened as well, thanks to his widening quads and inflating calves.

The pendant began to glow brightly before David had a chance to utter the words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was four years older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the brief flash of light subsided the three boys were left standing awe struck. David stood before his friends at 6'4\" and with more muscle than he thought possible. He may not have become as built as his brother and his friends, they worked out all the time, but he definitely had some muscle. His clothes were way too small. so he stripped them off. He ended up standing in his room with his friends staring at him in his stretched out underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid noticed that his chest and stomach had a light dusting of hair and his face itched. When he reached up to scratch his face he felt the rugged stubble of manhood. He looked to Paul and Sam in shock. They both had eyes as big as plates and their mouths hung agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do now?\" David asked. \"I can't just walk around the house suddenly four years older and expect my family to be okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sam began. \"You could leave, I guess. I mean, your brother is always mean to you and you could be easily rich with that thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has a point,\" Paul agreed. \"You could have more fun than anybody in the world. And you could be the richest man ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded slowly. His mind beginning to race through options. He needed clothes, he needed to shave, he needed a place to stay, he needed food. He had no idea how to get along without his parents, but he knew that he couldn't just stay, suddenly 18 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will leave,\" David told his two pals. \"I'll leave a note for my mom. I need some clothes and I have GOT to shave. This hair on my face is driving me nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't run around the house like that to get clothes and razors.\" Paul said. \"Me and Sam will sneak into your brother's room to get you that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two younger boys ran out of the room to retrieve what David would need. They weren't long gone before they came crashing in the door, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got it all.\" Paul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, thanks,\" David said. He grabbed the pile of clothes and the razor and shaving cream from his buddies and went to his bathroom. He managed to shave his face without cutting himself. He studied himself in the mirror before grabbing up the clothes and putting them on. His face was more mature, more masculine with a strong jaw. His neck was thicker and his body, though still slim had a muscular definition that could not go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized how uncomfortable he was in the old underwear so he stripped them off. It was hard but he finally got them kicked off. When he stood and saw himself in the mirror his jaw dropped. He was packing now. The instantant that went by for him to finish puberty had done him wonders. With a smile on his face and new ideas cooking in his head he grabbed up the outfit his buddies and gathered for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did really well considering they had no idea David's new sizes. The full AE outfit they had picked out for him fit perfectly. When he stepped out of the bathroom he saw his friends eyes light up. He must have looked pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" David said. \"I'm off to start an adventure.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again, he wasn't sure exactly what to expect. \"Did it work?\" he asked as he opened his eyes, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me,\" Paul shrugged. \"Check your wallet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as Paul suggested, David pulled out his wallet and opened it up. Sure enough, five twenty dollar bills were there that weren't there before. \"Woohoo!\" he cried out half-heartedly. \"I'm rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you now can go down to McDonalds and buy a hundred cheeseburgers,\" Paul deadpanned as he rolled his eyes. \"You know, you could've gotten more money if you just rooted through your mom's purse or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" David sighed, \"I guess it wasn't a very good wish, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Sam smiled as he patted David on the shoulder. \"It's not like there's anything written on the pendant that says you can't use it as many times as you want. And besides, better to start small and make sure it works than go for something big and have it blow up in your face, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" David's eyes lit up, and he stuck out his tongue at Paul. \"Stupid Paul making me doubt myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it, you!\" Paul grinned mischievously as he swiped out his hand at David, missing his face by inches. This caused David to laugh and then tackle Paul, bringing the two of them crashing to the ground. They rolled around on the floor for a bit, playfully wrestling, each one trying to get to a position of dominance. Sam, for his part, started cheering on whichever boy was losing, switching sides when they got the upper hand. He secretly enjoyed seeing his two best friends (and crushes) scramble around on top of each other, but made sure to conceal his growing excitement.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Paul cried as David's fingernails scratched the back of his neck. \"That hurt!... kinda.\" He pushed David off of him and brought his hand to the back of his neck, tenderly testing the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" Sam whistled as he leaned over and examined Paul's neck. \"That looks like it hurt. You'll have a mark there for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bleeding?\" Paul asked, wincing with the slight pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his head. \"Nah, it's dry. Close though; just another millimeter or so and David might've gotten to a vein or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising to his feet, David stuck out his hand and helped Paul up too. \"Gee, I'm sorry,\" he said, looking a little embarrassed. \"I didn't mean to hurt ya. I guess I just got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Paul said, and he shook David's hand in acceptance of the apology. \"Still, it might be time to trim those claws there, tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's eyes lit up wide. \"That's it! That's what I should wish for! Thanks, Paul!\" He started pacing back and forth, excited, his mind racing for how exactly he should word his wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Paul ran his fingers through his hair, unsure of what David was getting at. \"What's it? What'd I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys know that I've always loved tigers and big cats, right?\" David asked, an eager expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Paul looked at each other blankly. \"You have?\" Sam asked, tilting his head slightly. \"I... I don't remember you every saying anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned, rolling his eyes and smacking his palm against his forehead. \"YES! I have! Why do you think I have this poster?\" He walked over to the back wall and gestured up to a large poster he had hanging above his bed of a tiger crouched and hidden in tall reeds of grass, ready to pounce at the right moment. \"In fact, I've always <i>wanted</i> to BE a tiger. Not a real one living out in India or China or whatever, but a human-like one, one that walks around and talks and stuff. Kinda like Hobbes, Calvin's tiger in the comics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooookay...\" Paul said, thinking in the back of his mind about a couple of certain web sites that he had come across accidentally and wondering now if David had visited those sites too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what my wish should be!\" David continued. The other two boys watched apprehensively as David took the pendant in hand. Holding it up, he said in a loud voice, \"I wish I was a tall, anthropomorphic tiger!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe held his breath as he waited for the changes to start occurring. Within seconds, he felt his skin begin to bristle, the thin layer of hair on his arms and legs standing on end. The hairs all started to lengthen and multiply in number, growing thicker and thicker, pretty soon coating the entire surface of his skin with a thin base layer of orange fur. At the same time, his eyes started to grow wider and more cat-like, while his nose and mouth began to protrude, forming a muzzle, his ears sticking out and moving upwards on his scalp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Paul's mouths both dropped open. \"It's actually happening!\" Sam cried out. \"I've never seen anything like it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul barely nodded in agreement, unable to bring himself to comment on what was happening to his friend. Both boys continued to watch as David kept changing, the toothy smile on his face becoming wider and wider. At the moment, he felt a very strange sensation going on in his backside, like his spinal cord was getting longer and pressing against his skin. Turning his head and looking behind him, he saw that a tail was sprouting from the back of his waist. \"That's SOOO cool!\" he cried out. He tried clenching the muscles in that area slightly, giving the tail a little flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David's fur grew thicker, black stripes started to form in a pattern on top of the orange base. But besides everything else, what may have been considered perhaps the most impressive was how big he was getting. At first, he had only started to inch upward, but his shoulders and chest muscles had also started to get wider, with both his arms and legs growing thicker and more powerful. His feet burst out of his shoes, having morphed into large, more oval-shaped white paws with the soles growing soft, fleshy pads. Now that he was looking more and more like an actual tiger, though, his body suddenly started to go through several quick growth spurts, passing six and a half feet, then seven, with a few lurches upward in height and within a few seconds. His clothes stretched out and grew tight on his body, and the button on his shorts popped open as the seams began to tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had reached seven and a half feet, his transformation had completed, and he stood before his friends. He opened his eyes, now yellow, and bared his teeth, which had grown sharper and more fierce-looking. Looking down on his hands-turned-paws, he moved his fingers in and out, starting to retract and un-retract his claws as he did so. Walking over to the full-length mirror, he looked into it only to see a handsome orange, black, and white muzzle looking back at him. He was now a strong-looking, muscular anthro tiger nearly two feet taller than he had been with an athletic build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't believe it!\" he said, taken aback with how amazing he looked and felt. \"This is better than I ever dreamed!\" He spun back around to look at his two friends, who stared back at him in wonder. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them could answer, but the look on both of their faces told him all he needed to know. He was unlike anything they -- or anyone -- had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he finally said, \"since you guys are so impressed, what do you think about me using this thing to make both of you into anthros?\" He held up the pendant, pointing at it with his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly turning their heads to look at each other, Sam and Paul let the next few moments pass without saying anything, trying to come to grips with what had just happened in front of their very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a minute or so of blank stares, Sam opened his mouth. \"Wellllll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh.....\" Paul answered, equally as clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee,\" Sam finally said, considering David's offer, \"What should we do?\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, I trust you guys and all, but maybe it would be fun if I changed myself or you without you realizing it was me doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Paul asked with an annoyed look on his face. \"You just showed us the pendant! If something changed, how would we not know it was you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin crossed David's face. \"Oh, maybe if I do this.\" He thought for a moment, making sure what he was about to say next would be right, then continued. \"I wish that I was the only one who was aware of the power of the pendant, and that any changes I make with it would be accepted as reality by everyone else, unless I say otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis two friends stared at him blankly for a moment, and the pendant began to glow. David noticed, however, that neither Paul nor Sam were looking at the pendant or seemed phased in any way whatsoever. In fact, Paul even yawned, starting to look bored, as the glow faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you're babbling on about,\" Paul said, \"I don't really care. Ya know, it's getting late. I should probably get home and finish my homework for school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam nodded his head in agreement. \"We've got that quiz in Geography tomorrow that I really need to study for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid smiled, trying his best to hide his amusement. If the pendant worked as advertised, he would never need to study or worry about a quiz or test again. For a moment, he thought about wishing that Sam and Paul would stay overnight, or even wishing that tomorrow was a weekend, but he decided to let them go. There would be plenty of time for him to have fun with Sam and Paul later. And besides, he had a bigger goal in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, guys,\" he said after walking down the stairs with his friends and seeing them out the door. He held off on wishing some sort of practical joke onto them as they left, instead waiting until his brother Wes came back with his friends to try out the pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat at the kitchen table as Wes, Mark, and Josh came in. Wes went immediately to the refrigerator and grabbed three bottles of Gatorade, keeping one for himself and throwing the other two guys one each. \"Whew, what a workout,\" he said as he wiped the sweat from his brow. Finally noticing David sitting at the table, Wes turned to him and chuckled. \"What are you doing there, Tiny? Did you get lost and forget where you were going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't answer right away, thinking about what would be the best way to handle this. The possibilities seemed endless. He could shrink Wes and the other guys down, making them literally the \"tines\". He could grow himself up to the ceiling or even bigger, looming over them with his height. There were so many ideas he had, but he quickly realized that his thoughts were turning to revenge awfully quickly. They were enjoyable enough thoughts, sure, but he began to feel a little guilty for having them. Sure, his brother had treated him like crap for as long as he could remember, and he wanted to get back at him for it, but that wasn't the most healthy attitude to have now, was it? Especially having the pendant now and any power it held, David began to realize that if he also had a responsibility, a duty to try to make the world a little better. Sure, he could still have some fun with it, but if he went too far, if he gave in to his darker side... well, there would be no turning back from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helllllo?\" Wes's impatient and slightly annoyed voice interrupted his thoughts. \"Earth to Tiny. Come in, Tiny.\" Mark and Josh chuckled a little as Wes rapped David's head with his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, however, David instantly realized what he should wish for. Looking at the three older boys in the room, he began to smile. \"I wish,\" he said softly, \"that I got along with the three other boys in this room as well as I got along with Sam and Paul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, the look on Wes's face changed, going from one of derision and scorn to a friendly, excited smile. Mark and Josh, too, changed in demeanor, becoming much more relaxed and amenable to David's presence in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, David,\" Wes started, sitting down at the table while he continued to drink his Gatorade, \"you should come work out with us next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid started to beam, amazed at how quickly and how well the wish went into effect. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Mark chimed in, walking over next to David. \"You're always welcome with us. Besides, you could use some muscle on those bones.\" He leaned over and gave David a playful punch on the arm. \"Ya know, if you want.\" He looked into David's eyes and smiled, causing David's heart to skip a beat. Was he imagining things or was there something there?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mark looked back towards Wes and started chatting with him, David couldn't help but drift off a bit in his mind. David had always felt that Mark was one of the hottest boys he had ever met, but since he was friends with Wes, he had always seemed to be, at the very least, a little condescending towards David, which dampened his attractiveness, in David's mind at least. Now, though, if Wes and his friends were destined to get along with David, then that removed that obstacle, and made Mark all that much hotter than before. David had seen Mark plenty of times with his shirt off, but he couldn't help but fantasize about Mark taking off even more, coming up to him, taking him in his arms and kissing him - not just a one-time fling, but a true relationship... his boyfriend. He didn't realize it, but he even began to wish inwardly that this would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of imaginary bliss, he shook it off and opened his eyes again. Looking across the table, though, he realized Mark was staring at him again, but with a more tender look in his eyes. When they made contact, Mark smiled, a hint of suggestiveness around his lips. David couldn't help but chuckle uncomfortably, not sure of what to make of it. Grinning a little wider, Mark subtly winked at him, a tiny gesture which caused David to stop breathing for a few seconds. Was it really happening? Did the pendant allow him to make the wish just through his fantasy? It was all too awesome and unreal to be believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys,\" Wes said to Mark and Josh, \"I think it's about time for you two to get back home. I don't want your parents worrying about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded and stood up, but Mark didn't move right away, still staring straight into David's eyes. After a few seconds, Mark turned to Wes and said, \"Actually, I think I might stay here tonight. My parents don't mind; besides, I've got an early soccer practice tomorrow morning before school, and it's closer from your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWes shrugged. \"Fine then. Josh, need me to give you a lift home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Josh said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Wes picked up his car keys and waved good-bye. \"I'm gonna grab dinner while I'm out.  Should be back in about an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Mark grinned, looking back at David. He continued to stare, waiting until he heard the door slam shut and Wes's car engine start before he stood up and made his way to David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they'd never leave,\" he said as he brought his hand to David's cheek and gently stroked it, a mixture of desire and emotion in his eyes. David felt his cock instantly grow hard at Mark's touch, and his heart nearly jumped up through his throat. Here was one of the hottest boys he had ever laid eyes on, and he was clearly wanting David right now. David didn't quite know how to respond, but he felt his legs, shaky as they were, standing up, drawing his face closer to Mark's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark closed his eyes and gently leaned in to David, bringing their lips together and kissing in a long, passionate kiss. As he did so, his hands moved down to David's hips, and David brought his hands to Mark's. David had fantasized about this moment for several years now, but actually experiencing it was unlike anything he could have imagined - and David knew that this was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they broke off the kiss, Mark looked into David's eyes with a sense of longing and passion. David tried to convey the same feeling, but he was too overwhelmed and amazed to pull it off. Sensing something a little off, Mark cocked his head to the side slightly, a grin forming on his lips. \"What's the matter, Davy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blushed a little at Mark's simple if effective nickname, his eyes falling to the floor. His mind raced through all sorts of different feelings and emotions, and he realized he had to come up with a plausible answer. \"It's just -- I guess I wasn't expecting this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Mark chuckled softly. \"You didn't expect a kiss from your boyfriend? It's not like we haven't done this before. After all, we've been dating for over a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's eyes started to light up a little in surprise, but he was now more in control over his emotions and expressions, and he did his best to nod silently without revealing what was going on in his head. Over a year? So the pendant had not only changed Mark's feelings and attraction towards him, David thought, but also changed his memories so that he thought they had been together for a while. This was certainly an interesting development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" David smiled back into Mark's face. \"You're right. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling broadly, Mark placed his hand on David's head and moved it gently, rustling David's hair. \"Don't worry about it, hon,\" he said. \"This relationship still feels as new as the day we met too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark leaned in again, and they kissed, this time David moving his tongue into Mark's mouth. The exchange was longer this time and every bit as passionate as before, if not more so. Continuing to make out, David could feel Mark's hard cock now poking his stomach. Frankly, it was hard to miss. David had seen glimpses of Mark naked before as he showered or changed clothes at their house, and knew that he was very well endowed. But feeling it press into him made it all the more surreal and exhilarating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to stay in the moment, but he couldn't help but be distracted by the millions of thoughts that were going through his head. If he stepped back from the situation, it seemed a little bit preposterous that a senior like Mark would be dating a freshman, especially for a whole year. David wondered if the wish had changed anything else about the world around them, if anyone else knew about their relationship or if they kept it a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about it more, though, he quickly realized that, with the pendant, he could manipulate the fabric of reality to exactly the way he wanted it to be. The possibilities were literally endless. Maybe, he thought, he could play around with that and have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the kiss ended, and the two boys stared into each other's eyes, a moment that seemed to be an eternity all its own. After a few seconds, however, David asked, \"So, what do you want to do now?\" He had a suggestive look on his eyes, but tried to refrain from using the pendant's powers to influence Mark's decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mark said after a moment's consideration, \"I've got an idea I think you'll like. How about\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, okay, it was more like dragging, but David wasn't about to protest. When they got to the room, Mark quickly shut the door behind them, then immediately started making out with David, pressing his body up against David's and forcing him back against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience was unlike anything David had ever had before, and better than he had dreamed of. Mark's mouth was warm and he was a very active kisser, and as their tongues worked together, David could smell a slight smell of sweat from Mark's recent workout - a noticeable but pleasant musk that made David all the more horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had placed his hands around Mark's neck, but Mark was more adventurous, exploring David's chest and back with his hands while they kissed, eventually finding his way underneath David's shirt, which he soon pulled off over his head. Following suit, David removed Mark's shirt, and the two stared at each other, smiling slightly, before quickly returning to making out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the two found themselves on top of Wes's bed. As they continued to make out, with Mark on top of David, David could feel Mark's hard cock pressing through his gym shorts and into David's stomach. He almost came right then and there, but restrained himself, knowing that he could have more fun if he waited. Especially if he went ahead and used the pendant again. But what should he use it for, he thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Mark then began to kiss his way down to David chest. \"OH Mark\" David cried as he felt his cock stir. His small 6 incher slowly, erotically, began to stretch upwards, expanding into a future monster. David could barely control himself; his growing cock was also making him increasingly horny. He began to grind his hips into Mark. He was passing 8 inches and his balls had grown to the size of golf balls. As if on cue, Mark started massaging David\u2019s growing meat trough his jeans. \"Oh, you like that don't cha?\" Mark teased. David could only bite his lip as Mark moved back up David\u2019s neck. 10 inches now with no end in sight. David briefly wondered how big he would get, before Mark rammed his tongue back down his throat. David was feeling unbelievably horny now, and why wouldn't he be? His cock was passing 12 inches with balls the size of Fiji apples and the hot and horny stud on top of him seemed blissfully unaware of the pulsating shaft now reaching up to his navel. Finally David couldn't take it anymore. He somehow managed to role Mark over so he was on bottom. \"Suck it.\" David commanded. Mark slowly reached up and began to pull off David\u2019s jeans, exposing his 14 inch fuck stick in all its glory. \"You mean this?\" he asked sweetly. \"Why whatever took you so long?\" With that, Mark promptly swallowed the whole thing, going all the way up to David\u2019s massive balls. David began to moan uncontrollably. \"Fuck, oh fuck fuck fuck! That feels so good Mark! Oh suck me good, I'm so close!\" David threw back his head and cried out as he shot a massive orgasm into Mark, who somehow managed to swallow all of it. David then collapsed back onto the bed, exhausted but ecstatic. Mark curled up beside him and slowly ran his strong hands through David\u2019s hair and planted one final kiss on David\u2019s slowly deflating penis before going to get cleaned up.</span></div></div>",

His cock spring back up to full attention, begging for yet another servicing. David smiled as he looked at his brand new cock. 14 inches long, thick as a beer can, and paired with soft ball sized nuts. However looking at the rest of his scrawny 14 year old body, he realized that he look ridiculous. \"There has to be a way to fix this.\" he thought, his mind turning to the medallion. Looking for it, he realized that he left it in the kitchen when Mark dragged him upstairs. He tried to get up, but every movement made his dick sway erotically. \"This is gonna be fun. All I have to do is go downstairs with a comically oversized cock and overactive sex drive that seems to activate when I move, simple.\" He heard water start running in Wes's and his shared bathroom. \"Mark must be showering, I've gotta be quick.\" David forced himself up, doing his best to ignore the deep urge to start jacking himself, and struggled to make his way downstairs before Mark got out of the shower. \"Have there always been so many steps?\" David asked himself. Each time he stepped down, his dick bounced up. \"I'm gonna have to turn down this new sex drive.\" He thought as he made his way into the kitchen. Spying the medallion on the counter, he hurried over to try and fix this mess. \"I wish I wasn't so horny all the time.\" David felt his cock begin to deflate, still big just not so horny. \"That's better\" sighed David \"Now for the rest of me.\" He thought about giving himself three more years so he could be that same age as Mark but he quickly rebuffed that idea, he liked his friends and didn't want to lose them. He then thought about how hot Mark was, with all his muscles in just the right places. He really liked that idea; there was just something super sexy about it. But then David saw that his brother had left the TV on and it was showing a commercial for Calvin Kline underwear. \"Bingo\" thought David. \"Just enough muscle to be irresistible but not enough to be freakish. I'll save that for later.\" Grasping the medallion, David made his wish. \"I wish that I had the body of an underwear model\" David felt his whole body start to shake. He watched as muscles began pushing out from his pale 14 year old body. His biceps went first, puffing up to a sensual 19 inches while his back and shoulders widened and became more angular. His abs started to get major definition, developing into a beautifully chiseled 6 pack that would make any man drool. His pecs plumped up till it looked like each one was implanted with a brick under his skin. His ass ballooned into a magnificent bubble butt, perfect for stuffing the back side of some sexy underwear. Finally his legs became shapelier, more defined as though he'd spent his last 6 years running track. As he regained control of his body David noticed that while it turned the rest of him into a model, the medallion had left him the porn star equipment dangling between his legs. David smiled, it was perfect. He reentered Wes's room just as Mark was coming out of the shower, his hair still glistening with water. He flashed a smile at David that made his knees buckle. \"You,\" Mark said as he pulled David into an embrace, slowly tracing his new muscles with his hands \"Are almost impossibly hot. How did I get so lucky?\" David smiled and gave Mark a long, sweet kiss, his tongue searching Marks throat for his tonsils. David\u2019s member perked up again. \"Shit, I forgot to remove the kissing wish.\" Before David could react, Mark pushed him to the bed and jumped on top of him, rolling around and making out as forcibly as he could. David groaned as his cock began to grow, he wanted to use his fuck stick so bad. He managed to regain enough composure to whisper in Marks ear. \"Give me your ass.\" Mark jumped up and flattened himself against the door. \"It's all yours.\" Without a second of hesitation, David plunged his now 15 incher into Marks supple ass. He thrust in and out and covered Marks back and neck in kisses, each kiss causing his cock to grow bigger. He could only imagine what Mark was thinking, feeling his member grow 3 solid inches while lodged inside his ass. He could hear Marks groan and squeals but paid them no mind, he was lost in europha. </span></div></div>",

He found himself absorbed by their embrace, sucking his thoughts from him like a whirlpool. It wasn't even a minute, but it felt like ages before their lips finally parted, David finally remembering to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark,\" David gasped softly, his eyes closed. Mark could only grunt a \"Mmm?\" to reply; with the kiss broken, his tongue was slowly moving south, now washing David's neck in saliva. David himself was in a haze of ecstasy, the roaring rush of making out surging through his body. He was only barely aware of what he was saying, and not at all of the pendant still around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark... you're amazing. You're perfect. I just wish there was more of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stopped kissing David's pectorals to look at David and smile, while the pendant he couldn't notice glowed. \"Sorry, Davey... you'll just have to make do.\" Just like that, David became aware now of another set of arms embracing him from behind. Another bulging torso was lightly pressing against his back, the weight of another head planting kisses just under his ear. He didn't have time to articulate his puzzlement or alarm before he heard Mark's voice whisper smoothlyover his shoulder, \"Besides.. two should be plenty. It's more than most other people get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's heart rate doubled as he swallowed his surprise and excitement, instead just broadening his grin and to match Mark's and giggling a little. Getting caught by his ideal partner- <i>partners,</i> now- from both the back and the front was a thrill he hadn't been expecting, but was hardly going to complain about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening wore on, in a stream of groping fingers and eager libidos. The Marks finally got around to removing David's pants and underwear, his dick bouncing into attention to an intrigued whoop from the Mark in front. A hand glided gently down its shaft, then back up , then down again. David had to strain himself to not release, even as he sat in the lap of his lover who was completely surrounding him.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Davey,\" the Mark behind him cooed tauntingly. \"Just a little more...\"<br>\r\n<i>No,</i> Davey thought to himself. <i>Not yet, let it last...</i><br>\r\nThen the hand released its throbbing prisoner, and David watched as front-Mark bent down, slowly, leisurely... and planted a warm, soothing kiss on his head.<br>\r\nIt was too much. David felt his body disobey him, build, build, then release in one fantastic geyser.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nBy the time they were done, they'd all been satisfied, and were laying together in one softly panting huddle on Wes's bed. David was in the middle, flanked on either side by Mark. David couldn't believe his luck; a day ago, Mark would've been right behind Wes to make fun of him. Now he was here in his arms, everything he'd hoped for and more... and with this pendant, it was just the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... any idea on how we explain to your brother the mess we made in here?\" The Mark on David's left mentioned, eyeing the cum-stains all over Wes's bedsheets. \"I don't think he's gonna thank us for those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hey- you guys work on that, I'm going to get us some dinner,\" The Mark on David's left replied. He got up and started donning his clothes. David thought that there should only be the one set, considering, but a third pile of clothing identical to the first Mark's was lying on the ground in wait. Neither Mark questioned it- to them, it had been there since they'd all stripped for the bed- so David didn't think about it any further, either. After that Mark left the room and went downstairs, the Mark in his arms got up as well. \"Well, come on, Dave,\" he said with a sigh. \"We should at least get these sheets in the laundry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've got a better idea,</i> David thought with a smile. Then he whispered, \"I wish we had no mess to clean up from our make-out.\"<br>\r\nThe stains evaporated. Mark blinked, then smiled, oblivious to the mess that wasn't.<br>\r\n<i>Eat your heart out, causality.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on,\" Mark said, after getting his pants on and grabbing his shirt. \"We've got pizza downstairs in a few minutes. Don't want it to get cold.\" He planted another smack on David's cheek while he were getting his jeans and jogged out the door. David was all-too-ready to join them, when a thought struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a sec, David realized. The other Mark just said he was going to make some dinner. He never said what he was getting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David had always had a major crush on Mark, but he'd always thought he was too small for him. And besides, as far as he knew, Mark was as straight as the barbells he lifted. \"But I can change all that\" David thought. He decided to start on his first problem, leaving the problem of Marks sexuality for later. \"I wish time would stop and I would grow 300lbs of rock solid muscle.\" David felt heat pulsate through his body. His frame stretched to make room for his new muscles, stopping at a comfortable 7 feet. Next, his body began to inflate like a balloon. His once stick figure arms expanded, growing biceps the size of fresh melons and shoulders that could easily be mistaken for cannon balls. Next, his back and shoulders widened, turning his back into something that looked like a road map of Colorado. \"I guess I go through doors sideways now.\" David thought, chuckling inwardly. His pecs began to push out from his growing frame, taking on the appearance of massive, meaty pillows with large, firm nipples dangling straight down from each one. David could no longer see below them, but he felt each one of his abs pop out from his previously flat stomach, turning it into a chisled 8 pack. His ass firmed and rounded into somthing that would make almost any gay man cream his pants. Finally his legs began to fill out, turning into tree trunks that would probably enable him to run a mile in a minute or less. As the pulsating heat subsided, David ran his hands over his new, better body. \"This is amazing!\" Thought David, flexing a bicep that was covered in a road map of veins. \"I feel so strong, so powerful, like I could curl a car!\" Thinking about it, David realized that his brother's Taurus was parked in the driveway, perfect! David walked outside, getting used to the feeling of so much muscle. He put one hand underneath his brothers\u2019 car and managed to lift it as high as his pecs before he had to use his other hand to get it up over his head. \"So I can't quite curl the car, but it's a good workout.\" David laughed. Suddenly he became aware of something sticking out in front of his pecs. His manhood had grown too! \"This just gets better and better\" he cried \"This thing has to be at least a foot and a half to get out from under my pecs, probably longer by the looks of it. But how am I gonna hide this in public?\" David made a mental note to measure it later and walked back into the house. \"I wish I had cloths that would fit me.\" Suddenly, a t-shirt, briefs, sweet pants, and a pair of flip flops. Walking back into the kitchen, David realized that time was still frozen. \"I wish time would unfreeze.\" David said aloud. With a snap time began again with no indication anything was different. \"Man David\" Said Josh, \"Why did you have to be blessed with genetics while the rest of us are stuck like this?\" \"I think you look just fine.\" David replied \"You're a lot bigger than most guys your age.\" \"Yeah, but nowhere near as big as you\" Mark noted, running his eyes all over David\u2019s sculpted body. \"Hey Wes, can you help me with my essay for English?\" asked Josh \"Sure, let\u2019s use the computer in my room\" As Wes and Josh moved upstairs, David was left alone with Mark. \"So you guys really think I'm that big?\" Asked David, bouncing his pecs. \"Are you kidding? I would love to have a rack like you!\" Mark exclaimed. He laid his hand on top of David\u2019s. \"So, big and strong. Big everywhere.\" David gulped \"You really like it?\" \"I love it, stud\" Mark stood on his tiptoes and managed to give David a long, wet kiss. David's knees almost buckled. \"I thought you only slept with girls.\" David managed to say. \"I do, but that's only for appearances. Every time I'm banging a girl, I'm thinking of you and your huge, sexy muscles.\" Mark pulled David in for another kiss, longer this time. \"What\u2019s say you and me leave those two alone for a while. Mom and Dad have a house on the lake that they never go to.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive to the lake seemed to David like it was never going to end. It didn't help that everytime they stoped at a red light, Mark would reach down and begin stroking and massaging Davids new member trough his sweatpants. It was all David could do to keep from coming on the drive up, knowing that if he held out his reward would be unlike anything in his wildest dreams. Mark seamed to relize just how hard David was, and constently teased him by alternating between his fuck stick and his prominately displayed nipples that poked through the fabric of his shirt. By the time they got to Marks lake house, Davids sweatpants were fighting a loosing battle with his moster hard on and David was desperate for a release. After some dificulty, David managed to squeze his muscles trough the front door and into the living room of the house. \"Marks parents obvously spent some serious dough on this place.\" Observed David. The lake house was a large three bedroom, three bath with a huge wrap around porch directly over the lake. With 15 foot ceilings and no neighbors for miles, it was the perfict place for a muscle stud like David to be serviced by a willing partener in complete privicey. \"This way sexy.\" Mark motioned, leading David to the large master bedroom. Mark pulled off his shirt, revieling his own well defined body, and then began doing the same to David. \"Here, let me help you with that.\" David growled sexualy, ripping his skin tight shirt to shreds to expose his massive muscles. Mark put a hand on Davids superhuman pecs, gentally massaging them and flicking his over sensitive nipples. David moaned, fuck he was horny. His foot an a half hard on had already popped his too tight breifs and was now straining dangerously at his skin tight sweatpants, somthing that didn't go unnoticed by Mark. Mark smiled, placing both hands on Davids shaft and used it to hoist himself up over Davids pecs, enableing him to begin to make out with his horny muscle stud. That only drove David further into a frenzy. He threw Mark onto the king size bed and with one mighty hand ripped the boys pants off, exposing his own respectable 11 incher. \"Fuck you're sexy.\" David said, slowly dragging the remaines of his sweatpants over his massively oversized cock and balls untill all that remained was the medalion around his neck, burried somewhere in his cleavage. \"Do me, drive that sucker all the way home.\" Mark said, as David slowly moved onto the bed beside Mark. Davids dick bobed wildly, slaping his abs with suck force it flung his pre into Davids gloious cleavage. Laying on his back, David picked the smaller man up off the bed, positioning his ass right above his throbing cock. With one mighty thrush from his hips, he drove his cock deep into Marks fuckable ass. \"Yes, yes, yes!! Fuck you you big horny muscle fucker! Harder, harder, give me all you got!\" Happy to oblige, David thrush the remaider of his cock into Marks ass, his pelvis bucking uncontrolably. Mark was in complete heaven, this was the greatest fuck he had ever or would ever recive. With a mighty roar that shook the windows, Davids balls churned a massive load into the smaller man. He sprayed so much that Mark couldn't take it and cum blasted out his ass and all over Davids abs and legs. After the torential flow stopped, David pulled Mark of his cock which left his ass with a resounding pop. He then turned his atention to Marks own member, throbing and begging to cum. \"Looks like you've got a little problem here, what say we fix that?\" Mark was in no room to protest even if he wanted to. David placed Mark on his cum soaked abs and positioned his member in between Davids pec pillows. \"I've always wanted to try this\" Mark gasped. David grined and slowly began flexing his pecs, giving Mark the pec fucking of a life time. After the explosive sex he'd just recived, it wasn't long before Mark shot his load up into Davids pecs and all over his face. David began licking the cum off of himself. \"Oh that tastes good\" he told Mark. \"All full of sex and protien. How about you and I go and get cleaned up?\" Mark nodded weakly, and David picked up his worn out lover and carried him into the large walk in shower in the master bathroom. As soon as the jets of water hit them, Mark was up against the wall being pounded for a secound time by Davids monster. David couldn't controle himself, he was so incredibly horny. It was almost as if his cock didn't want to get soft. Not that either boy was complaining. 6 hours and 4 \"showers\" later, the two lovers finally managed to pull out of their cycle of lust and fall into bed. David in the nude of coarse, his mamoth cock draped over one leg, and Mark in a pair of boxers, draped over Davids pecs.</span></div></div>",

David decided to let him sleep for a few more minutes before slowly bouncing his pecs to wake him. \"I was so afraid I'd wake up and none of this would have happened\" Mark told David, sliding his hands over the young muscle stud. \"Oh it happened, and I think I still have some of your seed in between my pecs to prove it.\" \"That almost sounds like a challenge.\" Mark said slyly, moving his hands down into David\u2019s cleavage. David laughed as Marks hand slowly explored the chasm between his oversized pectorals. \"Well, nothing of mine.\" Mark said as he pulled the medallion from its hiding place \"But I did find this.\" Oh crap, think fast David. \"It's my uh good luck charm. For when I feel like I could use some extra luck.\" \"Why would you need any help with luck?\" Mark asked \"Seems to me that you've got just about all the luck you need.\" \"You're right, it's silly. I just sometimes forget I'm wearing it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually flexed his bicep, hoping to distract Mark. Thankfully as soon as he saw David's muscle, Mark seemed to forget the conversation and moved straight into worship mode. As he began to run his hands over the veiny arm, David's morning wood decided to kick in. Shortly before the third shower last night, David had had Mark measure his cock. They found it was an astounding 26 inches long hard, over two full feet! They didn't know how big he was soft because by the time he got soft, both of them were fast asleep. Mark was kissing David\u2019s arm when he saw the monster had awakened. He slowly moved down to David\u2019s beautiful organ when David started bouncing his pecs. He laughed as he watched Mark struggle to decide between David\u2019s cock and his muscles. \"Ugh, you're making this to hard David! I would be a whole lot easier to play with you if there were two of me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, David saw that Mark was still clutching the medallion; witch threw out a blinding white light. When the light subsided and David opened his eyes he saw an identical version of Mark, who David seemed to automatically know was named Clark, sitting on his abs. Mark seemed not to notice anything was different and began to slowly caress David\u2019s muscles while Clark started to stroke his hardening shaft. Mark then proceeded to make out with David as Clark started to suck his now fully hard cock. \"This could work\" David thought to himself, \"While I love Mark, he can't service all of me. I can always wish away Clark later.\" He felt his body shudder as the twins slowly pushed him towards climax. Mark suddenly stopped kissing him as Clark removed his mouth from David\u2019s penis and the two of them rolled the unresisting David onto his side. Clark then positioned himself behind him while Mark began to deep throat his cock. David moaned as the twins went in and out in perfect rhythm, as if they'd been doing this for years. With two of them working at it, it wasn't long before David shot his load down Marks throat at the same time as Clark shot his load up David\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's gonna relieve that pesky morning wood.\" David told the boys as they both took turns making out with David and each other. It was one of the hottest things David had ever seen. He had always considered Mark the hottest person he'd ever met and now he was watching two of him making out with each other. He watched the two slowly graduate from kissing to fucking, all the while keeping both hands firmly on his own cock. It was only after all three of them came that David noticed Clark slowly starting to fade until he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he served his purpose.\" David said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who baby? Surly you don't mean me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're still my perfect boyfriend. Too bad we have to go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we don't, people are gonna start to wonder what happened to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the clock, 11:18. \"If we leave at noon we can be back home by 2, we can say we went fishing\" \"Sounds good enough for me.\" Said Mark as he rolled off of David and headed for the shower.</span></div></div>",

We can sneak back up here whenever possible but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut in the mean time we\u2019ll just have to be quiet about this.\u201d David finished.

The drive back was noticeably more subdued. David noticed that Mark spent more time looking at the road then at him and at red lights he would no longer stroke David\u2019s cock, although he would still occasionally play with his nipples from time to time. Finally they pulled into David\u2019s driveway; Mark parked his truck behind Wes\u2019s Taurus and started to climb out. David pulled him back in and caressed his face.<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you stay a little longer? Come on, one last kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYou know we can\u2019t baby.

David sat in the cab for a minute more. Fuck this was going to be hard.</span></div></div>",

He had a loving family, good home, was fairly good-looking, and in good physical shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all that, however, Mark felt like something was missing from his life.  He got his fair share of looks from the opposite sex, but he always wanted to stand out more and feel special.  Sure, having red hair made him a little bit different than all the blond and brown-haired boys at his high school, but it wasn't really enough for him - he wanted to be so special that every girl would want him and every boy would want to be him.  But he could never really define exactly what that trait would be, or how he could develop it, so he flitted from idea to idea, always trying to come up with something new to fill the void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could get some new clothes,\" he thought.  \"From one of those weird shops downtown...perhaps something vintage.  That would be different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark hopped in his Jetta and drove to the older part of downtown, where most of the shops funky boutiques with old clothes and jewelry.  He parked his car along the street and headed into the first one he came to called \"Bunker's Landing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was a bit musty, but it was filled to the rafters with vintage clothes.  He looked around to see what he could find, and the shopkeeper assisted him while he looked, but unfortunately they had nothing in his size.  \"Most men back in the 40s and 50s were not quite as strapping as you, lad, so I'm afraid there's nothing here that will fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark thanked the older gentleman and was headed out of the store when he spotted a strange pendant on a chain in one of the displays.  It reflected the light so much that it almost appeared to be glowing, and Mark really liked the masculine design - it was silver with the etching of what appeared to be a very burly Viking on it.  The Viking was raising his well-muscled arm up to the heavens while standing on a pile of coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much,\" he asked while pointing in out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper replied, \"For that old thing?  It's been here since I took the place over, and I have never been able to sell it.  Ten bucks and it's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark quickly paid and put the pendant and chain around his neck.  He felt a warmth and a presence once he put it on, and was immediately glad he made the purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went to some of the other shops, but still not finding any clothes, gave up on his quest and decided to stop at the mall instead and hit the food court for lunch.  He got his usual meal from McDonald's and was watching the other shoppers when he saw Kristi Darrington and her friends walk by.  Kristi was the hottest girl in school in Mark's opinion, with her shapely athletic build, blonde hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too be she's dating that prick, Brock Stevens,\" thought Mark.  \"I wonder what it is about Big Brock that she finds attractive?  Well, whatever it is, I wish I had it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new pendant began to glow and suddenly Mark started to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His skin tingled, vibrating with some sort of mysterious energy, and his muscles started to feel tense, like in the middle of lifting weights or something. The fabric of his clothes pressed against his skin, gradually growing tighter as the seconds passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--?\" Mark exclaimed aloud in astonishment as he looked down at his body. \"Am I growing -- taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed he was. Thirty seconds had passed since the pendant started to glow, and already he seemed like he was significantly taller. He looked around the food court in a panic, but everyone seemed to be going about their business normally -- no one else noticed the changes he was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute after he had started growing, the tingling sensations had died down, and Mark's body seemed to cease its sudden spurt of growth. His polo shirt had become untucked from his jeans, and had gone from being rather loose to practically form-fitting, showcasing the slender, athletic outline of his chest and stomach, while the sleeves appeared to be about to rip, and barely approached touching his biceps. If he were to guess, he would have said he had grown perhaps a foot taller practically instantaneously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat on earth could have caused something like this, Mark wondered? \"The pendant!\" he whispered aloud as he fingered the still-glowing piece of metal. Of course! It seemed implausible, or at least too good to be true, but someway, some how, the pendant he had just bought must have been enchanted, and allowed him to -- well, what exactly? Granted his wish? Read his inner desire? Changed things on its own terms? And why was nobody else reacting to him suddenly growing right in plain sight, in the middle of the mall. Whatever the case, it seemed to be working out well for Mark so far, so he decided to keep the pendant on and hoped it would continue to bring him more pleasant surprises. </span></div></div>",

Suddenly he noticed the waist of his ruined jeans began getting tighter &amp; tighter as it seemed like he was being pushed away from the sink so he looked down. When he did he saw he no longer could see his 6 pack abs &amp; he had a gut that was expanding by the minute pushing his shirt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then his gut got to big for the waist of his jeans as they burst open &amp; the zipper was forced down to accomadate his large gut. His shirt was straining to contain his large lovehandles &amp; gut but had now ridden up exposing it. Then his chest &amp; shoulders widened &amp; exploded in muscle &amp; size completely ripping his shirt in half down the front. Even his back widened with muscle ripping the shirt down the back to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his arms exploded &amp; grew to what he guessed was 24 inches as his sleeves could no longer contain them. Lastly his neck &amp; face thickened &amp; became fuller. Then the transformation was over. He was now literally the same size as the offensive lineman Brock. Mark looked at his reflection &amp; said, \"if I had brown hair instead of blond hair I could pass for being Brock's twin brother. People would think I'm Brock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then said, \"I wish my shoes &amp; clothes would grow to fit the new me.\" The pendant glowed again as his clothes repaired them selves &amp; grew to fit his larger body perfectly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ken and Omair had been best friends since the beginning of freshman year of high school, when Ken's family moved to the United States.  They were in the same homeroom that year, Ken having been promoted a year due to his accelerated studies in Japan, and Omair, being able to speak a little Japanese, was eager to welcome Ken, and learn about his culture.  Ken was shy at first, but meeting someone who actually spoke Japanese helped him blossom, and the two quickly became inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been an excellent swimmer in Japan, Ken joined the swim team at his high school right away. Omair would always come to his meets, not only to support his friend, but, secretly, because he liked seeing Ken in his speedo.  He had a great body: skinny, with muscles in all the right places.  Ken never questioned Omair's secret motives, and Omair was too nervous to make any advances, even after two years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, during the fall of their Junior year, Omair came over to Ken's house after a meet, as he often did.  Omair would help Ken on his english homework, the only subject where Ken wasn't getting straight A's.  Afterwards, they would often play video games.  They were both very good at Dance Dance Revolution, and they would often compete viciously against each other in this, but all in good fun, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this day, Omair was interested in doing something else.  \"Why don't we explore your house?\"  he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's there to explore?\"  Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Omair said.  \"Don't you have an attic or basement or something? Those are always fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ken thought for a moment.  \"We don't have a basement in this house.  I guess there's an attic, but I don't think we've ever been up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"  Omair said.  \"All the more reason for us to explore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ventured upstairs and found the place in the ceiling that had the ladder to the attic.  Ken blew the dust and pulled down the ladder.  As there was no lights on in the attic, Ken had to find a flashlight, and shown it into the dark as they climbed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" Omair said, half-mockingly.  \"This is scary!  You'll protect me from the monster in here, right, Ken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monster?\"  Ken asked, not realizing that Omair was joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, never mind,\"  Omair said.  \"Just keep moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of boxes in the attic.  Ken shown his light on them, reading the labels:  Magazines, books, candles, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These boxes must have been left here by the last owners of the house,\" Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's all junk,\"  Omair said.  \"Keep going, there's got to be something interesting in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ken's light fell upon what looked to be a very old chest.  \"Oooh!\"  Omair said. \"Look at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached it.  The chest was very ornate; each corner of it had very detailed decorations that appeared to be hand-carved into the wood.  Ken opened up the chest.  Inside was empty, except for one thing; a pendant attached to a chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's kind of disappointing,\"  Omair said.  \"I kind of thought we would find some treasure, or a dead body, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen picked up the chain.  \"It's very pretty, though,\"  he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\"  Omair said.  \"Put it on!\"  Ken did so.  The chain fit perfectly. \"Wow,\"  Omair said, \"it looks good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen nodded.  He liked having it on; something inside him even started to feel good with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look!\"  Omair pointed to the chest.  \"There's a piece of paper in there!\" He picked it up.  On the paper, a message was scribbled across.  Omair read it aloud:  \"Whoever finds this pendant, please be responsible!  For with it, you have the power to grant any dream you may have.  Signed, M. Worthington.\"  Omair looked up from the paper, with a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think that means?\"  Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.  Maybe, you can, like, wish for things, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen laughed.  \"I think you've been watching too many movies, Omair.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, try it out!  Wish for something absurd!  It couldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\"  Ken said, \"but only to humor you.\"  Ken took a deep breath, mockingly dramatic, and made his wish:</span></div></div>",

It was all in jest until Omair took an accidental elbow to the jaw, and then  he threw himself onto Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few punches later and the boys sat up breathing heavily, sweat beading across their brows.  Ken gripped is chest and felt a pain begin to spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you can really be a jerk sometimes, I tell you stuff I don't tell anyone else and make fun of me.\"  Omair said sternly.  Ken continued to grip his chest, and the amulet began to glow dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omair...something, somethings wrong.\"  Ken squeaked in a panicked voice.  Suddenly he flung backwards straight as a board, his pelvis and chest alternating convulsions.  Omair straddled him and tried to hold his spasming shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken! Ken, whats happening man?!\"  Omair shouted, but Ken was now gritting his teeth in pain, unable to answer.  It was then that Omair noticed his friends lithe body swelling like a balloon. With each convulsion Ken seemed to inflate a bit more.  His shoulders blimping outward, turning into massive boulders.  His chest fattening with huge heavy mass.  Ken's arms plumping up, until each one was thicker than his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" was all Omair could say as he saw Ken's once tight abs develop into a thick column of round bumps extending to his ballooning thighs.  Legs so thick they must've been wider than Ken's previous waist size.  Even though the angle was bad, Omair even noticed the once cute small butt Ken sported turning into a gigantic mound of bubbly muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of moments it was over.  The golden glow of the amulet faded and Ken could feel his freedom of movement return.  He had difficulty moving around, now that his short frame was carrying so much more weight, but he rocked back and forth till he could stand.  Ken forced the speechless Omair off of him, and stood for the first time, feeling the weight of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy, holy crap Omair...what, what happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen ran to a covered vanity mirror that his parents had stored in the attic and threw back the sheets covering it.  He gasped.  There in the mirror stood a 5'7\" muscle pup, with a  body so ripe with bulbous muscle it looked like it was ready to pop.  Ken no longer saw the athletic swimmer, in the mirror was a big wrestler type, a 190 pound stud.  Ken's panic turned to pleasure, the new weight felt good.  Very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair continued to stare.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His once loose cloths now tight and formfitting.  He felt amazing and powerful.  The energy rushing through him was an immense high and he sighed in ecstasy as his hands wandered over his muscular and supple ridges.  He wasn't tight like a competative bodybuilder, but close.  With a soft pliable layer of fat that made his body look fuller, sexier, Omair's ultimate wet dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken, buddy, you ok, wow man...you, you look...hell you look amazing!\"  Omair stood next to Ken admiring the stunning physique next to him.  Ken was practically glowing with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omair, dude, this is amazing!\"  Ken said gripping his dense arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow man, I can't believe that thing worked!  The amulet actually worked!\"  Omair excitedly patted his buddy on his swollen back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen noticed how tight his cloths had become, and although he hadn't grown taller at all, his shirt now rose above his belly button.  The sleeves stretched up into his armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't hurt?  You looked like you were in a lot of pain.\"  Omair asked inquisitively, taking a glance at the mound of flesh filling the tight seat of Ken's jeans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  My god Omair it's amazing, I wish I could do it again!\"  Ken paused realizing what he just said, and the two boys stopped and glanced at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken?\" Omair raised an eyebrow and took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was then rocked with another wave of power as the amulet began to glow again.  It threw him to the floor in what appeared to be agony, once more Ken gripping his now expanding chest.  Omair watched on, his concerned look changing into hedonistic desire as he watched his friends body morph even more into his wildest fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen lay prone, though this time moaned softly as he felt himself swell even more.  His pecs inflated till each one pushed high out from his chest, so full they pressed against each other and hung like round sacks of flour.  His shoulders expanded to immense proportions tearing through the already strained sleeves, and his thickening back helped to rip the rest of his shirt right off his ballooning torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's legs also exploded with size.  His hams and quads vying for space as they expanded obscenely, tearing through his skin tight jeans.  Each one had to be at least the size of his waist now, if not larger, and the sexy bubble of a butt he had a moment ago was now a huge ghetto rump that jutted up and out, wide and muscular seemingly defying gravity.  His calves fattened as well, as they formed massive diamonds of muscle as think as his enormous forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Ken's arms had grown huge too.  His biceps and triceps competing for space as they were pushed away from his body by his thickening lats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, in moments the transformation was finished.  Ken could barely stand, his massively bloated muscle body so compact and thick that it constricted movement.  As he stood, the rest of Ken's clothes tore away leaving him in a pair of tight briefs that barely held around his bulbous bubble ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair saw in front of him the hottest asian muscle stud ever.  Massive broad shoulders that formed a V shape to Ken's thick but narrow waist,  and the sexiest curves down his back and over the most gorgeous and impossible bubble butt he'd ever seen.  Ken stood marveling at his massive bodybuilder body, and could see that Omair was becoming more than a little excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen felt amazing being as massive as he was and having such an the effect on his friend.  He grew excited too, and the tight confines of his strained briefs soon filled to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen plotted another wish.</span></div></div>",

The bottom of the shirt continued to rise higher, inch by inch, and his jeans were starting to tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Ken said, \"it worked!  Omair, you're growing huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair was now about 8 feet tall, and the growth seemed to be speeding up.  His toes had punched through the tips of his shoes and socks.  His legs were lengthening, and burst out of his jeans, revealing a black pair of briefs, which were themselves straining to hold everything in.  His shirt finally ripped apart as well when he reached nine feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's jaw dropped open as he saw his huge friend towering over him, almost completely naked.  He was so stunned that he didn't notice his cock had grown rock hard.  \"Wow, Omair,\" he said, \"this is amazing!  How does it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I dunno,\" Omair said.  \"I'm a bit light-headed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair continued to grow.  His underwear finally gave in and split apart, allowing his cock to spring out, a foot long and still soft.  This in itself started to arouse Omair, and his cock began to harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out, Omair!  Your head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Omair's head was beginning to press against the rafters of the attic.  He quickly sat down to avoid any destruction of the house or his body.  Finally, at twelve feet tall, his growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen walked over to Omair, speechless.  Even sitting, Omair was still taller than Ken standing. Ken placed his hand against Omair's chest, touching his nipple, which was almost as big as Ken's palm.  Already horny, Omair leaned his head back and let out a slight moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omair, just...wow!\"  Ken still couldn't find the right words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this?\"  Omair said, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I like this?\" Ken said.  \"Omair, this is fantastic!  You're twice my size!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do now?\" Omair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ken said, with a grin crossing his face.</span></div></div>",

I gotta say, you two put on quite a show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair noticed Karim's bulging boxers, and put two and two together.  \"That's sick!  You're my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim nodded.  \"Yes, I am.  But I know hot when I see it, and you two are hot.  But do you know what would be hotter?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair and Ken stared at him dumbfounded, as Karim held up the pendant.  \"For you two to pleasure me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he said his wish aloud:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wish Omair and I would swap ages!\" Karim clearly proclaimed while staring at Ken and his giant brother, Omair.<br>\r\nThe pendant began to glow and emanate a warmth in Karim's hand. <br>\r\nKen and Omair  gasped in fear upon hearing what Karim wished for. Swapping ages? That seemed quite crazy, even after what Ken and Omair had seen with the previous wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light died down, Omair returned to his normal height, still nude, with Ken sitting on top of him. A quick movement and both boys were standing, and facing Karim as he shuddered noticeably once the wish started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes first started with Omair. He shrank from his normal height, currently 5'11\" to his height when Omair was 13. Now standing at 5'5, Ken and Omair began to worry. Was Karim's wish more than just a simple age swap? Would they actually grow and shrink into their respective ages? If this were the case, Omair's body was reversing it's growth back into the body he had when he was Karim's age, whereas Karim was going to age forward to Omair's age and grow accordingly. <br>\r\nNext, Omair's facial hair, what little there was, instantly fell out. The short hairs dropped to the floor easily on their own. Karim's muscularity vanished as his body shrank into the proper physique to match his when he was 13. <br>\r\nOmair's face lost some of it's maturity just like the rest of his body, and took the form of his past self at the age of 13. Standing naked, it was clear to all that he had gone through a partially reversed puberty and lost most of his bodily hair, along with a few inches of his penis. Going from an impressive 8 inch erection to a measly 5 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim looked over Omair, only standing an inch taller than him before his growth kicked in. Karim grinned as his body stretched upward at a rapid pace. Karim stretched higher than Omair had been before he shrank, to a whopping 6'1\". Clearly at some point in Karim's life he would hit a major growth spurt. The growing teen chuckled and stood menacingly over the now smaller boys. Before he could say anything, Karim's face began to itch. When his hand reached up to his face, he discovered that he now had a sexy face of hair. A perfectly groomed amount of hair on his face to accentuate the now matured angles of his face. His hair lengthened slightly, and his voice deepened, made obvious by the ominous chuckling as he grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Karim's body was quickly following suit of growth. Karim's shirt, already tight on his newly heightened body became tighter as his chest swelled with muscle. Karim mentally wished that his body would further develop with muscle to further assert dominance as the soon to be older brother.<br>\r\nOnce the brief light died from his newest wish, Ken and Omair watched in horror as Karim moaned, groping the new found size of his swelling pecs. <br>\r\nUnder the shirt, along with his pecs, Karim's abs tightened into a beautiful, deeply toned set of 8-pack abs that would put fitness models to shame.  Karim's arms swelled with power, quickly filling with muscles so large that it would look almost ridiculous if he were still 13. <br>\r\nKarim's neck and shoulders grew as well, making Karim even more intimidating with his new age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim threw his head back in pleasure and let out a quiet moan while he continued fondling his pecs. The sensitive nipples resting there being stimulated by the violent rubbing of his shirt as it fought to stay on his swelling body. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ken and Omair were turned on. As horrified as they were to see Karim suddenly filling out and developing at such a rapid pace, it also made them both horny to watch his body swell beyond their wildest fantasies. It didn't help that Karim 's rock hard cock was visible through his tightening boxers while Karim's legs and ass swelled with powerful muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim's legs filled to ridiculous size, made powerful to the point where he could quickly run long distances without trying. On the other side of his body, his back filled with grooves and lumps of muscle, looking similar to a road map of his powerful body. Underneath his back, was Karim's now large ass. The mounds on his backside stretched out his boxers, making it look similar to a thong at this point, doing nothing to hide his large boner, now lengthening to an impressing 11 inches. Clearly Karim would develop quite well as he grew older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair's attention was torn from Karim's lengthening meat as a loud ripping was heard. Looking back up to his incredible torso, the boys saw that Karim's body had torn his shirt entirely off his body, exposing the teen's body, glistening with sweat from his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim was still lost in the throes of pleasure as he now put more attention to his nipples rather than his meaty pecs in general. Karim new the boys were staring at his massive cock, and he planned to give them quite a show. <br>\r\nRubbing his nipples, Karim's cock throbbed noticeably in the prison that contained his meat. Precum stained the fabric quickly, was the liquid was freely spilling from his overly stimulated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karim's growth came to a close, his boxers gave out and finally left him fully naked. The cool air blew on Karim's gigantic form of a seventeen year old. <br>\r\nKarim's muscles has swelled to a size that would challenge a bodybuilder. His face had developed into model like structure, with an intimidating height of 6'1\" to match. To top it all off, Karim's body hair had sprouted in the length of a perfectly clean shave, as if he properly groomed his body hair every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Karim was done growing, he still continued to fondle his nipples and make his cock throb in the open air. Ken and Omair couldn't take their eyes off of the massive piece of meat before them, oozing precum so invitingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while all 3 boys were preoccupied with Karim's self pleasure, their memories were changing. Now that their changes were complete, Ken and Omair only remembered Omair being the younger sibling, whereas Karim was the older one. Karim also gained these memories, but still clearly remembered the past before he'd grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck yes!\" Karim cried out, as his cock finally throbbed one last time and shot rope after rope of hot cum into Ken's face. Ken hardly reacted for some time to the cumshot before everything finally set it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair had no idea what was going on. Neither boy knew why they were all standing naked, with the exception of Ken in his boxers, in the attic. Karim, however was the first to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken, why are you and my dorky brother up here? And why are you both nearly naked?\" Karim spoke, his deep voice breaking through the boys reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen instantly responded, sputtering in confusion. \"Karim! I... don't know what's going on. I don't know how we got here. And why are you naked?\" <br>\r\nKarim chuckled and responded accordingly. \"Just wipe my cum off your face and come with me to your room. I wanna have a little fun without my dorky bother around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim turned to leave, Pendant now around his neck, with Ken following. Omair stood in confusion, his 13 year old body naked in the attic of who used to be his best friend, but is now the best friend of his older brother, Karim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that their memories were altered, Ken and Karim remembered always hanging out, and with Karim's matured body and increased sex drive, constantly fucking. Omair, however, was left to his own devices, and his own friends. Something felt off to him, however, and he wanted to know what was wrong...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ken\u2019s face was burning with embarrassment as he followed Karim back to his room.  What the in hell HAD he been doing in his boxers in the attic with stupid, worthless Omair?  Where had the rest of his clothes gone?  And why had Omair and Karin been naked?  It just didn\u2019t make any sense!  The only bright side was that Karim had admitted the cum on Ken\u2019s face belonged to him, so Ken desperate hoped he had somehow managed to please his beloved, uber-buff Arabic He-Boy.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nIn spite of his deep humiliation and confusion churning within him, Ken still found the time to ardently admire the broad, most muscular back of his best friend, lover and idol as the duo proceeded into Ken\u2019s bedroom.  There the sixteen year-old hurried over to his bureau, opening the top drawer and quickly throwing on a shirt and pair of blue jeans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Karim, I don\u2019t remember how I even got there,\u201d he tried to explain in frantic apology.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Ken,\u201d Karim reassured him, his wonderfully deep and resonantly commanding voice pure music to Ken\u2019s ears, like always.  He sighed in relief, even as his eyes eagerly feasted on the magnificently naked body of the towering, muscle-bound Middle Eastern Hercules whom he completely worshipped!  Mighty Karim stood at a full half foot taller than Ken, the overwhelming splendor and glory of his beyond perfect, fantastically muscled physique on full, proud display.  The Japanese American\u2019s adoring gaze traced up those immensely powerful, tree-trunk thick legs, to that monumentally mind-blowing manhood and Karim\u2019s laser-carved, eight-pack cobblestone abs.  Further up, to the sculpted, rock-hard slabs of muscle, the pecs Ken was eye-level with, then the doorway-broad shoulders and unbelievably muscular arms.  And higher yet, to that priceless-looking pendant and most of all Karim\u2019s chiseled, supermodel features, his beautifully spiked black hair, his bottomless brown eyes and irresistibly domineering smirk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was vaguely aware that his open mouth was literally drooling, but he couldn\u2019t help it: Karim was by far the handsomest bronzed teen Atlas <i>imaginable</i>!  Anyway, it wasn\u2019t like he was giving away any secrets; he\u2019d been pathetically clearly crushing on the great-looking Middle Eastern muscleboy since the blessed first day they\u2019d met.  And in the intervening years, Karim had only grown much bigger, far more buff and exponentially more handsome! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen had resignedly realized from the beginning that the godlike Karim was infinitely far out of his league, but to his ever-lasting amazement and eternal thankfulness, the most popular and attractive boy in school had deigned to grant Ken the gift of some of Karim\u2019 priceless free time.  Through study sessions together Ken soon learned that Karim was also a genius who effortlessly pulled straight A\u2019s every semester, a fact which only increased the awestruck Asian boy\u2019s ever-swelling admiration and attraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen had attended every Varsity football game to enthusiastically cheer Karim on, especially loving the sight of the incredibly built adolescent juggernaut repeatedly blasting through the opposing team\u2019s lines and effortlessly scoring touchdown after touchdown!  It was a rare game indeed when at least one of the opposition\u2019s players wasn\u2019t injured by Varsity Team Captain Karim\u2019s brutally aggressive, utterly unstoppable muscle-power.  Though far from the biggest on the field at a mere six foot one, Karim had repeatedly proven that he was vastly stronger and tougher than any of his older, taller teammates, all of whom instantly obeyed their heroic, dominant young leader.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim seemed to dominate everyone in his life, even his parents, and Ken was no exception whatsoever to that rule.  From the very beginning of their relationship Karim had been the apex alpha male, while Ken had been his worshipful follower.  The duo always did what Karim wanted, when Karim wanted, and Ken was grateful merely to be able to bask in the intoxicating presence of the gorgeous, Pakistani-American paragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had thought his heart would stop earlier in the year in this very room, when Karim had curtly commanded \u201cBlow me\u201d.  At first fearing it was a cruel joke, Ken had hesitantly peered up at his dream boy\u2019s glorious, movie star handsome visage.  Seeing only sternness there, he had immediately dropped to his knees, putting his own face directly on line with his tremendously muscular master\u2019s phenomenal manhood, hands shaking as he reverently unzipped the shorts to gain access to the foot-long work of art within. He had later proceeded to lovingly lick every flawless, immensely muscled inch of Karim\u2019s marvelous Mr. Universe frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then Ken had literally jumped to please and physically worship his ripped, shredded teenage god whenever allowed.  Now, staring shamelessly and endlessly at the naked, mega-hunk true love of his life, Ken could only blurt out, \u201cGod, I love you so <b>MUCH</b>!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was generously rewarded with Karim\u2019s blindingly beautiful smile, and he moaned aloud he came helplessy before his dark-haired, mesmerizingly attractive boy god. Karim stalked with predatory grace to the much smaller, younger adolescent, his majestically huge, exquisitely cut muscles rippling powerfully beneath his cinnamon brown skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so handsome, so strong!\u201d Ken murmured blissfully in the glowing aftermath of his orgasm.  \u201cYou\u2019re perfect!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming imposingly over the comparatively tiny, puny teen, Karim leaned far down, his lips brushing Ken\u2019s ear as he whispered, \u201cI know.\u201d        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore turned on than ever, Ken longed to softly kiss the statuesque Karim\u2019s canyon-deep, awesome chest, but he dared not touch his peerless powerhouse lover without permission.  And thus Ken could only whine his unfulfilled desire for the remarkably comely, enormously muscular Adonis smirking far above him.    <br>\r\nKarim cupped Ken\u2019s face possessively in one exceptionally large, superlatively powerful hand, making the other boy sigh in pure pleasure.  He leaned down once more, Ken\u2019s heartbeat thundering in his years as he anxiously awaited Karim\u2019s knee-weakeningly sexy kiss. <br>\r\n\uf075\uf075\uf075\uf075<br>\r\nQuestions swirled endlessly around the confused Omair\u2019s mind.  How had he gotten here, in Ken\u2019s attic?  How had his clothes gotten all ripped, along with all the other garment scraps scattered around the floor of this attic?  Why had his older brother and Ken also been here, and where had their clothes gone?  Try as he might, he couldn\u2019t remember any of the events which had led him here, yet he also certainly couldn\u2019t leave like this!  <br>\r\nScavenging around the attic, the scrawny thirteen year-old found a pair of unzipped pants on the floor and gratefully at least covered himself.  Emerging from the attic he again considered about going home, but he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that there was something really wrong here, something which went even beyond his current amnesia.  Instead of continuing down to the ground floor, Omair crept up to the closed door of Ken\u2019s bedroom and cautiously peered through the keyhole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw stunned him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big brother sex god Karim was still totally nude, more impossibly muscular and way better-looking than any genie ever depicted, with a gargantuan manhood easily over four times the size of Omair\u2019s own.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair had lived his whole life knowing his older brother Karim was vastly superior to him in all conceivable ways.  He\u2019d grown used to living in the shadow of his superstar, superstud elder sibling who excelled at everything and who treated him like an annoying insect.  Although Karim was only four years older, a wide, gaping chasm separated the brothers both mentally and physically, and Omair was despondently certain he\u2019d never even grow to be even a tenth of what great Karim already was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim cupped Ken\u2019s face and Omair gasped.  He\u2019d had a crush on the older Japanese-American boy forever, even though Ken hated him.  The perceptive teenager had quickly picked up on Karim\u2019s disdainful contempt for his younger brother and so Ken had soon begun mercilessly bullying Omair to curry favor with and please Karim. The gorgeous Pakistani-American Goliath\u2019s smirking approval had encouraged Ken to eagerly physically and mentally abuse Omair every time they met.  He had told the younger boy over and over how worthless he was, how stupid, how ugly, how Omair wasn\u2019t even worthy of the honor and privilege of kissing Karim\u2019s bare feet.   And though Ken was only average physically, his three extra years significantly aided him in slugging Omair in the stomach, tripping him and shoving him around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet in spite of all this, Omair held onto a great affection for Ken.  He had shadowy, vague memories of everything being different, of he and Ken being equals instead of victim and bully, of Karim not looming over his life like an unconquerable colossus.  He strained to bring those mysterious memories to the forefront of his mind, but could not.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw Karim leaning in to kiss Ken and instinctively he acted, throwing open the door and shouting \u201cStop!\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth older teens whirled to face him and the dark looks they subsequently shot him made the thirteen year-old gulp in fear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The glow grew brighter and brighter, as the tone grew higher pitched.  This went on for a short while, and it got so bright that Omair and Ken had to shield their eyes, and the tone was so loud they cringed.  After a few seconds of ear-splitting loudness, with a loud crashing sound the pendant shattered, and the light and tone suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair looked at his brother, who was laughing now, almost with an evil laugh.  The pendant was in pieces on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?!\" Ken asked, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim just simply smiled, and at that moment, he began to grow.  It was a slow growth at first, and was hard to tell, but after a minute, Ken realized that Karim was a few inches taller. Karim stretched, playfully, and his shirt began to ride up a little higher than before, revealing a tone, fit stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not so bad,\" Omair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Ken replied.  \"But remember what his wish was: to grow exponentially.  That means his growth rate will keep speeding up forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was.  At this point, Ken walked over to Karim, and noticed that they were now the same height; Karim had grown about seven inches in just a couple of minutes.  Karim's clothes were now becoming a little too tight.  He reached out and placed his hand on Ken's shoulder, who batted it away instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-ho!\" Karim exclaimed.  \"Playing hard to get!  Well, don't worry, it'll all be easy enough soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen gulped.  He had to do something to stop this crazy boy from growing.  But what?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had broken apart fairly evenly, and was in four approximately equal-sized pieces.  He picked them up, and pressed them together.  While holding them, he closed his eyes and wished aloud, \"I wish Karim would return to his normal height!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he opened his eyes, only to see Karim standing before him, looking down, and smiling.  He was still growing bigger, and, just as his wish was stated, the rate of growth was continuously increasing.  He was now almost a foot taller than Ken, making him about six and a half feet tall.  His clothes, designed for a five foot tall thirteen year old, were striving in vain to succeed in keeping him clothed, but they were not able to survive much longer, and they were starting to give way.  His shirt had grown tight around his forearms, the bottom of it only came down to the top of his rib cage, and the sides were splitting.  His boxers were beginning to split apart on the backside, and his rock-hard and ever increasing cock had found its way to the open.  And finally, Ken heard a loud RIIPP as Karim's feet, which were now size 16, were now becoming too large for his socks, his toes poking through and breaking free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim kept smiling while shaking his head.  \"Don't you see, Ken?  It's over! I'm going to be your new god, now, and there's no way to get around that, so you better get used to the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror, Ken held onto the remnants of the pendant as he ran over to the boxes where they had originally found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Omair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's got to be some way to counteract this!\" Ken exclaimed.  \"We have to be able to fix this pendant, or reverse his growth or something!

His shirt, boxers, and socks had now ripped completely and was in tatters on the ground, and he was completely naked.  He began rubbing his nipples, which caused his cock to grow even more erect.  Ken and Omair both had a hard time keeping their eyes off the lengthening cock; even when you factor in Karim's increased size, it was very well developed for a boy his age, and made both Ken and Omair reconsider their actions for a moment.  But Ken broke his attention away and kept flipping through the book, looking for a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is!\" he said.  \"Reversing a wish!  Let's see... 'The only way possible to reverse a wish is for the one who currently obtains the pendant to wish it reversed.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's no good,\" Omair said.  \"See if there's a way you can fix it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Ken kept flipping pages, finally finding what he was looking for. \"'Fixing the pendant:  If a wish of extraordinary effort is attempted, the pendant may break into four pieces.  Though the wish will be granted in the fullest extent possible, this will then immediately render the pendant powerless until a repair is made.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is!\"  Omair exclaimed.  \"How do we repair it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen continued reading.  \"'To repair a broken pendant, one must take all four pieces and submerge them into a pot or cauldron of boiling hot water for...'\" Ken gulped.  \"'...for seventy-two hours.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seventy-two hours!\" Omair exclaimed.  \"Who knows how big he'll be by then?!  Is there any way to make it faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen kept on reading.  \"'If repair is not attempted in the manner described for the exact time period, the pendant may produce unpredictable results.'  Hmm, well, unpredictable results might be better than no results at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get downstairs and get that started,\" Omair said.  \"We can't waste any time at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, my darlings,\" Karim said, as he moved to block the exit from the attic. His massive naked body was now over ten feet tall, almost the size Omair currently was.  His head was near the rafters, and he was beginning to have to duck to avoid hitting them.  He smiled as he stood in front of Ken, keeping him from leaving, with Ken now eye level with Karim's fit and lean stomach.  \"I can't let you leave.  That will ruin all my fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was nervous as to what idea of \"fun\" Karim was thinking of right now, and he tried to rack his brain for what to do. </span></div></div>",

Realizing he couldn't wait any longer, Ken ran towards Omair and pushed with all his strength, at the same time pressing back on Karim's cock.  Karim was so wrapped up in the moment that he didn't even notice until Ken had worked Omair free, leaving Karim sitting alone on the floor, cock pulsating and throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, Omair,\" Ken said, \"we gotta go downstairs and use that pendant now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--but it's not been nearly enough time!\" Omair replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter!\" Ken said.  \"We can't wait any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Karim opened his eyes, noticing the two other boys escaping down the stairs, Omair barely fitting through the attic opening.  \"Trying to escape, I see,\" Ken said in a mocking tone.  \"Well, don't worry, I'll catch up with you two soon enough. Then we'll have some real fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ken ran down the stairs and Omair crawled down on his hands and knees behind him, they soon made it to the kitchen, where the pot was still boiling the pieces of the pendant together.  \"Here, hand me that spoon,\" Ken said, and Omair complied. \"Okay,\" Ken said.  \"I'm going to force these pieces together, and then we'll make our wish and hope it all works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of glass breaking came from upstairs, and, looking out the window, Omair could see Karim's arm sticking out from one of the attic windows, almost reaching the ground. \"Hurry!\" Omair said, \"he's gonna bring down the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen moved each piece of the pendant to face each other, then pressed them together with two different spoons.  After holding them together for a few seconds, he then grabbed a set of tongs and tried to fish them out.  Amazingly, they held together out of the water, though the cracks where the pendant had split apart were clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we just need to let it dry off and cool, then we can use it,\" Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the whole house began to shudder, and Omair and Ken could hear cracking wood coming from above them.  In a moment, the ceiling of the second floor caved in, and this caused the entire side of the house to then start to crumble.  Dust and debris floated in the air, clouding their vision.  When it settled, Omair and Ken were horrified to see Karim's brown feet in front of them, filling the space where the rest of the house used to be, as big as Buicks.  They looked up, and saw Karim's tree trunk legs; his still-erect and massive dick, which was leaking precum; his fit and lean torso with his arms resting on his hips, and, most disturbingly, his grinning face, some eighty feet in the sky above them.  \"Hello, boys,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken, you gotta use it now!\" Omair screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen took a deep breath, then put the pendant around his neck.  The boiling water still clung to the string and to the pendant itself, and this caused him to scream in pain.  He looked up, and saw Karim's massive hand, the size of a crane, reach out towards him.  Right before they reached him, he yelled at the top of his lungs: \"I wish that we had never found this pendant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pendant began to glow, and it started to emit extremely bright beams of light, in all directions, which caused all three boys to avert their gaze.  After an almost unbearable sound, like being in the middle of a thunderstorm, the light then stopped, and Ken opened his eyes, trying to see what had happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it worked?</span></div></div>",

Not only was he  the biggest living thing on the planet now by far, but he was now getting to the point where even Mount Everest would be at waist level! The world was shrinking around him, and he knew that pretty soon, even the entire planet wouldn't measure up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the pendant, which was on a chain wrapped around his neck. It had grown with him, and itself was probably bigger than any stadium. It was the only thing that had grown with him, as the rest of him was completely nude, from the top of his head, which had long ago pushed through the clouds, to the toes of his feet, which knocked over skyscraper after skyscraper as they continued to expand in the downtown area. This included his cock, which had long ago grown stiff and was casting a shadow over a large portion of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had conflicting memories on how he had gotten to this point, both so clear and vivid that it was hard to tell which one was more accurate (if either). One one hand, he remembered following Omair over to his friend's house, sneaking behind them as they both made their way to the attic, then getting ahold of the pendant as they tossed it aside after a wish. On the other, he remembered deciding to sneak into the attic of his brother's friend's house on his own the last time Omair had been over a few days before, finding the pendant in an ornately decorated chest, and then using it later that night at home. He decided the last memory made more sense, or at least was more fitting with how things now were, as in it he remembered first hitting ten feet, then a hundred, then a thousand and so on, and the panic that the city went through in their futile attempts to try and stop him from playing with and destroying what he pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim rubbed his right hand down his smooth, flat chest and torso. He hadn't bothered to increase his muscularity at all, and, other than the height, still had the skinny appearance of a young teenager. As his hand reached his cock, though, he noticed that it seemed to protrude further out than he remembered from before he had found the pendant, about one and a half times as long as his hand was from the tip of his middle finger to the bottom of his palm. He touched it, and it sent shivers down his spine, causing a tiny bit of pre shot out the slit. Tiny to him, of course, but enough to completely drench several buildings down below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other hand still held Ken's house, with Omair and Ken still (presumably) in it. The thought of the two older boys running about like chickens with their heads cut off inside, their minds blown from seeing him so large, brought a smile to his face, and made his cock twitch even more. He was so incredibly big compared to them-- compared to EVERYONE. He could do whatever he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what he wanted was to keep getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning a little at the thought, Karim knew that he was close to getting off now, but he needed a little something extra to push himself over the edge. Looking down at the pendant once more, he smiled, realizing what that something extra should be.</span></div></div>",

If he were to scale with a normal sized human, his incredible penis would scale to about 12 inches. Karim grinned as the large meat throbbed and pulsed larger, as he remembered when he would beat off his impressive 7 inch cock.<br>\r\nKarim fondly remembered trying many different techniques to increase the pleasure of his day-to-day masturbation habits.<br>\r\nThis usually ranged from gently massaging his large testicles to rubbing his nipples, a personal favorite of his, to even one time fingering his asshole. While the pleasure from that was good, he imagined that a big cock in his ass would feel better.<br>\r\nSnapping out of his reverie he firmly grasped the large penis and moaned while pleasure coarsed through his growing body. Even from all his efforts as a normal teen, nothing felt as good as what he felt right now. He have the cock a few slow strokes and threw his head back in pleasure, precum falling from the slit freely. He circled his finger along the head slowly, moaning louder as the pleasure increased, then returning to slowly stroking his cock. While the pleasure from jerking his fat cock mixed with the sensation of his growth were incredible, Karim wanted more.<br>\r\nHe grinned as he let go of his cock and grasped the pendant, his cock throbbing in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking loudly, Karim wished. \"I wish that my growth will speed up and become even more erotic than before!\"<br>\r\nKen and Omair watched from below as Karim shuddered, fearing what his next wish would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh yeah...\" Karim groaned as his body surged higher, faster. His head reached higher into the sky as his feet grew faster and continued to destroy the city below him. All the while, his cock pulsed and twitched as his body sent waves of pleasure unlike anything he'd felt before. Precum shot in volleys down onto the city below, drenching many buildings in the hot, sticky substance.<br>\r\n\"Oh this is so goood.\" Karim moaned as he stood, feeling his body swell so much quicker than before.<br>\r\nKarim's cock was not ignored long before he grasped it forcefully and began to quickly stroke it.<br>\r\n\"OH FUCK YEAH!\" Karim shouted through the extreme pleasure he was feeling.<br>\r\n\"OH YEAH THIS FEELS SOOOO GOOD\" The Pakistani god shouted as he furiously beat off infront of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair watched the scene unfold from the window of Ken's house. While they should have been trying to concoct a plan to stop Karim, they couldn't take their eyes off the scene above. Karim's thick cock looked incredibly impressive to the giant teen and his friend. Even though Omair was his brother, he couldn't help but get hard as he listened to Karim's shouts of pleasure booming across miles of land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim felt his balls swell, and the pressure building up as his orgasm approached. He again thought back to his time as a normal teen, when he would practice edging and holding off on cummimg to increase the cumshots length and distance.<br>\r\nNow, as a massive god for all to see, the pressure building in his massive cock was almost too much to bear. <br>\r\n\"OH FUUUUCK I'M SO CLOSE. FUCK YEAH.\" He shouted as he stroked as fast as he could, precum lubricating and making his efforts easier.<br>\r\nKarim let the pressure build for as long as he possibly could bear, but before he knew it, he was driving himself over the edge.<br>\r\n\"OH FUCK I'M SO FUCKING BIG AND HORNY. I'M GONNA GONNA CUM!\" The teen screamed as thick ropes of cum launched over the city, landing another city over, covering the entire thing in cum as he continued to shoot volley after volley of hot cum. Karim moaned as he continued stroking his cock slowly while he came, feeling the cum launch from his massive cock, and some even dribbling onto the city below him as his hot orgasm came to an end.<br>\r\n\"Ohh fuck that was amazing.\" Karim gasped, watching his cock fall flaccid. He was too wrapped up to notice he no longer felt his erotic growth he wished for, as it had returned to his original growth as he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim turned his attention to the house still in his left palm, grinning as he imagined them still panicking, when in fact, the boys were getting themselves off to the hot display Karim put on.<br>\r\n\"So boys, what should I wish for next?\" Karim said, thinking of another way to make his already incredible growth so much better.</span></div></div>",

LOOK at how BIG I am! and this is just YOUR wish!\" He laughed realizing his BIGGER growth spurt would now be exponentially added, and as his growing hard cock crashed through the neighbours house he could only moan a little, flooding their home with precum as he waited for Ken's wish to make him into a GOD</span></div></div>",

There was no way it could be real. She had been woken up in this early hour of the day to witness the boy of her neighbor standing tall over his house. He looked to be around 80 feet tall. She couldn't discern very well, but Ms. Monroe could swear that Karim was talking to someone. The boy sat down with both his leg around the house, his crotch area hidden by the walls and the unbroken part of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonroe noticed the soles of his feet, since they were pointed up. Smooth and almost as tall as an entire floor, she estimated each feet to be around 10 feet tall, perhaps more. His long toes suddenly curled, and she saw Karim grasp his head. The ground shook. His feet shot straight past her house, his knee almost to her house's side. That's when she noticed IT. A giant cock head was heading straight for her. It looked absolutely fat and was of a dark purple. Out of its opening, a clear liquid was dribbling. Monroe's mind was telling her to run, but the emotions she was harboring kept her pinned to the window. The gigantic sex organ was almost upon her when she finally snapped out of it and started running. She didn't even look back as the sound of broken plaster and bursting water pipes was heard. That is, until Monroe tripped on the hallway's carpet right before the stair down to the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw was out of this world. The bedroom was filled with Karim's cock head. The wall around the door behind her was buckling to the rhythm of the boy's heartbeat. His sex pulsed anew, and a gigantic shot of pre-cum filled the hall. Monroe was pushed away by the flood and fell down the stair. The door! she thought. Get out of there, quickly. Her life was in danger. The entire house was buckling as the penis destroyed en entire room in it's growth and proceeded to grow even bigger, spanning almost two floor in height. Outside, a deep rumble could be heard like a laugh. Monroe was now knee deep in the clear fluid, trying to open her main door, but the shaky walls had crooked it. The main door was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no choice, she waded as quickly as she could through the waist high fluid into her kitchen and exited through the window. Only in her bathrobe, having grabbed her keys on the counter, she ran to her car. Even then, Monroe had to be even faster : a gigantic foot was slowly growing in front of her alleyway. At the rate it was growing, the big toe would be covering the entire way out of here. The car sped up and just narrowly escaped as it passed by the front of the boy's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even moving, in the last 10 minutes, Karim had destroyed his neighbor's house. If Ms. Monroe could have looked back, she would have seen the opposite side of the house be pierced anew by the fat, bloated, pulsing cock. Karim was extremely close to having an orgasm after witnessing his neighbor run away like a scared ant. He didn't even care about his brother and his friend any more...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karim's swelling body was now blocking the only street that lead out of the neighborhood. Having to think fast, Ken clutched the pendant tightly and ordered Omair to hoist him up the large 10 foot walls that surrounded their homes. Just as Omair threw his large body over the wall himself, Karim's moans could be heard. It seemed his growth was speeding up yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the massive teen's body could not be seen from where they stood, his cock pointed upward, almost as if it were defying gravity. The boys were mesmerized for a moment as they watched the thickening cock throb and leak precum down the shaft. It seemed that Karim was still fondling his nipples in an attempt to get his giant body off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking haste, Ken ran towards the parking lot of a nearby market, Ken threw himself into an old looking pick up truck, while Omair was forced to sit in the bed due to his large size. Ken was pleased to find that the fool of a driver left their keys in the ignition, and that they must have recently filled the tank. Looking into the back seat, Ken found a pair of old clothes. Quickly putting them on, Ken noticed the large size, but kept them on anyways, since he was previously only in hs underwear. Throwing the pendant into the passenger seat, Ken drove away as fast as the legal limit would allow. The last thing he wanted was to get stalled by the police when he needed to escape from Karim and his swelling body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ken drove away, Omair listened to the nearby sounds of his teen brother. While he was stricken with fear at the thought of his brother growing to monumental sizes, it turned him on to hear Karim's cries of pleasure. Omair remembered how he'd felt while growing, and so he understood why Karim was so horny. It was a euphoric thrill to feel your body swelling, the power coursing through you as you grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stopped several miles away at a super market, where he hastily purchased a portable hotplate, which he could use to keep the pendant boiling while on the road. Also grabbing batteries to fuel the hotplate until they could find somewhere to stay, along with a gallon of water. Ken rushed back and threw everything into the passenger seat and began to boil the pendant. Driving off, Ken realized it was going to be a long wait for the pendant to repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Karim couldn't believe the pleasure he felt. The power coursing through his veins as he swelled larger and larger with each second, and the electric waves of pleasure as he rubbed his pecs and fondled his nipples. While Karim had previously been a scrawny teen with no muscle mass, and a somewhat larger than average cock, Karim now sported a well toned body, comparable to a swimmer, and a massive cock that would scale to about 13 inches. His feet crashed through the wall of the neighbor hood, while his head did the same on the other side. Hearing the residents scream and try in vain to escape his growth only made him hornier, bringing him closer to release. <br>\r\n\"Ooooh. Fuck. So fucking BIG.\" Karim groaned, biting his lip as his growth sped up yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horny teen moved one hand from his nipple down to his swelling balls, massaging them and feeling the cum churn inside. <br>\r\nThinking back to when he was a teen, Karim would practice holding off on cumming for as long as possible, enjoying the pleasure of his cock throbbing violently as if begging to blow. Of course, not only did that make his cumshots fly far, but it also meant that there would be a large amount of cum. <br>\r\nThe thought of blowing the biggest load on the planet made his cock throb eagerly, already feeling pressure build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim moved his hand back up his torso, feeling his abs and pecs just in time to let his balls run across the ruins of the neighbor hood he was growing over. His muscled ass was destroying any remains of the neighbor hood as it rapidly grew with the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the fountain of precum gushing from his fat cock, Karim gently pressed his finger against the tip of his cock, moaning, and then bringing the sticky liquid to his mouth. Savoring the taste of his salty, yet somewhat sweet pre, Karim gushed more out, which he used to lubricate his constant work on his nipples. The slick lubricant made his actions easier, further bringing him to his orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. So fucking big and horny...\" Karim moaned, feeling his cock about to blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They-they're changing me MORE!\" He moaned as his body swelled with muscle! So thick he could barely bend his arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next of Ken's frantic wishes affected the growing teens cock, it was already MASSIVE but jutted up quickly sliding between the now thick groove of his muscled pecs!

Why had he ever discovered this chest and make the stupid wish in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim shivered with pleasure, his body experiencing another massive growth spurt. He was now over two hundred feet tall, the left cheek of his heavily-muscled ass now completely filling the space where the house used to be. His cock looked even more impressive, nearly as thick as an arm and almost reaching the young teen's mouth, looking like it was ready to burst. \"OHHHHH, YEAH!\" Karim moaned in pleasure, closing his eyes. \"Feels so GOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair placed both of his large hands onto Ken's shoulders, shaking him hard. \"Quit making those stupid wishes!\" he cried. \"Don't you see that each one's just adding on to his growth? He's already way too huge as it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gotta work sometime!\" Ken replied in exasperation. \"It's the only chance we have of reversing everything and saving ourselves!\" He held up the pendant again. \"I truly and totally wish that everything would return to normal!\" Again, the pendant flickered and died, and Karim's cock lurched forward, lengthening by another dozen feet or so as the rest of his body continued to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair shook his head. \"We have to get away from him and follow those directions! Unless we want my brother to end up bigger than the planet, we need to get the pendant back in proper working ord--ERK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was cut short as a massive brown hand came down from above and wrapped around both boys. Karim scooped them up and lifted them into the air, bringing them to his smiling face, still amazingly youthful considering how gargantuan the rest of his body had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, boys,\" he said, \"I thought you'd like to be able to see what you're missing!\" He opened his hand slightly, and Omair and Ken looked out and saw they were rising further and further into the air; Karim had started to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Karim! Stop this madness!\" Ken cried out, nearly in tears now. \"You'll end up killing everybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh,\" Karim grined, \"why do you think I'd want to go and put an end to all of this FUN? Look how much I'm ENJOYING this!\"  The two smaller boys watched as his other hand began to run down his rock-hard chest and abs, eventually finding its way to his cock. He stroked it a couple of times and precum continued to ooze out, gallons of it splashing to the ground far below. \"Besides, even if I WANTED to, I don't have any way to stop it. The pendant is shattered, and the wish just keeps on GOING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then,\" Omair shouted, \"what are you going to do with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim's devilish smile frightened Omair and Ken more than anything else that had yet happened today. \"Oh, I have my ideas!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If Karim's smile had filled Ken and Omair with dread, it was nothing compared to what he said. What sort of ideas would this power hungry young male have? As though in answer to this question, Karim's hand slowly reached down (though not very far) and lightly grasped his massive cock, rubbing it a few times again, moaning loudly. \"Oooh, there's the obvious idea of course! You boys have a good imagination right? Just look at what this hand is doing...\" He began to pump his hand, the pre flowing even faster out of his slit as he did so. \"...and imagine me doing it with THIS hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe playfully wiggled the fingers of his opposite hand, the hand that contained his older brother and Ken. This action, combined with Karim's words, made both older boy's jump. Karim laughed loudly, his voice booming out over the neighborhood as he saw their horrified expressions. \"Oh man! Those looks are priceless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair clenched his fist, pissed of that he was being humiliated like this by his own brother! He glared down at Ken and tersely said, \"THIS is why we should have been running!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen knew that Omair was right, that in a moment of weakness he had panicked and made their situation insurmountably worse. Now that they were in Karim's clutches, there seemed very little hope of actually repairing the pendant, and making any further wishes on it just spiked Karim's growth to great heights, adding on to his first wish. The situation seemed completely hopeless! Ken was suddenly snapped out of his thoughts by Karim's voice, growing louder every second as he continued to get exponentially larger, speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But like I said, that's way too obvious! I have a different idea that I think will be just as fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden lurch, the hand containing the two teens were slowly brought closer and closer to Karim's impressive chest, his pecs bigger than most bodybuilder's, even if he was at a comparable height! He took a deep breath and the slabs of muscle in front of them inflated dangerously, the right pec actually pushing against the two boys, shoving them dangerously close to the edge of Karim's palm! Just before they were pushed over the edge, Karim let the breath out and grinned down at them over the swell of the muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how long you boys can last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair raised an eyebrow at Ken who just shrugged. Last doing what? Ken was about to ask this very same question to Omair, when Karim's thumb and index finger easily plucked his older brother off his palm and brought him over to his left nipple, dropping him unceremoniously on top of it. Omair grabbed on to it as tightly as he could, unable to stretch his arms around the fleshy pink nodule, making him feel even more insignificant than he had felt before. His younger brother's heart was beating powerfully behind him, the sound as ominous as war drums. Karim giggled, tipping his palm, his eyes filled with glee as he watched Ken stumble and fall much the same way, landing with a light *thump!* on Karim's other nipple. It was surprisingly warm, warmer than Ken had expected. He was able to sit rather comfortably on top of it, the swell of Karim's pec rising up majestically behind him. Ken hated himself for it, but something about this was turning him on a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, his thoughts were interrupted by a sudden wrenching movement underneath him, the nipple suddenly rocketing up and down like a bucking bronco. Ken clung desperately to the nipple as Karim continued bouncing his pecs, laughing as he watched the two tiny boys on top of them get knocked around. The feeling of effortlessly dominating them was only increasing his lust, his dick gushing forth even more pre cum. It wouldn't be long now before he exploded! His moans filled the air as his muscled ass plowed through the surrounding houses, his balls obliterating the street and lawns while his feet were starting to encroach on the city. Karim was beginning to gain a much wider audience as his body surged unstoppably bigger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen, in his haste to grab onto the young boy's nipple, had a very loose grip on the pendant. One particularly hard bounce knocked the small metal object from his hand. As though he was watching it in slow motion, Ken gaped as the pendant turned over a few times before falling down, down, down, lost somewhere on Karim's enormous body. Ken nearly broke down right then and there. Now truly all hope was lost! How could things possibly get any worse?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ken and Omair could only watch helplessly as Karim reached a finger down towards his abs, where the pendant had fallen, and started to push against the firm slabs of muscle, gently stroking them with his hand while at the same time scrunching up his stomach and causing the ripples to flex and move up and down in rhythm. His cock seemed to be very pleased with this sensation, making a jerking motion of its own, with more gushes of pre cum erupting from its slit. Karim moaned deeply all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of this self-pleasure, Karim stopped stroking his stomach and brought his hand back up towards his chest, where Omair and Ken were still clutching on for dear life. As his finger passed his nipples, the two boys could barely make out the tiny speck on his fingertip; the pendant had stuck in between the skin of his finger and his finger nail, and it had begun to glow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this is great!\" Karim called out, his laughter booming through the surrounding area. \"Thanks for taking care of the pendant for me, boys, but I think I'll be taking it back now and keeping it. For good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Omair screamed in frustration, but there was nothing that he could do; Karim's hand was now way too far away to make any sort of retrieval attempt, and it looked like his formerly \"little\" brother already was getting some fresh ideas on how to use the pendant again. If he already had become so incredibly big and still was growing exponentially, what else could he possibly do to top that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Omair,\" Karim chuckled at his brother's disappointment. \"What are you thinking that I'll end up wishing for first? Perhaps for me to grow at an even faster rate, maybe a mile a minute?\" He shook his head. \"Nah, I think that I've gotten enough of that to last me a while. Wait there for a moment while I consider my options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen breathed a sigh of relief. At least Karim wouldn't be getting bigger at any faster rate than what his first wish was already making him. Of course, it kinda seemed like a moot point, since he had wished to grow without stopping. Maybe, though, the power of the pendant would wear out sometime soon and he'd stop. It had to, eventually... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omair!\" Ken called out, cupping his hands over his mouth and shouting towards his friend on the opposite side of Karim's chest. \"I don't understand! If he's not gonna wish to grow anymore, what else could he be thinking about wishing for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Omair moved his head back and forth wildly. \"Beats me!\" he called out. \"I have no clue what's running through Karim's mind right now! For all I know, he could wish to do this all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair didn't think that his brother could make out their conversation being so much bigger than the two of them, but the giant's ears had become extra sensitive as he had grown. \"Say,\" he said, a mischievous grin forming on his face, \"do it all over again. You know, that's not a bad idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Omair and Ken looked up at Karim's looming face, wide-eyed and confused. \"What do you mean?\" Ken yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Karim explained, \"I love being so big, and I love the sensation of continually growing like this. If you couldn't tell,\" he said, patting his oozing cock with a free hand. \"But once you've gotten past four or five hundred feet like I have, it's not quite as interesting as outgrowing a house or something like that. What say we wipe the slate clean and start over, so to speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean,\" Omair's face lit up with hope, \"that we're gonna go back to normal? That you'd stop growing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming laugh came from high overhead. \"Oh, no, it doesn't mean that at all! I think I'll always be growing bigger and bigger, no matter what happens or how I change reality! That's a wish that's been made, and that the pendant broke during. I can't take it back! But, if I occasionally wish myself back to normal size, while still growing overall, we can go through a lot of interesting situations where I think I'd have a lot of fun. I think I'll even wish for you two to forget about everything that's happened with the pendant, even the first wish I made, so that my growth will come as a complete surprise. Maybe after we go through that, if I get bored, I can decide to destroy the planet or something with my cock.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair and Ken didn't like the sound of Karim's words at all. He was going to make them forget everything? Even the initial wishing that started all of this? Could that even be possible? \"Wait!\" Omair cried out, throwing his hand up to try to catch his massive brother's attention before he said anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as usual, Karim ignored him. Grinning broadly again, he held the pendant as tight as he could. \"Okay, I think I've gotten an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened his mouth to make his wish, Ken and Omair felt a blinding flash of light surround them, and a low droning noise filled their ears, masking the words that Karim was saying. Both boys suddenly felt dizzy, and after a few seconds, they blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they came to, they had no memory of what had gone on that day. Both of their heads were in a complete daze. Sitting up, Omair looked around, noticing that they were now at a somewhat unfamiliar place, and he had no idea of how he and his best friend and secret crush got there. He didn't think anything unusual of being his normal height, or being clothed again, because as far as he knew now, he'd never changed size in the first place. The word pendant meant nothing to him at the moment, and the last time he'd seen Karim, his little brother was substantially shorter than he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart still beating a little heavily, Omair rubbed his eyes, blinked several times, and took a few deep breaths. After a couple of minutes, things started to feel a little familiar, and he began to realize where they were at.</span></div></div>",

He tried to remember how he got there, but for some reason his memory was fuzzy. He vaguely remembered going into the attic, but after that he was drawing a blank. He felt as if there was something important he should know, something big, but his mind just failed to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you Omair?\u201d Someone asked. Turning around, Omair found himself looking at Peter, Karim\u2019s short and skinny friend. Peter was the same age as Karim, though he was a bit undersized at 5\u20191\u201d and 80 lbs. wet.  He had brownish hair combed over and a pair of green eyes hidden behind a pair of nerdy looking glasses. Personally Omair always found him annoying, but for now he was open to any kind of explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is you!\u201d Peter said. \u201cWhat are you doing here, you\u2019re going to be late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLate? Late for what?\u201d Omair frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLate for\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What?\" Omair asked, perplexed at the notion. Why would someone set up a wrestling match between him and his brother? What possible use could that have? He didn't have much time to think about it, though, as Peter quickly grabbed his wrist and pulled him off in the direction of the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at a locker, which Peter put in the combination and opened. \"You'd better change into your outfit in a hurry,\" he said, looking over his shoulder towards the direction of the gymnasium, where the rest of the students had gathered and were cheering loudly. \"I don't know if the crowd will be able to wait much longer. Or Karim, for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair was all sorts of confused, and looked at Ken, who shrugged. \"I guess you should do what he says for now,\" Ken suggested, \"until we figure out what the heck is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Omair obliged and slipped into the wrestling uniform that was in the locker, a black and gold singlet which, surprisingly enough, fit him just perfectly. As soon as he finished, Peter stepped back in and motioned for him to hurry. \"C'mon, they're all waiting!\" he cried out. Omair rolled his eyes and followed him into the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw his brother, who was the same short, skinny thirteen year old that Omair had remembered him as, he thought something was very peculiar about the way Karim smiled at him. Karim was shirtless, wearing just a pair of loose-fitting blue shorts, and was also barefoot. He hopped around from one foot to another as he waited for Omair to take his position, apparently full of energy and ready to get started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karim,\" Omair asked as the match was beginning to start, \"what the hell is going on?\" His brother didn't answer, only continuing to smile mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the teachers that Omair didn't know signaled for the match to begin, and the two boys started circling around each other. As they did so, Omair could swear something was happening to his brother, but he couldn't place his finger on what. To hell with it, he thought, I'm just gonna go all out for this -- but not hurt him, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed at his brother, tackling him and brining him to the ground, trying to pin him down. At first, Karim offered surprisingly little resistance, and Omair began to smile, thinking this silliness would soon be behind him. But after closing his eyes for a few second, he felt a slight heat underneath him, and when he opened them again, he was stunned to see that Karim had gotten much larger - almost six feet tall, as tall as Omair was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell?\" Omair exclaimed. His little brother still looked like a skinny teen, but he had just gotten to be much taller. Omair looked down and noticed that Karim's shorts were now much tighter, and he seemed to still be getting bigger right in front of his eyes. Something about all of this seemed - familiar, somehow. But that was impossible... wasn't it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Omair was now starting to rest fully on his younger brother as Karim grew larger underneath him reaching at least 8 feet before he seemed to stop his impossible expansion. Omair rested there wide-eyed, and looked back at Ken who seemed equally awestruck at Karim's growth. Maybe he wasn't imagining things... But how could this be?! Omair's 13 year old brother was starting to win ground in the fight, and didn't even seem to offer more effort against Omair! His now larger face still seeming frozen in his creepy smile which sent a chill down your spine. \"Karim?... What's happening?\" His brother just laughed softly and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you looked down at his smoothed chest and started to notice shadows there that you weren't used to seeing on your suddenly larger brother. His chest started to inflate as if Karim's breathing was pumping him up more and more. You looked over his young frame and noticed that indeed every single muscle was starting to expand and grow against you now and you gulped hard. \"W-what is going on? This is impossible!\" Omair was beginning to realize that his arms still pinning Karim were not going to do anything against his brother now, but still he was just lying there with his smile and ever expanding bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Karim reached the mass that would look big on an athlete, and positively huge on the 13 year old under Omair, he stopped growing. \"Oh no...\" Omair and Ken gasped in unison as he felt his body getting lifted up in the air effortlessly to the other kid's hearty cheers, as Karim started to move his stretched out muscle arms up and in one swift motion wrapped around him, squeezing him to Karim's bulging chest. Omair cried out in pain as his body was compressed in his brother's vise-like grip which earned a hearty laugh from the suddenly dominant brother. Omair was shocked and afraid about his brother's sudden change in stature and personality, and now more than anything he was afraid that he couldn't even breathe! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim sighed and let go of Omair who rolled off his \"little\" brother and gasped for air. Ken, who had been frozen in shock at the display unfolding in front of him snapped out of his trance and instantly rushed over to his best friend's aid. He lifted Omair's head into his lap and comforted him with a nervous look on his face \"A-are you okay?! Nod if you can hear me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- *Nod* - *Phew* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger kids laughed and cheered as they stood around Karim's hulking body, all of them only standing waist high compared to the 8 foot youngster. Ken scoffed at them all at what they did to his friend, and wanted nothing more than to just leave with Omair and forget everything he had seen, already having pinched most of his arm to a light red to test the reality of what was unfurling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair started to come to mostly and sat up against Ken, happy that this finally seemed to be over. He gawked wide-eyed over at his big \"little\" brother towering over the rest of the boys around him, and saw his face still smiling right back at him. His eyes fell over his brother's herculean physique and actually started to envy the smooth hairless muscles priding his the young body after the sudden expansion. He looked over the bulging chest, and the deep lines between his chiseled 6-pack abdominals and his.... \"OH, holy fuck !\" Came the shocked response from Omair, and Ken followed his eyes to see exactly why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Karim's 6-pack abs his now overly tight blue shorts had started to rip and tear in various places since his growth spurt and did absolutely nothing to hide an absolutely huge 18 inch sausage that coiled upon itself and stretched the fabric out over two firm spheres the size of large tennis balls. Ken and Omair stared wide-eyed at karim's massive appendage that seemed ridiculously large on him, and still remained soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys started to gather around the make-shift arena again and their cheers started to die down. Omair wondered what would happen now, and when he heard the words \"Round TWO!\" Shouted from one of the boys his heart sank and started pounding wildly in his chest. Ken gasped as Karim started to walk towards them, muscles rippling with power as he walked and his huge cock rolled in the shorts that seemed to still tear and rip with every movement. Karim gripped his older brother and separated him from Ken who was pushed back to the floor with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair stood in the center of the 'arena' and watched with interest as one of the other boys started to come out from the line of kids and Karim walked back. Karim held his hand low and the boy coming forward high-fived it, with more confidence than Omair would want from a young 13 year old boy going into the ring with him. Ken however sighed with relief as he wouldn't have to see his friend beaten to a pulp this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy came and stood in front of Omair he recognized him as Karim's friend Peter from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim sneered menacingly on the sidelines and focused his abilities onto his friend, waiting for the show to unfurl. Omair watched Peter intensely as Peter seemed to gasp and moan, and shiver noticeably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeters body started to climb higher and higher in front of Omair, who started to stare and whimpered \"..not again! What's going on here?\" Peter grew bigger and bigger infront of Omair, up to eye level and then with a smirk and moan he pushed beyond that. All the while he packed up muscle mass, much the same way Omair's brother had previously. Peter stepped closer to Omair and filled up Omair's view with his wide chest while he grew to an 8 feet tall muscled kid like Karim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING!*</span></div></div>",

For a moment, Omair was starting to get turned on by all of the muscle on Peter's body. His massive pecs that Peter couldn't see over, his tight eight pack abs, and massive biceps that would take an incredibly long time of hard workouts to develop. What shocked Omair the most was Peter's massive cock.<br>\r\nIt wasn't as large as Karims, but it was still a sight to behold. Omair wanted to get out of this crazy wrestling match. He couldn't win, and both his brother, and friend were muscle gods that he wanted to fuck. Hard. He gulped down the thought when Peter took another step twoards him. Suddenly, he heard someone scream from behind him \"TAG-TEAM MATCH!\" Omair turned around in shock to see Ken, standing in the ring. \"Are you CRAZY?!\" Omair cried out. Omair couldn't take Karim, who didn't have as much muscle as Peter. Karim's growth was centered to his crotch, not his muscles. Karim gave a laugh from behind th ring and stepped up. Eyeing Peter before taking stance. Omair noticed that Karim's shorts had ripped more, and showed even more of his massive cock. Even though Karim was his brother, he desperatley wanted to feel up on his body. The bell rung again, signalling the begining of a Tag-Team match. Karim and Peter chared twoards Ken and Omair, and tackled them both in unison. Ken felt his arm snap, and he cried out in pain. Peter laughed at his weakness. <br>\r\n     Peter loved his new body. His mucles were HUGE. His dick had grown to sizes he had never thought possible. it had to be atleast 30 inches long. His pants were threatening to tear any moment when he looked over at Karim. When he tackled Omair, the movement caused his shorts to tear, and his huge cock was hanging out. Peter never thought he could have been gay, but now, he wanted some playtime. The growth was going to Peter's head. <br>\r\n    Karim felt a slight tingle in his cock. He looked to the side and saw Peter touching it. Before Karim could react, Peter screamed \"Time Out!\" A bell rung. Karim knew where Peter was going with it when Peter stepped in to the locker room, and ripped his pants off as the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Omair asked again, a hundred percent certain he must have misheard the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Karim\u2019s solo exhibition game against the high school\u2019s Varsity football team,\u201d Peter explained impatiently as he led them toward the nearest exit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair and Ken realized all of the kids in the hallway with them were also heading for the door.  They emerged into a perfect spring day, with the sun shining brightly overhead and not a cloud in the sky.  To their left the stands enclosing the middle school football field were already packed with people; the trio was among the tail end trickle of the crowd. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?!?\u201d Omair demanded of Peter.  \u201cKarim can\u2019t play against the high school team!  He\u2019ll <u>DIE</u>!\u201d  The thought of his skinny thirteen year-old younger brother being trampled by those senior hulks made him shudder.  Annoying as his little bro might be, Omair certainly didn\u2019t want to see him hurt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Peter snorted sarcastically.  \u201cKarim\u2019s gonna kick their fucking asses so easily!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair and Ken exchanged bewildered looks with each other, both completely lost.  What in the world was going on here?  Was Peter nuts?  Was <i>everyone</i>?!?  Why else would they all allow an event to take place which was this patently ridiculous and potentially dangerous?  The stands seemed to hold the entire population of the middle school and high school student bodies, most of whom were talking excitedly with each other, acting as though they were at a real football game rather than a sick farce.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter took them over to the home team bench where Karim was sitting, dressed in a white football uniform bearing a 01, a helmet resting on the bench next to him.  At the visitor\u2019s bench was the Varsity football team, stretching out and preparing for the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair rushed up to his little brother, placing his hands onto Karim\u2019s shoulders in preparation for shaking some sense into the younger boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seventeen year-old was a bit surprised by just how wide he had to spread his arms.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKarim, you can\u2019t go out there!  You\u2019re gonna get yourself killed!\u201d he insisted.  Behind him Ken nodded in emphatic agreement.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The thirteen year-old smiled, as though he wasn\u2019t about to be completely steamrolled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Omair!  Don\u2019t you have any confidence in your own little brother?\u201d he asked teasingly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, \u201clittle\u201d!\u2019 Omair emphasized.  \u201cThose overgrown monsters will tear you limb from limb!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this heartfelt plea Karim burst out laughing, as if his older brother had said something absolutely hilarious.  Ken tugged urgently on Omair\u2019s arm and he turned around to see the high school player taking the field and their places as the announcer\u2019s voice boomed over the speakers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELCOME TO THE FIRST FOOTBALL GAME OF THE SEASON!  TODAY WE WILL HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING KARIM PLAY AGAINST THE WOODVALE BEARS VARSITY TEAM!  THE GAME WILL BEGIN IN FIVE MINUTES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my cue, bro.  Gotta go!\u201d Karim said flippantly, donning his helmet and standing up.  And up.  And UP!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair\u2019s jaw dropped open in shock as he stared straight ahead at the red 01 emblazoned on the white football jersey stretched tightly across Karim\u2019s extremely broad, deep chest.  What the <b>HELL</b>?!?!  He was five feet eleven inches, yet his barely teenage younger brother was now over a head taller than he was!  The towering thirteen year-old also appeared far more buff and muscular than Omair would ever have thought possible!  Without warning Karim started forward, effortlessly knocking Omair onto the latter\u2019s ass as he energetically jogged onto the field.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen helped his stunned best friend up, the two of them sinking down onto the bench, ignoring the nearby Peter\u2019s smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre-are you seeing what I\u2019m seeing?\u201d Omair managed to mumble to his best friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seeing a terrifyingly big Karim about to go solo against the entire Varsity football team?\u201d                      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the seventeen year-old answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Ken agreed bleakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both glanced over to where Karim stood alone, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ref blew his whistle and amid the roar of the crowd play began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even a single teammate to snap the ball to him, Karim simply tucked it under one now-massively muscular arm and charged forward.  He smashed through the defensive line like a runaway locomotive, the impact sending numerous blocking opponents flying.  Other opposing players threw themselves at the Pakistani-American powerhouse, only to be swatted aside like annoying insects and brutally thrown to the turf.  Although Karim was now the tallest one on the field, the combined mass of his opponents should have still managed to pull him down.  Somehow, however, Karim\u2019s incredible, awe-inspiring strength kept him powering relentlessly forward, trampling and crushing underfoot the fools who had dared try to stop him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair and Ken watched in wide-eyed disbelief as the dark-haired adolescent Atlas bull-dozed through the final players standing his way.  Wild cheers broke out from the spectators to celebrate Karim\u2019s first touchdown.  The monumentally muscular tower of power swaggered back toward the fifty-yard line, casually waving to his innumerable enthusiastic supporters.  On the opposite end the Bears were slowly, disconsolately picking themselves up, some helping off the field teammates too injured to leave it by themselves.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blinking, he looked around, trying to figure out where he was and how he got there. From the looks of the furniture, the beams and the wooden walls, Omair had to say he was in a cabin of some sort. A big cabin....a VERY big. The ceiling was so high up that it must've been several stories high, and the length of the room was comparable with a high school football stadium. Despite the enormity of the space, the furniture looked normal enough. A cozy looking couch, some arm chairs, a wide broad table and a cheery fireplace. On the far side he spotted what looked like a kitchen and some really over sized openings leading to different parts of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair turned around to find his friend Ken standing behind him, looking bewildered as he was. \"Ken, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask the same thing.\" Ken said. \"The last thing I remember was being at your place, and now suddenly we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, me too!\" Omair said. \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Ken said, looking around. \"I don't think there was a place this big anywhere near home though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they looked, Omair spotted a window. Going up to it, he took a peek outside. When Omair looked out, he saw nothing but white. Outside of the cabin a fierce blizzard was roaring, and for a moment Omair spotted far off mountains before his vision was swallowed up by snow once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, i think we're in a cabin in the mountains.\" Omair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did we get up into the mountains?\" Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair just returned a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that hit to your heads you guys took must've really jarred your brains if you can't remember we won this trip up here.\" A familiar voice said behind them.

Karim was more than a foot shorter than he was, and skinny as a rail. There's no reason he should be fearful\u2026 and yet, Omair felt a very strong wave of dread wash over him. \"Where'd you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim grinned and giggled. \"The same place you came from, silly. The four of us were dropped off in a limo just about ten minutes ago, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" This didn't seem at all familiar to Omair, and didn't didn't really make any sense. What limo could come up a mountainside in a blizzard like this? Omair shook his head, trying to clear it, and turned to his friend. \"Do you remember any Limo, Ken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm\u2026\" Ken looked like he was lost in thought for a few seconds, blinking a few times in rapid succession. \"I-- I really can't say. My memory is really fuzzy right now\u2026 We didn't go on a bender or anything did we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Ken, you know neither of us drink.\" Still, the feeling was probably pretty close to a hangover, Omair realized. He didn't remember very much of anything immediately preceding them waking up here, he had a pretty bad headache, and he felt sore all over. Looking at Ken, he too seemed to be dealing with much the same effects. \"At least, I don't think we drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around the cabin, Omair tried to piece together everything. Something seemed wrong, very wrong about all this. The cabin was so large, and so tall -- what kind of mountainside cabin would have so much space for just a few people? And why could he not remember anything after being at home with Ken? And Karim\u2026 he was behaving kind of strangely, like he had a secret or something, and the reaction Omair got from seeing Karim was very unsettling. He didn't quite know why, but he didn't like what was going on. Not one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second,\" Omair said, spinning back around to face Karim. \"You said 'four of us'? Who's the fourth? Did mom or dad come with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Karim shook his head. \"No, of course not!\" Omair and Ken both turned their head towards the far side of the cabin, where they heard someone walking in from the other room, as Karim continued. \"The other person here is\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

What are you doing here?\" Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, the same reason we're all here?\" Dan rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, right...\" Ken looked over at his friend, but Omair was equally clueless. For some reason the fact that Dan was there seemed really off, like he didn't belong there. But then again, the entire situation was one huge head splitter. They had no idea how or why they were in a remote cabin in the mountains, and with the raging blizzard outside it looked like they weren't leaving any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey 'big' bro,\" Karim said, bringing Omair's attention back towards him. Something about how Karim said 'big' seemed to feel like he was being mocked at. \"I'm getting hungry, cook us something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're stuck in the middle of nowhere in a blizzard and you want to eat?\" Omair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, you have to take care of us remember? You're suppose to tend to me and Dan's every need.\" Karim told him a little too smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it twerp, I can pick you up and throw you ten feet into the snow.\" Omair warned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim just let out a laugh, as if he knew something that Omair didn't, and it only pissed him off even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there even any food in this place?\" Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there's tons.\" Dan said, pointing towards the kitchen. \"There's a huge fridge in there with enough food to feed a family of four for a month, and if that wasn't enough there is a storage room loaded with tons more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we might as well eat something. There's no point in trying to wait out a blizzard on an empty stomach.\" Ken shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair gave an uneasy nod as he followed everyone into the kitchen. For some reason he couldn't help but think that something big was going to happen to them. And what made him even more worried was that whatever it was, Karim seemed to be looking forward to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There wasn't a microwave in the kitchen, but Omair was relieved to see the oven seemed to work just fine, and heated up quickly. Placing a large pan of lasagna in the oven, Omair set the timer for the recommend time of thirty-five minutes, then sat down at the table next to Karim and Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Karim asked. \"I told you, we're hungry!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ovens take time!\" Omair protested. \"You'll just have to wait for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Grinning, Karim pointed to the oven. \"You might wanna check again, 'big' bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Omair stood up and walked over to the oven. \"Okay, okay, but just to humor--\" He stopped himself, seeing that the timer now read blinking zeroes. \"What the-- The power didn't go out, did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up behind him, Ken shook his head. \"No, I don't think so. At least, the lights didn't flicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then did I set the timer right?\" Omair opened the oven, shocked to feel heat coming out of it, way too much for the oven only having been on for less than a minute. Looking at the lasagna, it appeared to be complete, a little bit of visible steam rising from it. \"How-- how is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omair!\" Karim cried out, banging his fists against the table. \"Hurry up! We're STARVING!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair scowled at his younger brother but grabbed a potholder and pulled out the pan, placing it on the counter. Taking a knife, he sliced it up and put two slices on four plates, bringing them over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he set them down, both Karim and Dan dove into the food, sucking it down almost as rapidly as a vacuum. \"Easy, guys,\" Omair said. Pace your-- HEY!\" He watched in shock as the two finished their own plates, then immediately grabbed the ones Omair had set down for him and Ken. \"What do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth still full, Karim looked up from the food for only a moment, a goofy grin on his face. \"You'd better get some more meals ready. You don't want to keep us waiting again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing his eyes, Omair nevertheless went back to the fridge, grabbing a chicken dinner and placing it in the oven, being careful not to burn himself. After doing so, he looked back at the two younger boys, noticing that, as they ate, their clothes seemed to be getting just a tad bit tighter, a little bit of their stomachs now starting to be revealed. \"That's weird,\" he whispered to Ken. \"Do they seem a little bigger to you? Not like fatter or anything, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ken nodded in agreement. \"And the strangest thing is, this seems a little familiar. Like something like this has happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair felt his heart skip a beat at hearing Ken say this. \"Yeah! I've been feeling that way too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim and Dan both finished at the same time, tossing their plates aside. \"More!\" Karim yelled, as the two younger brothers looked at the older boys expectedly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though both Ken and Omair were both full, Dan and Karim were both demanding for more food. \"Haven't you two had enough? You eat too much, you're going to get a stomachache!\" Omair warned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're still soooo hungry!\" Dan said. As if on cue, both of their stomachs growled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill skeptical, Omair went to the fridge and checked to see what was in it. He grabbed a casserole dish loaded with mac and cheese and stuck it into the oven. He began to reach for the timer when Karim cleared his throat. Skeptical, he opened the oven just a crack and peeked in. The mac and cheese was already all bubbly and browned beautifully on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell does this oven cook food this fast?\" Omair said as he took it out and set it on the counter in front of the two kids. Immediately Karim and Dan dove in, shoving the mac and cheese into their greedy little mouths. Within three minutes they had completely eaten it clean. \"More!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you both eat so much and still be hungry?\" Ken asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, we're both growing boys!\" Karim said with a very broad and mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the way Karim said that made Omair look them over again. He had thought so before, but now he was almost sure that the two boys were indeed bigger than before. Their once baggy t-shirts were now a bit on the tight side, and whenever they lifted food up to their mouths, their sleeves would slide back and Omair could swear that he saw what looked like some developing arm muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Omair, we\u2019re hungry!\u201d Dan said, his stomach growling once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright alright!\u201d Omair went back to the fridge to see what he could find. From there on he went into a cooking routine. He would grab some random item from the fridge and stick it into the oven, only to open it up right away to find the food perfectly cooked. When he took it out and set it in front of the two boys, they would immediately devour it and demand more, and Omair would start the cycle all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Omair turned around, he could swear that Dan and Karim were both bigger than before. It was as if each bite of food was immediately converted into mass that was added onto their bodies. Was it the food that was making them grow? No, that couldn\u2019t be it, after all both he and Ken had eaten it and nothing had happened to either of them. He wanted to think more on it, but then the two hungry mouths would scream for more food. Soon both Omair and Ken were rushing to meet the demands of their brothers, who seemed to eat everything as fast as the magic oven could cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like forever, Omair and Ken went to the fridge to grab another dish, but found the shelves completely bare. The two kids had eaten everything! Turning around, the two teens looked at their brothers and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the seats were not two little boys. In their place were two, huge, hulking figures. During the course of their little meal, they had grown to over six feet tall, their bodies filling up with large, well developed muscle that could hold their own in any amateur bodybuilding competition. They looked like they must\u2019ve weighed 220-230 lbs each of solid rock hard muscle! Their clothes were now skin tight on them, hugging every curve and crevice of their new bodies. Because their bodies had stretched longer, the bottom of their shirts had ridden up, exposing 4 inches of some of the most ripped, defined abs Omair and Ken had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what happened to you two!?\u201d Ken exclaimed, his eyes bulging as much as his brother\u2019s new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had lunch.\u201d Dan said, leaning back in his seat and rubbing his ripped abs contently and gave a loud buuuuurp .\u201dWhoops, excuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you we were growing boys.\u201d Karim said as he flexed an arm, causing a huge 18 inch bicep to pop out. \u201cAnd growing boys need their food.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow their puny, shrimpy little brothers had grown into imposingly statuesque teenage muscle-studs, in only half a freaking hour!  It was crazy!  Once again, though, as with the food and the odd oven, the older teens were given no time to think about what had happened.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow that our meal is done, let\u2019s have some fun!\u201d Dan suggested.  \u201cC\u2019mon, bro, let\u2019s arm-wrestle,\u201d the overgrown giant of a thirteen year-old urged, confidently brandishing his bronzed, much more muscular arm down on the kitchen table.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I-I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Ken stuttered, wide eyes still locked on the half a foot taller, brutally handsome Japanese Hercules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro, I wasn\u2019t asking,\u201d Dan warned threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older boy swallowed nervously, looking over beseechingly at Omair, who could only shrug back at him helplessly.  What could they do?  The raging blizzard outside had trapped the two friends in this remote cabin with their impossibly enlarged, enormously empowered kid brothers!  There was no way to escape, and as for resisting . . . well, Ken and Omair had made liberal use of the unwritten law that older brothers could pound on their smaller siblings who bugged them.  Now that Dan and Karim had essentially become <u>their</u> terrifyingly <b>BIG</b> brothers, the last thing either wanted to do was piss off these newly dominant alpha males.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen reluctantly slipped into the opposite chair and placed his own toned, fit arm on the table.  Even seated, Dan loomed like a mountain, utterly dwarfing his Varsity swimmer elder brother with his magnificent stature and muscle mass.  Not wanting to look up into that cocky, flawless visage, Ken stared determinedly ahead into the fabric-covered wall of muscle which was Dan\u2019s phenomenal chest.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe two clasped hands, Ken\u2019s almost lost in his brother\u2019s, as Karim counted them down.  When he shouted \u201cGo\u201d, Ken, to his credit, threw himself into the competition, giving it all he had.  Unfortunately for him, Dan\u2019s tree-trunk thick arm stood steady as the Rock of Gibraltar, not budging a single millimeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d the challenger taunted cockily.  \u201cI can\u2019t even feel you trying!  You\u2019d better use both arms.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nKnowing it was fruitless, Ken nonetheless tried, but his two arms put together weren\u2019t as thick with muscle as the right arm of the towering, chiseled Asian Adonis opposing him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a theatrical yawn, Dan contemptuously took both of Ken\u2019s hands down to the table in the blink of an eye, his carved, peaked mountain of a bicep not even bulging from the minimal effort required.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty pathetic, bro,\u201d the victor gloated as he released his older brother.  \u201cYou should try to build some real muscle, like Karim and I did.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStung by the insult, Ken opened his mouth to make a sharp reply, but the ease and swiftness of his defeat in this contest of strength killed that impulse.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Karim rose up from the table.  He peeled off his black, seven sizes too small shirt, fully revealing the sculpted slabs of his dusky, perfect pectoral muscles and his cobblestone, killer eight-pack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Omair, we don\u2019t have to arm-wrestle,\u201d he mock-reassured as he came around the table and strode predatorily toward his older brother.  \u201cLet\u2019s just wrestle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair stumbled backwards purely on fear-filled instinct.  While this pair of brothers was much closer in height, Karim having the advantage of only a few inches, the Olympian younger boy was tremendously better built than the older one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stood up to try to go to his friend\u2019s aid, but Dan caught his upper arm in an unbreakable, iron grasp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them have their fun, little brother,\u201d he ordered Ken in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon backed into a corner, Omair was forced to engage with Karim and was then repeatedly twisted into painful pretzel-shapes by the mighty Pakistani-American powerhouse!  After ten pain-wracked minutes, Karim finally let Omair collapse into a heap on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are such wusses!\u201d Karim complained.  \u201cWe're going . . .   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He heaved the giant meal over to the two young boys, both cheering as they saw this veritable mountain of meat being delivered to them. They dug in, smacking and gobbling as they shoved huge forkfuls of meat into their mouths, resorting to using their bare hands to cram wedges of potato into after the forks, barely giving themselves any room to chew and swallow. It was like they were trying to force as much food into their bodies as fast as they could and yet neither of them showed any signs of cramping up or even mild discomfort! It was just another weird layer to add to this already towering cake of strangeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair jumped as he felt Ken's warm hand press down on his shoulder, getting his attention. \"What?\" Omair said, turning to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say...there's something that's even WEIRDER here than anything that's happened while we've been in this cabin.\" Ken said, glancing over at his little brother, his eyes widening slightly as it looked like Dan's clothes getting even tighter on him, fully revealing his trim stomach, the shirt sleeves so tight around his arms they looked ready to give way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Even weirder than us being stranded in a cabin the size of a couple of football stadiums with our younger brothers who are eating food out of a magic oven and getting BIGGER?\" Omair hissed at Ken, glancing over at Karim, gulping as he saw the young man stretch, his lengthening arms subtly reaching higher every few seconds, his shirt tearing right down the middle over his chest, revealing an athletic set of pecs he hadn't had before. He was starting to look similar in build to Ken, a high level swimmer. Karim chuckled and grinned at his brother, running a single finger down his smooth chest, giving him a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair shivered, a memory briefly rising from the depths of his mind, like a humpback whale preparing to breach, almost breaking the surface before falling back down to the deepest ocean. WHY did he keep having these strange feelings? What was he not remembering? Before he could dwell on it for very long, two very loud, resounding belches filled the air, both kids holding their bellies, their mouths wide open as the air gushed from their mouths, ending in a drawn out sigh of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting...\" Ken said quietly, wrinkling his nose a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby.\" Dan threw back, pushing his chair back and jumping to his feet. \"That was great! I'm already looking forward to dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we don't have to rush anything.\" Karim said, walking over to his friend, wrapping an arm around his shoulder. \"We've got aaaaaaall the time in the world, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Omair asked, taking a step closer to Karim, hesitating when he saw the formerly short boy was now almost as tall as him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, YOU don't have to worry about it.\" Karim said, planting a hand on Omair's chest and pushing him back. \"You'll find out soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan chuckled and wrapped his arm around Karim's waist, leaning in closer to him. \"So...how about you give me a \"tour\" of the bedroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim turned his full focus on Dan and said, \"I thought you'd never ask. See you later boys! Dan and I have some...other business to attend to. But don't feel left out! We'll be back for you two very, VERY soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those almost foreboding words, the pair ran off together, still holding on to each other, giggling as they disappeared through one of the gigantic openings into what was presumably a bedroom. Before Omair or Ken could do anything, a deep creaking sound filled the air, an enormous wooden door suddenly closing, blocking off all entry to the room Karim and Dan had entered. \"How...did they close...agh, never mind!\" Omair shouted, grabbing his hair in frustration. \"What were you trying to say before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed and said, \"Don't you think it's a little ODD that Dan is here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No odder than Karim being here. Or US being here.\" Omair said, shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? It doesn't dawn on you that it's weird my little brother is here when I don't HAVE a little brother?!\" Ken shouted, shaking Omair's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You've always had a little...brother....\" Omair replied, his voice hesitating slightly near the end of the sentence. \"Haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I saw him, I KNEW there was something off.\" Ken said, starting to pace a little. \"I mean...even though my brain is telling me that that kid is my little brother I just KNOW I've never seen him before in my life, that I've ALWAYS been an only child. This whole situation is just...impossible! I keep feeling like there's these memories that are just out of reach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way.\" Omair said, wrapping his arms around Ken. \"Whatever the heck is going on here, we'll get through it okay? Together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed and nodded, leaning his head against Omair's chest. Even in this insane situation, just having his very close friend with him through it all made Ken feel more at ease...at least until</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ken and Omair stood together in the kitchen, not saying a word. Ken continued to rest his head on his best friend's chest, enjoying the warmth of the toned swimmer's pecs underneath Omair's shirt. Omair continued to reach mentally for any possible memory that could help him figure out what was going on. All that Omair could remember was going into Ken's attic, and then everything went blank up until the point that he was cooking dinner for Karim and Dan. In fact, just like he and Ken had agreed, Omair couldn't remember Dan existing until only a few minutes ago. However, the weirdest thing about the situation was the younger boy's reaction to the food Ken and Omair had made for them. In one moment, the two friends were feeding scrawny teens, but before they could believe it, Dan and Karim were suddenly much different than they had been mere minutes ago. Omair couldn't shake the sight of Karim's pecs swelling out of his shirt, tearing the fabric almost to the point of being able to see his nipples. Dan had undergone the same changes. His arms were thicker, much more defined, and his shoulders threatened to tear his shirt apart at the seams if he moved too suddenly. Omair distinctly remembered as the boys were leaving that they were taller than usual. Their already tight shirts exposed more of their tight torsos. Even their pants were tighter, promptly displaying their more pronounced asses and thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omair, I just don't know what's wrong here, but I know something is.\" Ken muttered into his chest.<br>\r\n\"I was thinking the same thing. Our brothers know something we don't. Maybe they know how we got here, and why they're growing.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should try and get the answers from them?\" Ken suggested, looking up at his friend.<br>\r\n\"But how would we do that?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, try and ease them into a conversation and see if they tell us what we want to know?\"<br>\r\n\"It's worth a try, I guess.\" Omair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the two teens walked down the hall towards the bedroom where Dan and Karim had gone. The door was cracked, causing Ken and Omair to stop outside and listen into their conversation. Rather than a conversation, Ken and Omair heard a strange sound coming from behind the door. The two boys looked at each other in concern. Taking initiative, they both began to peek through the crack in the open door. What they saw was far different from what they expected. Instead of finding two teen boys sitting and talking, they found two boys in their underwear making out on the bed. From Ken and Omair's vantage point, they had a perfect view of Dan's firm ass in his tight underwear as he grinded his hard cock against Karim's bulge. The sound they had heard was clearly the sound of the younger teens having their fun with each other. Ken and Omair were immediately hard at the sight. It felt wrong to both of them to be watching the younger teens without them knowing, but the older teens couldn't take their eyes off of the erotic sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, the teens were developing well with their growth. From what they could tell, Dan's back was tell toned, and his ass pushed out farther than it normally would. Since they were only staring at him from a rear-view, the small glimpses they got of his bulge did not show the full length, but what Ken and Omair saw was still quite impressive. And from Karim's moans as he sucked on Dan's tongue, it was clear he was greatly enjoying Dan's administrations. Both Ken and Omair were taken by surprise when Karim gripped Dan's wrists and rolled them both over so that he was on top of Dan. Now the spying teens had a frontal view of the others, giving Ken and Omair a prefect view of the rest of their bodies when Karim came up to breathe for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen felt himself getting harder in his pants upon seeing Karim's muscled torso, glistening with sweat. His pecs heaved up and down with each breath. Karim's abs were prominent and tight, but what really caught his spies' attention was the massive, throbbing cock dripping precum in his tight underwear. Ken briefly wondered how large Karim was before he grew, but he was taken out of his thoughts when they heard Karim talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have some guests, Dan.\" Karim chuckled. \"Hey, boys. Don't be shy. Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair looked at each other in fear. How did the grinning teen know they were watching him and his friend through the door? However, both boys reasoned that running away was no use. Omair slowly pushed open the door, giving Dan and Karim a chance to see Ken and Omair standing in the door, their hard cocks showing through their pants. Karim grinned, his cock throbbing harder at the sight of his older brother and friend getting hard while watching him make out with Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a better idea than taking care of each other, Karim.\" Dan said suggestively, his voice resonating a little deeper than Ken remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dan, why don't you tell us?\" Karim responded, sharing a grin with Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that they should take care of us, so we can sit back and have some real fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Karim both felt themselves throb harder in their underwear at the thought, an obvious sign of praise for the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's not such a bad idea, Dan. In fact, I think it might work. If Ken pleasures me while Omair takes care of you, I think we can have some real fun before our next meal. Get over here boys, and get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair were speechless. Neither one of them could believe what they were being told to do. Karim was obviously asking them to suck their cocks. As turned on as they were, neither Ken nor Omair wanted to pleasure the horny teens before them. However, both of the older teens found themselves walking towards the bed as if Karim had magical control over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, boys. Why don't you start with your mouths?\" Karim moaned, grasping his thick cock through his underwear before pulling them down. Dan followed suit, moaning as he imagined Omair's mouth around his thick meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's mind was screaming for him to stop and leave immediately, but he couldn't control himself as he climbed onto the bed and grabbed Karim's cock. The pulsing dick was warm in his hands, and slick with precum. Before continuing, Ken looked over to find Omair doing as he did; grasing Dan's cock and giving it a few gentle strokes, causing the horny Asian teen to throw his head back and moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah. That's it, Omair. Get to work.\" Dan groaned. Omair followed the teen's orders, bringing the 8 inch cock to his face and dragging his tongue slowly across the dripping, purple head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, that feels so fucking good. Just like that. Yeah.\" Dan moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ken, don't let Dan and Omair have all the fun.\" Karim teased, prompting for Ken to take Karim in his mouth. \"Ohh, yeah. Your mouth feels so good.\" Karim groaned, gripping the back of Ken's head, forcing him further on the fat meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair couldn't believe themselves. First, they were spying on two teen boys as they were making out, and then before they knew it, they were sucking off the same two boys they spied on. Their minds were reeling, trying to figure out how they had gotten themselves in this situation, and why they were obeying their younger brothers, but their bodies refused to listen. Omair found himself actually enjoying the taste of Dan's salty precum. While Omair was busy at work on Dan's cock, the horny teen boy grabbed at Omair's shirt and tore it off of his back. Dan ran his hand up and down Omair's smooth, lightly toned back before pushing his hand into Omair's pants. Omair pulled his face off of Dan's cock to protest, but instead he let out a moan as he felt Dan's fingers running over his tight asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to work, or I might have to punish you.\" Dan growled. He looked over at Ken and Karim, pleased to find that Karim had moved his bottom into a more suitable position. Ken was laying on his back, entirely naked with the torn remains of his clothes scattered around their hand of the bed. Karim positioned himself over Ken, and started to fuck his face. Karim's heavy balls slapped against Ken's chin with each thrust into his mouth, increasing Karim's arousal. Ken was having a hard time taking the entire length of Karim's cock down his throat. Karim's cock was larger than Dan's, standing at a proud 9.5 inches, nearly choking Ken with each thrust. If it weren't for Karim's excessive precum slicking up his cock, Ken would never have been able to take Karim's huge meat during his sexual onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, boys. This is fucking hot.\" Karim moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Omair. Fuck, I'm so close.\" Dan groaned, gripping Omair's head with both hands, forcing more of his throbbing cock into Omair's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older teens were flooded with panic. How could they let themselves become the sex slaves of their horny teen brothers? If they didn't stop Dan and Karim soon, what would become of them? The older teens feared what would happen if their brothers would want more than just their mouths.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>BANG BANG BANG</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK!\" Already on edge, Omair jumped at the loud rasps coming from the front door of the cabin. He stared at it for a moment, trying to make out any movement through the frosted glass on either side of it, but didn't see anything. \"Who could that be?\" he asked Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A delivery, perhaps?\" Ken shrugged. \"But then who'd deliver during the middle of a blizzard out in the middle of nowhere like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys both held their breath, waiting for more knocking, but none came. Finally, after nearly a minute, Omair took a slow step over to the front door. There was no peephole he could look through, and even up this close, the glass was too opaque to be able to see anything through. The only way to find out what was there was to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, he reached out and unlocked the deadbolt. He then grabbed the handle and slowly pulled it open with a soft creaking sound, revealing--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow began blowing inside the cabin, and Omair's teeth had already begun to chatter at the cold air pouring in. He started to shut the door again, when he saw a small cardboard box sitting on the doormat. He picked it up and brought it inside, shutting and locking the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Ken asked, peering over his friend's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair turned around, holding the box up to his face, examining it. \"I have no idea.\" There were no markings or labels on the box to indicate where it came from or even who delivered it. It wasn't even taped up; the edges were simply folded in on each other to keep it shut. \"It's not heavy at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair did as his friend instructed. Inside the box, underneath a few layers of bubble wrap, was a simple bronze-colored pendant attached to a golden chain. He picked up the pendant and looked at it, turning it over in his hands. Both sides of the pendant seemed worn down with age, and there was some form of writing on one side, but it was too faded to be legible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken,\" Omair asked, \"does this pendant seem... familiar to you at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, w--\" Ken stopped, squinting his eyes and taking a closer look. \"Actually, now that you mention it, it does. I feel like I've seen that before, but I can't place where or when.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could discuss this further, though, the sound of something crashing, followed by a series of loud moans, came in from the bedroom at the other end of the cabin. The two boys exchanged worried looks, then dashed towards that end of the cabin, pushing agains the heavy, imposing wooden door that stretched up almost all the way to the ceiling some thirty feet above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door didn't budge an inch, though. And, from the other side, the moaning only got louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.\" Ken banged his fist against the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what it sounds like they're doing,\" Omair said, turning around and leaning his back against the door, \"do you really want to be in there with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Ken cried out. \"I mean, no. I mean... Something's not right here, with them, with... with that--\" he gestured towards the pendant still in Omair's hand. \"I just want some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Omair said. \"And I have this nagging feeling that we're forgetting about something important. I just wish we could remember what that was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in his hand, the pendant started to glow, causing both boys to gasp. They then both simultaneously saw a rapid succession of images flash before their eyes: Omair twelve feet tall in Ken's attic; Karim making his wish and causing the pendant to split in half; the young teen turning into a giant, hulking monster that demolished their neighbor's house and couldn't be stopped; them each hanging from one of Karim's nipples for dear life. Everything became crystal clear to them all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pendant!\" Ken exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karim!\" Omair replied with the same urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wait, how was he back to not being a hundred-foot-tall behemoth?\" Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Omair answered, \"but both he and Dan, whoever Dan is, were both getting larger before they went in there. Whatever they did must be still at work. Which means, now that we have the pendant, and it seems to be working again, we can get in there and stop them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Ken cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair turned to the door still blocking their path and held out the pendant. \"I wish that this door would open for us!\" The pendant glowed, followed by a creak as the door budged forward several inches, enough for the two of them to squeeze through the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they saw inside, though, made them stop dead in their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim and Dan were both nearly three times as tall as they had been when they went into the bedroom, both fully nude, the tattered remains of their clothing lying at their feet. A few feet to their right, a large chest-of-drawers lay on its side with its contents half-spilled out, no doubt the source of the crashing sound Ken and Omair had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim stood behind Dan, kissing down the back of his neck, causing Dan to let out a series of loud, sensual moans. Karim simultaneously rubbed Dan's chest with his left hand while with his right he stroked Dan's shaft, which had to be at least two feet long. Copious amounts of pre poured out its tip onto the floor. Karim's own shaft, equally as long and equally as hard, pressed into Dan's back, and though it didn't leak as much as Dan's, the scent of the two boys' arousal was combining into an overpowering musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys' physiques had also noticeably changed. Karim sported the perfect swimmer's build with tight pecs and a noticeable, defined v-section, and firm, bubbly hips and ass, which Dan used both his hands to grip onto the sides of. Dan hadn't developed quite as fast as Karim had, but his smooth, tight body looked much more like a young teenager's now than the skinny twelve-year-old boy they had been looking at before. He also seemed to have grown slightly taller than Karim, as he had to spread his legs further apart to allow him to be able to have the proper reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two younger boys were so engrossed in each other that they hadn't noticed the door opening. Mixed feelings ran through both Omair and Ken. They couldn't deny the site before them was incredibly hot, but they had to get to the bottom of this and stop Karim before he became the lustful beast he had been back in their neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair quickly put the chain of the pendant around his neck so as not to lose it, then held it and closed his eyes. \"I wish Karim would stop growing, go back to normal, and we can put all of this behind us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath and opened his eyes, watching for any changes. Within a few minutes, he realized...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karim's cock throbbed and pulsed larger as he hatched a brilliant plan for Ken and Omair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim thought back to Omair growing in Ken's attic. Before, Karim had never been so turned on, thinking Omair was the hottest thing ever after he'd grown. But now, Karim thought it would be even higher to rub Omair's grown body against his eternally swelling dick.<br>\r\nThe thought made his huge penis leak precum and throb harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim looked down at the two teens in his swelling palm. They looked so small in comparison to his massive hand, and it turned him on even more. <br>\r\n\"Alright, boys. It's time we had some fun around here.\" Karim spoke, making both boys stare up at him in fear, only making Karim even hornier.<br>\r\n\"I'm really close to getting off at this point, if you can't tell. But I need something a little... extra.\" He murmured, moaning gently as his body continued to swell even larger.<br>\r\nKen and Omair wondered what Karim meant by that. What did Karim mean by extra?<br>\r\nTheir questions were quickly answered as Karim's hand began to move closer to his pulsing cock. The large, dark tower of meat gave off a warmth that the boys found comforting, but only for a moment before they were pressed against the hot penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf matters weren't already bad enough, Karim's hand began to pump up and down around the massive cock, his hand not even able to reach fully around it. However, he easily held Ken and Omair in his grip while he stroked his meat. Precum made his motions smoother, but gave no relief to either of the boys in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim had never felt so good in his life. He was now the biggest person ever, while still growing. The incredible pleasure from growing, mixed with the sensation of masturbating was almost too much. Not only, however, was he just jacking off, but he was getting himself off with two teenage boys in his hand. The thought alone brought him closer to the edge, but the feeling of two teens pressed against his monster cock made the entire experience even better than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim's hips bucked in pleasure as the Pakistani God stroked his massive penis with a horny fury. Hundreds of people stood below Karim watching in fear as he brought himself closer and closer to an orgasm.<br>\r\nWith his free hand, Karim rubbed his hand up and down his solid torso. The novel sensation of feeling his muscled body only brought him closer and closer. <br>\r\nKarim's hand often stopped to grab and fondle his large pecs. The massive mounds of muscle were so large that even bodybuilders would feel envy if Karim were a comparable size.<br>\r\nOccasionally, Karim's hand would graze his brown nipples, sending a shock of intense pleasure throughout his growing body.<br>\r\nWhen he first started growing, his nipples gave him a great sensation when he would fondle them, but now, as his pecs had grown beyond belief, the large brown nubs became very sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair wished they were running from this godly teen trying to stop his power hungry growth, instead of being coated in precum and violently stroked against a massive cock.<br>\r\nAs erotic as the situation was, Ken and Omair were hardly turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim, on the other hand, was hornier than he'd ever been. He felt the hot orgasm building in the base of his cock, while he stroked both teens in his hand. <br>\r\nThis was the hottest thing he'd ever done. The power was going straight to his head as he continued to show his godly power to Ken and Omair. This sexual pleasure continued to build up until Ken and Omair felt Karim's cock pulse violently, and then suddenly they heard a loud scream of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, they could see cum shooting out of Karim's cock, flying far into the distance as his hips bucked wildly in pleasure.<br>\r\nThe orgasm lasted several minutes, along with Karim moaning and groaning the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cumshot subsided, Karim took his hand from the throbbing meat to grin at Ken and Omair.<br>\r\n\"Fuck, that felt good...\" He moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Omair were horrified. They just helped get Karim off when they should've been running and trying to repair the pendant.</span></div></div>",

He could feel the muscle that was holding him growing. He head was resting on Omair\u2019s pec and he could feel it slowly ballooning to larger sizes.

Having to crawl on his hands and knees to get through his front door, cradling Ken in one arm, Omair chuckled. \"Once we get your ankle taken care of,\" he said, \"we should wish me back down to normal size. Or at least small enough to be able to walk around the house normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Ken said playfully as he hugged Omair's pecs tightly, \"you're no fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair sat Ken down on the couch in the living room. \"Now rest here for a few minutes while I go call a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Ken nodded, and waited until Omair made his way out of the room. Once he was sure his giant friend was out of earshot, he whispered, \"I wish my ankle would keep hurting from this moment on.\" Instantly, he felt the pain go away, and he stood up, testing it gingerly at first. Satisfied that it was as strong as before, he walked over to the kitchen where Omair was frowning while looking at a phone, which looked doll-sized in his huge hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid phone,\" Omair muttered. \"I can't hit the right buttons. My fingers are too big.\" He turned to Ken, still frowning slightly. \"Why are you here? I thought you were going to rest that ankle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Ken said as he placed a hand on Omair's shoulder and smiled comfortingly. \"I think I just had stepped on it wrong and pulled the muscle for a bit. It feels fine now. See?\" He quickly did a little dancing move, shuffling his weight from one foot to another to prove that his ankle was feeling strong, then immediately broke into a big laugh. \"I'm fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then,\" Omair said. \"That's a relief!\" He tried to put the phone back in the cradle but instead slammed it into place, knocking it to the ground with a large crash. \"Dammit! Being a giant kinda sucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother didn't seem to think so,\" Ken said with a smirk. \"I'm sure there are pros and cons to it, like with anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair nodded. \"Yeah, but at least right now, I think I would like to be back to my normal height. Can you make me smaller, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed, thinking this over for a minute, trying to decide what he should do. On one hand, he didn't want to make Omair uncomfortable. On the other, he sure did like how sexy he looked big and muscular\u2026 and naked. \"Talk about your pros and cons,\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Ken shook his head, trying to play it off, \"nothing.\" Taking a deep breath, Ken made up his mind on what to do next. </span></div></div>",

Instead, they were actually swelling with mass and bulk. Ken shook his head ferociously and said, \"No...no no NO! This can't be happening...how...why---\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's questions were drowned as Omair's godly brother moaned again, groaning as his balls continued to swell, feeling more and more of himself coming into existence. Omair said not a word as Ken's wish simply added onto Karim's, and the god-like boy pulsed and grew larger and larger with each passing second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moaning subsided, only to be replaced with a deepening chuckle which grew into fully fledged, evil laughs. It was Karim. The two boys looked puzzled to eachother, only to cover their ears as Karim's earsplitting voice burst through the air mockingly, \"Awwww, something wrong boys? I know what you're trying to do, it won't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's eyes widened as he continued to shake his head, tears rolling down his face as the giant spoke, \"The pendant broke when I made my wish, that means ANY wish is going to just keep adding on to mine, no matter what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen dropped to his knees sobbing, as Omair just gaped at his brother's statement, \"You see boys, you can't stop a god. I mean look at me!\" The ground shook and rumbled as the titan rose up and up, higher and higher. The cocky teen forced each and every one of his monstrous muscles to swell up, rivers of veins coming to the surface. All the while more mass being piled onto his frame. Karim smiled broadly at their fear, and he continued to smile as he spoke, \"No matter what you do, no matter what you wish for, there's no stopping this. I'm just going to keep getting what I want now. I'm <i>never</i> going to stop growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat very word, <b>never</b>, sent the most chilling shiver down the boy's spines. The menacing laugh broke through the air again, as he looked down upon the two boys, \"I'm just going to keep getting bigger....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to surge. He pulsed with size and muscle. He groaned as his massive formed continued to tower over everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And bigger.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill growing exponentially bigger and faster, he reveled in his literal godhood. He clenched his gargantuan fist and felt his arm surge with unbelievable strength. He could do anything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <b>BIGGER!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCackling like a madman, Ken felt as though his life was flashing before his eyes, and Omair looked at him with sorrow. The two boys quivered at what they heard next. Something that they wished would never had been said. What Karim was asking for now was simply insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh....now boys, I could just simply kill you both now without even blinking. I wouldn't even feel a thing. Fuck that, it won't be long before I crush everything. I'm offering you two a chance at living the longest. All I ask is one teency weency, tiny favor....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. \"Help your god grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering with pure terror, Ken didn't know what to do exactly.

The pendant in his hands glowed briefly before dying out like all the other times. For a brief moment Ken hoped that nothing would happen this time, that his wish wasn't granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" Karim moaned, thrusting his chest out. And out. And OUT! To Ken's complete horror, he watched as the giant kid's already huge pecs swell even bigger, faster. Karim's body had already become pro bodybuilder proportions from his earlier wish, but now the young teenager was reaching levels beyond the dreams of any Mr. Olympia contender out there! Soon Karim's pecs reached almost cartoonish proportions compared to the rest of his body, but there was nothing funny at all about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the other part of the wish, Ken's eyes darted to Karim's nipples. Like his pecs, Karim's nipples had also joined in the growth, growing thicker, fatter and longer with each passing second. Ken gulped as he watched those nubs get larger and larger, soon becoming as long as he was tall, and it didn't look like it was going to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Karim's hands began to move, reaching up and began feeling his newly grown (and still growing) pecs. \"Mmm, nice and big, just like I like it!\" He said, hefting the weight of one of his pecs, the slab growing so big that it required both of his hands to cup it. \"Now let's see how sensitive my nipples are now!\" He grinned as he held up his index finger and thumb, and pinched one, big, fat nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOH!!!!!\" Karim shouted at the top of his lungs, the force of it nearly knocking Ken and Omair off their feet. Karim's fingers were latched tightly on his nipples, pinching them with a force that could crush rock. \"OOOOH! OHHHH! OOOOOOOHHH GOD THIS FEELS AMAZING!\" He screamed. His cock lurched, growing completely hard once more and spat out massive globs of pre. The two normal sized boys had to dodge from the super hot seed, each glob the size of a Volkswagen. Then Karim began to play with his nipple, rolling it between his fingers and tugging it. Each twist, tug, and squeeze brought on shot after shot of pre cum, which launched out of his massive cockhead like cannonfire, some landing twenty blocks away, completely destroying trees, cars and anything else it hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he played with his nipple, the closer he got. His pecs flexed and bounced as he tortured his nipple, his moans can be heard miles away. Finally he couldn't take it anymore and did the one thing to bring his long sought orgasm to fruition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up and pinched his other nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH FUUUUUUUCK!\" He bellowed as his cock erupted, the force of his climax sounded and felt like a volcanic eruption. This time Ken and Omair did get knocked off their feet, and they cowered on the ground as the giant muscle god above them shot an endless load of cum into the air. Whenever the torrent seemed to start to dissipate, Karim would squeeze his nipples and his climax would renew itself even stronger than ever. The creamy liquid fired so hard, so far that it landed halfway to the next city, flooding an unfortunate shopping district with sticky hot cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like ages the cumming died down, and Karim did not renew it with another nipple pinching. Karim's monumental pecs heaved as he basked in the afterglow of his climax. \"Fuck, that felt good.\" Karim said, rubbing his pecs with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Ken was shaking madly. Was this how his life was going to become? Fueling the growth of this ever growing titan? Would he have to endure moments like that for the rest of his life, until Karim was tired of him and squashed him like a bug?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if Ken tried anything, Karim would wipe him out. And besides, the pendant would only seem to add to the giant, not take anything away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if he used that to his advantage?</span></div></div>",

The feelings of raw power in Karim's body turned him on so much, mixed with the dominance over Ken and Omair, that Karim was already incredibly horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know what to do, Ken.\" Karim spoke, biting his lip as he admired how large his throbbing meat had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stared at Karim's penis for a moment, shocked and confused about what to do. On one hand, Ken liked the idea of pleasing Karim, but at the same time Ken knew that he had to repair the pendant and stop Karim's growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ken could think anymore on the matter, Karim's voice cut through his thoughts.<br>\r\n\"If you don't start pleasuring me soon, I might have to use a little force.\" Karim warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Ken knew he had to please Karim or face punishment from the giant teen, who was starting to fill then entire attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair sat on the sidelines, watching everything happen, stroking his cock as he watched his brother's giant cock grow taller than his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Omair. Did you think I'd leave you out on all the fun? I have a special job for you...\" Karim mused, tweaking a nipple.<br>\r\n\"While Ken plays with my huge cock, I want you to come over here and suck on my nipples, and make me really horny. You know how much I love to play with my nipples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Karim was speaking with Omair, Ken got busy. He leaned forward and wrapped both arms around the towering meat before him. He pressed his entire torso against it and felt the heat coming from it. Karim moaned loudly in the middle of his sentence towards Omair. Ken began to slide his body up and down the growing cock eagerly as he jerked the giant's cock off with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh! Ken really knows how to please a god! But as I was saying Omair.... oooh that feels good.... I want you to put your mouth to use and suck on my nipples while Ken does all the work on my meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair realized that Karim was far too big to fight against at this point, and he had no choice but to help get his growing brother off.<br>\r\nOmair moved over to Karim's swelling chest, watching it rise and fall for a moment, admiring his well sculpted pecs, which were no doubt a result of his wish. Without warning, Omair leaned forward and licked Karim's dark nipple, noting how it tasted salty from Karim's sweating body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh fuck that's amazing Omair. Keep licking...\" Karim groaned, arching his back a little. With Ken jacking him off, and Omair attacking his incredibly sensitive nipples, it wouldn't be long before he shot is load!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen now had to stand to properly pleasure the giant penis before him, and he had even taking to licking the massive head while he stroked the cock.<br>\r\nOmair was sucking happily on Karim's swelling nipple, while he lay on his chest and please his other nipple with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Karim layed in the attic and moaned loudly, his growth now causing him to bend his knees to stay contained in the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both boys pleasuring his massive and ever growing body, Karim wanted to stay confined in the attic as long as he could, and also Karim was turned on even more at the thought of growing so big he burst out of the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim's cock throbbed violently on Ken, as he worked eagerly to please Karim's cock, which had now swelled to be even larger than his entire body!<br>\r\nPrecum coated Ken easily, which helped make his actions much easier.<br>\r\nOmair continued happily sucking his brother's nipple like a nursing child, but also was enjoying rubbing his cock into the groove of Karim's pecs while he worked. Karim noticed Omair fucking his chest and it only made him hornier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh! You boys are -unf- working really good to please your god!\" Karim moaned in delight, his voice now a deep baritone as he passed nearly 50 feet in height, his body curling to remain in the attic as long as possible. It wouldn't be long before the floor caved in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boys. I'm getting so close...\" Karim moaned. Ken and Omair prepared eagerly to bring Karim to his orgasm and hopefully find a way to escape after they please the giant...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karim's mind raced with excitement. If the pendant could do to him what it did to Omair, there was no telling where his fun could end. He didn't want to act to hastily, however, so he decided to head home and think things over before he made his wish\u2026 well, wishes, more likely, he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly made his way back towards the ladder heading out of the attic, glad that Ken and Omair were too involved in each other to even hear him at all. Once out of the attic, he jogged downstairs and out of the house, wanting to get home as soon as possible so he could try the pendant out in the privacy of his own bedroom (well, actually the bedroom him and Omair shared).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran all the way home, which was currently empty, with Omair (still) over at Ken's house, and both of their parents out at a social gathering. As he ran upstairs to the bedroom and locked the door behind him, he realized he probably could have used the pendant to wish him here instantly, not having to run the mile and a half between the houses. It was a fleeting thought that he didn't dwell on, since Karim was too excited to try out his new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed over to the side of the wall where a full-length mirror hung. Looking at his own reflection, he realized that he didn't mind what was looking back at him. He was skinny, sure, and a little dorky looking, but it was a look all his own, and he was kind of proud of it. It didn't win him the stares of any of the girls at school (or the guys, which was what he was really wanting), but that wasn't the biggest concern on his mind before. However, with the pendant, all that would be history - he could change his body to be the hottest person on earth, or control people's minds to make everyone lust after him no matter what - the possibilities were literally endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided, though, to test the pendant by changing his body. He threw off his shirt and pants, only leaving a pair of dark blue boxers on, which hung somewhat loose on his legs. He draped the pendant around his neck, feeling a slightly warm sensation as he did so, which made him smile involuntarily. \"This is it,\" he said aloud, softly and to nobody except himself. \"Here goes nothing. I wish my body would add thirty pounds of muscle.\" The words were almost a whisper, his voice showing signs of doubt that were creeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next, though, eradicated any doubts he had. He felt the pendant heat up even more. After a few seconds, that heat ended up flowing out of the pendant and traveling through his body, concentrating on his chest. His muscles began to tingle and pulsate, pushing outward slightly in accordance with the wish. Looking in the mirror, his jaw dropped as he saw himself change from a skinny teen who hadn't really experienced the benefits of puberty to one who looked like he spent nearly every day in the gym, his biceps now round with muscle, and his pecs now clearly pronounced and separated from the rest of his torso. It wasn't anything that looked unnatural, but it certainly was a big difference from what he looked like a few seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Awesome!\" he cried out. He didn't quite know what he had been expecting, but this was more muscle than he could've ever hoped to develop in a year's worth of working out. Liking how the pendant could change his muscles, he decided to focus next on his height. \"I wish to grow a foot taller!\" he said, louder this time and with more confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same heat started radiating and he felt his body tingling again, this time in his bones. Hearing a slight stretching sound, he looked down and saw that his limbs and torso were all stretching out, the ground getting further and further away. His boxers, tighter than before due to the muscle developed in his legs and ass from the previous wish, now began to tear as his body was just too much for them. The pleasure he was feeling didn't help matters, as his cock began to swell in excitement, poking the fabric and making the strain worse. As the growth stopped, the boxers ripped, leaving Karim standing there naked, over six feet tall and with muscles like an eighteen-year-old athlete. The only thing that made him look young was his still-boyish face, which had the widest smile on it that you could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's what I call results!\" Karim exclaimed. He started walking around the room, quickly getting used to his new size. He thought about moving his hands down to his now rock-hard cock, but resisted the urge, realizing there was a lot more fun he could have, even tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" he thought aloud, scratching his chin with his hands. \"what should I do now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karim stood in the center of his room, fully nude, muscled and horny, with the pendant around his neck. He had all the power in the world. He could grow to be 200 feet tall and rampage, or he could have the biggest cock ever.<br>\r\nAll these possibilities were in Karim's hands, and he wanted to do it all. However, he wanted to deal with his... \"little\" problem. Once Karim had burst out of his clothes before to reveal his newly muscled body, he instantly became as had as a rock. His penis had been dripping precum for some time, and he wanted to have a little fun.  However, Karim knew with the pendant resting on his solid pecs, he could do so much more than just pleasure himself like he used to before he became all powerful.<br>\r\nHe thought instantly of his friend Spencer, a boy in the grade above him. Spencer was a cute boy, with a nice bubble butt. Despite having a cute face and great ass, Spencer was a thin little thing. He was often ignored by others and turned to Karim for a friend. He always suspected Spencer was gay, but now Karim could know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Karim made his wish. \"I wish my friend Spencer would be in my room, and fully aware of the pendant's powers.\" Karim would rather cut to the chase than have to explain about the pendant.<br>\r\nThe pendant glowed and hummed for a moment, before the light died down and Spencer was standing in Karim's room. Spencer was caught entirely off guard when he found himself in Karim's room, but what really shocked him was seeing Karim naked with a hot body. Thanks to Karim's wish Spencer already knew about the pendant and what it could do.<br>\r\n\"Karim, what's going on? Why are you naked? How did you get so big?\" Spencer questioned quickly. To this, Karim simply chuckled and made another wish. \"I wish Spencer would get a hot, sexy muscled body and a hard-on for me\" Karim said. Karim wanted to make sure Spencer was primed and ready to have some fun once he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pendant glowed and hummed again, and after dying down, Spencer moaned softly. <br>\r\nAfter the light died down a pleasuring sensation filled Spencer's entire body, and then it turned to a soft pressure, as if his whole body was building up to a big orgasm.<br>\r\nKarim watched eagerly as Spencer's somewhat loose shirt began to tighten on his swelling body. It started in Spencer's forearms. The frail limbs began to swell and thicken with solid muscle. Since Spencer had very little body fat to begin with, the changed were instantly noticeable.<br>\r\nSpencer was too enraptured in the pleasure of growing to notice his body changing at this point. The growth spread into his biceps, the nonexistent muscles swelling quickly into large, powerful orbs of solid strength, roughly the size of baseballs. Once Spencer's shoulders began to broaden and thicken, did he actually notice what Karim was doing to him. His shirt had become too tight on his arms and shoulders, but once his swelling pecs blew up into massive mounds, did his shirt finally give way. <br>\r\nKarim licked his lips in anticipation. Spencer's nipples grew slightly larger and nicely accented the massive pecs they rested on.<br>\r\nSpencer's stomach tightened into eight hard mounds of solid muscle, almost like a brick road on his stomach. His waist thinned, giving Spencer a Junior Bodybuilder's appearance. However, Spencer's legs were still thin and frail. To make matters worse, his upper body was quickly wearing out his weak legs with the newfound weight. This problem was quickly solved when his thighs and calves began thickening to an incredible size, as if he had spent years working them to their beautiful size.<br>\r\nThe growth of his legs destroyed Spencer's pants, leaving him in his tightening underwear. The last article of clothing on his body was quickly destroyed as well by his hardening dick, swelling to his beautiful 7 inch erection, and his thickening bubble butt. The two pillows he called butt cheeks were quickly becoming larger and more muscular by the second.<br>\r\nEventually, the fabric prison of his cock and ass was torn apart by the contents that stretched it too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpencer moaned deeply, the pleasure subsiding now, his body glistening with sweat. Karim noted the sight of brown hairs that made up a treasure trail. It turned Karim on even more to see what an early bloomer Spencer had been, even though he had been so skinny before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarim stepped up to Spencer, running his hands along his new muscles. Karim loved to feel the smooth muscles that were even larger than his own. It was sexy, feeling the large mounds on Spencer's body. <br>\r\nSpencer looked at Karim, who was standing only an inch or two taller than himself, and grinned.<br>\r\n\"You like what you see?\" Spencer groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys cocks throbbed and leaked precum in anticipation. They were both muscled and horny, and they wanted each other so very badly. Karim grinned at Spencer, prepared for the next step...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't unusual for Omair to be over, and he gladly welcomed the boy into his home, especially knowing how close he and Ken were. Everything seemed as if it were a normal day, until he had heard the two boys go up into the attic of their house. Figuring Ken would just rummage through some boxes looking for something and be right down, but when the two had been up in the attic for quite some time, he grew curious as to what was keeping them up there so long. As far as he knew, nothing of interest was really up there, and he never made a trip up there for anything other than an occasional look at old photo albums. <br>\r\nHe ventured up into the attic, and as he was reaching the attic, just before he could call out either of the boys names to get their attention, he heard gentle moaning. This caused him to enter the attic and position himself behind some boxes near the door, out of view of the two boys. While he had always suspected some attraction between the two, he never imagined he'd accidentally stumble upon the two having sex. However, he was even more surprised to find that not only were they fooling around, but Omair was twice his normal height!<br>\r\nHe rubbed his eyes thinking he was only dreaming, but he found that Omair's increased height was a reality. He also noticed that Ken was holding an ornate pendant in his hand, which slipped out of his grip as he was running his hands across Omair's larger torso. The scene turned him on, admittedly. Seeing Omair taking up so much room in the attic, his large cock throbbing with excitement, it was quite the sight for him, and his own cock was growing hard in his pants. Through his lust, Ken's father caught a better look at the pendant in his son's hand. He recognized it as the old pendant that had been handed down through his family for generations. His grandfather had told him it was a special pendant, but he always assumed he meant that it held sentimental value. Was the pendant the cause of this sudden growth spurt? <br>\r\nLuckily, his curiosity would be able to get the better of him, because Ken had let the pendant slip from his fingers and it fell to the floor. Neither of the boys seemed to notice, as they were too interested in each other. The pendant rolled across the floor, and as if by magic, rolled right up to where Ken's father had been standing. He quickly grabbed the pendant and looked it over in his hands. It was in fact the same pendant his grandfather had mentioned many years ago. His mind was suddenly racing at a million miles a minute. If this pendant could actually change someone like it did Omair, the possibilities were endless. He held the pendant tightly in his hand and sneaked back downstairs, trying not to alert the two boys to the fact that he had not only seen them both in such a lewd scenario, but that he had taken the pendant. <br>\r\nQuickly locking himself in his bedroom, he sat on the edge of his bed for a moment wondering what he should do to test the pendant's powers. If Omair had been able to grow twice as big, imagine how big he could make himself! Or he could even stay the same height and possibly become more muscular, more hung, anything! He desperately ached to test it out and prove to himself he wasn't crazy. After a moment of careful consideration, Ken's father decided to start small and wish for...</span></div></div>",

Within seconds, he had filled up the attic, and was only getting started.  The house began to creak under Omair's weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick!\" Ken said.  \"Hold me in your hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair held out his hands, which were now just a bit bigger than Ken, and picked him up, sheltering him.  Just a few seconds later, the house collapsed, and Omair fell twenty feet to the ground, though at his size, it only felt like a foot or two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping Ken safe in his hands, he carefully stood up.  He was still expanding at an exponential rate; at this moment, the other houses around him came up to his knees, and Omair's feet filled up the space where the ruins of Ken's house were, and were continuing to expand.  Omair quickly started to move out of the neighborhood, trying to minimize any destruction he caused, but. as he passed two hundred feet tall, that became harder and harder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Omair walked towards downtown, he opened up his hands and looked at Ken, who was loving every minute of this.  \"Ken,\" Omair boomed, \"why did you do this to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled, \"Come on, you'll love it!  You're a fuckin' god now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Omair continued to grow, passing five hundred feet now, he considered what Ken said. He was right.  Except for Ken, everyone else on the planet now was insignificant compared to him.  The two of them were unstoppable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmair was big enough now that he could place Ken on his shoulder without him falling off, so he did so.  Ken loved being so high, and loved riding on his massive, naked best friend.  He was incredibly hard, and decided to strip naked, since clothing didn't really matter any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, Omair reached downtown, where he was over 1000 feet tall, the height of the tallest skyscrapers in the city.  His growth finally stopped, and he turned around, looking at the trail of destruction left in his wake.  Cars and buildings were flattened, streets had his giant footprints left in them, and people were in mass hysteria.  Sirens wailed in the distance.  He looked down at the masses fleeing at his feet: puny bugs to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, his cock, which was hard and almost 100 feet long, brushed against a building, sending shivers down his spine.  All this growth had made him insanely horny, and he could definitely have some fun at this size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at his shoulder at Ken, who was already stroking himself.  \"Hey, babe,\" Omair said.  \"What do you think I should do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Ken answered...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His parents were back at the resort lying down and \"sunning\" next to the pool, his sister had gone off scuba diving, and his three brothers had taken off on their own adventure (Julian was pretty sure they were trying to find someplace that would serve them alcohol). He wanted to do something, anything, with any of them, but he couldn't: the pool his parents were at was adults-only, the scuba company required anyone using their equipment to be at least sixteen and put a $100 deposit down, and his brothers wouldn't let him come along cause he was \"a little kid\". All he could do today was walk along this beach, bored and wishing he was back home with his friends, or that his friends were here with him. Alone as a twelve-year-old, Hawaii kinda sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the beach, the thing he was looking forward to the most before the trip started, was sort of a drag. He wanted to go swimming, but his parents specifically told him not to go into the ocean without them or one of his siblings around. He thought about disobeying and going anyway, but he feared what would happen if he got caught: he would be grounded until he turned eighteen, have his allowance revoked permanently, or any one of dozens of other equally severe punishments. Even if he didn't get caught, he knew enough about rip-tides and strong currents to know it wasn't a good idea to go without someone he knew. He had thought about trying to build a sand-castle, but that seemed like a little kiddie thing (at least his brothers had said so the other day), and besides, the sand wasn't stable enough on this beach for that to be successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked out at the crowds, the group of twenty-somethings playing beach-volleyball, the old ladies looking for seashells, and the families horsing around and having a good time, Julian cursed to himself. \"Fuckin' family. Why can't I be like one of these kids and have parents and brothers and sisters who want to do stuff together?\" Disgusted by the crowds (or rather, by how lonely they made him feel), he headed away from the resort areas, down to a more private part of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to hike a bit to get away from the din of the crowds, but when he finally got to a secluded area where no one else was around, he sat down and looked out onto the waters. The waves rose high above the surface, crashing onto the beach, then being pulled back out and doing the whole thing over again.  \"At least this is pretty peaceful,\" he said to himself. As the minutes passed by, he slowly began to let free his stress, and he felt a little better about the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the waves, Julian saw something get washed up onto the shore about a hundred yards from him, glistening in the sun. He wasn't sure what it was, but it looked interesting enough to warrant further attention, so he got up and jogged over to investigate. When he got within thirty feet, he determined it was a rather large bottle of some sort, perhaps a wine bottle or something similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the bottle, he picked it up and tried to make out what was inside. The glass was greenish and translucent, and he could make out what looked like a piece of paper as well as a large, somewhat heavy circular object. His curiosity piqued, he ran to the edge of the beach where some boulders stood. Raising the bottle high above his head, he smashed it down onto the rock, sending the glass shattering but freeing the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circular object turned out to be some sort of pendant with a thin ribbon threaded through it, sort of like the medals given out at the Olympics. He picked it up and examined it closely. By color, at least, it looked like it had been made of gold, but it felt surprisingly lightweight. One side was completely smooth, while the other side had an engraved picture of an arm flexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is this?\" he asked aloud. Picking up the paper, he examined it for answers. The writing on it was very faded, but still seemed to be legible. In ornate script, it read: \"When you wear this pendant, it can provide you with seemingly unlimited power, and whatever you wish becomes truth. But beware: power comes with a price. It has caused our people too much havoc and distress. I hope you find it more beneficial than we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seemingly unlimited power?\" Julian repeated aloud. This was too good to be true. It definitely sounded like someone was playing a prank on him; that he'd try it out and someone would come out of the water or behind a palm tree and laugh at him, or worse. He started to throw it back to the ground, but before he could, he thought: \"What if\u2026\" What if it were true? What if, somehow, this would be his ticket to changing his life? It was a ludicrous and entirely unrealistic idea, he knew, but he had always had an active imagination, so part of him wanted to believe that it might, just might, be real. Besides, he couldn't help but thinking that if he didn't try it out, he'd spend the rest of his life wondering about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head and quieting the voice inside telling him he was being childish, he still knew he just had to try. \"It can't hurt,\" he reasoned. He put the ribbon around his neck and let the pendant fall to his bare chest, jumping in shock as he did so. Whereas it felt somewhat cold and metallic in his hands, against his chest it felt warm, almost as if something inside it had caused it to start emitting heat. \"Must be the Hawaii sun,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about how to use it. \"Whatever you wish becomes truth,\" he repeated from the paper. \"I guess I should test it out with something small first.\" Looking around, the only thing on the horizon that caught his eye was the shards of glass from the bottle he had broken. \"That should do,\" he said to himself. \"Okay, I guess I just have to say it aloud.\" He cleared his throat. \"I\u2026 I wish this bottle was whole again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it looked like nothing had happened, and Julian closed his eyes, shaking his head in disappointment. When he opened them, however, he was shocked to see that the bottle had been completely restored to its former unbroken state! Rubbing his eyes in disbelief, he looked back only to see, sure enough, the bottle was still there. As he examined the ground closer, he noticed there wasn't a shard of glass anywhere to be found. Somehow, someway, the bottle had been fixed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" he said. \"The pendant works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to test it out on something else to be sure. It might have been a fluke, and besides, the bottle was an inanimate object. Julian knew that the only way he would believe in the pendant's power was if he tried it out on himself. He thought for a second of what he should try, then came to a decision. Taking a deep breath, he whispered aloud, \"I wish I was six inches taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, he felt his entire body begin to tingle, and he noticed his swimming trunks were beginning to feel more restrictive. Looking down, he saw the ground getting further and further away, and his torso and legs were lengthening, stretching out, almost like putty but more firm. \"Holy crap!\" he said aloud as the tingling stopped, his trunks stretched nearly skin-tight against his legs and crotch. \"I\u2026 I can't believe it!\" He couldn't quite tell how much taller he had grown, but it was significant. He felt that he was nearly as tall as his 14-year-old brother Christian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing so quickly felt amazing, but Julian wanted to see if he could reverse it, to make sure that if anything ever got out of hand he'd have a failsafe. With a slight bit of disappointment in his voice, he said, \"I wish to cancel the last wish.\" Instantly, without any kind of sensation or sudden rush, he felt shorter, and his swimming trunks returned to their normal loose fit. \"Huh,\" he mused aloud, \"I guess reversing a wish is quicker than making the wish in the first place. Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sorts of possibilities of how to use the pendant rushed through his mind. He could change himself in any way imaginable, or mess with his family, or even have some fun with his friends back home. As he thought of these things, he realized something. With this pendant, his power seemed truly limitless. With this pendant, he was a god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wry smile formed across Julian's face. Hawaii wasn't going to be so boring after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pendant around his neck, Julian hurried back over to the packed beach, thinking about all the things he could do now that he had this power. Part of him wanted to make drastic, massive changes right away, totally conforming the world to his will and whim, but Julian shook those feelings off, remembering the words on the paper that came with the pendant: \"Power comes with a price\". Even if he had almost-unlimited abilities, he didn't want to overuse them. As angry as he had been with his family before, this discovery had overcome all that, and he knew he had to be responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the middle of the crowds, he slowed his jog to a steady walk, looking around for the first interesting thing he could test out. His eyes landed on a red-haired, pale-skinned boy a little younger than him who was playing in the ocean a few dozen yards from where he stood, running out and getting his feet wet, then retreating back gleefully when a large wave would come in. Julian recognized that this boy had just checked into the same floor of the hotel that Julian's family was. He hadn't really had much interaction with the boy, only seeing him in passing in the hall once and a couple of times down in the lobby. He didn't even know the boy's name; all he knew was that he was from England, and he spoke with a thick British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so fair-skinned,\" Julian said to himself, \"he'll get completely destroyed by the harsh sun here.\" His hand brushed against the pendant and he smiled. \"Maybe I can help that!\" He took a deep breath. This would be the first time he had changed a person other than himself, so he didn't know what variables would come into play. \"At least it'll just be a small change. I wish for that red-haired English boy to get a nice, even bronze tan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, the boy's skin started to glow, as more and more melanin started to appear, his skin gradually growing darker. It was quite a sight to see, this boy going from extremely pale to tan so quickly, and Julian's eyes widened as he watched, even though he knew it was coming. Julian looked at the people near the boy, and no one else seemed to be reacting or paying any attention to the change that was occurring. Even the boy didn't notice his skin becoming more and more brown. \"Maybe people are oblivious to my changes unless I specifically wish them to notice\u2026\" Julian guessed, \"\u2026if I can even wish for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen or fifteen seconds later, the changes seemed to have stopped, the boy's skin now a healthy tanned light-brown, giving him a much more Mediterranean look.  The only thing that indicated his previous skin color was his shock of bright-red hair, which now looked kind of ridiculous and out of place in comparison to his tan, but Julian found it kinda neat-looking. The boy still had the same gleeful expression, and the same playfulness to him, he just looked more appropriate for Hawaii now. The rest of his family that were nearby still had their fair complexion, and Julian held his breath as the boy's mother, a short, squat woman, walked over to her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry,\" she called out, \"we're all putting on some more suncream now. C'mon, Love, get out of the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mum,\" the boy replied, \"I feel fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed, shaking her head. \"I guess you can skip this round. I don't know how you got lucky enough to be born with such sun-proof skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned and walked back to where the rest of the family was sitting, while the boy squealed gleefully as he continued to splash in the waves. Julian sighed in relief, realizing that his first test of the Pendant on another person was a complete success. He also felt a little thrill from helping someone else out, even a stranger. \"This is so cool,\" he whispered. \"I'm almost like a super-hero.\" A smile came to his lips he thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So what should I be expecting when I open this, Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai had just answered the door to a delivery man who had a package for him to sign for. As soon as he saw the return address, 'Nick Chadwell, San Francisco, CA', he smiled, flipping open his phone and giving his best friend a call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's groggy voice answered on the other end of the line. \"C'mon, Kuai, I don't even get a 'Hello', 'Good Morning, Nick', 'Sorry to wake you so early'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early?\" Kuai scoffed. \"Someone needs to check their alarm clock. It's two forty five in the afternoon here, so I know it's almost noon where you are. I think it's time to get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai could hear Nick's feet hit the floor. \"Hey, some of us don't get the whole summer off,\" Nick said. \"I think I've earned a little beauty sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kuai shook his head. Nick had been his best friend for four years now. They had met online at a community for giant fetishists, \"macrophiles\", as Kuai had learned to call himself. He remembered feeling so relieved when he started talking to MegaKing484, who turned out to be Nick. Finally, here was someone who got him, who felt the same way he did. The dream of longing for other guys to grow on a massive scale, to play with him like a little toy, to cause havoc and destruction - well, it was a desire Kuai had since he was a little boy, one that he had hidden away and become incredibly ashamed of. It didn't help that, being nearly a foot taller than his classmates all his life, and bigger than his parents since he was 11, he thought he never would be able to experience someone tower over him like that. But finding there were others like him, guys and girls who were as fascinated with and turned on by giants as he was - well, it was a life-changing discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Nick had talked for two years, becoming closer and closer, before finally planning to meet each other at MegaCon, a sci-fi convention in Orlando. That weekend was the best of Kuai's life. Online, Nick had hinted at, but not explicitly stated, that he was interested in Kuai, flirting casually and innocently, but that interest exploded into an all-out sexual desire when they met in person, and they had ended up spending most of the convention in their hotel room. Kuai had never slept with a better, more intense lover before, and he hadn't since, even counting his current boyfriend, Sean. Nick seemed to be in heaven making love to a tall beast of a man like Kuai, and though Kuai would've preferred things the other way around, he enjoyed his lover's enthusiasm and vigor, making the experience something he would never forget. At the end of the weekend, Kuai had seriously considered moving back to San Francisco with Nick and living together forever with him, but they each ultimately realized that, while they were more than compatible with each other, their relationship would be better served remaining close friends, and they each moved on with their lives, Kuai returning to Massachusetts and taking a job as a middle school math teacher at a smaller, private academy, while Nick returned to California to be close to Silicon Valley, a games journalist by day, but at night working on a secret project that he could tell Kuai very little about but had something to do with nanotechnology, which Kuai jokingly referred to as 'Fairy Dust.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Nick, sleep while you can,\" Kuai smiled, amused by his friend's laziness. \"But tell me, what's in this mystery box you sent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled slightly, pausing before answering. \"Well... Why don't you open her up and find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, hold on a second.\" Kuai grabbed a box cutter from the kitchen counter and ripped open the tape. The box was small and lightweight, filled mostly with packing peanuts, but inside was a small rectangular brick, rounded on the edges, looking almost exactly like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, how sweet, Nick,\" Kuai said sarcastically, \"you sent me a phone. You do know that I already have a phone, right? In fact, I'm using it to call you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a phone, big guy,\" Nick responded. \"Though I admit I did, um, 'borrow' parts for the chassis from some of my friends down in Cupertino. And I don't think you'll find anything like it at any store in the country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai scoffed playfully and picked up the object out of the box, examining it closer. While it did look like a smartphone on the outside, with a large black pane of glass on the front, Kuai couldn't see any kind of speaker or microphone anywhere on it. The material felt like extremely smooth and polished glass, almost onyx-like in a way, and Kuai only saw one small rectangular button sticking out of the bottom, while a small hole had been drilled through the top, a thin gold chain running through it. The object was even more light outside of the box, and Kuai gently tossed it in one hand, testing it's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Kuai asked, \"so if it's not a phone, what is it?\" Kuai turned it over, unable to make out writing or markings of any kind on it. \"Is this some sort of new iPod competitor? Nick, didn't the Zune teach you anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put the damn thing around your neck, Kuai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai obliged, draping the chain around his neck, the object resting against his black sleeveless shirt in the middle of his muscled chest. Even while wearing it, it hardly felt like it weighed anything to him, as if it were barely there. He gently swung his neck back and forth, the object swaying but the chain staying firmly in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, done,\" Kuai said into the phone. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Sean home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai looked out the window and saw his boyfriend Sean outside, lying down and reading a book on the porch swing. Sean was only average height, being 5'9\" with a skinny build, and attended Suffolk University, where Kuai had graduated from. The two had met at the on-campus gym during Kuai's senior year, Sean an incoming freshman who just couldn't take his eyes off of the athletic Chinese giant, his stares (and cute body) eventually driving Kuai to introduce himself, and things took off from there. Though they had lived together for the past few years, Kuai still wasn't sure if he saw himself staying with Sean the rest of his life, as the younger man didn't always quite get Kuai intellectually, but Sean was definitely a caring and compassionate guy, and Kuai appreciated that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you looking at him?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Nick,\" Kuai was beginning to grow impatient. \"He's outside the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Nick's voice got a little lower, \"Now, listen carefully. I want you to look at him, focusing hard on his body. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai rolled his eyes but did as his friend instructed. \"Okay, got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you look at him,\" Nick continued, \"I want you to concentrate on his height, imagining him getting bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kuai,\" Nick interrupted, deadly serious, \"just do it once. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a crazy waste of time to Kuai, but if there was one person in the world that he trusted, it had to be Nick, so he did as his friend asked. He stared at Sean, making sure to focus on his height, imagining him growing upward, inch by inch. Something he had done several times before in his head, with no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, this time, it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean's body began to slowly expand, growing bigger right on the porch swing. It took Kuai a few seconds to recognize what was happening, but once he saw Sean's normally-loose shorts begin to tighten, and the buttons fastening his shirt stretching open and outward, revealing Sean's pale white chest and stomach, Kuai knew that something had happened. Something had changed. The idea that he had only fantasized about before was now, seemingly, a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Fuck,\" Kuai whispered into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it happen?\" Nick asked, his voice now getting excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did you do this?\" Kuai said, nearly at a loss for words. \"I mean -- what -- how --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Kuai. Just try to focus back on Sean and take him back to his normal height. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -- I think so,\" Kuai answered, and looked back at his boyfriend. He focused his thoughts once more on Sean's body, but this time looked to shrink him back down to his normal height. Sean's tight clothes began to loosen again, and his legs and torso seemed to suck inward somehow, finally stopping when he was back the way he had been a few minutes ago. During the entire experience, Sean continued to read his book, oblivious to what was happening with his body and his sudden gain (and loss) of five inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai started pacing back and forth in his kitchen, unable to keep still. \"Nick, that was incredible!\" He started to speak faster, full of wonder and excitement. \"How in the world could something like that happen? I mean, I just looked at him and thought about him getting bigger like you said, and WHAM! he started to grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the line, Nick chuckled. \"That's the power of the pendant,\" Nick said.</span></div></div>",

The back of the gold necklace has two tiny sensors that tap into your nervous system via your spinal chord, reading your brainwaves and able to detect and interpret your thought patterns. So if you want to use it, make sure you're wearing it properly. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Kuai stammered in reply, still not sure if he was believing what he was hearing. \"But wait! How\u2026 I mean, I guess I understand how it can read my thoughts, sorta. But how does it make the changes? Like to Sean and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick started to laugh. \"Remember the nanotechnology I told you I was working on? That 'Fairy Dust' you were always making fun of me for? Well\u2026 that's what makes the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kuai asked incredulously. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each time the pendant detects a thought, it will emit a wave of nanites, little subatomic robots that can make changes to everything around you. They reproduce at a seemingly near-infinite rate, and can build up, change, and tear down any matter, organic or otherwise, in seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Scrunching his nose up, Kuai thought for a moment. \"Wouldn't that be dangerous? What happens if the nanites get out of control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick breathed in deeply. \"Yes, Kuai, there is some inherit danger in nanotechnology. But don't worry, I've programmed in so many safety checks and redundancies that nothing can get too far out of hand. Whoever holds the pendant is always in control. The software it runs on has a self-destruction algorithm that makes sure all nanites are totally destroyed within a certain period of time after leaving the pendant. That defaults to five seconds, but if you think about the time delay, you can increase that up to a minute. If you want to go longer than a minute, you have to make sure you keep focusing back on your subject once a minute so that the pendant can emit a new strain of nanites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too much for Kuai, who shook his head, his breathing starting to increase. \"So-- what does this mean?\" he asked. \"What can the pendant do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai could almost imagine Nick's broad smile. \"Almost anything you want it to, Kuai. Remember how we talked about some of your fantasies last year of having some of your students tower over you? This could make that happen. Or perhaps your basketball team needs a bit of a boost. I'm sure a few extra inches or feet or yards in height will help them out. The nanites can change people's memories to make them believe the changes you've made to the world are the way things have always been, so they don't see anything out of the ordinary. And since they're subatomic, they can even, through the principles of quantum physics, go back in time and affect history to line up with your changes. This pendant honestly gives you the power of a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these words,  felt his knees weaken, and he stumbled back, landing on the kitchen table, luckily not breaking it in half under his weight. This seemed all too good to be true. If he hadn't seen what had happened to Sean with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe it. But Nick was an extremely smart man, and he had never lied to Kuai before. Kuai realized this was something to be excited about after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Kuai, there's one more thing. I need to tell you about some of the controls and rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Controls?\" Kuai asked. \"I thought you said it reads my brain waves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does, and that's how the changes start and is defined, but there are some settings you can change regarding the different ways the pendant can go about making those changes. Do you see that button on the bottom of the pendant? Give it a double-click.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai grabbed the pendant in his left hand and did what Nick said. Instantly, the side facing towards him lit up, and five images of small switches appeared on the screen, all marked to the up position, which Kuai guessed by the \"I\" label above them and the \"O\" label below indicated the switches were all on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of those five switches on the screen can control something about the pendant,\" Nick continued. \"The one marked 'one' is sort of a locking mechanism. When that's turned on, no one will be able to take the pendant away from you; it gives them a shock if they do. The only way you'll get rid of it is by voluntarily taking it off. Switch two will actually make the pendant unnoticeable to anyone but you. With it on, no one can tell that you're wearing it, even if you're in bed naked and they're lying right on top of you. The third switch affects the subject, or subjects, and their minds. Whoever you transform will be unaware of any changes you make to them if that switch is on, and will think they've always been that way. Four works pretty much the same way, but instead of the one experiencing the change, it will affect everyone else in the world, except you of course. Finally, switch five affects how the various inanimate objects and environment around the subjects are changed. If it's on, clothing, buildings, desks, chairs, whatever, will change with the subject, just as if they had been designed for them at their new size. I know, based on how much you like the idea of clothing ripping to shreds, that's a switch you'll probably enjoy playing with.\" Kuai chuckled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you can turn any of these switches on or off at any time, just by bringing up this screen with a double-click of that button. Any switch you change will not be retro-active, meaning that if you want to undo something you did, you need to make sure the switches affecting people's memories are turned on, otherwise, they'll still remember the changes you made., and if you grow somebody and cause the building they're in to grow because of it, if you turn off the switch and shrink the person back down, you'll still be left with a huge building. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded, giving each switch on the screen a little tap, flicking them on and off. When he was finished, he made sure they were back on their defaults, saying, \"Got it.\" As he flicked the last switch, he noticed a long slider bar at the bottom of the screen below all the switches. \"Hey, Nick,\" he asked. \"What's the long red bar at the bottom do?\" He heard hesitation come from Nick's end, with a long pause. \"Nick, c'mon. I'm your closest friend. Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Nick answered, \"That's the slider to override the safety protocols. It'll ask you for a passcode to do so, and I can't give you that, Kuai, I just can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai sighed. \"I understand, Nick,\" he said, accepting it, but a little hurt that his friend wouldn't give him the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't be disappointed. There's only a few things that the safety protocols control that affect you. First off, and I know this sounds like a biggie, but whoever's wearing the pendant can't change themselves. If I know you, though, I don't think that's gonna matter much. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kuai answered, \"Sure, Nick. That's fine. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the only other thing is that there's a limit to how much you can change someone. It varies from subject to subject and in different situations, but there might come a time that you won't be able to grow or transform a subject anymore without taking them back to normal. If that seems to be coming too early or too soon, let me know, and I might be able to log-in remotely and adjust some of the parameters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Kuai said. \"Anything else I should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about it.\" Nick chuckled slightly. \"I know you're gonna have a lot of fun with it tomorrow at school with your students, big guy. Make sure you call me and let me know all the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" Kuai smiled, excited about all the possibilities that were in store for him. \"I'll talk to you tomorrow then. And, thank you so much for this. It means a lot you shared this with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, big guy. You deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" Nick repeated, then hung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Kuai couldn't sleep much, too excited, both in his head and elsewhere, for what the next day would hold. When his alarm rang in the morning, he jumped out of bed, into a quick shower and shave, and after eating breakfast, he was on the road to the school. After getting his lesson plans finalized for the day, the first bell rang, and the students filed into his classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first class was 7th grade Honors Pre-Algebra, and it was a small class, consisting of ten girls and six boys. Kuai looked at each of the new students as they walked in, each one nervous and excited at the start of a new school year, with new books, fresh backpacks, and clean uniforms, friends to make and experiences to have. As they all took their seats, Kuai fingered the pendant. Finally, he made sure it was in the 'invisible' mode so no one could see it, draped it around his neck, and then stood up, ready to face the class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Classroom management on the first day of school is easy. Let the children see no fear and they will usually leave you alone. Kuai\u2019s classroom was no exception. Just seeing his towering 6\u20199\u201d, heavily muscled physique was usually enough to keep the students in line. With a stern but smooth tone, Kuai stared down at his class, absorbing every face as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Honor\u2019s Pre-Algebra. I am Mr. Tao, and let me start off by saying that if you want to succeed in my class, you will have to work for it. Your butts will be in those chairs before the bell stops ringing, you will always bring a pencil and---\u201c pause for dramatic effect, \u201c\u2014I accept no excuses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the room. Kuai could literally hear a few of the student\u2019s gulp with anxiousness. Kuai was actually a pretty easy going guy when it came to everything (but sports). He liked to have fun and he loved life. But teaching is all about presence and theater. Even he knows that his enormous body won\u2019t control the masses forever if he doesn\u2019t have the vibrato to back it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed up by calling the roll and having the students introduce themselves. Each time he made it to one of the boys, he would study them very carefully, instantly exploring all of the possibilities with his pendant. Out of the six, one immediately caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA taller, lanky boy stood up in the third row. His beautiful green eyes were enlarged over twice their size because of the coke bottle lenses they hid behind. He had tan skin with short brown hair and spoke with a mousy voice. \u201cHey. I\u2019m K-Kevin.\u201d He was clearly nervous. \u201cI\u2019m in the seventh grade\u2014ob-obviously, and I\u2014enjoy reading and playing Call of Duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the boy stuck with Kuai. Perhaps, it was because Kevin never took his eyes off of him. His coke bottle glasses made that painfully obvious. Every time Kevin thought Kuai was looking the boy would blink a lot or hide his eyes in the rims of his glasses. Kuai though this was cute and saw lots of potential there. Kevin remained slouched in his chair and tried to \u201chide\u201d behind his glasses. But he knew this kid was very interested in what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014and I will expect you all with books and section one homework on my desk tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the students quickly filled out of his room, erupting in louder conversations the moment they went through the doorway. The only student who remained behind was Kevin. He was still slouched in his chair pretending not to stare at Kuai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you need something?\u201d Kuai softened his voice for Kevin. He didn\u2019t need to command a room anymore and the last thing he wanted to do was to scare him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin suddenly leapt up having been thrusted out of his dream world causing all of his books to hit the floor with various thuds. He quickly crumpled to the ground to pick every one of them up. \u201cLet me help you with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai descended upon Kevin, covering him in his huge shadow. He reached for Kevin\u2019s math book just as Kevin jerked for it, causing their hands to touch. Instead of jerking away, Kevin froze, staring down at the floor. Kuai kept everything moving for Kevin\u2019s sake and merely handed him the book. Trying to calm the boy\u2019s nerves, Kuai said, \u201cYou know you didn\u2019t need to bring all of your books from homeroom. Most teachers won\u2019t start using them until tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was still frozen, staring at his hand. Kuai\u2019s comment once again snapped him out of it and forced him to propel himself up. Clutching his books tightly, he said, \u201cTh-thanks. Mr. Tao. It will never happen again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai gave a hearty chuckle. \u201cIt is certainly not a crime to be over prepared.\u201d He slowly rose in front of Kevin, filling the entire space between the nervous student and his desk. \u201cEspecially not in my class-- Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin finally looked up at Kuai and gave the sweetest most heartwarming smile. His heart slowed slightly to a steady gallop and he took a small sigh of relief. \u201cThank you, Mr. Tao.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was no longer the jittery, spastic space cadet he had been moments ago. In that simple moment, Kuai could feel hooks of affection leap out from Kevin and snare his heart. Kuai wasn\u2019t expecting any of this. Especially not on the first day. Kevin nodded, but didn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas there anything else?\u201d Kuai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin slowly shook his head broadly from one side to the other, still wearing that enormous grin on his face. \u201cNothing else sir.\u201d He slowly passed Kuai as he headed down the row. His head was still shaking slowly from side to side as he glided further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is one interesting kid,\u201d Kuai thought to himself.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact---\u201c he thought, gripping his invisible pendant, \u201cLet\u2019s make Kevin a little more interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin may have been tall for a seventh grader, but he was still nothing compared to Kuai. He decided to give him an edge on the other students. As Kevin slowly walked closer to the door, \u00a0Kuai imagined Kevin slowly growing to an even 6 feet with a swimmer's build. \u201cDon\u2019t want to give this kid too much too fast. He could crack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin\u2019s glide slowly halted and Kuai could hear Kevin\u2019s breathing get louder. They almost sounded like faint moans. Kuai watched as the power of the pendant immediately took effect. Kevin\u2019s body crept up higher in the air as all of his muscles slowly filled out. It was difficult to see under Kevin\u2019s loose clothing, but Kuai could definitely make out \u00a0some new bulges in Kevin\u2019s arms and thickening butt where none had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his steady ascent to six feet tall and thickened frame, the growth halted and Kevin continued his walk as if nothing had happened. When he reached the door, Kevin turned and gave a small wave to Kuai, still wearing that huge smile under his two, huge green eyes, \u201cBye, Mr. Tao.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn\u2019t help but give a small grin in return, noticing the slightly bigger bulges moving in Kevin\u2019s arm. \u201cSee you later Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kuai was alone and he scrambled to check the various settings on the pendant. His arms flexed with huge bulges as he tugged on the object only he could see. \u201cSo, Kevin doesn\u2019t know what just happened. He thinks he\u2019s always been this way... Interesting\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave Kuai some ideas.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai looked at the clock on the wall. Two of the allotted six minutes between classes had elapsed, and his next class would start to trickle in shortly. He had to be quick. Sure, no one else would be able to see the pendant he was handling, but if someone saw him standing around fiddling his fingers in thin air, holding nothing, they might decide to put him in a strait jacket and lock him in a padded room for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at his desk and turning his chair away from the door, he thought about the different settings Nick had described the day before. He knew the first two switches should probably stay on, for a while at least, as the pendant was too important for anyone else to know about it yet. He also wanted to have his changes stay unnoticed for a little bit longer, so it would probably be best to keep the 'unawareness' options turned on for now. That left the final switch, which Kuai guessed might turn out to be his favorite anyways. Nothing turned him on as much as thinking about someone's clothes stretch across their growing body, seeing each seam start to--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard footsteps enter his classroom, and he hurriedly tapped the fifth switch to the off position, then let go of the pendant, letting it drop back onto his chest. Spinning his chair around, Kuai saw a couple of students already sitting at their desks, talking to one another quietly. For a moment, his breathing had sped up and he could feel his heart pounding slightly, but he quickly realized that no one had noticed anything out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more students trickled in, the room became louder, and Kuai smiled inwardly. First period classes were always tough, as most of the kids were still a little tired from having to get up so early (a reason he had demanded - okay, begged - Principal Kaufman to put one of his honors classes first, since those students tended to participate more anyways). By second period, everyone was pretty much awake and ready to learn (well, most everyone; there always would be that one student who would doze off no matter what time of day it was).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis class was going to be a larger one than his first, being regular 7th-grade math, and Kuai knew that meant it had the potential to get a little out of hand if he didn't set the tone right here. A powerful monologue worked fine for honors students. For this class, though, he needed a prop: a baseball bat he had placed underneath his desk, a trick he learned from one of his college professors. He only would use it on the first day, and even then he never would mention it or do anything other than hold onto it a bit for all the class to see. The bat would then be put back under his desk for the rest of the semester, ready to be used again as a reminder if necessary, but, strangely enough, in the past two years Kuai had been a teacher, it so far had yet to need to make an encore.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang and the last few students filed in, Kuai pulled the bat out, holding it horizontally with both hands, and stood up, pacing in front of the class. When the students saw what Kuai was holding, and took in his intimidating height, their chatter died down almost immediately, and he could feel their eyes fixate on him with something between fascination and sheer terror. Kuai remained silent as he paced for a full minute, doing his best not to smile, as that would destroy the effect he was going for, though if one of the students looked very closely, they would see the corners of his lips turned upward just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kuai spoke, his booming voice breaking the silence and filling the air. \"Welcome class. My name is Mr. Tao, and I will be your math teacher this year. I take the subject of mathematics very seriously, and if you want to pass my class and be able to move up to eighth grade math, so will you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai paused for a moment and stopped pacing, his body now facing the class. Nobody moved a muscle, and\u00a0<br>\r\nKuai could see some staring at him wide-eyed, mouths open in shock. Good, he thought. If I can capture them now, I'll have them for the entire year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now some of you may be intimidated,\" he continued as he started to walk up and down the aisles, \"by the concept of improper fractions, or the idea of solving for X. Well, I'm here to tell you, Don't be!\" At the back of the classroom now, Kuai spun around quickly, causing one of the girls at the back of the class to jump a little in her seat.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fractions, algebra, geometry,\" he resumed his slow march down another aisle of desks, \"all the subjects we'll touch on this year, they all have at least one thing in common: they were devised and conquered by humans. And I've got news for you: everyone sitting in this classroom is human. And you can all conquer math, if you so choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had them now, Kuai knew. Now to drive it home, so to speak. He stopped again, this time beside the desk of a particularly mousy blonde-haired boy, who nearly cowered in his shadow. \"Now others of you might be intimidated by...\" he motioned with his hands, indicating his own body, as he resumed his pacing, \"....by this. By me. Don't worry, I'm not here to hurt you, and I don't get any pleasure from making people cry. I know it may be hard to believe, but I am actually a nice guy. Come to my class with your best effort, and I'll make sure that you will succeed. But if you come here with anything less, then prepare to be severely disappointed when report cards are handed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a performance worthy of an Oscar, Kuai thought. He only wished he could know right away if it connected with any of his students, though he thought he could see a few that genuinely understood. Only time would tell if he was right. But in the meantime, he had other, more... exciting, things to consider.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roll call was next. After putting the bat away, Kuai made his way through the list of students, starting with 'Anderson, Deanna' and working down from there. \u00a0When he got to the last one, though, he felt an odd sense of deja vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilkins, Austin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" a bright, chipper voice answered. Kuai looked at where the voice was coming from, marked in his book, then nearly did a double take. The boy looked almost exactly like a younger, shorter version of Kurt Wilkins, one of Kuai's most talented 8th graders from last year's basketball team. He had a slender build and rather long, unkempt auburn hair that framed his face, deep hazel eyes, and fair, freckly skin. What Kuai really recognized, though, was the wide smile that had endeared him to Kurt as a coach and that interested him in Austin right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai considered whether or not he should say anything, finally deciding he had to. \"I'm guessing,\" he said to Austin, as he slowly stepped over to the marker board, \"that you're related somehow to Kurt Wilkins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin's warm eyes lit up, and he grinned widely. \"Yup, he's my older brother! You coached him last year, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded. \"Glad to be able to work with one of the Wilkins boys once again.\" He wished he could talk a little more with Austin, but Kuai didn't want to put the spotlight on him to the detriment of the other students, so he moved on, starting the lesson. During the entire class, though, he eyed Austin, who seemed to be intently paying attention to Kuai's instruction and would always be one of the first hands raised to answer any question. Kurt had been one of the most outgoing boys Kuai had ever known, a true leader for the team, and it looked like he had passed on his energy and enthusiasm to his younger brother. Kuai was definitely intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang, Kuai strode over to stand by the door. \"Remember, pages 1-4, problems 1-24. Due tomorrow at the BEGINNING, not the end, of class.\" The students stood up and began to shuffle out, most of them not making eye contact with Kuai. Give 'em time, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin, though, walked right up to him and stuck out his hand. \"It's great to meet you, Mr. Tao,\" the boy beamed as they shook. \"Kurt went on and on about you, telling me that you're tough but fair, and that you really got on him last year to become the best basketball player he could be. I think that's a pretty awesome thing, in a coach or a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kuai cocked his head slightly. This boy was really something, he thought, possibly even more intriguing than Kurt. \"Well, thank you, Austin,\" Kuai answered. \"You seem to have a lot of enthusiasm for learning. Tell me, why aren't you in honors classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am!\" Austin replied. \"It's just that I've always struggled with math. I don't know what it is, I just can't get my mind around it. But after a year of you teaching it to me, I know that I'll be calculating long division in my head, or solving complex equations in seconds flat, or whatever I need to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't know Kurt, Kuai would've thought Austin was just trying to suck up to him. But the older boy had the same attitude, always positive and upbeat. It must run in the family, Kuai thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya later, Mr. Tao!\" Austin waved a little and then ran to catch up with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn't stop smiling, and he looked at the clock once more. There was a seventeen minute break now between second and third periods. Students would typically go to the cafeteria for a snack or sometimes to the library to study or to use the internet. Kuai knew he had to follow Austin and see where this bright young man was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out of the classroom and looked down the hall to the direction Austin had gone towards, seeing him standing in a group of three or four other boys at the top of the stairs, leaning against the railing and chatting. Kuai kept his distance, far enough away not to be noticed, but close enough to eavesdrop on their conversation, and he kept his eyes moving, making sure it didn't look like he was watching them. Austin definitely was the most lively of the group, telling stories and jokes and moving his hands to illustrate them as he did. The other boys all seemed to listen to Austin, but he didn't dominate the conversation, listening to and encouraging the other boys.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's definitely the spitting image of his brother,\" Kuai muttered under his breath. \"Only\u2026\" There was one big difference that Kuai had noticed back in the classroom. Kurt Wilkins played center and was the tallest boy on the team, if not the whole school, standing 6'1\" by the end of eighth grade and still growing. Austin, however, was on the smallish side for a seventh grader, several inches shorter than each of the other boys in the group he was in.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis small stature \u00a0didn't seem to bother him any, Kuai noted. Maybe he just hadn't hit his growth spurt yet. \"Perhaps I can help with that,\" Kuai said quietly as he fingered the pendant and a small smile crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe focused on Austin, imagining his body even taller than Kurt's, with a slender build in the same proportions as the ones Austin had now. He also focused on having the transformation last a little longer this time than it had with Kevin. Might as well get the most out of it, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stopped talking mid-sentence, and Austin's body started to sprout up. Kuai had momentarily forgotten that he had turned off the option for clothes to change, so he was slightly started when Austin's white uniform polo shirt became untucked, and his bulging arms started to push against the fabric of the sleeves. Once Kuai realized what was going on, though, his smile widened. The bottom of Austin's lean stomach began to show, and his thighs had started to fill in the loose leg-holes of the school shorts more fully.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin was now taller than all of his friends, but he still continued to grow, his frame getting larger and larger. As his shoulders widened, the polo couldn't take the strain anymore, and the fabric started to rip down the middle of his shirt, with the seams near his shoulders and armpits also beginning to tear apart. The buckle of his belt snapped open, strained by his expanding hips, and the shorts started to inch down slightly on Austin's body, trying to find a narrower spot, before finally their snap popped open, revealing a pair of likewise-struggling boxer-briefs. Kuai hadn't paid any attention to the boy's shoes yet, but they, too, were getting their share of abuse, finally popping open and letting his toes, which had torn holes through his socks, have some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to Kuai like an incredibly too-short time, the growing stopped, and the boys resumed their conversation, Austin towering over the others with his clothes in tatters. No one seemed to pay any extra attention to the six-foot-three seventh-grader in their midst who was now very much out of dress code. Autsin himself didn't even seem to care that his uniform had just gone to shreds.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point in their conversation, his friend turned to him and remarked, \"Hey, Austin, aren't those clothes a little tight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Austin replied, grinning as he casually looked down at his body. \"I guess it's time for me and my mom to go shopping for some new uniforms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai chuckled to himself, excited by the results of Austin's changes, and bemused by the fact that no one treated the ripped clothes as anything rather unusual. \"That could make things fairly interesting,\" Kuai thought, as the bell to end the break rang. Not that seeing a boy grow eighteen inches in less than a minute and having two six-foot-plus seventh graders in the school wasn't already interesting enough. But Kuai imagined that his day could only get more exciting from here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The passing period was almost over, so Kuai took quick, heavy steps back to his classroom. A sea of heads filled the hallway, bobbling beneath Kuai\u2019s chest as each tried to clear out of the teacher\u2019s way. He was certainly the tallest and the biggest person on the faculty, and the students\u2014well, there was absolutely no contest. Kevin and Austin were no doubt the tallest seventh graders, but Kuai knew of one or two eighth graders that were even taller than them. Luckily, all the ones Kuai knew about were on the basketball team, and Kuai was their coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe possibilities are endless!\u201d Kuai excitedly thought to himself, making sure to keep a face of stone in front of the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seventh graders had already shown up for third period. By now, Kuai was getting a firm grip on his lesson and the introductions. He could just slip into auto pilot now, letting him concentrate on more interesting matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone finished taking a seat. He began the lecture again, from the top with bat in hand. It was an even split of girls and guys, all of them with their unique sizes and shapes. Kuai decided to make things a little more interesting this period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c---now when I call your name from the roll, I want you to come up to the front of the room, give us your name, tell us what you did over the summer break and what some of your interests are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students didn\u2019t dare groan at the suggestion, even though they had gone through a similar exercise for the past two periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChang, Allen,\u201d Kuai called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, Asian boy snapped to attention in the front row. His face was round and smooth, decorated with a pair of thinly framed oval glasses. He was clearly not an athlete, and took trepid steps as more and more eyes trained their sights on him. Allen\u2019s chubby frame jiggled as he came to a halt in front of the center row. Kuai immediately saw how nervous he was. \u201cLet\u2019s give them something else to stare at, shall we,\u201d he coyly thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen began introducing himself with a quick and shaky voice to the class. What nobody other than Kuai noticed was all of Allen\u2019s boyish fat slowly melting away. His polo hung looser and looser off his shoulders as all of his features thinned out. As his tummy continued to shrink, even his shorts began to slip from around his waist. Allen tried to pull it up, but the belt was no longer tight enough around his thinning waist. \u201cI can fix that,\u201d Kuai thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai forced Allen\u2019s tiny body to quickly shoot up several inches. Allen\u2019s shoulders quickly broadened, his hips suddenly enlarged enough to catch the edges of his belt. His knees sprang out from beneath his shorts, exposing a lengthening field of smooth, olive skin. Allen was definitely no longer the shortest person in the class. With his introduction finally over, a much taller, thinner boy took his seat completely unaware of his former self. All he knew was that his shoes felt uncomfortably tight and that his shorts rode painfully high over his exposed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai was pleased with his work, but wanted to make sure they went unnoticed. He studied the reactions of the class intently\u2014and nothing. Most were attentive, some were bored, but none were shouting, \u201cLook, that kid grew six inches in under a minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai took a silent sigh of relief as he continued down the roll. Two girls and an uninteresting boy later, he reached, \u201cDavis, Len.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly taller, trim Native American boy stood up from the back. He had bronze skin with long, straight black hair tied back in a loose pony tail. Some of the students snuck disapproving glares and snickers at Len, hoping Kuai hadn\u2019t noticed. But they forgot that he was a teacher\u2014he notices everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen spoke with a smooth voice and a hint of an accent that Kuai couldn\u2019t place. Despite the class obviously shunning him, he was rather calm as he spoke. \u201cGood. Now watch this class,\u201d Kuai thought, wielding the power of the pendant once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen\u2019s uniform fitted nicely around his thin features. That slowly began to change as Kuai went to work. Within moments of Len giving his name to the class, his muscles began to react. All of them slowly swelled from underneath his uniform, giving tight bulges were none had been before. The pocket sized, gold embroidered school emblem feebly stretched around Len\u2019s chest as it slowly swelled from underneath. The two tight bulges pulled on the buttons of his polo as they swelled larger and larger. Even his knee high-khaki shorts couldn\u2019t hide the thickening bulges erupting from his legs and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of the different growing features on Len\u2019s thickening body, Kuai was especially mesmerized by Len\u2019s growing arms. The two, thin bronze poles quickly inflated with rippling bulges. Veins appeared around every bend, especially inside of the forearm. Each one pulsed just beneath the surface of his skin. His biceps forced his sleeves to tighten, and his sleeves forced even more veins to appear. All of this while both arms laid peacefully at his sides. It was a beautiful cycle in Kuai\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai also kept shooting glances at the class. He noticed the larger Len grew, the more eyes that burrowed into him. The snickers from before were long forgotten. Boys and girls alike were entranced by Len\u2019s tight, gymnast build, and none of them remembered any different. Len didn\u2019t notice how the students salivated at his muscular frame, any more than the students remembered him being an outcast just thirty seconds earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably enough,\u201d Kuai thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in time too. Len had finished with his introduction and begun to take his seat. Kuai immediately noticed how awkwardly Len was walking to his seat, constricted by his shrunken clothes. He also noticed how hard Len was trying to hide that fact, and that Len was the only one who cared. Kuai also couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off of Len\u2019s tight bubble butt or how each cheek swelled with every step he took. Len\u2019s khaki\u2019s could no longer hide just how large his muscles had gotten, and Kuai soaked in every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Len took his seat, Kuai called the next name, but could hear a distinct--- RIIIP--- as Len settled in his seat. Kuai\u2019s commanding voice kept the attention of the class on him, but Kuai saw Len\u2019s face turn beat red with one hand reaching around to feel his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho\u2019s next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cEvans, Patrick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai saw heard a sudden jerk directly in front of him. Patrick moved so quickly that he immediately lost his balance and tripped over a loose shoelace, propelling him face first along the polished tile. Kuai immediately shot his class a most sinister glare, prohibiting any laughter over Patrick\u2019s spill. Still, even Kuai couldn\u2019t stop the roar of stifled chuckling now sweeping the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright,\u201d Kuai tried to asked quietly to the boy sprawled out at his feet. Patrick rolled over, and saw the hulking figure standing directly above him. The harsh florescent lights accentuated his mighty silhouette and bathed Patrick in Kuai\u2019s enormous shadow. With a huge gulp and a red face, Patrick jumped up in front of the class. His once pale face was now redder than a cherry, and he couldn't stop his stammering as he tried painfully to introduce himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai saw the smirks and evil grins of the class. Many of them were enjoying Patrick\u2019s thorough humiliation for no better reason than it wasn\u2019t them. Kuai shot his eyes directly back to Patrick. His thin arms were locked behind him, and he even twirled one foot behind the other as he spoke. Patrick looked absolutely scared and painfully positioned, yet somehow he managed to keep his high, boyish voice talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor reasons unknown to Kuai, he had taken personal offense to the class' reaction to Patrick. His olive face reddened a bit and his eyes were now glued on the stammering redhead. \u201cI\u2019ll give them something to laugh about,\u201d he huffed in his own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick had short, but scraggly ginger hair with hazel eyes and a light spackling of freckles all over his skin. He stood twisted in front of the class, barely capable of going on when all of the sudden, his body shot six inches into the air. His white polo immediately untucked  from him pants, exposing a small portion of a slightly swollen stomach. Patrick\u2019s pants rode up clear past his ankles and part of the way up his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Patrick managed not to fall a second time when his body expanded. Instead, he reposition his feet to take a firmer stance, but his arms were still twisted behind his back. Half a second later, every muscle in his body quickly began to inflate. His polo suddenly tightened around the shoulder and helplessly tried to restrain his rapidly growing physique. Boulders erupted were only bone and fat had once been for his shoulders and arms. This forced Patrick to release them both and hang his arms on either side. Even though, in his mind, he merely chose to move his arms. (Instead of being forced to because they were too big to reach around his broadening backside.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest quickly snapped both buttons of his shirt and even ripped the polo part of the way down his chest. This exposed hint a hint of the heaving slabs of meat barely restrained just under the thinning fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants formed small rips in several places. Patrick\u2019s calves widened and split the bottom seam of his pants. His high water socks were even forced to roll down and split in a few places. His quads and hamstrings stretched each pant leg as far as they would go. Another half inch around and they would have ripped clean off of him. Patrick\u2019s butt wasn\u2019t so lucky. With a quick rip, both glutes tore their way out of their small prison. His tight bubble butt was not going to be contained by such dainty fabrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai finally realized what he had done and stopped Patrick\u2019s growth immediately. \u201cDamn! I forgot to make it where his clothes grew with him.\u201d Kuai actually didn\u2019t mind, he just feared for the boy he tried to protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick finished with his introduction and immediately noticed that his clothes had burst. His face continued to blush as he scurried for his seat with awkward, heavy steps. Patrick's head was pointed straight at the floor, preventing him from noticing that he was about to plow directly into Kuai. Foretunely, Kuai had learned how to be quick on his feet and moved out of the young bodybuilder's way. Their two, respectively huge bodies couldn't fit in the same, tiny row of desks any With an unexpected--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--and another loud--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Patrick, took his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick immediately crossed his enormous arms on his desk, splitting a sleeve in the process and put his head down on his desk, forcing his shirt to ride even higher up on his bare, but heavily muscled torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai didn\u2019t know how this was going to play out. Patrick was obviously still distraught, but what about the rest of the class. He surveyed the sea of faces with scrutiny. Kuai was pleased to find one distinct change from every person who had dared to chuckle at Patrick before: \u201cFear\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear that Patrick heard them laugh at him and fear of what he might do to them if he knows who they are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satisfied teacher even let out a tiny grin. \u201cMuch better,\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai returned to his roll and continued the introductions. The next few students were girls and each nearly tripped over themselves because they couldn\u2019t help but stare at Patrick\u2019s (or Kuai\u2019s) enormous body. Patrick may not have been as large as Kuai by a long shot, but he was certainly the most muscled kid in school. Something Kuai now knew he could change or keep with a single thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more boys came up on the list, but none of them interested Kuai. They were the typical private school rich kids, being too full of themselves already to deserve any assistance. Moving down closer to the end of the roll, though, Kuai finally came to a boy who looked like he could work with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Phillips, Tyler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small boy leaped out of his seat in the first row by the window and nearly sprinted to the front of the class, skidding to a stop in front of the board. His blue eyes sparkled with excitement and seemed to be constantly moving, never staying focused on one thing for very long. His school polo hung loosely off of his short, scrawny frame, and the cuffs of his khakis almost entirely covered his black shoes. Kuai guessed that even the extra-small sizes available for the middle school uniforms must have been a bit too big for this youngster. The boy brushed his wavy, unkempt, medium-length blonde hair out of his eyes before he began speaking, continuing to do so throughout his introduction.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Tyler Jackson Phillips!\" he exclaimed. \"I play on the school soccer team, where I'm a midfielder and was a backup last year, but I hope to be a starter this year. I've been working on running long distances all summer, building up my endurance and stamina, plus since a bunch of guys from last year's team graduated, I should have a better chance.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler never stopped moving. Even as he \"stood\" in front of the class, he fidgeted uncontrollably. Kuai watched the energy shoot out of him in any way it could. \"He's got potential,\" Kaui said, briefly fingering the invisible pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill talking, Tyler rattled off anything and everything that popped into his mind. \"I love video games, and I have both a Sony Playstation 3 and a Nintendo Wii, though the Wii is technically my little sister's, but I play it more than she does. She likes her dolls and play sets, and I like my games. My favorites are Rock Band 3, Batman Arkham Asylum, and Super Smash Brothers Brawl.\" As he spoke, his eyes darted around the room, randomly focusing on various stimuli, including the clock, Kuai, some of the students, the items on Kuai's desk, and the ceiling tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also like to travel, especially to amusement parks,\" Tyler continued. \"This summer, my family and I went to Columbus, Ohio, to visit my grandparents and I got to go to both Cedar Point in Sandusky, which is north of Columbus, and Kings Island in Mason, which is right outside of Cincinnati, south of Columbus. They're two of the biggest amusement parks with the most and best roller coasters in the world, and I rode all of them. My favorites were Millenium Force at Cedar Point and The Beast at Kings Island, which I rode three times each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler effortlessly raced to new topics, he became more and more excited, speaking at a faster pace and his slightly high-pitched voice getting a little louder with each new thing he mentioned. Kuai also noticed that he seemed to be almost jumping up and down now, his enthusiasm for all of the varied interests he described bubbling over in a display of exuberance that was just too cute. Amused, Kuai had to stifle a bubbling chuckle inside of him. At the same time, though, he saw a preppy-looking boy at the back of the class (Bradley Franklin the Third, Kuai coldly remembered from his haughty introduction) lean over to a girl in front of him, whispering, \"What a little spaz!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded, and Kuai's brow furrowed. Tyler might be a bit overeager, and he definitely had some distractibility issues, but the energy he brought to everything was contagious, and Kuai couldn't help but feel affection for the boy, and resentment towards anyone making fun of him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this'll shut them up,\" Kuai thought to himself as he focused his mind on Tyler. He decided to only change him a little bit at a time, wanting to be careful not to make a hyper kid too big too fast, especially after what had happen with Patrick. In his mind, Kuai saw Tyler standing about six inches taller than he currently was, with a bit more meat on his bones; nothing too crazy for now, but something that would put him on par with the other boys in his class and help him fill out the uniform.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as he visualized it, Tyler's body began to slowly grow upward. He continued talking uninterrupted, clearly oblivious to the fact that he was getting larger. His shoulders inched further apart as his entire frame expanded, the small shirt now stretched across his chest, not strained but definitely a tight fit. The tail of the shirt just barely became untucked, still hiding his slender stomach but not by much. Tyler's legs also got longer, his socks now visible below the pants-line, and the leather of the belt stretching a bit against his widening hips.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his growth finished, Tyler stopped talking, wincing in pain. He brought his hand up to his mouth and began to rub his lips. \"Owww,\" he said, moaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Tyler?\" Kuai asked him, concerned that he had done something wrong; that somehow the pendant had ended up hurting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Tyler said, \"it's just my braces.\" He flashed a bright smile at Kuai, revealing the metalworks inside. \"I think the orthodontist tightened them too much yesterday. Don't worry, though, I'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai heard chuckling coming from a scattering of the other students, and shot a stern glare across the classroom before turning back to Tyler, feeling a mixture of concern and endearment for the boy. He had been too caught up in his smooth, flawless skin and bright sapphire eyes to notice the braces he wore, which must've stayed the same size along with the boy's clothes. \"I'll have to be more careful about that kinda thing in the future,\" he thought. He breathed a sigh of relief that he had only decided to make Tyler's first growth a small one, and hoped he would be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler, though, had clearly gotten over it. He continued, still speeding up. \"Anyways, I also make my own movies, writing out the screenplays, getting my family and friends to act in them, and then shooting them with my parent's camcorder, finally editing them on my MacBook and posting them to YouTube. I'm going to go film school for college at either NYU in New York or UCLA in California, becoming a movie director, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai realized that if he didn't step in and stop Tyler, the kid would probably keep talking for the rest of the period, which by now only had about twenty minutes left anyways. He held out his hand and said, with as gentle a voice as possible, \"That's enough for now, Tyler.\" Tyler looked at him, a slight sense of disappointment in his large eyes that made Kuai feel terrible for stopping him. Hating that feeling, Kuai grinned and said, \"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find out everything else about you during the rest of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile returned to Tyler's face, and he nodded. He ran back to his desk, nearly hitting another student's desk with his bigger-than-normal feet, plopping back into the chair. Kuai shook his head in amusement. \"That kid is going to be a whole lot of fun to grow,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two other boys were after Tyler in the roll list, both bulky football players whom Kuai didn't feel like making any bigger. Once the entire class had spoken, Kuai used the remaining time to go over the basic subjects that were going to be covered in the first lesson. As he wrote a stream of numbers and symbols on the board, explaining what they signified, Kuai would always turn and look back at the class, making sure everyone comprehended what he was saying. He also watched the three boys he had grown, interested in how they handled their larger bodies.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai especially kept an eye on Tyler, who swung his legs back and forth underneath his desk, lightly tapping his pencil against his notebook subconsciously. He seemed to be making an intense effort to look up to the front of the classroom and stay focused, though he would also occasionally look out the window to his left, perhaps at a car pulling out of the parking lot, a fly buzzing through the classroom, or at the titles of books on the bookshelf nearby. Whenever Kuai noticed Tyler drift off, he would try to get his attention, saying a particular phrase extra loud, stomping his foot as he turned, or tapping against the board loudly with the marker. Each time, Tyler would quickly face forward, looking into Kuai's eyes with a sheepish grin that indicated he knew he had been caught. His grin, more than anything, with the wired teeth and slightly swollen lips, captured Kuai's heart the most. \"He is one cute kid,\" he thought when he turned back to the board. \"I just need to change the settings back to their defaults, so his braces don't explode in his mouth.\" Taking the pendant in hand, trying to make it look as casual as possible, he quickly turned on the screen, switching the clothing option back on. \"There. Now to have some--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIINNNNGGGG<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish that thought, the class was over. A little disappointed, Kuai nevertheless made sure to hide that fact from his face as he turned back to remind the class of their homework assignment. The boys and girls stood up to leave, Tyler dawdling a bit towards the back of the group. Kuai wished he could spend more time with the boy, but it looked like he would have to wait.</span></div></div>",

He was just about to turn towards the door when he stopped, his mouth hanging open a little. Pointing, he looked up at Kuai, excitement once again bubbling up in his voice. \"Whoa! Is that from UCLA, Mr. Tao?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai knew immediately what Tyler was referring to: a framed basketball jersey leaning against the wall beside his desk, waiting to be hung on the wall. \"Yes, indeed, Tyler,\" Kuai's face went from stone-faced teacher mode to a more casual, friendly demeanor as he walked over to the desk. \"That is a Bruins jersey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, whose is it? Is it Abdul-Jabbar's? Walton's? Miller's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shook his head, smiling in a mixture of pride and embarrassment. \"No, Tyler. That's, um, actually... my jersey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler practically jumped through the ceiling. \"Holy crap! You played for the Bruins?\" Kuai nodded, beginning to say something, but Tyler interrupted. \"Wait! I think I remember you\u2026 yeah! You played power forward for a couple of seasons about six or seven years ago, right? I was just starting to watch basketball then, but I remember seeing a really tall Asian guy play.\" Tyler beamed with pride and excitement. \"You know, I think I confused you with Yao Ming a few times.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Tyler\u2019s grin sagged, immediately replaced by a worried look. \"Uh, what I\u2026 I didn't mean\u2026\" He started running his hands through his hair, a nervous sweat forming on his forehead. \"Ah, geez. You\u2019re not him. You\u2019re you! I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn't help but laugh out loud at Tyler's cute, boyish nervousness. \"Don't worry, Tyler,\" he said. \"You wouldn't be the first. I guess most people don't think that there are very many Chinese men this tall.\" He felt an urge to pat Tyler on the shoulder, but fought it, hesitant to initiate any kind of physical contact. Instead, he leaned against his desk, sitting on his hands. \"But, you know, Yao is a bit older than me, and almost a foot taller. I'd like to think I got him beat in the looks department, though.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's definitely true,\" Tyler's face washed over with a wave of relief. \"Well, anyways, I'm a huge Bruins fan. I told you that's where I want to go to college, right? For film school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded. \"Or NYU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed and rolled his eyes. \"Yeah\u2026 that's where my mom wants me to go. \u00a0She doesn't think I should be going to school clear across the country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kuai stood back up, \"you're just now starting seventh grade. It's not bad to be planning for college this early, but you still have plenty of time to choose. Who knows,\" he added with the hint of a wink, \"maybe, by then, you'll be able to convince her. And if you need an alumnus recommendation, be sure to let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes lit up, and Kuai could tell that he understood him. \"Yeah\u2026 Yeah! I sure will! Thanks, Mr. Tao!\" He grinned again and turned towards the door, bouncing with every step. Kuai watched contently, enjoying the view and thinking about all the different possibilities the pendant gave him with this boy.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler reached the door, though, he stopped. After a second's pause, he slowly turned back around, looking up into Kuai's eyes with an honest, hopeful expression. \"Mr. Tao? Can I tell you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai slowly nodded, unsure of what Tyler was going to say, but preparing himself for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you noticed in class today that I can be a little hyper or distracted sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding back a chuckle, Kuai looked straight at Tyler's eyes. \"Yes, I did, Tyler. It'd be kind of hard to miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corner of Tyler's lips turned upward slightly, and his cheeks reddened. \"Yeah, well\u2026 I haven't told this to any of my other teachers today yet, but\u2026 well, for some reason, I feel I can trust you already. Last week, my mom took me to a doctor-- not my normal doctor, but a psychiatrist. He asked a whole bunch of questions and ran some tests, and, at the end, he told her I have ADHD.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai smiled as gently as possible. \"I figured as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it is kinda obvious, isn't it?\" Tyler chuckled, his hands brushing away another bit of hair that had fallen into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you on any medication?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \"Nope. Not yet anyways. The doctor said that he wants me to learn about ADHD first and see if I can manage it on my own before he prescribes anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai smiled with assurance, this time overcoming his worry and taking the boy\u2019s shoulder with a strong teacherly grip. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be fine Tyler. And let me know if there is any way I can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you bet Mr. Tao!\" Tyler\u2019s bright face lit up again, flashing Kuai with his reflective braces. \"I knew you would back me up! Thanks! This year's already shaping up to be a big success!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Kuai said, eyeing Tyler's slightly bigger but still skinny frame once more. \"In fact,\" he said, this time just to himself, \"let's make it the biggest yet.\" Quickly thinking about what to do, he started imagining Tyler growing yet again, slowly but steadily, inch by inch until he became eye level with Kuai. Sure, it would undoubtedly make him the biggest seventh grader on earth, but if the pendant worked the way it was supposed to, no one would freak out or think that Tyler had ever been any different. In addition, he focused on filling out Tyler's skinny frame with a layer of tightly defined muscles, making sure not to go too extreme, but giving him a true athlete's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had even finalized his thoughts, Kuai saw that the pendant was already at work. Tyler was looking away from Kuai, having seen something out the window that had caught his interest, so he didn't notice the delighted expression on Kuai's face when he started sprouting up. The growth was much more noticeable than before, even though this time his clothes expanded with him. Within a few seconds, he was eye level with Kuai's chest and still getting bigger. The muscles in his torso and arms pushed outwards, filling in the school uniform, which was able to stretch to cover them adequately enough. His elongating thigh and leg muscles swelled, the fabric of his pants keeping up with their expanded form, if only barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was now as big as any of the other students at the school, but he didn't stop there. He continued to get taller, the pendant and its invisible nanites still driven by Kuai's thoughts. Tyler was coming close to be able to look Kuai in the eye, and his body now looked like one that he'd worked hours in the gym to create. The fabric of his shirt, still tight from not growing with him during his introduction, did little to hide the peaks and valleys of his pecs, and the rippling biceps in his forearms. Though Kuai himself had a toned body, he realized that Tyler must now be even more muscular than he was! His shoes, having grown in proportion with the rest of Tyler, also looked to be larger than Kuai's, probably now size twenty or more. Kuai's thoughts for a moment turned to what those huge feet inside must now look like.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler reached Kuai's height, his growth slowed to a stop, and Kuai could've sworn he heard a slight satisfied moaning sound coming from Tyler's mouth, though he figured he must've imagined it. The boy was now an amazing specimen, by far the tallest person in school, student or otherwise (other than Kuai of course). The youthful face on top of the huge, statuesque body drove Kuai wild inside, and he had to shift his legs to hide his arousal. Of all the changes he had made using the pendant so far, Tyler's were definitely the most impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy now seemed to be looking back at Kuai, that adorable grin still on his face. Kuai guessed that, with Tyler now believing himself to have been exceptionally tall all his life, he must enjoy being able to finally talk with someone he didn't have to turn his head down to look in the eye. \u00a0Much as he enjoyed admiring Tyler and getting to know him, Kuai realized that both of them needed to move on. His fourth period students had started walking in, and the clock showed only two minutes left before the bell rang. \"Tyler,\" Kuai said firmly but softly, \"you should get going. I don't want you to be late for your next class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to reality, Tyler quickly looked at the clock on the wall. \"Oh crap!\" he shouted, his voice still the same pitch as before but noticeably more powerful. \"Thanks, Mr. Tao! I'll see ya tomorrow!\" He quickly turned around and bolted out the door. His large feet slammed against the floor, causing e walls to shake slightly. His movement still contained all the intensity and vigor of the 4' 10\" boy he had first entered the classroom as. It seemed as if the growth had done nothing to take away his energy or his restlessness; indeed, it only served to magnify it! Kuai couldn't wait to see the giant hyperactive boy tomorrow, but he knew that he still had more school to get through today.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>BANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA metal ring shot into Kuai\u2019s classroom. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the bell!\u201d Kuai thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his students, both inside the classroom and out, clogged the doorway and hall, eager to find out what was going on. Kuai approached, speaking with a forceful tone. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny seventh graders, dwarfed by Kuai\u2019s enormous body, quickly tried to scatter out of his way. A few even bumped into him, bouncing off his hardened body. However, there were just too many of them, and it took a whole minute before Kuai was able to shove his mighty frame into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai found the source of the bang: about twenty feet away, a huge section of lockers had crumpled under some powerful force. Tyler stood with his back to those lockers, surrounded by about four other boys, two from Kuai\u2019s last class. \u201cTeach you to run into me like that again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t see you! You\u2019re just so---\u201c He stopped himself. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d Tyler pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d one of the boys snarled, \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t MEAN to do this either!\u201d He wound his fist back and launched it into Tyler\u2019s rippling stomach. That alone wouldn\u2019t have been enough to hurt Tyler, but another boy punching Tyler in the gut at the same time, while the third held his foot out to trip him. It was enough to send the overactive titan back into the lockers with another loud, reverberating---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s body cradled deeper inside the increasingly disfigured lockers. A look of anguish wiped across his face. \u201cWhat are you doing Tyler? Fight back!?\u201d Kuai anxiously thought to himself as he fought his way through the sea of students watching the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler trembled with fear. \u201cLook. I promise. It will never happen again. I just got distracted! I was walking. Didn\u2019t see. Then, I---\u201c he huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou smashed that body of yours right into me, making me drop my stuff!\u201d the leader interrupted. \u201cAnd there is no excuse for that-- Freak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Freak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFREAK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother group of boys near the fight chimed into this malicious chorus. Tyler looked feverish and defeated. Everyone seemed sided against him. What was he going to do? Kuai furiously thought, \u201cI am going to end this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai was still trapped about ten feet away, but this fight was over, as far as Kuai was concerned. Kuai immediately took hold of the pendant, focusing on Tyler\u2019s attackers. The leader wound back his thick arm up for another punch, but as it sailed through the air, all of his muscle quickly melted away. By the time his fist made contact with Tyler\u2019s stomach, this boy was no bigger than Tyler once had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand crumpled like paper against Tyler\u2019s steel abdomen. \u201cOw! That hurt, Freak!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy tried to avenge their former leader, but Kuai made the same changes to him. He yelped in pain and grabbed his reddened hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, all four boys were transformed. Before, they ranked among the biggest and the strongest seventh graders in the whole school. But now, each was smaller and weaker than Tyler had been, helpless and unable to dent Tyler\u2019s huge muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on guys,\u201d the leader called out with a whiny, high pitched voice. \u201cWe\u2019re done with this Freak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader coddled his hand as all four of them disappeared up the hallway. Kuai thought about running after them and punishing them with anything the school could throw at them, but he decided he had done enough. Those four boys could never <i>physically</i> hurt Tyler again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tardy bell rang and the sea of students quickly cleared. The boys that had chanted \u201cFreak\u201d earlier lost their nerve as the crowd thinned and scattered away from the crumpled titan. Kuai slowly approached Tyler. The boy\u2019s head hung low, his huge body cradled in the deformed locker that his back had pulverized twice now. Kuai even heard small sobs escape the boy\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler\u2014\u201c Kuai said quietly with sweetness and concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey hate me,\u201d Tyler sobbed, rubbing one eye with a huge, clinched fist. \u201cThey all do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Kuai lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded, keeping his eyes closed. \u201cThey call me \u2018Freak\u2019. They always have. For as long as I can remember, people have always looked at me and thought I was different. I know I\u2019m big\u2026 but I\u2019m still a kid! I still like to play. I still like to laugh and have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sobs worsened. \u201cAnd now with this ADD thing, they are just going to have more of a reason to---to\u2014\u201c Tyler couldn\u2019t contain it anymore. He wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flung his body upon Kuai and wrapped him in the biggest hug he could.  Tyler\u2019s tears quickly soaked Kuai\u2019s shoulder, his huge chest muffling Tyler\u2019s sobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai was stunned for a moment, his arms just hanging at his side. \u201cSchool rules be damned,\u201d he decided. This boy was in pain, and Kuai was probably the only person in the world that could understand the EXACT pain this boy was going through. Kuai slowly closed his arms around Tyler\u2019s huge torso. He was even more heavily muscled than Kuai had originally thought. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Tyler. I\u2019ve got you. I promise, it\u2019s going to be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pulled his body even closer to Kuai, trying to let his words comfort him. After a minute of bawling tears in the hall, Tyler finally quieted back into sobs. He lifted his head up, exposing his moist, reddened face. \u201cEven mom doesn\u2019t get it. I know she tries. But she\u2019s nothing like me. She doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be\u2014 so\u2014\u201c The final word hurt Tyler\u2019s lips to say it. \u201c\u2014different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai knew exactly what Tyler meant. His size hadn\u2019t always been a blessing for him either. Kuai tried to speak, but couldn\u2019t. His eyes had locked into Tyler\u2019s. But somehow, Tyler reacted. Even though his cute, young face was still twisted with pain, a slight smile appeared. Tyler looked into his eyes, but it felt like he was looking into Kuai\u2019s soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2014 are like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these simple words, Tyler summed up everything Kuai could have said to console him. Tyler\u2019s blunt nature and knack for honesty struck Kuai in a most personal way. This look on Tyler\u2019s face reminded him of Kevin just a few hours go. Kuai\u2019s heart fluttered as he thought of the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the pain flowing through Tyler slowly subdued, overcome by his revelation. \u201cIf you are like me, that means you are the only person in the world that understands me,\u201d Tyler\u2019s innocent logic began. \u201cAnd if you understand me, that means you can help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai slowly nodded, his eyes widening at Tyler\u2019s sudden wisdom. But the boy wasn\u2019t finished. Though his flushed face still dripped with tears, he smiled, completing his thought. \u201c\u2014that means I can help you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai was speechless. Why was Tyler having this effect on him? Before Kuai could consider the thought further, Tyler actually giggled. \u201cLike a teacher would ever need my help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Tyler knew. They released from their embrace and slowly stood back up. Tyler and Kuai both towered above the lockers and the empty hallway. Tyler slowly collected the books at his feet, hugged them close to his meaty chest and asked, \u201cIs it alright if I come by after school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded. \u201cSure, Tyler. I\u2019ll be in my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lit back up into his former self. His reddened face beamed with excitement. \u201cNow, you had better get to class, Tyler. We are both running late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gosh! What time is it!?\u201d Tyler snapped around his empty wrist, looking for a watch that did not exist. \u201cOh, duh! I\u2019m late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned and bounced down the hallway. But before he got too far, Kuai called out. \u201cAnd Tyler--!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler immediately skidded to a halt, poking his head from around the corner. \u201cTry not to bump into anyone else today,\u201d Kuai grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tightly closed his eyes and flashed a full set of braces at Kuai. \u201cWill do Mr. Tao! See you after school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whipped back around the corner, an irregular beat of thudding feet fading down the hall. Kuai turned and headed back for his classroom. He actually found himself slightly saddened by the fact that Tyler was gone. \u201cHe is really some kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kuai entered his room, he saw a group of kids just inside the door gossiping about the fight. He wanted to hear what they were saying. \"But what about class?\" Kuai wondered, \"Shouldn't I go ahead and get started?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of his students were standing around the room in clusters, excitedly discussing all that had gone on that day. No one noticed their teacher entering. Kuai heard a group near the door gossiping about the fight, and he casually retreated into the hall unseen, interested in what they had to say. Maybe this could give him a better insight into Tyler, along with everyone else\u2019s perception of this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014I still can\u2019t believe those guys tried to pick on <i>that kid</i>!\u201d one girl  shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid!?  You mean Freak!\u201d a tough tenor voice said. \u201cGuys our age aren\u2019t supposed to be that big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something wrong with him,\u201d the first girl defended. \u201cYou know, a medical thing or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe steroids!\u201d a surprisingly deep-voiced guy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think!?\u201d a second girl gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I saw him taking some pills last year! He <i>said</i> it was for his allergies. But I knew what they were! One of his soccer teammates said he took them all the time right before a game,\u201d the second guy smugly concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a soccer player!\u201d the first girl swooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?!\u201d the first guy snapped sharply. \u201cBut-- have you seen him play!? I hear he\u2019s always missing the ball or kicking it clear off the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI even heard he busted a ball once. Kicked it and the ball\u2014 exploded,\u201d the second guy boomed, his voice sounding like a hollow drum. \u201cThey almost had to forfeit the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls swooned. The first guy, got a little heated. \u201cNot only is he a Freak, but a screw-up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl snapped out of it and spoke again. Kuai winced the sound of her voice, like nails on a chalkboard. \u201cBut why would those four little goons try to beat him up? They barely come up to his waist! They must have known they didn\u2019t stand a chance. I\u2019m surprised he let them get as far as they got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s a pushover!\u201d the first guy exclaimed, \u201cAnd everyone knows it. You saw how he just stood there. That kid may be big, but he knows he\u2019s a Freak. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t fight back! And why bother? Once a Freak, always a Freak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Freak,\u201d the second guy repeated mindlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai broke out into a sweat, his blood boiling. He certainly found out everything he could handle for now. With one large step, he filled the entire doorway, the top of his head obscured by the molding. Kuai glared at his class, especially the group of four near the door. Based on their appearances, Kuai guessed the tall blonde girl had the shrilling voice and the shorter girl with honey brown hair was the other. As for the boys, the ringleader who seemed to have it out for Tyler was a shrimp of a child with greasy hair and thin lips. The other boy stood taller than the rest, extra large with a perpetual blank look on his face. Clearly the first boy was this one\u2019s master, following him like a dog on an invisible leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got one look at Kuai and darted for their seats. The rest of the class heard their hurried footsteps and followed suit. Kuai could barely think straight, furious after what he had just heard. He knew that kids could be cruel, just like adults, but it was always tough being reminded of their senseless maliciousness. The next half-hour was a blur up until lunch. The class left quickly, leaving all of their stuff behind. It took every ounce of strength within Kuai\u2019s enormous body to close the door softly. His face flushed with a bright red. His eyes burned with an intense fire. And a bellowing scream burst out of chest as he drove his tightly clinched fist into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThreads in Kuai\u2019s sleeve snapped as his bicep fought angrily against it. The drywall rattled against Kuai\u2019s power. His hand rested just inside the wall. Kuai did not notice nor care. His mind was consumed with what he had heard. It took a full five minutes in silence before he got his lunch out from behind his desk. Kuai\u2019s thoughts continued to swirl around and around the cruel words those kids had said about Tyler. \u201cIf just a few kids feel that way, what about the rest of them?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe furiously ate his way through a ham sandwich and sucked a small container of juice dry. Kuai didn\u2019t stop to breathe. His mind leapt to a few of the other kids he had changed. He had hoped, despite the pleasure he got out of changing each person, that he had benefited them in some small way; that their changes would help them cope and fit in. \u201cBut if that\u2019s how they treat Tyler\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai dwelled on these thoughts through the rest of fourth period after the students returned from lunch, running through them in his mind while he droned on with the lesson. He couldn\u2019t help but feel responsible for what had happened to Tyler, and what could happen to any of them, like Patrick or Kevin, the dorky-cute kid from first period. \u201cIf Tyler can\u2019t defend himself, what hope does a kid like Kevin have?\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and he dismissed the class. As his fifth period class filed in, the last one before his planning period, he snapped himself out of it. \u201cTyler had problems long before I came along. All of them do. I am the only person who can help these kids. I know what it\u2019s like to be different. And I KNOW that with time\u2014and the appropriate changes\u2014I can reshape their lives for the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai clutched the pendant with new found determination. In that instant, he made it his goal to find kids in need, outsiders, weaklings, and the friendless, and help slowly change their lives for the better. \u201cI\u2019ve found quite a few so far, but I bet there is at least one more in need of help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai just had to wait for the opportunity to present itself. Introductions began again and not too long after, Kuai thought he may have found another kid in need\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The beginning of fifth period, however, put Kuai's determination to the test. Unlike the other classes, where he stood off to the side as the students gave their introductions, Kuai sat down behind his desk as he told the students what to do, too tired and upset from what had happened the previous period to stay on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was another Honors Pre-Algebra, and the kids definitely seemed more well-behaved than the previous classes, but also much less interesting. The first name that came up definitely stood out from the rest, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakani Akamu-Oke?\u201d Kuai fumbled a bit with the pronunciation, looking around the classroom, not sure if he should be expecting a boy or girl to answer. After a few seconds of receiving blank stares from the class, though, he repeated the name. \u201cMakani?\u201d No one answered again, so he marked down the absence and continued with the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy after girl after boy came up, and Kuai couldn't find any that intrigued him. He knew that the indifference was beginning to show on his face, but he couldn't bring himself to fake any kind of interest right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the students had spoken, Kuai looked down at the roll list and sighed. \"Can't there be just one boy who catches my attention like Kevin or Tyler?\" he thought to himself as he stood back up to begin the lesson. \"Is that too much to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer to his question, just as Kuai had put his marker to the board, the door flew open. Looking over, he saw a bronze-skinned boy with shaggy chestnut-brown hair covering his eyes and ears, reaching the collar of his polo, covering the back of a thin seashell necklace he wore. He had a thin build and stood about 5' 3\", on par with the rest of the boys in his class. He meekly stepped into the room, eyes on his sneakers, ashamed for having interrupted the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa-KAH-nee?\u201d Kuai asked sternly. The boy nodded, avoiding eye contact with the class. \u201cAm I pronouncing that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, sir,\u201d he said lowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the back of the class, Kuai heard a couple of girls' voices start to whisper to each other. \"Is that the new boy?\" one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is!\" her higher-pitched friend said. \"Did you hear what happened to him in third period?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai turned around and frowned, stomping his foot down loudly as he did so, which got the girls to shut up. He then turned to the boy at the door, shaking his head. \"Young man,\" he said, \"this isn't a good way to start the year. I expect my students to be on time every day, especially on day one.\" He stepped a little closer to Makani in order to intimidate him a little, to make him think twice about being late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy kept his head down as he held up a small slip of paper to Kuai. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Tao,\" he mumbled. \"I-- I was-- Here's my --\" The boy swallowed hard, finally looking up to Kuai and tossing his head to one side to move the hair away, revealing a pair of deep, golden-brown eyes underneath. \"I was at the Nurse's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftening his glare a little, Kuai grabbed the note and studied it closely. The signature of the Nurse was spot-on; it appeared to be legit. Kuai slowly began to nod. \"Okay. You're excused\u2026 for today,\" he added for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man visibly sighed with relief, getting ready to head to the only open desk, in the front row. \"Hold on,\" Kuai stopped him, \"one thing, while you're up here.\" The boy froze, turning around after a few seconds and looking up at Kuai with a bit of fright in his eyes. \"It's nothing big,\" Kuai said, trying not to come off too harsh, \"but I'm sure everyone would like to hear a bit more about you.\" Receiving a questioning look from the boy, Kuai motioned to the board. \"Just stand in front of the class and tell us your name and a little about yourself. Your interests, what you did this summer, things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hesitated, looking petrified. \"O-okay,\" he finally said, slowly shuffling up to the board, still holding his notebook. He turned his body to face the class, but his head was still pointing down at the ground. \"My-- my name is M-Makani Akamu-Oke.\" He clutched one arm with his hand, trying to keep his balance. \"I\u2026 M-my family moved here from Hilo, Hawaii last month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai leaned forwarded at this, his curiosity piqued at last. He didn't like to cut in on his students, but he had to find out more about this exotic new kid. \"Oh, really?\" he asked. \"Why? What brought you to the other side of the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani turned his head towards Kaui, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. \"Uhhhh\u2026\" He shifted nervously from one foot to another, finally taking a deep breath. \"I-- My dad, and-- uh\u2026 I mean my parents--\" Another big gulp later, he furrowed his brow in determination and finally spat it out. \"My dads moved to Massachusetts to get married. They-- they were tired of not having -- of\u2026 you know, not having the same rights as other couples\u2026 so when one of them got an Associate Professorship at Northeastern\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kuai said, nodding in approval, ignoring the snickering coming from the class. \"Good for them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Makani looked like he felt a little grateful to get that off his chest. Kuai knew revealing that kind of information on the first day would not make the boy very popular, but he knew that it took courage for him to do so, especially considering how closed-off Makani seemed to be otherwise. The boy started fiddling with a metal bracelet on his wrist and continued, \"Anyway, I guess I like doing things outside\u2026 When we were in Hawaii, me and my older brother Kale would go surfing almost every weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai could hear a girl in the class swoon, and he could understand. He definitely enjoyed the image in his mind of this attractive Hawaiian boy riding a wave, his wet brown skin glistening in the Hawaii sun. As much as it made Kuai happy for the boy's fathers to be able to get married to each other, it almost seemed criminal for him to have to live this far north. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Makani continued to talk about his interests, Kuai realized that this was the boy he had been looking for all period. Whether or not he had a surfboard beneath him, Kuai could still make sure that he at least looked like a surfer, with a muscled, ripped body. While all eyes in the class were up front, Kuai started to form a picture in his mind of a taller Makani, with a much more toned body, one that would turn heads on any beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few seconds for Makani to start becoming bigger. His body inched upward, growing taller little by little as the class watched, unaware of what was going on right in front of their eyes. Kuai noticed the boy's legs, sticking out of his shorts, not only were getting longer, but the calf muscles were growing larger and more rounded. His chest pushed outwards, the fabric of the shirt conforming to the hills and valleys of his pecs and abs, and his biceps and triceps swelling and rippling as the boy kept moving back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis transformation now finished, Makani now looked more like a proper surfer: ripped physique with a healthy glow and a broad stature. It might not have been quite a big a transformation as Tyler's, but Makani still had to be one of the biggest kids in the seventh grade, and Kuai could tell that virtually all of the girls in class were watching as the boy finished talking and returned to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai smiled at the changes he had made, now ready to start with the lesson, feeling more enthusiastic about the day. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wrapping up his lesson as the bell rang, Kuai walked over to the door, watching the students file out of the room. He sighed, happy to be finally finished with classes, only having his planning period left. He also thought about all the boys he had grown during the day, trying to decide which one was the most enjoyable change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the classroom emptied, Kuai looked up and noticed that Makani still remained seated at his desk, his eyes facing the board and his hands propping up his chin, his body motionless. Watching him for a moment, Kuai finally cleared his throat and said, \"Makani? It's the end of class. Time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy didn't respond, still staring straight forward. Starting to get concerned, Kuai moved over towards his desk. Usually, the sight of such a large body standing above would be enough to get any of his students' attention, but Makani didn't blink an eye. \"Are you alright?\" Kuai asked, waving his hand in front of Makani's face. As he did so, he noticed the bracelet that Makani had been playing with earlier as he introduced himself to the class. Looking closer, Kuai saw a clasp on one side that looked like it could be opened. \"It must be a medical bracelet,\" he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, he gently grabbed the boy's wrist and popped open the clasp. Inside, a small panel read \"Makani Akamu-Oke 2/15/1999, This patient has Epilepsy. If seizure lasts more than 5 minutes call 911.\" Kuai breathed in deeply, trying to calm down his swirling emotions as he realized what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Makani blinked and jerked his head up to look at Kuai. When he saw the large man looming over him, Makani's eyes lit with a fiery glow. He seemed a but disoriented, and as he began to comprehend his situation, his mouth dropped open in shock. Kuai kneeled in response, keeping his hand close to the boy's arm. \"It's okay, stay calm,\" he said as softly as possible. \"Do you know where you are and who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second of examining Kuai's face and his surroundings, recognition replaced confusion. \"You're my Pre-algebra teacher, Mr. Tao. And -- I - I'm still in your classroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded, the corners of his lips turning upward in relief. \"Right, Makani. That's right. Are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Makani said, closing his eyes and rubbing his forehead with his hand. \"I-- I must've just had a \u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A seizure,\" Kuai finished, indicating the medical bracelet. \"I was worried when you didn't leave with the others, so I opened it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani squirmed some in his seat, but his eyes softened as he stared at Kuai. The same fire from a moment ago returned in Makani\u2019s amber-colored eyes, but only for a moment. Suddenly and without warning, Makani just grabbed his notebook, jumped to his feet and hurryed towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little disappointed, Kuai stood back up, eyeing the boy's muscled legs as the cuffs of his shorts swished just above his knees as he walked away. \"Are you sure you're good to go to your next class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani halted immediately and lingered in the doorway. \u201cLet me at least write you a note,\u201d Kuai offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani turned and slowly approached Kuai\u2019s desk. He kept his head tilted down and spoke through his thick chestnut hair. \"Thank you Mr. Tao. This year is going to be tough as it is. I\u2026 I need to make sure that I start my next class off on the right foot, unlike what I did with you.\" He hesitated, but finished his apology. \"I... I'm sorry if I offended you earlier by being late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Makani's humbleness and sense of personal honor won Kuai over for good. \"Not at all,\" Kuai said, chuckling. \"I hope you didn't feel too put off by my attitude earlier. Without a doubt, I\u2019m serious about my students and want to be absolutely sure they are always prepared.  However, I never judge or hold a grudge against them\u2014 or you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time all day, Makani began to smile. Kuai handed him a slip of paper. Makani gently removed it from Kaui\u2019s grip, still daunted by the size of his math teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" he said, tossing his hair out of his eyes, \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly fair of you, Mr. Tao. I promise that your kindness will not be wasted.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it was clear that Makani wanted to make full eye contact with Kaui.  Already his confidence was building and Kuai knew it. Even through his shyness, Kuai could tell Makani had an unexplainable charisma about him, something that captivated Kuai. The flames in this boy\u2019s eyes said it all. Underneath this meek shell was a powerful person just waiting to be unleashed. And Kuai had the power to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani gripped his medical bracelet in one hand. Kuai took that opportunity to brake Makani\u2019s intensifying gaze. Pointing to the bracelet, Kuai said, \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on you. And please feel free to come by anytime if you need something. I am here for you and the other students.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani's grin became an enchanting smile. The flames in his eyes held Kuai tightly to him as they continued to grow. Makani looked even taller than he had been after the change, his back and neck straining to reach up to his teacher. Kuai could've sworn he was holding his head higher, his muscled neck straightening out. \"I will certainly do that, Mr. Tao,\" he said, taking Kuai's hand and shaking it with a surprisingly firm grasp, biceps flexing as he did so. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani\u2019s spell broke, for now. He broke his gaze from Kuai just as the tardy bell rang. Makani released Kuai\u2019s hand. \"I'd better hurry to class. I'll see ya tomorrow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai stood in the doorway and watched the muscled Hawaiian boy stride down the hall. Right before Makani turned the corner, he looked back. Surprisingly, he had a somewhat embarrassed smile on his face. \"You know, you're the only teacher today to pronounce my name right on the first try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved, then disappeared. Sighing, Kuai turned back to the classroom, his eyes wandering from wall to wall as he tried to organize his feelings. It took him a moment to recover from his after-class encounter with Makani. Kaui hadn\u2019t realized it until now, but his face was hot and he was breathing rather quickly for only having been standing still. He even found that he was slightly light-headed. Makani had quite the effect on Kaui, and more interestingly, Kaui hadn\u2019t even noticed until after it was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finding a way to push those thoughts aside, Kuai was left only with the emptiness of his classroom. A combination of relief for a job well done, anticipation for the rest of his day, and loneliness set in. Kuai knew that he would be seeing all of his favorites again tomorrow, and there were plenty of other students to encounter all throughout the school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the last period of the day, which was the planning period. Luckily for Kuai, he really didn't have planning to do yet. He pretty much had everything ready for the rest of the week, since it was only the first day of class. He needed to cover pretty much the first chapter of the book in almost every class that he taught, which meant that he was just going over old material, or repeating stuff from the previous year that the kids should have already covered before. It was then all new material from there, and he would end the first week of class with a small quiz in all his classes at the end of the week, most likely on Friday or on Monday, giving him the weekend to do most of the grading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had written down the lesson plans for all his classes, which all covered just about the same math subjects, and he knew he could use the math quizzes he prepared the previous year. All he needed to do was go to the teachers' lounge and run off enough photocopies to hand out to the students. Once he was done with that, he was actually done for the day. There were still thirty minutes left in the period, and there was no reason for him to sit around an empty classroom during the final period of the day, so he decided to go out and wander around the athletic facilities and see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he strolled up to the glass door to the gym, he spotted a few kids sitting on the wooden bench on the sidelines while most of the boys were playing a pickup game of basketball as Coach Thompson was blowing the whistle as the referee. Kuai immediately recognized most of the kids in there, since he just had them during the fifth period math class in his own classroom. Much to his surprise, he saw that Makani was one of the boys who was sitting on the bench. How come he wasn't playing basketball with the rest of the class?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai quietly opened the side door to the gym and walked in. He walked along the perimeter of the court, in order not to disrupt the game that was in progress. Then, he decided to sit down on the wooden bench, next to the muscular boy from Hawaii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" he whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Mr. Tao!\" Makani said, with a surprised expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was done with my planning work, and I dicided to walk around. I saw you guys were in here, so I figured I'd come and take a look!\" Kuai explained. \"So, how come you're not playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Umm...\" Makani mumbled, as he pulled on his silver-and-red Medic Alert bracelet. \"I'm excused from participating in P.E. class...\" he said in a downcast tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it because of... Epilepsy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani let out a deep sigh in reply as he stared at the wooden hardcourt floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can't participate in any sports at all?\" Kuai asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I surf and swim with my dad... Plus I got a treadmill and a weight bench at home, so I can lift weights when there's someone there to watch me!\" he replied excitedly. \"I lift weights at home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe score between the two teams had just tied, and Makani suddenly looked up, ready to cheer on his classmates. He then stood up, took a few steps forward, and started cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Asher! Just one minute to go! Go, team, go! Go, Tim! Go, Steve! The score is tied! You guys need to score! GO!!!\" Makani started shouting at his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn't feel more proud. Here was a boy who couldn't play, due to a disability. Yet, he was so selfless and so supportive of those classmates who were on the court, that he would still come out and cheer on all his classmates!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kuai looked up and saw the Hawaiian boy standing in front of him, he quietly took hold of the pendant with his fingers. This kid had shown so much passion, and so much character, he couldn't help but imagine Makani with just a little more muscles, perhaps in his arms and in his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kuai had imagined, Makani's calves swelled even more. They were already big, from the previous growth spurt, and now they had growth to the size of pro-soccer-star-level. The boy's thighs thickened a bit, adding layers of muscle as well, becoming big enough so that he wouldn't look too big. Kuai didn't want the boy to look like a bodybuilder. At least, he looked like he lifted plenty of weights and the other kids would respect him in the hallway and the jocks would know by now NOT to push him around. Kuai also wanted to make sure nobody would dare pick on him just because he had a disability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Makani's arms inflated a bit more, as his biceps ballooned to the size of softballs. With bulging triceps and a nice vein running over his bicep and down his arm, the Hawaiian boy was dangerously close to resembling a pro weight lifter. All the other students would be aware of the fact that this boy was strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani finally shouted out loud as the team scored the final basket as the clock ran down to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won! We won!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy Hawaiian boy sat down next to Kuai, with a wide grin on his face. Just then, another boy named Asher sat down right next to him, reaching over and grabbing a small gym bag that sat on the floor behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice basket, Asher! Good game!\" Makani cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, dude. Here, my mom gave me a small jar with jelly to take with me. It's really sweet...\" Asher said, as he pulled a small sealed glass jar containing a red substance out of his bag. The skinny boy, who was much smaller than Makani, wrapped his fingers around the lid on the jar as he strained to unscrew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two tries and failing, he turned and looked at Makani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to try?\" Makani asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsher stared at Makani, examining his bulging biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Asher said, as he handed him the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani casually placed his bronze-skinned fingers around the edges of the cap, and gave it a twist as the thick biceps in his arms flexed while Asher looked on. There was a loud POP and the cap came off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go...\" Makani smiled, as he handed the opened jar and the cap to his friend. \"Piece of cake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang... You're STRONG!\" Asher exclaimed, as he took the jar of jam from his classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani just shrugged, as Kuai looked on at the two boys with a wide grin on his face. Kuai pondered helping Asher out later, but he certainly felt proud of his big Hawaiian boy at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai returned to school the next day and continued his math classes as usual. This time, he was actually looking forward to seeing all his students, especially the ones he got to grow bigger the previous day. In a way, he felt bad that he had already changed these boys and made them bigger, because it meant that he had to go out and look for other boys to grow. He was still extremely happy to see Kevin, Tyler and Makani in his class, and all three boys did extremely well. They were all well-liked and respected by now, and they had slowly become known as the big three boys on campus. This made Kuai very happy and it only confirmed the fact that he needed to spend more time walking around after school, so he could see if there were others he could help using his pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce class was over for the day, Kuai wandered around the athletic fields surrounding the school yard and the large main buildings where the classrooms where located, looking for new students to assist. He loved sports and sports activities and he supported any student who was actively involved in athletics. Not only that, but he was also involved in the basketball program at the school, so he had a personal interest in seeing that the student athletes at his school excelled in sports and athletic competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai walked over to the football field, where he spotted a young man named Anthony, an eighth grader at the school. Kuai saw that Anthony was practicing throwing the football to Chad, another one of the members on the football team. Anthony was a little bit shorter and thinner than Chad, and he struggled with attaining the same reach as Chad did, when throwing the ball. Chad was able to launch the ball from a distance and to have the ball land in Anthony's hands, but Anthony came a few yards short every time he tried returning the ball to him. Kuai saw that and decided to give him a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile holding the pendant in his hand, Kuai glanced over at Anthony from where he was sitting, in the bleachers, and he began to imagine what Anthony would look like, if he were to gain another thirty pounds of muscle and if he grew another six to eight inches taller. Just as the previous few times, that was exactly what happened: Kuai saw Anthony change right before his very eyes, since he was standing on the field before him wearing a t-shirt and shorts with running shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's arms and legs thickened and grew longer right away, making him grow eight inches taller in the process. His torso also expanded as he grew wider by a few inches. Next, every muscle in his body began to swell, as thirty pounds of raw muscle was evenly added and distributed across his entire body in a matter of just a few seconds. His biceps and pectorals grew firmer and his abdominals became more defined while his calves ballooned outward from the back of his legs. His thighs increased by layers of muscle and every muscle became hard all over. This time, when Anthony threw a football, it clearly sailed right over Chad's head! Chad had to run in order to get the ball, because Anthony had thrown the ball so high and with so much force!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai had grinned when he saw the effect of his little growth spurt on the boy and decided to go home so that he could have dinner with Sean, his boyfriend. It was Friday night, and he was looking forward to the weekend. He had a lot of math quizzes to grade, but he knew that he could get it all done once he got started on it. He was already looking forward to seeing his big boys in class on Monday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the weekend, Kuai just focused on relaxing and grading math quizzes. He knew he had the pendant, and he could have gone out to have some fun with that. He actually wanted to try something new and use the pendant to make someone grow really big, he just didn't know who to grow and how big to make him yet. He wanted to be careful and try it out on either a new person or someone whom he had used it on already, and just make that person really big, like seven or eight feet tall or more. He needed time to think about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the fifth period math class, he had Makani. Although Kuai was happy to see the big Hawaiian boy in class, the big surfer boy seemed unusually quiet that afternoon. After class was over, Makani was the last to get up from his desk, and Kuai addressed him right away as the Pacific Islander stumbled over towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Makani! What's going on? You seem a bit down!\" Kuai said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr. Tao... My parents... We may be leaving again soon...\" he replied sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You guys just got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but my dad just got a six-month internship in Washington State... So, I don't know what's gonna happen to me... I hope I don't have to move again... I want to stay here... I like it here...\" Makani sighed, while staring at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, dude... That's tough! You just started school here, too!\" Kuai added. \"That would be really hard on your grades to change school at the beginning of the year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... But, I need a place to stay... Unless my parents can find me a foster family here... Someone who can take care of me during the next six months...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your father's cell phone number!\" Kuai responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani gave Kuai his father's cell, while giving him a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... Are you gonna call my dad?\" he stuttered. \"What... Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a foster family to stay with?\" Kuai asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay with me!\" Kuai grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You're kidding, right? Are you serious?\" Makani gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call your parents and invite them over to my apartment this evening. I'll take care of everything!\" Kuai said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Thanks, Mr. Tao!\" the Hawaiian boy cheered, as he walked out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Makani had left, Kuai picked up the phone and dialed the number. He spoke with Makaio, one of his fathers, about the possibility of becoming Makani's guardian while his fathers go to Washington State on an internship for six months. This would mean that he would have the big boy living with him, and he would have plenty of opportunities to use his pendant on the boy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things went surprisingly well for Kuai that evening. He got to meet both of Makani\u2019s fathers, who were more than excited to meet their son\u2019s math teacher. They had already heard an earful about this famous teacher, and now they finally got to meet him in person. What made the evening even more interesting was the fact that Kuai was willing to become Makani\u2019s guardian while his two fathers went to Washington State for their internship. Kuai showed that he had nothing more than Makani\u2019s best interest at heart, and he argued that it would be extremely difficult for the boy to maintain good grades if he were to be taken out of school during the middle of the school year. Both of his fathers agreed and they started making arrangements for having the Pacific Islander stay with his math teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gave Kuai several thousand dollars, enough to covers basic expenses like food and clothing, but also money for medication and visits to the neurologist. Obviously, there was a concern about Makani\u2019s seizures, but Kuai assured them that he would do everything to ensure the boy\u2019s mental and physical well-being. He would treat the boy like he were his own son, and he would call his fathers if anything were ever to go wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani arrived at Kuai\u2019s place the following day with two suitcases and a soft bag filled with clothes, books, and some old toys which he had brought along with him from the days he was still living in Hawaii, and Kuai showed him the small guest room where the boy could put away the clothes and all his belongs and make himself at home. Makani then hugged his fathers as they said their goodbyes and left to go to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, champ\u2026 Let\u2019s see what\u2019s on TV, okay?\u201d Kuai said, as he took the remote and switched on the flat screen TV set in the living room. \u201cGo ahead and make yourself at home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani changed into his tank top and shorts, and he removed his socks and sneakers so he now just walked around the house barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look your carpet\u2026 It\u2019s so nice and soft! Do you mind if I watch TV on the floor?\u201d the boy asked his teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, go right ahead!\u201d Kuai replied, as he sat down in his recliner chair next to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani lied down on his stomach with his legs stretched out completely, resting his chin in the palms of his hands while his elbows were on the floor in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, champ\u2026 Here is a pillow in case you decide to doze off!\u201d Kuai chuckled, as he tossed the boy a pillow that was on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026 Thanks, Mr. Tao!\u201d Makani replies, as he rested his head on the pillow as he watched TV from the carpeted floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn\u2019t help but grin as he looked down and see the Hawaiian boy lying on the floor before him. He figured the teen must have been tired from packing and moving his things and unpacking all his belongings again that day. Indeed, it only took about twenty minutes for Makani to doze off on the carpet in the middle of Kuai\u2019s living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kuai looked down, he couldn\u2019t help but smile as he saw the young, tall, muscular Hawaiian surfer boy on the ground before him. His eyes were closed, and his long, black hair was covering part of his face. His mouth was open just slightly, making him seem so cute as he lay there, sound asleep. It was hard to imagine that the boy was only twelve years old, for he seemed a few years older since he was so big now. As Kuai looked down at his pendant, the temptation to make the boy grow a little more became almost unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani\u2019s legs were several inches away from the edge of the couch on the floor. As Kuai focused on the boy\u2019s bronze legs and feet, he concentrated on his legs growing longer until they just barely touched the edge of the couch. The pendant immediately worked its magic on the sleeping boy, and Makani\u2019s legs suddenly grew about eight inches longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai blinked when he saw that Makani\u2019s leg moved as it rubbed against the edge of the couch. The Hawaiian boy let out a soft moan, as he turned his head around. Kuai laughed as he realized that he had unintentionally grown Makani over six feet tall by now, and it would be interesting to see how tall he would be once the boy wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Makani groaned, as he shook his head and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you took a little nap there, big guy!\u201d Kuai said, as he got up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani stood up and walked over to Kuai. The math teacher guessed that the boy was just about an inch or so past six feet tall now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 That felt great\u2026. Umm\u2026 Mr. Tao?\u201d he asked shyly. \u201cCan I get something to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, champ! The glasses are in the cupboard to the right of the fridge! We got soda and juice in the fridge, so help yourself. I suggest we go get something to eat in a few, and then we can go to the grocery store and stock up on some food for the two of us, okay?\u201d Kuai replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Makani walked to the fridge and opened the door, Kuai held on to the pendant and imagined the boy growing to the same height as him. Kuai figured it would be fun having the boy be the same height as him, so he didn\u2019t have to look down on him all the time. He always had to look down on all the kids at school, but now he didn\u2019t have to look down on Makani anymore, if he made the boy grow to six-foot-nine, same height as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Makani stood there and poured some water and ice into a glass, he felt his legs grow longer, his arms lengthen a few inches, and his torso stretch out further. Luckily, his muscles were also growing in proportion with the rest of his body, and the Hawaiian boy noticed how his pectorals, his thighs and his calves were inflating all at the same time as well. The boy had quickly grown to the same impressive size as Kuai, and his clothes were much too small for him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Mr. Tao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What\u2019s up, champ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy clothes must have shrunk or something\u2026\u201d the boy said, as he slowly walked back to the living room, holding a glass of water in his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai stood up and couldn\u2019t help but smile. Makani was exactly the same height as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 You\u2019re as big as me, so you could wear my clothes now\u2026\u201d Kuai replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d Makani grinned. \u201cCool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we can go to the mall and buy you some shorts and t-shirts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai got Makani some clothes to wear and the two young men got ready to go out and have some fun. They had some shopping to do, and some errands to run, and Kuai couldn\u2019t wait to show off his new big Hawaiian student to the rest of the world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kuai headed out the door, he saw Sean's small compact car pull into the driveway and his boyfriend get out. \"Hey, Makani,\" Sean said, \"how are ya liking your new home so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great, Mr. Sean,\" Makani beamed as Sean stopped in front of him. Kuai tried to stifle a laugh as he watched his average-sized boyfriend crane his neck upwards to talk to the boy behemoth like it was an everyday occurrence. Kuai wondered for a moment if other people that saw him and Sean when they went out on dates were thinking the same thing about the difference in height between the two of them. He cracked a smile at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, buddy,\" Sean said, shaking his head while grinning, \"<i>I'm</i> not your teacher. Call me Sean, not 'Mr. Sean.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\u2026 Sean,\" Makani nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you two big guys off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna take the T down to South Shore Plaza and see if we can find some clothes for Makani,\" Kuai answered. \"He's seem to have, um\u2026 outgrown his current ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sean asked, continuing to smile as he headed to the front door of their house. Winking at Makani, he said, \"I figured; that shirt looked like it might have been one of Kuai's. I guess a growing boy like you probably has to get new threads every few months, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Makani nodded. \"More or less. Not <i>that</i> often, but close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving goodbye to Sean, Makani and Kuai started walking down the sidewalk. The train station was only four blocks from Kuai's house, and it took about five minutes to get there. Kuai paid the two dollars for a ticket, while Makani swiped his student pass, which had unlimited access. Luckily, the southbound train that they needed had just pulled up to the station as they stepped onto the platform, and they hopped onboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car they had got on nearly was overflowing with all the late Friday rush hour commuters heading home to the suburbs after a tiring work week downtown. Kuai saw that only one seat in the entire car appeared to be open. He motioned for Makani to sit down in it, but the boy shook his head. \"No way,\" he grinned. \"I want to subway surf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subway surf?\" Kuai narrowed his eyes in puzzlement, with a slight sense of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Makani said as he found an open space in the car with not many other people around. \"It's when you ride the subway standing up, without holding on to any rails or anything, and try to keep your balance as you do so, just like on a surfboard. I've only seen people do it on YouTube, but if I know how to surf for real, I should have no problem doing the same kinda thing in a subway car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn't help but feel a bit skeptical. \"Well, first of all, this part of the line is above ground, so we're technically not on a subway. And secondly,\" he softened his voice out of concern, the boy's condition in the back of his mind, \"isn't it dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani didn't have time to answer as the train lurched to a start. Kuai grabbed on to the rail running across the ceiling in the middle aisle, but Makani stuck out his hands and arms, trying to keep his balance. Other passengers in the car quickly moved out of the way, clearly afraid that the large boy would topple over and crush them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Makani seemed to have no trouble staying vertical. The train reached full speed, banking around a corner. All the while, the Hawaiian muscle boy's feet stayed firm, his large pillar-like legs keeping him steady, and his torso tilting and flowing along, countering the forces of gravity and inertia, keeping him standing upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got more comfortable, Makani made eye contact with Kuai and smiled. Impressed with the boy's skill, Kuai returned the smile and gave him a thumbs up. Makani brought his hand up as well, but instead of a thumbs up, he extended his thumb and pinky, flashing the \"hang loose\" sign, sticking out his tongue in playful fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train's brakes began to squeal, the vehicle quickly decelerating. Makani leaned forward, looking like he almost was going to have to reach out and grab a pole, but quickly recovered before the train came to a stop. More people got up and left, opening up two seats, which Kuai and Makani both took. It was a bit of a tight squeeze, the two 6' 9\" muscle-bound guys sitting in seats designed for people about two-thirds their size, but Makani didn't seem to mind, and Kuai enjoyed the chance to be so close to his\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis what, Kuai thought to himself. His student? No, that was too formal, and didn't represent nearly what their relationship had blossomed into. His protege? Perhaps, but that still sounded off. He would have liked to be able to call Makani something like his son, but Makani had two wonderful fathers who had prior claim to that title. Finally, he just decided on calling him his friend, because that's what the boy had now become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the train continued to roll down the tracks, Makani turned to Kuai, a spark of some idea in his fiery amber eyes. Noticing this fire, the corners of Kuai's lips turned upward. \"What's that look for, Makani?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" the boy said. He faced forward again, his hair falling down and covering his eyes. After a few seconds, though, he took a deep breath and turned back to Kuai. \"I just wanted to say, Mr. Tao--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuai. When we're not in school, please call me Kuai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Makani's bronze cheeks started turning red slightly, \"uh\u2026 I just wanted to say, Kuai\u2026\" He had put an extra emphasis on the name, as if his mouth was savoring the chance to say it. \"\u2026 that I'm really grateful for you and Sean taking me in for these six months, and for you personally being so willing to help me out. Everything you've done has really been more than I could ever ask for, or  hope to repay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Kuai protested, \"don't say that! You don't need to repay me anything. I'm doing this because you're a great guy worthy of a shot at success. I know if you have the support you need, you can excel at anything: school, sports\u2026 even be able to overcome your\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My epilepsy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded. \"That or whatever else comes your way. You're twelve years old, you're life has barely begun. There's going to be things that happen to you down the road that you won't see coming. But,\" Kuai turned and stared straight into Makani's eyes, the fire inside them now blazing, \"if you're confident in who you are, and in who you've surrounded yourself with, then you can't lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani began to mist up, and he began to sniff a bit. Kuai gently placed his arm across the boy's broad shoulders, giving him a gentle, encouraging pat on the back, then quickly bringing it back to his side. The rest of the train ride went uneventful, and as they stepped off, Kuai noticed the sky had grown darker during the trip, evening setting in. The bright lights of the mall shone in the distance, beckoning them forward. They quickly marched the two blocks, finally arriving at the mall doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a Friday, the mall was packed. Large groups, mostly teens and twenty-somethings, mulled around in the center hallway, and as Kuai and Makani stepped inside, dozens of heads turned, staring in awe at the 6' 9\" athletic Asian man and the equally tall and doubly more-impressive Hawaiian boy that accompanied him. Kuai glanced at Makani out of the corner of his eye, knowing the boy saw all the eyes fixed on them, and relieved that Makani seemed to be delighted with all the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Makani said as he walked up to the mall directory, examining it quickly, \"why don't we first head to\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the moment Makani walked into the Apple Store, he was an instant celebrity. The tall Hawaiian surfer boy strolled over to the table whee the iPods were on display, and started playing with one of the newest mp3 players. Almost immediately, two teens walked up to him, wondering what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, they need to load some surfing tunes on this thing! There is nothing but classical music on this iPod. Who listens to that?\" Makani grumbled, while holding the small device in his large, bronze hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother teenager stood next to him, not sure whether to address Makani as a teen or as a grownup, since he was so tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some grownups listen to classical music, like my dad! What do you listen to, Mister?\" the teen asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister? I'm no grownup! I'm a kid, just like you!\" Makani replied with a grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! How... How old are you?\" the boy asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy walked up and stood next to him. This boy had the same facial expression, so Makani guessed that they were brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm only twelve years old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I'm thirteen and my brother is sixteen and you're bigger than both of us!\" the youngest of the two boys exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Uhhh...\" Makani said, with his face turning a little red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at his muscles! That guy is huge! He must be super strong!\" the older boy gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be all the surfing I did back when I was in Hawaii\" Makani chuckled as he flexed his right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens stared at the big teen with amazement when Makani finally decided he wanted to move to the next table and look at the iPads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys want to check out this iPod?\" he asked the two boys. Both boys nodded. They were staring at the tall Hawaiian in complete disbelief after they heard he was only 12 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani handed them the iPod and wandered over to the next table where several iPads were on display. He picked up one of the tablets and began looking for an icon of a game he could try out. No sooner had he started playing a game on the iPad, which emitted many funny sounds while he played it, or two boys and a girl walked up next to him and tried to see what he was doing. One of the boys had to stand on his toes in order to see the screen, due to Makani's height. Makani saw his, and decided to greet the kids who had surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You guys want to try?\" he asked one of the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! What are you playing?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angry Birds!\" the big Hawaiian responded while he handed the iPad to the boy. \"Just tap here and push the bird back and fire him at these pigs over on the right! You gotta try to knock down as many pigs as possible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the boy started playing, a young man wearing a blue shirt with an Apple logo on it came walking up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you with anything?\" the sales representative asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get the Angry Birds game for my iPod as well?\" Makani asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can, Sir! Just log on to iTunes and purchase the game with your credit card and then download it to your iPod!\" the man explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... I'm too young to get a credit card. Is there a free version?\" Makani asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there is, Sir!\" the man replied, before walking off. \"Just search for it on the app store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Makani replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai had overheard the conversation and couldn't help but chuckle at the fact that most people had a hard time guessing Makani's age right now. Most people were probably guessing that he was a teenager or a college student, due to the fact that he was so big and tall. Nobody would ever think that he was still twelve years old! Wouldn't it be even funnier if he made Makani grow even bigger than he was now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai stood near the front of the store, trying to appear busy with the new white iPhones while in reality he was watching Makani out of the corner of his eye. The whole store seemed to gravitate around the towering Hawaiian, a small throng following him as he headed to the back of the store and picked up a pair of headphones for his iPod. A couple of teens slightly older than Makani even pulled out their phones and snapped a couple of quick pictures. \"I wonder if they think he's a basketball player or something,\" Kuai said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani pulled out a small black wallet and took out two twenty dollar bills that he had saved up from several weeks worth of allowance, finding the same salesperson he had talked to earlier, who pulled out a small iPod-like device and began to ring him up. Once he had his change and receipt, and his purchase sat safely inside a small, shiny bag with a silver Apple logo, the Hawaiian boy made his way back over to Kuai, the people in front of him quickly getting out of his way as he forged the crowded store. \"Ya gonna get one of those?\" he asked once he got close to Kuai, pointing at the phone in the teacher's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kuai took a second to remember what he had been looking at. \"Oh, no. I'm still on contract for a few more months. Besides, you know Apple; there'll be a new one coming out next month for sure.\" He grinned and sat the phone back on its dock, and the two headed out of the store, waving goodbye to the friendly employee at the front as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what?\" Makani said. He seemed to have gotten even more energized than before, probably pumped from having so many people gawk at him admiringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kuai turned his head to the long end of the mall's hallway, \"didn't we come here to buy you some clothes?\" A wry smile formed on his lips. \"Maybe THAT'S what we should do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Look, there's an American Eagle store upstairs!\" Makani pointed. \"They always have some pretty awesome shirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Kuai nodded, \"Let's head there next then.\" In the back of his mind he doubted that the smaller stores like that would have anything to properly fit a 6' 9\" muscular boy, but he'd let Makani discover that on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two entered the store, Makani headed straight to the fitted polos off at the righthand side. He stood back for a moment, looking over the dozen or so styles of shirts: orange ones, blue ones, red ones and black ones. Stepping closer, he began running his hands through all of the shirts, examining their tags. It took him a few minutes to finally pull out one with wide black and blue stripes and a small embroidered eagle on the chest. Makani held up the shirt to his torso, comparing it to see if it was anywhere close to big eough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it came up substantially short, looking like it wouldn't even cover his stomach if he tried it on. \"I don't think that'll fit you, Makani,\" he said, rubbing his chin with his right hand. \"What size is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double X,\" Makani's head dropped, his dark hair falling into his eyes. \"I can't find one that is any bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in understanding, Kuai recalled his own troubles finding stylish clothes that fit him. \"Excuse me,\" he said, waving down the only employee that seemed to be on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came over, stopping for a moment when she finally got a good look at the 6' 9\" boy, her eyes bulging slightly. \"C-can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're looking for some clothes,\" Kuai said. \"What's the biggest size you carry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"XXL in the store, XXXL on the website.\" She eyed the boy from head to toe. \"I'm afraid we don't make anything that'll fit either of you. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shrugged, sighing. \"Thank you anyway,\" he said. He saw the disappointment in Makani's eyes as the boy put the shirt back on the rack. \"It's okay, we won't leave until we find something that'll work for you, even if we have to stay at the mall all night!\" He patted Makani on the back, and the boy brushed the hair out of his eyes, the spark in them beginning to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed out of the store and towards the center of the mall, where Kuai saw an information desk. \"They might know where we should look,\" he said softly. Walking up, he leaned against the counter and nodded at the smartly-dressed, almost prissy middle-aged man with greying hair who stood on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to South Shore Plaza. How can I help you, sir?\" The man spoke with a noticeable lisp and had a slight conceited attitude, repelling Kuai almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was wondering if there are any Big and Tall stores in the mall. We're trying to find something that would fit Makani here.\" He motioned behind him, noticing that the boy was now posing for a picture along with a polite young Japanese couple that only came up to the bottom of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai chuckled and faced forward again. He could feel the man judging both of them as his eyes examined Kuai, then as he turned to look at Makani from head to toe. Kuai had known a few guys like this who were friends of a friend or something like that. Arrogant old queens, he thought to himself. Finally, the man answered, \"Unfortunately for you, sir, we don't have any specific Big and Tall stores inside South Shore Plaza. However, you might be able to find something serviceable at Macy's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kuai said, trying to hide his disgust and glad to be finished with that conversation. He stood back up to his full height and walked back over to Makani, who waved goodbye as the smiling couple bowed slightly and left. \"C'mon, buddy, Macy's might have something that'll work for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Awesome! Let's go!\" The two turned around and headed to the large anchor store, which happened to be near where they had entered the mall at. As they walked, Makani seemed to become more and more excited with each person who turned to look at him, giving him a bit of an extra spring to his step. He seemed to have forgotten the letdown in the American Eagle store just a few minutes earlier. His glowing demeanor seemed almost contagious, and Kuai couldn't help but smile as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Kuai and Makani walked through the doors of the large Macy\u2019s department store, there were greeted by a large red-and blue sign which caught their attention almost immediately: \u201c70% OFF ALL ITEMS in the MEN\u2019S DEPARTMENT \u2013 TODAY ONLY\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Did you see that?\u201d Kuai cheered, as he pointed at the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Let\u2019s go!\u201d the big Hawaiian boy shouted. \u201cNot one minute to lose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two large figures marched around the perimeter of the store, until they spotted the sign indicating that they had arrived at the Men\u2019s Department. From there, they started browsing the many colorful racks, shelves, and stands for all the various types and name brands of shirts, t-shirts, slacks, coats, jackets, shoes, socks, underwear, undershirts, and any other article of clothing which they could find in Makani\u2019s incredible size. Amazingly enough, the store was very well stocked, and they had everything from Adult Small to XXXL along with 'Tall' variations for each size. Makani made numerous trips to the dressing room, where he tried on different dress shoes in brown and black, undershirts, button shirts, polo shirts, t-shirts, and various types of slacks and jeans which he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Makani! You need one of these!\u201d Kuai noted, as he had found a beautiful, black pinstriped suit consisting of a coat and matching slacks. \u201cYou\u2019ll look so sharp in this along with your matching black dress shoes and a nice black leather belt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani dashed to the dressing room and immediately tried on the coat and the slacks. When he came out, he looked smashingly handsome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you need now is a nice button shirt and a red tie, and you\u2019ll be looking like a prince!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the sales associates came walking by, and she couldn\u2019t help but stop and stare at the large Hawaiian boy who was now all dressed up in the black pinstriped suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Look at the big hunk in the suit!\u201d she giggled. This immediately made Makani blush, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai ended up buying Makani three or four ties and belts as well, to go with the slacks and the shoes, so he had a few matching sets of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having tried on the dressy clothes, Makani wanted to test out something more casual. He found some Bermuda shorts with a tank top and some sandals. He put them on, and they fit so well that he decided to keep them on for the rest of the evening. Kuai paid for the other clothes and Makani ended up carrying two large bags filled with clothing items as the two big guys left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the store, they strolled right past an ice cream parlor. Makani asked Kuai if he could have a cup of ice cream, so Kuai gave him some money. While Makani stood in line, another boy came up right behind him. As Makani ordered and paid for his ice cream, the boy standing next to him realized that Makani was a kid just by the way he talked and by the hi-pitched tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! How old are you?\u201d the boy asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? I\u2019m twelve!\u201d Makani replied. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thirteen! But-- you\u2019re so big! You\u2019re a giant!\u201d the boy remarked, making Makani feel proud. Obviously, the boy was much shorter than him, and Makani thought that was way cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani walked back to the table where Kuai had sat down at, a huge grin on the boy's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you smiling about, big guy?\u201d Kuai asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis kid at the ice cream shop\u2026 He said I was a giant! He was a year older than me, but I\u2019m still a lot bigger than him\u2026 Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d Makani wondered out loud. \u201cEverybody thinks I\u2019m big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last remark got Kuai thinking that perhaps it was time to tell Makani about the pendant. The more he thought about it, the more Kuai realized that it was a good idea to inform the boy that he had been responsible for the growth, and that he had the pendant which allowed him to grow Makani even bigger as well. Even while just looking at the muscular Pacific Islander, Kuai had the faint urge to make the boy grow a little bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he fought the urge and decided to wait until they arrived home, so that he could tell his student about the pendant and perhaps use the growth spurt in a demonstration without all the crowds around. Kuai pondered even changing some of the settings on the pendant, so that Makani could actually \u201cfeel\u201d his body growing and notice when the growth spurt would start and end. If the boy was going to be able to see the pendant, Kuai realized he would have to turn the invisibility switch off as well. And, of course, Kuai didn\u2019t want to make the boy outgrow his brand new clothes just yet, so he made sure that the setting which caused the boy's clothes to grow along with the rest of his big body was turned on. That would prevent Makani from bursting out of the clothes they had just bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai stared at the pendant and formulated the best way he could bring it up to Makani. He supposed that if Makani didn\u2019t believe him, he could make him grow a bit, just to erase any doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani and Kuai finally left the mall and headed to the train station, returning home. As the boy started to put away all of his new clothes, Kuai stood outside the bedroom door, checking the pendant one last time, making sure the switches were set just like he wanted them to be. Taking a deep breath, he entered the boy's room and sat on the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakani\u2026. I've got something to tell you\u2026\u201d he said to the boy, who was standing in the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure? Whatya got?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to tell you something. You see, there's this pendant\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Pendant?\" Makani's eyes lit up as Kuai pulled out the pendant from around his neck. \"Wow! That's pretty fancy! Kinda high-tech-looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai chuckled. \"You have no idea, really. And believe me, it's not just for show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani sat down on the bed next to Kuai to take a closer look. \"Wow, it's got a screen on it? What do all those switches do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kuai started, \"they're kind of like preference settings on a computer, I guess, just helping refine the main purpose of the pendant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is?\" The Hawaiian boy's fiery eyes looked straight at Kuai's, full of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai could feel his heart start to beat faster. Why did this have to be so difficult? Oh yeah, he thought, because it sounds so crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed hard, finally saying, \"The pendant allows me to change things, like with my mind. Specifically, I've been using it to transform some of the boys at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani stared at Kuai in amazed silence for a few moments, then broke out in a laughing fit. \"WHA--? BWAHAHA-- Mr. Ta-- HEEHEE--\" He couldn't get out a word without cracking up for nearly thirty seconds, his eyes starting to water. Finally, he took a deep breath, wiped his eyes, and shook his head. \"That's a good one, Mr. Ta-- I mean, Kuai. So what's it do, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you'd believe me,\" Kuai said, a serious expression still on his face. \"That's why I want to do this. Stand up for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani rolled his eyes slightly, rising to his full 6' 9\" height. \"Fine, I'll humor you, but only--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's words were cut off as he was overcome with a weird tingling sensation. As soon as he began to stand, Kuai started focused on him growing to the ceiling, which was almost eight feet from the floor. Nearly instantly, the muscles in Makani's body started to tingle and flex, his bones stretching outward as his head inched towards the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time Kuai had allowed the target of growth to be aware of what was happening, and the sense of wonder and incredulity in the boy's eyes was truly something special. As he passed seven feet tall, Makani began running his hands down his shirt, which had grown along with him, amazed by how long his torso was getting and how far away the ground was starting to look. \"Wha- what's happening to me?!\" he asked, a little scared, Kuai thought, but also with a sense of excitement beginning to set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his frame was expanding as well. His shoulders widened, and his strong, muscled back now looked truly enormous. His feet, barefoot from having kicked off his shoes when he came in the house, now were nearly the size of two rowing oars, and Kuai chuckled when Makani started to wiggle his toes, guessing the boy didn't believe they were still his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai hadn't decided to change Makani's muscles at all for now, but the height increase made them grow in proportion to the rest of his body, and just the sheer sight of the giant beefy boy was enough to cause Kuai to marvel at his own work. Makani now looked like he could rip a phone book in half, or pull a small tree up from its roots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the top of Makani's head brushed against the ceiling, and his growing stopped. He had gone from being very large and impressive, to nearly being like a Greek god, the perception of power emanating from his body to all those around (which, unfortunately, was just Kuai for the moment). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Makani exclaimed. \"I'm a giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai laughed. \"You were already pretty much a giant before. Now you're just more of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" Makani twisted his hips back and forth, taking a look at his front and backside. He tilted his head up to the ceiling, ducking down instinctively when he realized how close he was to it. \"So how exactly does the pendant make the changes? Is it magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's powered by nanites or something,\" Kuai shrugged, \"I'm not really sure. I just know that it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Makani shook his head in wonder as he sat down on the bed, which sagged a little under his new bulk. Kuai couldn't help but be amazed to be looking up at a twelve-year-old boy who was over a foot taller than him. Makani stretched out his long, bronze legs, his feet nearly reaching the opposite wall. \"Ya know, for the past year, I kinda thought I wouldn't get any taller than I was. I mean, I'd been 6'9\" for so long, I thought I just had my growth spurt really early and I was finished. But now--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Kuai interrupted, \"I have something to tell you about that as well.\" Makani tilted his head, looking at him questioningly. Sighing slightly, Kuai started his confession. \"So, I got the pendant in the mail at the beginning of the school year. A friend from California sent it to me the day before classes started, and I brought it with me. I changed several boys that day, making them bigger or taller or whatever...\" Kuai paused, bracing himself for what Makani's reaction would be to his next words. \"...and you were one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hawaiian boy's eyes bulged, and his mouth fell open in shock. \"What? But I don't remember any changes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because of the settings on the pendant,\" Kuai explained. \"The only person who is aware of the changes is whoever wears the pendant, unless he allows either the one who is changed or everyone else to realize it. That's what those switches were for. In fact, even now the only people who should be completely aware of your change in height should be you or me, unless I change the settings again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani seemed to still be in shock, and Kuai was dying to be inside the boy's head and know what he was thinking. He also felt a new sense coming over him: remorse for keeping his actions hidden for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the boys tilted his head towards Kuai slightly and spoke. \"So... so I haven't always been tall and strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shook his head. \"Not by a long shot. On that first day, you were skinny and a bit on the short side. I changed you while you introduced yourself to the class because... Well, because I liked you. I liked the mixture of your shy nature with your pride, both for your heritage and your family. You're an interesting kid, Makanki; you have a fire in your eyes that just... drew me in, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani appeared to be lost in thought. \"I remember coming to after a small seizure at the end of your class that first day, and I remember you being so supportive and fair about it. I don't remember growing or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the pendant did it's job,\" Kuai nodded. \"I probably should've told you sometime sooner, but we've become such good friends partially because of that, and I enjoyed making you grow too much. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little embarrassed, Kuai hung his head low. But out of the corner of his eye, he saw Makani's face light up. \"Sorry?! What are you sorry for?\" the giant boy enthused. \"This is the best thing that could ever have happened to me! I love being the biggest guy I know, and having everyone look at me in awe wherever I go. I can't believe you think I could be anything but ecstatic with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai suddenly felt the large, muscled arms of the Hawaiian boy wrap around him in a powerful hug. He gently squeezed back, unsure if Makani even realized that Kuai was doing so. \"Well, Makani,\" Kuai said, \"I'm certainly glad you like being so tall. It certainly takes a load off of my back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani jumped up to his feet, nearly hitting his head on the ceiling, as he turned to face Kuai, an excited, hopeful look on his face. He looked like he was about to ask something.</span></div></div>",

We can do that. We can go for a walk, we can watch the other kids play baseball, and we can even go to the public pool which is right next door!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I wanted to go to the park just so that we can be outside. That way, you can try out the pendant some more!\u201d Makani grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai thought about the boy's words when it dawned on him: the giant wanted him to make him grow even bigger than he was now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026. I see where this is going! You want me to make you even bigger, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Makani asked again. This time, he was almost begging Kuai to make him bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that if I make you an inch taller than you are now, I\u2019ll have to shrink you back later on, or else you won\u2019t fit through the door?\u201d Kuai noted. \u201cYou will have outgrown the house then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! I just wanted to see what it\u2019s like to be really big\u2026 Like\u2026 Over ten feet tall!\u201d the boy said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, big guy!\u201d Kuai chuckled, as he stood and walked up to the giant boy, having to crane his neck in order to look up to the big kid, who was standing almost two feet taller than him now. \u201cLet\u2019s have dinner and get some sleep, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Makani beamed, as he turned around and set the table while Kuai ordered a pizza for him, Makani and Sean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Sean was totally astonished when he saw how big the Hawaiian boy had become! He barely made it up to the boy\u2019s abdominals, and it seemed weird looking up to a twelve-year-old kid who was so big and so muscular while standing almost three feet taller than him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, dude! You\u2019re scaring me!\u201d Sean gasped, when he walked through the door. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna outgrow the house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Makani cheered. \u201cI plan on doing that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai ordered several pizzas, since one wasn\u2019t enough to feed two big adult men and one giant boy. He ordered three pizzas, and he decided to save whatever was left in the fridge for the next day. That evening, the three of them just watched a movie on the big flat screen TV, before Makani crawled in bed and dozed off into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani was the first one awake that Saturday morning, which was typical for a twelve year-old boy. Kuai found him on the living room floor, watching cartoons, which was to be expected for a kid of his age. Makani was already dressed up in a tank top and shorts with tennis shoes, and he was ready to go out and have some fun in the park. Kuai took the boy to a bagel place down the street, where the two of them had a bagel for breakfast before they headed to the large public park. There, the two wandered around and observed a group of kids playing soccer at the soccer field, when they came by a concrete basketball court which was unused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got an idea!\u201d Makani cheered, as he ran towards the court and got all the way up to the hoop. He stood right next to the post, which supported the rim and the backboard, and patiently waited for Kuai to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026 Yes\u2026 The rim should be exactly ten feet from the ground!\u201d Kuai noted, as he compared the height of the rim to the top of Makani\u2019s head. He guessed that the difference was indeed about two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! So, if you make me reach the hoop, then I\u2019ll be ten feet tall!\u201d Makani grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, big guy! Just stand straight and don\u2019t move!\u201d Kuai instructed, as he focused on the Hawaiian boy. Using the basketball hoop as a measuring tool, he focused on Makani and imagined the boy becoming even bigger and taller, until the top of his head reached the edge of the red metal hoop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani felt his arms, his torso, and his legs tingle all over the place, as bones cracked while limbs began to elongate and grow all at once, thanks to the magic of the pendant. Due to the way Kuai had the switches set, Makani\u2019s clothes would also grow along with his body, preventing him from bursting out of his clothes. The boy\u2019s shoes grew even bigger than they already were as his enormous feet continued to expand to gigantic proportions. His phenomenal legs stretched out as his muscles grew bigger at the same time. His calves truly became rock-hard and huge, transforming into the biggest calves on earth. The same counted for his thighs and his biceps, which were gigantic by now! The kid had become a true titan! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani\u2019s abs continued to grow even bigger while his torso grew taller and wider. His shoulders became broader than they were already and his arms were just colossal by now! For Kuai, it was almost a pity to stop the growth at ten feet. He knew that he would make the boy even bigger real soon! The bigger he made Makani, the cooler the boy looked to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so awesome!\u201d Makani cheered, as he looked over and realized that he was the same height as the basketball hoop. \u201cI can dunk without jumping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Most guys will be too afraid to play basketball with you, Makani! They wouldn\u2019t want to defend you, trust me!\u201d Kuai pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani walked over to Kuai and the two of them headed over to the large pond, where people were feeding the ducks. Right away, several kids walked over to the giant ten-foot-tall boy. Kuai couldn\u2019t help but chuckle when he saw that Makani had become a big attraction for kids of all ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! How big are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow tall are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani kept on getting these questions from several kids, who came up to him. They all stared with wonder and awe at the giant boy, who was as big and as tall as a giant, but who still looked like a kid and who walked and talked like a young boy. At least, Makani had the face and the voice of a kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Makani! Let\u2019s go for a swim in the pool! I brought some towels and I got you your swimming trunks!\u201d Kuai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy!\u201d Makani smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go swimming, especially now that I\u2019m big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kuai and Makani looked over, they saw the large public pool straight ahead of them, surrounded by lounge chairs, a snack bar, a building containing the showers, and two high chairs were the lifeguards were seated. Obviously, there were numerous gasps from the parents, the kids, and the life guards at the pool when Kuai and Makani walked up, looking for a chair where they could set down their towels and their bags. This was going to be a fun afternoon for Kuai and his ten-foot giant!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai already noticed one problem with having Makani as a giant: the oversized kid had a hard time fitting through doors and squeezing into buildings that were built for \u201caverage\u201d people. Using his pendant, Kuai decided to quietly shrink Makani back to eight feet tall, so that the boy could at least get into the locker room and change into his swimming trunks. Once the tall Hawaiian came out, he made him grow back to ten feet tall, and the big boy was happy as a clam!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani wandered around the perimeter of the pool, until he reached the deepest end. A sign painted on the edge of the pool indicated that the pool was nine feet deep at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t dive in, Makani!\u201d Kuai warned the big boy. \u201cIt\u2019s still too shallow for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai realized that Makani had already reached the point now where he had become too big to do certain things, and diving into a pool that was nine feet deep when he was ten feet tall wasn\u2019t a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, Kuai! I\u2019ll jump in right here!\u201d Makani replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big boy just leaped into the air and landed in the water with a huge splash, grabbing his ankles in mid-air. The boy hit the water like a huge bomb, setting off several huge waves, much to the delight of all the other kids who were swimming in the other area of the pool.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai got on a lounge chair next to another chair where a nice gentleman was just watching the kids in the pool.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, lots of kids in the pool today, huh?\u201d the man said to Kuai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, absolutely!\u201d Kuai responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee the boy with the red trunks? That\u2019s my boy, Jason!\u201d the man said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai then pointed to Makani, who clearly stuck out above all the other kids who were swimming in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee that kid with the blue trunks? That\u2019s my boy. His name is Makani!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up in complete amazement when he realized that Kuai was pointing at the giant Hawaiian boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026 That really big kid who\u2019s swimming in the pool? The one who just jumped in right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai just nodded in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! That is one HUGE kid! Oh, my name is Jonathan, by the way. And, like I said, my son\u2019s name is Jason! He\u2019s thirteen years old!\u201d Jonathan said, as he reached out to shake Kuai\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you! I\u2019m Kuai!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kuai got a text message from Nick from California, asking about the pendant. An idea just came to him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJonathan, do you mind taking a picture of us?\u201d Kuai asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! Maybe Jason would like to be in a picture with your giant kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kuai and Jonathan called out to their boys, and they climbed out of the pool. Jonathan took Kuai\u2019s cell phone as Kuai, Makani and Jason huddled together with Makani standing in the background, since he was the tallest, by far. Kuai and Jason stood right in front of him, with the giant ten-foot-tall boy looming over them in the background. Jonathan had to take several steps back in order to get all of Makani to fit in the frame, before taking two pictures of the three of them. Then, he handed the cell phone back to Kuai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jason and Makani jumped back in the pool, and Makani just stood on his feet, with his head sticking out a foot above the water since he was a foot taller than the water line of the pool anyway. Several kids swam over to the giant boy, and started climbing on his shoulders and used his big, broad shoulders as a diving board.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn\u2019t help but grin when he saw that Makani had once again become a big kid-magnet, even in the pool. All the kids were immediately attracted to the giant boy, and they were all swimming around him like bees buzzing around honey. They each took turns climbing his broad shoulders so they could jump from them into the pool, which didn\u2019t have a diving board. That way, they could pick which side of the water they could jump into, since they were using Makani as a diving platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kuai heard one of the boys make an interesting remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026 I wish you were a little bit taller so we could dive even higher into the pool!\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai quietly took hold of the pendant and imagined Makani growing once again. This time, he made the giant boy grow another two feet taller, until he was twelve feet tall! Makani\u2019s chest was now sticking out above the water line, and he was truly a sight to behold! Standing twice as tall as an average adult, the big Hawaiian boy had to lift the kids on to his broad shoulders so that they could jump into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! How did your boy get to be so big?\u201d Jonathan asked Kuai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 He\u2019s from a big family\u2026 He\u2019s got good genetics, I guess\u2026\u201d Kuai responded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Nick called him on his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKuai! Who\u2019s the big kid in the picture? Holy smoke!\u201d Nick gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Makani Akamu-Oke. He is one of my students. His fathers had to leave for a few months and I decided to take him in. The boy is from Hawaii and let me tell you, he just loves to grow!\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big is he now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just increased his height to twelve feet! The kids adore him and the boy just loves being a giant! This kid is built to grow! He is the main attraction everywhere he goes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not kidding!\u201d Nick gasped. \u201cHave you given him a big growth spurt yet? Like made him twenty feet tall? Or even bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet. I decided to grow him just a few feet at a time. So far, he\u2019s loved every minute of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you take him outside to the park or something, give him a big growth spurt and see how he likes it. Then send me a picture of our giant boy. I\u2019m dying to see how he turns out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, we\u2019re at a public pool by a park right now! So, I might try that after he\u2019s done swimming!\u201d Kuai said with a smile on his face. \u201cTrust me, this kid loves being big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai just couldn\u2019t wait to give Makani his next growth spurt. The hardest part was deciding how big he was going to grow the giant Hawaiian boy\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai began to wonder how much fun a giant twelve-foot-tall muscle boy could have in a pool while he was surrounded by half a dozen kids who were all taking turns climbing on his shoulders so they could dive in the water. Then, once Makani started floating around on his back, the kids wanted to use the giant teen as a living raft. They took turns climbing on his torso and they would sit on his huge chest before sliding back into the water. For these kids, having Makani in the pool was nothing more than a huge treat, and Kuai noted that this was only the beginning of the giant boy\u2019s celebrity status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Makani finally climbed out of the pool and dried off, Kuai suggested that the two of them would go walk around the park a bit before heading home for dinner. As they wandered past the trees and bushes in the large recreational park, Makani suddenly stopped and looked up, scanning one of the trees for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear that? Look! Over there!\u201d the huge boy noted, as he pointed to an animal that was standing on one of the branches of a large oak tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cat!\u201d Kuai said, while looking up at the tree. He spotted a small, gray-haired kitten, who was standing on one of the branches, just over twenty feet above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani positioned himself just below the spot where the cat was standing and he tried to reach out with his long, muscular arms, when he realized that even he was out of reach. Then, he tried standing on his toes, but the branch was still too high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRats! The branch is still too high for me! I can\u2019t reach it!\u201d Makani grumbled, as he even tried leaping in the air but barely missing the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai then looked down at the pendant, which hung from his neck, as he looked up at the giant boy. He realized that this was the perfect opportunity to give Makani his big growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Makani!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm\u2026 Yes?\u201d the boy responded, as he turned to face his teacher, who was smiling back at him while holding his pendant in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for another growth spurt, my friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Kuai! You\u2019re gonna use the pendant to make me gr--\u2026 WHOA!\u201d the giant boy gasped as he was overcome by an intense prickling sensation in his arms and his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Makani looked down, he could see everything around him shrink very slowly. The trees, the buildings, the people in the distance, the cars in the parking lot\u2026 Everything seemed to be shrinking. As the boy looked sideways, the large oak tree seemed to be shrinking as well, as the branch that the kitten was standing on slowly appeared to be coming closer and closer to his line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the odd tingling sensation stopped. When Makani looked straight ahead, he was looking down at the top of the oak tree. He was able to bend down and extend his mighty arm, and allow the kitten to jump from the branch onto his huge hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere kitty kitty!\u201d Makani said quietly, as he squatted down and set the poor, scared kitten on the ground. That\u2019s when he looked up and spotted Kuai, who now looked much smaller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKuai? Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Makani looked down, he saw a short man standing before him. The man only came up to his knees! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Makani\u2026. How do you feel?\u201d Kuai asked the giant boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 Why\u2026 How did you get so small?\u201d Makani asked the little man standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t shrink or change size at all! You, my friend, have grown to the impressive height of thirty feet!\u201d his teacher responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhooaaa!\u201d Makani said, as he turned both ways as he looked around. Then it dawned on him. Everything seemed smaller to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral other people walked up to Makani, curious to meet the young, giant boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Makani looked down and realized that all the other people were also small compared to him, he realized that what Kuai had said earlier was indeed true: Makani had grown to enormous proportions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026 I was big before but now I\u2019m REALLY big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jonathan came walking along with his son Jason in tow. These were the father-and-son pair whom Kuai and Makani had met at the swimming pool, an hour earlier. Jason immediately came running towards Makani and stopped right in front of the giant boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Makani! You look big!\u201d the boy chuckled. Concerned that the boy noticed a change in height, Kuai checked the settings and made sure that the fourth switch was still on, which it was. He guessed to himself that just being around a thirty-foot-tall twelve-year-old was big enough for anyone to notice, no matter what the nanites did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you could do?\u201d Jonathan suggested to Kuai. \u201cYou should take Makani to the fairgrounds tomorrow! People will line up to have their pictures taken with Makani! Especially since he\u2019s so big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai pondered the idea for a moment. He liked the idea a lot!</span></div></div>",

Of course, everyone stopped in order to look up to the giant boy! Makani just kept on walking until he heard his teacher calling out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakani! Stop! I can\u2019t keep up with you!\u201d Kuai said, as he came running after the towering boy. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up with your stride, big guy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai finally caught up to him and stood before the tall Hawaiian, panting from the short sprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to carry you?\u201d Makani laughed, as he extended his huge hand as he squatted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai then stepped on to Makani\u2019s hand as Makani lifted him up to eye level. Makani then started walking, while holding out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat an incredible view from up here!\u201d Kuai grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani made it to the house in just three minutes, walking at an amazing speed with his long, powerful legs. Once they arrived, Kuai directed the boy to step over the six-foot fence and to walk over to the back yard behind the house. There, Makani squatted down and allowed Kuai to get back on the ground, when Kuai took a few steps back and took hold of the pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shrink you down so you can get into the house, big guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he said, the giant Hawaiian boy suddenly began to dwindle down in size! Everything around him began to increase as Makani\u2019s arms, legs and torso went through a rapid shrinkage, all in proportion. Luckily, his shoes, shorts and t-shirt also dwindled along with the rest of his body. It was an incredible sight for Kuai to see the giant boy shrink before his eyes, until he was finally reduced to standing 6 feet tall again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Even shrinking feels amazing!\u201d Makani grinned, as he continued to dwindle until Kuai reduced him down to his original height of 5 foot 3 inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, this was how tall you were before I started making you grow, a few days ago!\u201d Kuai pointed out. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside so I can experiment some more before we go to the fair tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani walked into the living room and stood in the center of the room while Kuai sat down on the couch before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see here\u2026\u201d Kuai grinned, as he looked over the pendant and the switches. \u201cI can grow all of you or just part of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Just a part of me? That\u2019s awesome!\u201d Makani giggled. \u201cTry it out on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai realized how much Makani just loved the sensation of feeling his body grow and shrink so he was more than happy to volunteer himself as his test subject. Kuai looked up at the boy and focused on just one part of the boy\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Makani felt a tingling in his hands, both of them! Then, as he raised up his arms, he realized that his palms, and his fingers were growing! His thumbs and all his other fingers were growing longer and thicker, while his hands were almost twice as big as before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! My hands! You grew my hands!\u201d Makani gasped, as he admired his huge hands, which were the size of baseball gloves now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake off your sandals, dude!\u201d Kuai ordered, as he looked down at the boy\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani kicked the sandals off, as moved them aside. Almost immediately, he was overcome by a tingling sensation in his feet, and as he looked down, he noted his feet and all his toes growing longer and wider at the same time. His feet grew to the point where they were twice as long as before, and twice as wide. They were as big as fins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck! I got big feet!\u201d Makani laughed, as he lifted up his huge feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I can also grow your muscles!\u201d Kuai laughed, as he concentrated on the boy\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani let out a loud gasp as his chest began to expand while his biceps in his arms began to inflate. Both biceps began to swell as they inflated like balloons, growing to the size of melons as they felt hard as rocks. In the meantime, Makani\u2019s flat chest suddenly came to life as his pecs pushed outwards and sideways, filling outward and making the boy look like a junior bodybuilder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 This is amazing! You can do so much with that pendant! I love this!\u201d Makani said, as he flexed both arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d like this!\u201d Kuai grinned, as he looked over the muscular boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Makani felt his torso grow bigger in every direction! His entire midsection was growing taller and wider! His chest and his stomach were just getting bigger and bigger, making the boy stand taller and wider, thanks to the pendant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll put you back in proportion and then I\u2019ll make you grow bigger before we go to the fairgrounds! How tall do you want to be?\u201d Kuai asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Twelve feet tall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy that tall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m twice as tall as all the grownups!\u201d Makani answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, champ. You got it!\u201d Kuai grinned, as he concentrated on Makani shrinking back to normal sized before he made him grow back to eight feel tall, in proportion. \u201cHow is eight feet? Is that tall enough for you, for tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai just looked up at the big, smiling boy. He was becoming a growth-junkie, but Kuai didn\u2019t mind. He would make Makani grow any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His rest was a peaceful one, not waking up at all until the next morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight had just started to stream in through the window blinds, and Kuai had barely opened his eyes when he heard the sound of a door fly open and two large feet running through the hall, then a fist pounding on their door. \"Kuai!

I guess they don't have those in Hawaii... at least, anything like The Big E.\" The Eastern States Exposition, or The Big E as it was more commonly called, had just started, still in its first weekend of the year. The large event basically counted as the state fair for their area of the country, where all six New England states came together to showcase agriculture and livestock, as well as to host various shows and entertainment, topped off with a midway full of dozens of rides and games. Though they would have to drive a couple of hours over to Springfield on the other side of Massachusetts, Kuai knew that the trip would be worth it, giving his big Hawaiian boy a day that he wouldn't soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw his feet over the side of the bed and slowly walked over to the door, opening it partway. Makani's face beamed down at him from the other side, wide awake, full of excitement. The boy had already gotten dressed in a black sleeveless shirt, khaki cargo shorts, and black sneakers, all ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makani,\" Kuai rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, \"relax. We're gonna have plenty of time to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" the boy protested, \"the website says the gates open at eight! That's only 45 minutes from now, and it'll take us twice as long as that to get there! And it's the first weekend of the fair too, so it's gonna be crowded like heck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kuai looked past the eight-foot-tall boy and noticed that the light in the upstairs office was still on, and he could make out the faint glow of the computer monitor from inside. He realized that Makani had probably been up for a while already, finding out as much about the fair as he could. \"Well, you're technically right about the time for the gates,\" the teacher finally nodded, \"but the buildings, rides, and exhibits don't open until ten o'clock or later. We can have a nice breakfast here, climb into the car a little before eight, and pull up to the fairgrounds just as everything starts to open. Don't worry; we'll have plenty of time to see anything you want to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" the boy sighed but reluctantly agreed, turning around heading back to the office to get on the computer again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai turned around, seeing Sean, who had sat up in bed, stretch and yawn. \"Gee,\" Sean said after a second, \"I wonder where that kid gets all that excess energy. You'd think he'd need to conserve it all in order to fuel that big body of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I guess the pen--\" Kuai stopped himself mid-word, realizing that in the few weeks or so since he had received the pendant in the mail, he hadn't mentioned a word of it to Sean. For a moment, he considered telling Sean all about it right now, but Kuai rejected that idea, deciding it would take way too long to explain, and that they needed to head out on the road soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, babe?\" Sean asked at Kuai, a curious but still-tired look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Kuai had a mini-panic attack as he thought about what he could say instead of talking about the pendant. \"I said I guess he has pent-up energy inside of him that he just has to get out somehow. You know how it is with kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Sean said as he got up and walked over to the bathroom inside their room. \"That's more your department, Mr. Tao.\" He grinned as he stepped out of view, and Kuai felt his insides flutter when Sean called him that. He breathed a sigh of relief, thankful that Sean wasn't too suspicious of anything that had happened with him or Makani. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning went fairly smoothly, Kuai heading downstairs to make some scrambled eggs for the other two. After they finished, Sean headed upstairs for some last minute preparations. Makani started to clear off the table and brought the plates to the sink, while Kuai cleaned the pan and mixing bowl, standing next to him. \"Hey, Kuai?\" Makani asked while he rinsed the dishes, \"when do you think you'll be able to grow me to twelve feet again like we were talking about last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai repressed a growing laugh. Up for less than an hour, and already he wants to grow again, he thought. \"Well,\" he said as he turned to Makani, leaning against the sink, \"you'll probably want me to wait until we get to Springfield. I don't think my Mazda would be able to fit a twelve-foot-tall boy, even with you having the entire backseat to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Makani nodded. \"Okay, we'll wait until we get there. But can you do it right as soon as I step out of the car. Please, Kuai?\" Makani looked up at him with the biggest eyes Kuai had ever seen on a boy his age. He couldn't say no to that face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Kuai ruffled up Makani's long dark-brown hair, \"the instant you set foot in the parking lot, you'll be twelve feet again. Give or take a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani pumped his fist. \"Yeah! Now I'm REALLY excited!\" He started to jump up and down a little as he brought the plates to the dishwasher and set them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai loved the boy's enthusiasm, but he realized he would have to temper it a bit if they were going to keep the secret of the pendant to themselves. Not only would there be all the thousands of people at the fair to think of, but Sean was going to be with them all day too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Makani, listen.\" Kuai made sure Makani was looking at him before he continued. \"Remember that right now you are the only person besides myself who knows about the pendant and what it could do. Not even Sean knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you haven't told him anything about it yet?\" Makani seemed a little surprised to find out this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shook his head, a little embarrassed. \"Nope. I'm not so sure what he'd say or do if he were to find out. I'll tell him eventually, I'm sure, but for now I'd like for him or anyone else to remain unaware of the pendant's existence. For now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani thought about this for a second before agreeing. \"Okay, that's no big deal. You said that one of the switches there makes everyone else think that I've always been whatever size I am at the time, right? So you could grow me to be twelve feet tall, or a hundred feet tall, or even five hundred, and everyone would think I've always been that huge.\" Makani looked up for a second, allowing himself to get lost a little in that fantasy. \"Imagine! Everyone thinking that I grew up my entire childhood being the size of a skyscraper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai chuckled. By the time this is all over, who knows what could happen, he thought to himself. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nTen minutes later, they were on the road, heading up I-93 towards downtown Boston, then merging onto I-90 west towards Springfield. As Kuai drove with Sean fiddling with his phone in the passenger seat next to him, he kept glancing back to Makani, who was sprawled across the back seat, listening to his iPod and reading a book for school at the same time. He's such an interesting kid, Kuai thought, incredibly mature for his age, but at the same time still hanging onto a childish sense of fantasy and delight. I guess that's why I was drawn to him in the first place; he's almost exactly like me in those ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncountering no traffic on the drive, they actually arrived at the fairgrounds at 9:38, a few minutes earlier than Kuai had anticipated. Keeping his word from earlier, as soon as Makani opened the door and jumped out of the backseat of the car, Kuai imagined him growing four feet taller, and the boy's body followed suit. A huge grin formed across Makani's mouth as he felt his body tingling and stretching higher above Kuai, Sean, and everyone else, but he remained silent, not wanting to alert anyone to what was happening and possibly get Kuai in trouble with them. Finally, he stopped growing when he reached twelve feet tall. The top of Sean's head was not quite level with Makani's belt, and Kuai didn't come up much past the boy's belly button. The youngster walked in between the two adults, getting lots of stares from other fairgoers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got in line at the admission gates, Kuai noticed that the price for a child twelve or under was five bucks less than the price for an adult ticket. At first, he thought about asking Makani if he could temporarily shrink him down under six feet tall so the ticket seller would believe he was twelve years old, but as he was just about to open his mouth, he looked up at Makani's face and realized how much more enthusiastic the boy had gotten just within the past few minutes since his increase to twelve feet tall. Kuai figured it was worth the extra five bucks he'd have to pay just to keep that momentum going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up next to the window, Kuai pulled out his wallet. \"Three adult tickets, please,\" he said to the elderly lady manning the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to add on tickets to see Reba McEntire tonight in concert at the Comcast Arena Stage?\" the lady asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reba McEntire?\" Makani scrunched up his nose. \"Who's she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a country music star,\" Kuai informed him. \"I don't actually know any of her songs, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Country?!\" Makani pinched his nose shut in playful disgust. \"Eeeww, no thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the fair tickets would be fine, then,\" Kuai replied to the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he handed the money over, Sean's eyes suddenly lit up, and he grabbed Kuai's arm in dramatic fashion. \"But wait, guys! What if it's actually Kenan Thompson in a wig?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, with a huge goofy grin on his face, as if he was expecting the other two guys to start laughing. When they didn't, he said, \"C'mon, guys, haven't you seen that SNL Short?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Kuai shook his head, taking the tickets and fair map the lady had handed him. \"No, Sean, I doubt that we have. I don't get to catch up on as much television as you do. Being a teacher doesn't leave me with a lot of free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then, forget it.\" Sean crossed his arms and turned away, pouting slightly. Kuai ignored him for a minute, knowing that he would get over it by the time the guys were inside the fair gates, which he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Makani literally bounced with excitement, seeing all the bright signs and lights flashing. He breathed deeply, taking in the mixture of various aromas and smells (some  pleasing, some not-so-pleasing). Kuai could notice the boy's mouth starting to water, and he checked his wallet again, making sure that he had enough cash to pay for any food that the massive Hawaiian boy and his twice-as-big stomach would require.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the midway!\" Makani pointed towards the roller coaster and ferris wheel that rose above the other buildings near the back of the fairgrounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, he quickly started heading in that direction, leaving Kuai and Sean standing in place, looking down and examining the map. When Kuai looked up and noticed Makani's head and upper body rising above the rest of the crowd some two hundred feet ahead of them, he panicked slightly and yelled out, \"HEY! Makani!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy didn't seem to hear him, so he and Sean sprinted to catch up with him, finally grabbing the edge of his shirt and stopping him, causing Makani to turn around. \"What's the matter?\" he asked, with a concerned and apprehensive look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Kuai huffed, trying to catch his breath from sprinting. \"It's just that...\" He wheezed again, realizing that Makani could really cover some distance quickly at this size, with those longer legs of his. \"...The midway isn't open for another hour or so. Besides, the rides and games there are always more fun to do in the late afternoon and evening. Think of it as an end-cap, a great way to finish the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... okay!\" After a few moments of contemplation, Makani seemed to understand the reasoning. \"Well then, where should we head to first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were standing almost in the exact middle of the fairgrounds, so they looked around, turning in all directions and trying to see what appeared as if it would be the most interesting thing to do. Finally, they decided on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's walk around the Avenue of the States\" Kuai suggested, as they turned towards the area where many historic buildings from the New England states were on display. Already, Makani had a hard time getting through the doors of the buildings, since he was so big and tall. Kuai had to adjust his height and shrink him down so he could walk through the door before growing him back again, but the boy didn't mind having to go through these constant little growth and shrinking spurts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were wandering around outside again, Kuai heard a familiar voice call out his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuai? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and recognized Stan, an old friend from school, whom he hadn't seen for years until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stanley Stevens? Oh my goodness! How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuai? What's going on, my friend? Are you still teaching? How do you like my little fair, huh?\" the short, chubby man in the three piece suit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm teaching math at the academy. This here is Makani, one of my students!\" Kuai said, as he allowed Makani and Stan to shake hands.  \u201cOh, I love it here! So, are you running this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! What a big boy! Almost like what I'm looking for!\" Stan said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m in charge here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Kuai asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was hoping to find a giant dude or a muscle man, just to have as an attraction for the weekend. My regular muscle guy is doing a show in Chicago so I need a substitute.\" Stan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see Makani over here? He's pretty big, right? I can actually make him grow even bigger than he is now!\" Kuai whispered in his ear. \"I got a pendant which can change the boy's size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Kuai can make me REALLY BIG!\u201d Makani added. \u201cMuch bigger than this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I was kinda hoping for a giant... Like a really BIG guy.... One who could hold people in the palm of his hand. Man, could you make him that big?\" Stan asked him. \u201cI know that is asking a bit much\u2026 I must be asking the impossible, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Me? A giant? Oh yeah!\" Makani said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai could tell where this was going. Makani was smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big do you want him to be and where do you want him to be at?\" Kuai asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take you to a big grassy field near the back of the park. All he has to do is sit there and let people sit on his hand and climb up his legs. Make him like fifty feet tall! Is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over to a large grassy area which was covered by a huge oak tree. Makani then stood near the center of the area and waited as Kuai adjusted the settings on the pendant so that everyone could see the growth and so that Makani's clothes would grow with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThem, the twelve foot tall boy started getting bigger and bigger, experiencing the most intense growth spurt he has ever had. With a huge grin on his face, others gathered around as the boy's growing legs propelled him higher and higher. His torso grew bigger, wider and taller while his arms became longer. His feet grew as well, and his muscles exploded with outrageous growth all at once. Kuai realized that he was now making Makani into the biggest and strongest human being on earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakani just grinned as the growth stopped. Looking down, people just seemed like action figures to him. He was a true giant now, towering over buildings before him. As he sat down, leaning with his back against the oak tree, a crowd already began to form. People wanted to meet the giant boy and sit on the palm of his hand and enjoy the view from his shoulders. What a spectacular sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKuai! You crazy dog! How did you do that?\u201d Stanley cheered. \u201cLook at that kid! That was just amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long does he need to stay there?\u201d Kuai asked him then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just for two hours. I figured that would be long enough for this afternoon. But, could you bring him back here by tomorrow?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! We\u2019re here for the whole weekend!\u201d Kuai grinned. \u201cPlus, Makani is a great kid. He\u2019s very mature, which is why he makes a great giant! The boy is just made to be big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai and Stanley looked on as Makani lowered his hand to the ground and allowed people to step on the palm of his hand. Then he would raise his hand to his other shoulder, so that they could climb on to his big, broad shoulder and sit on them for a few minutes. Then, he would lower them to his giant thighs, where they would walk around and explore his enormous legs, until they could reach a small staircase and get back to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai quickly used his cell phone to take a picture of the titanic Hawaiian boy who was happily entertaining the people like they were small action figures. Then, he placed a call to his friend Nick in California, just after he emailed that photo to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness, Kuai! You made that boy gigantic!\u201d Nick exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is the star attraction at the fair right now, Nick! The crowd loves him!\u201d Kuai explained. \u201cNot only that, I noticed something while I was growing him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow easy it was! I mean, I expected that I would have needed to concentrate harder on making the boy grow since I was planning on making him so big, but it was just so incredibly easy! I mean\u2026 I just pictured him becoming a giant and BAM! The kid just exploded in size and muscle! His body just shot UP like you wouldn\u2019t believe! It\u2019s like, every time I make him grow, it seems to be getting a LOT easier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve already changed him a few times, is that correct?\u201d Nick asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, about a dozen times already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the pendant pretty much has all of Makani\u2019s physical properties saved by now. Furthermore, the kid\u2019s body has pretty much adjusted to growing and shrinking thanks to the pendant. I mean, you can shrink or grow just about any part of the kid\u2019s body with your eyes closed by now! You can increase his muscles or make his legs grow longer\u2026 You can change him in any way you want to, by now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to hurt him, will it?\u201d Kuai asked, feeling a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t even think Makani even feels the changes anymore. He doesn\u2019t even notice it! You can grow him another set of biceps if you wanted, or a second set of legs! Just remember, if you use the pendant a lot, you might drain the battery sooner and it will take a few hours for the pendant to charge!\u201d Nick warned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Thanks Nick!\u201d Kuai said, before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai and Sean then wandered around the fair, occasionally checking up on the giant Hawaiian boy, who was having more than enough fun on his own by letting people sit on his hands on shoulders and on his legs while he just looked down at the crowd below\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two rapid beeps sounded from the intercom. \u201cMister Tao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai immediately recognized the older woman\u2019s voice. \u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d he called out, looking in the direction of the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse this interruption,\u201d the secretary\u2019s voice crackled, \u201cCould you please report to Dr. Yates\u2019 office as soon as possible.

I will inform him that you are on your way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in silence once more, Kuai\u2019s mind began to rush. Teachers dislike getting unexpectedly called to the principal\u2019s office almost as much as students do, if not more-so. At least he didn't have to travel to the main administrative building in the center of campus to see the headmaster, who oversaw the entire academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai rarely got in trouble. On some occasions, Dr. Yates asked him to tone down his intensively competitive nature while coaching. However, since the Wellington Academy\u2019s Crimson Knights were usually victorious even over the much larger public schools, Kuai had earned some latitude to be more\u2014 expressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the image of Tyler up against the lockers suddenly flashed into Kuai's mind. \u201cThis couldn\u2019t have something to do with the fight earlier, could it? What if the principal was suspicious about my involvement in the situation? There are cameras all over campus. I can\u2019t just lie and say, \u2018I wasn\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai calmed his nerves, headed out the door, and locked up his classroom. The hall seemed unusually quiet and empty. A long corridor with pristine, freshly painted white walls stretched down for quite a distance. A pair of large staircases at either end of the hall were overlooked by two, large, double pained windows. All of the lockers neatly lined the wide corridor with their pristine shape and crimson tint. That is, except for two lockers near the end of the hall closest to Kuai\u2019s classroom. Kuai ran his hand along the wrinkled contour of the metal. Every curve and twist of the metal reminded him of the incident from fourth period. It took both of the top lockers to cradle Tyler\u2019s enormous back, barely holding him up against his would-be attackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai gulped again, his mind still unnerved by this sudden summons. He managed to keep his head high only to be forced to duck it down again a moment later. None of the doorways were tall enough to fit Kuai when he stood upright. And only double doors or larger could fit Kuai squarely through their opening Kuai followed the winding staircase, bathed in sunlight and pausing on the first landing. Campus at midday was a breathtaking sight. The enormous panes of glass could clearly see the entire northeast side of campus.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRays of light scattered through the trees over the lush campus. Just beyond a shaded grove, neatly trimmed plants and polished wooden benches stood the single story elementary building; the only single story building on the Wellington\u2019s entire campus. Kuai could even hear the faint chirp of birds over the quiet hum of central air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved being outside. Perhaps that\u2019s why Kuai always loved sports so much, that and the thirst to win at a physical contest. Kuai finished his descent to the first floor, bound for Dr. Yates\u2019 office. He barely reached the lobby\u2019s entrance, guarded by a pair of double oak doors, when he heard raised voices coming from the science hall beyond. Kuai ducked toward Dr. Yates\u2019 office, peeking through one of the many windows. The secretary who buzzed him earlier hadn\u2019t seen him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai rounded past the office, leaving the well-furnished, although stale, lobby to investigate. Halfway down the science hall, just off the other side of the lobby, stood a furious teacher and his student. Kuai could now make out more clearly what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014and what do you think gives you the right to interrupt my class, pencil neck! On the first day of school no less!\u201d an older man bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut sir\u2014\u201c a younger voice defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, young man! What part of 'remain silent' do you and these other seventh-grade morons not seem to understand?! It\u2019s a wonder I made it through last year\u2019s bunch; now you're aiming to top them on the first day of classes. Leave it to a pencil neck like you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onslaught continued. Kuai didn\u2019t have to listen to understand what was going on. He stood at the end of the hall as discretely as a 6\u20199\u201d muscle bound Asian could, partially shrouded by a pair of lockers. He peeked over the top of the metal easily and recognized the teacher immediately; a particularly disgruntled middle-aged teacher that Kuai felt should have left the profession long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more difficult for Kuai to get a good look at the kid. He had short brown hair and kept adjusting what appeared to be a large pair of glasses hanging off his nose. Then he noticed something odd. \u201cThis kid is as tall as his teacher. He could look him right in the eye if he wanted too. Must be at least six feet tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally clicked. \u201cWait a second,\u201d Kuai thought, \u201cHow many seventh graders are that big? It\u2019s Kevin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the mousy child from Kuai\u2019s first period class was the one being relentlessly chewed out by his science teacher. Kuai didn\u2019t fully understand why he was so upset, but he didn\u2019t really care. He accepted the need to be heavy-handed sometimes; he was a coach, after all. But this guy kept personally attacking Kevin, just because he could. Kuai felt his heart begin to race. His eyes narrowed; his hand tightly gripped the pendant. He had had enough! \u201cYell at this\u2014 asshole.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin\u2019s body swelled as the teacher continued to yell. All of his muscles burst to life with growing size and thickening strength. His swimmer\u2019s build reshaped into that of a rock-solid middleweight wrestler. Kevin\u2019s chest puffed out, his back widened and his legs bulged even larger under clothes that were being magically forced to keep up with his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai also inched Kevin up about three inches more, making him half a head taller than his teacher. Kuai watched the angered science teacher lose his nerve as Kevin grew more impressive; 6\u20193\u201d, 12 years old and ripped with strength. Kevin\u2019s body now looked even more impressive than Makani\u2019s, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin\u2019s growth finally slowed. He kept his head tilted down, but now his enormous green eyes were right in line with his teacher\u2019s face. Kuai could hear the potbellied teacher clear his throat. \u201cAnd you stay out here until you can control yourself in class. Understand?\u201d the teacher\u2019s voice forcefully shook Like an angry dog with no teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2014sir.\u201d Kevin grumbled coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classroom door opened and shut quickly, leaving Kevin all alone. He threw his broadened back against a pair of lockers and sank to the ground. \u201cAbout time that old coot left!\u201d Kuai thought to himself, his body temperature slowly returning to normal. \u201cBut should I go over there and talk with Kevin, or get to the office? After all, Dr. Yates isn\u2019t known for his patience\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai couldn't leave Kevin there. He may be huge, but he was still a kid. And any person would be feeling awful after being yelled at like that. Kuai made his way to Kevin, who had tucked his head in between his thick, tan arms and huge legs which were straddled apart. Kuai heard soft muffled sounds coming from the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there a moment, mere feet away from Kevin, unsure of what to say. Kuai\u2019s eyes wandered, getting a chance to soak in all of his changes up close and personal. Kevin\u2019s smooth skin rippled at every little flex of his body. His clothes had grown with him, but they still pulled around the largest bulges. Finally Kuai found the words and spoke. \u201cRough day, Kevin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge boy shot his head straight up in the air, momentarily forgetting the tears and sweat that still drenched his face. \u201cMr. Tao!\u201d His eyes shot around nervously; he quickly motioned to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Kevin. You can remain seated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looked upon Kuai with nervousness and appreciation. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t look at me, Mr. Tao! My face\u2014it must be\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin brought his mighty arm up to wipe and cover his face. His other hand pulled his legs close, curling him into more of a ball. Kuai slowly knelt next to Kevin, looking through his muscles, speaking directly into the boy\u2019s huge green eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re face is fine Kevin. I would be upset too if something like that happened to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin dropped his arm, the pain in his eyes magnified. He sniffled. \u201cYou heard all of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassment filled his pained face, but Kevin didn\u2019t look away. Kuai remained as soft and caring as he knew how, only nodding his head once in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin sniffled in pain once more, quickly hiding his head underneath his arms again. It was amazing his heavy glasses didn\u2019t fly off his nose. \u201cOh great! Just\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin\u2019s head whipped around furiously before burrowing back into his arms. The rest of Kevin\u2019s muffled words were lost between his arms and legs, choked by another painful sob. It seemed he wanted desperately to hide, but had nowhere to go. Kuai\u2019s voice darkened. \u201cYou were being treated unacceptably, no matter what happened.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin threw his head back up to Kuai\u2019s. \u201cReally? I mean, I\u2026 I was thrown out of class. Y-you saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt depends on what happened. But no matter what it was, he should never have demeaned you with malicious name-calling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin huffed, wiping his face clean with his arm. \u201cThose are some of the nicer names I have ever been called. Being so tall and once in my life being so thin\u2014 people think of some pretty cruel things to call you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai felt his heart skip a beat. \u201cYou\u2014were thin?\u201d Had Kevin somehow become aware of Kuai's changes?\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin bobbed his head, a hint of a smile glistened. \u201cI know. Hard to believe right?\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin bit his lip and his eyes fluttered about. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Kevin tried to speak, but the words would get tangled up in his tongue. Nervous as ever, Kevin fought through it to tell Kuai part of his story. \u201cThere was a time wh-when I was just lanky and tall. I was\u2026 am, the outsider.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin took deep breaths, expanding his chest into his knees. Speaking so candidly was obviously difficult and Kuai was patient as ever as he watched Kevin piece together his thoughts. Finally, the nervous hulk continued. \u201cPeople want nothing to do with me. No matter what. I put on weight. I got b-bigger. But they never changed. It was always the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer Kevin spoke, the easier it became for the words to form. The only difficulty now was how emotional these words made Kevin feel. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t hissing about my glasses, then it\u2019s my height. If it\u2019s not my height, then it\u2019s my voice. One thing after another on constant repeat, day in and day out for all my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears returned to his cheeks, but his eyes never blinked. They were glued to Kuai in a way he couldn\u2019t do minutes before. Kevin gulped, exhaling uneven breaths. \u201cOnce an outsider, always an outsider.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai sighed, relieved to hear Kevin believed he had come by his size naturally, but still burdened by a different feeling. This was the third time a student had recounted a painful past to him, and it hurt. Each story Kuai heard hurt him more and more to listen to. A whole lifetime of pain hid behind their youthful features and their young years, but that didn\u2019t make them suffer any less. Kuai now knew why he had been drawn to Kevin so many hours earlier. Tyler, Makani and Kevin were all outcasts. Each bore their own secret weight, unable to shrug it off or to shoulder it anymore. Kuai knew this pain. Their pain was his pain too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Kevin\u2014\u201c Kuai breathed in, \u201cThose people may think whatever they like. A long time ago, people thought and said some fairly mean things about me as well, but\u2014\u201c he gulped, \u201cI pressed on. I found people who cared for me because of who I was, not because of who they wanted me to be. From then on, I have cherished only having to be myself and being loved by the few people I care about for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn time, I know you will find people just like that, Kevin. There are people out there who will love and care for you exactly the way you are. And until you find them all, I want you to know that I will always be in your corner, looking out for you. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai spoke with such force and sincerity, causing Kevin\u2019s eyes to widen even further than Kuai thought possible. His jaw slackened and he nodded his head with long slow stokes. Kaui could see all of his muscles tense up and bulge. Kevin had a deep and profound reaction to Kuai\u2019s sincerity. Even more than either knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai stood, the boy's emerald eyes following him through the coke-bottle lenses. He extended his hand and slowly helped Kevin up to his feet. Kevin\u2019s strength had certainly grown, and hopefully some of that strength would soon bloom on the inside now, rather than just the outside. Perhaps in time, his body could reflect the strength within. Yet another boy Kuai was sure he wanted to help.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. He needed to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin wiped his face one final time, although it was still flushed, especially around the cheeks. \u201cAre you ready to get back in there Kevin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin gave Kuai the same doe-eyed look from this morning and floated back inside. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said as he closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai hunched down and looked through the tall rectangular window on the door. He saw the middle aged teacher lecturing gruffly as ever. His eyes caught sight of Kevin once more, forcing him to stumble before continuing. Kuai let out a sly grin. \u201cAnd if I ever catch you yelling at one of MY kids again\u2014\u201c he gripped the pendant, \u201cI will find out just what this thing can do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai stood straight back up and hurried down the hall. Dr. Yates was still waiting. \u201cHow long does it take for me to get from my classroom to the first floor, anyway?\u201d Kuai thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had to walk to the headmaster\u2019s office in the central building.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai hurried through the lobby and took a breath, ready to face whatever Dr. Yates needed to see him for.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai walked up to the desk where the secretary sat, the older grey-haired woman glancing back and forth between a large stack of papers and the computer monitor in front of her, her hands never deviating from the keyboard. He stood at her desk, waiting for a greeting that never came. \"It's not like she can't <i>see</i> me,\" Kuai thought to himself, beginning to tap his foot. Finally he cleared his throat, saying,  \"Sorry I'm late, Barbara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Tao,\" a slightly smug smile formed on the secretary's lips without her eyes ever leaving her work. \"What's your excuse this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shook his head. \"No excuse. I just got distracted along the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a slight \"tsk\"-ing sound come from her lips, \"Well,\" she said, \"lucky for you Keith Larson stopped by and Dr. Yates is still chatting with him. You can go ahead and head on in, though; he told me he wanted to see you as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded and stepped down a small hallway towards the ornate wooden door of the principal's office. Knowing that Keith Larson waited for him inside didn't exactly help his apprehension. The eighth-grader was the perfect example of the kind of student at Wellington that Kuai despised: rich, stuck-up, and extremely condescending, even to his teachers. He had been elected president of the middle school student council both in 7th and 8th grades (probably having bought the election, Kuai figured), and always had his nose in every corner of the school's business. It didn't help matters that Keith's father sat on the board of directors for the school and that his family was instrumental in the school's founding, even having the elementary school building named after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stopped in front of the half-open door, he could hear Keith's muffled voice in some sort of discussion with the principal. Kuai started thinking of the last time he had come to this office, when he had gotten in a bit of trouble at the end of last year. He had taught Keith in seventh grade Honors Pre-Algebra, and had given the boy the grade that his shoddy homework and test scores deserved and added up to: a C minus. That's when the boy's father began raining down on him the holy hellfire that only a multimillionaire could deliver, making threatening calls and emails to the teacher (which went unanswered), eventually barging into the school building and confronting Kuai face-to-face. After Kuai didn't budge, Mr. Larson tried to go over his head to the principal. A bitter tug-of-war ensued between Kuai and Dr. Yates about raising the boy's score, but he eventually got Dr. Yates to agree with him, and the C minus remained, though the battle had caused the relationship between the teacher and the principal to become strained. He only hoped that this year could start off on a better note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing himself for whatever was about to happen, he lightly rapped on the door. \"Come in,\" he heard Dr. Yates' booming voice call from inside. He stepped through the door and into the office. The decoration in Dr. Yates' office was impressive, with darkly-painted walls, golden trim and a vaulted ceiling. Large oak bookshelves lined the room, filled with volumes on subjects ranging from education principles and child psychology to more intense fare like military history. In the center of one side of the office was Dr. Yates' framed diplomas from both West Point and Columbia University; on the opposite was a decades-old portrait of the principal wearing his Army dress uniform, along with several framed medals and commendations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai knew (along with every other teacher) Dr. Yates' storied history as an officer in the Army, and the decision after retiring from the military to obtain a Ph.D. in Education Leadership and enter the world of school administration. He had started as middle school principal at Wellington the year before Kuai joined the faculty, and had developed a reputation amongst teachers and students alike as a tough but fair leader who liked to give inspiring speeches that had a tendency to drag on just a bit too long, and who would rarely call students or teachers by their first names and expected them to respond likewise. Kuai couldn't help but to admire and respect the man for all that he had accomplished in his life, but the two continued to find themselves on the opposite sides of many issues that arose, butting heads occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Tao,\" Dr. Yates said, standing as the teacher entered, \"thank you for coming down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded at the principal, looking at him eye-to-eye, the only person in the school who he didn't have to tilt his head far down to do that (well, except for Tyler now, of course).  Even though the broad-shouldered African-American man stood slightly shorter than Kuai at six foot six, he carried himself with a presence that could be both impressive and intimidating, even to the larger Asian teacher. Dr. Yates' face had a energy to its expressions that hid his true age (which Kuai didn't know exactly but guessed had to be over sixty). His smooth, mostly wrinkle-free skin and clean-shaven head helped contribute to that effect, the only signs of advancement being slight streaks of grey in his otherwise black, impeccably-trimmed mustache, and the thin-framed reading glasses that stuck out slightly in his jacket pocket. Kuai had never seen the principal in anything other than a sharply-pressed suit, even when he was attending the basketball games Kuai coached. The one he now wore looked particularly striking, a jet-black suit with dark purple pinstripes, matched with a diagonally-striped black and violet tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to suppress a slight sense of nervousness that had set in, Kuai swallowed as silently as he could. \"You wanted to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sit down, please,\" Dr. Yates motioned to one of the chairs across from his desk, the only empty one there, since Keith was sitting in the other. \"I just was finishing up with Mr. Larson, who had come by to make sure the school had adequately budgeted enough funds for the student council's planned activities this semester. I assured him that we most certainly have.\" Kuai recognized the concealed glimmer of contempt in the principal's eyes, knowing that Dr. Yates disliked dealing with the boy and his pesky father as much as the rest of the faculty did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the student, Kuai noticed that Keith seemed to have totally ignored the teacher's entrance into the room. \"After what I went through with him last year, I wouldn't expect any less from him,\" Kuai thought. The fair-skinned, red-haired boy was dressed in the optional school blazer with the Wellington Academy logo on its left breast pocket (as he always was). Even now, sitting across from Dr. Yates, he had an air of superiority about him that repelled Kuai nearly immediately. The teacher thought about using the pendant right here and now to cut this boy down to size (literally), but he restrained himself, realizing that may have something to do with why he got called to the office in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith rose to his feet as Kuai sat down, sticking out his hand to shake Dr. Yates'. \"Well, I'm certainly glad we have all that straightened out,\" he said as he forced a very fake-looking smile. \"I wouldn't want the students of Wellington Academy to not be receiving their fair share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As would I,\" Dr. Yates returned, stone-faced. \"Good day, Mr. Larson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stepped behind Kuai's chair, still ignoring the teacher's presence, and left the room. Dr. Yates walked over to the door and shut it completely behind him, sighing when it had closed. \"Thank God that's over with,\" he thought. \"Dealing with that boy and his damn father is harder than kissing ass to a four-star general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be glad you only have to deal with him every week or two,\" Kuai said, grinning slightly. \"I had him in class <i>every day</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me,\" Dr. Yates replied as he returned to the plush leather chair behind his large mahogany desk. \"but you didn't have to <i>also</i> deal with appeasing a father who could make a motion at any time to have you removed from leadership. I gotta say, sometimes the blood in this school can run too blue for my tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded in agreement. After a few seconds of silence, he breathed deeply. Might as well get it over with, he thought. \"So, Dr. Yates, what did you call me down to your office for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai's fears were confirmed when Dr. Yates' eyebrows furrowed slightly, and the principal crossed his arms on the desk and leaned forward. \"Look, Mr. Tao,\" he started, \"you know as well as I do that the thing I dislike most, more than pain-in-the-ass parents, more than firing underperforming teachers, more than any of the other stresses my role in administration throws at me, is violence in my school halls. Not only does it create extra paperwork that someone has to end up doing, not only does it potentially threaten to raise our insurance premiums...\" He paused, closing his eyes and breathing in deeply, seemingly accessing some deep-seated emotion or personal history. He then looked straight back at Kuai, continuing \"...but, more importantly, it can lead to things that are far far worse for the very kids that we are here to protect and educate. Believe me, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai felt his cheeks begin to grow a little flush and he slumped slightly in his chair. \"I understand completely, sir. And I agree.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Yates picked up a coffee mug off of his desk and took a sip before continuing. \"I'm glad you do agree with me, Mr. Tao. But it troubles me when a fight breaks out in the school halls, and I hear that a teacher is witness to the event, but doesn't do anything to stop it. I understand that's what happened today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--\" Kuai stopped himself, realizing that nothing he could say here would make him look any better in the principal's eyes. Dr. Yates wouldn't accept the excuse of being trapped by the crowds of students, as he would expect a teacher of Kuai's size and strength of presence to have been able to quickly yell and clear a path straight to the boys. And Kuai couldn't exactly say that he actually <i>did</i> help resolve the situation by using the pendant to transform the bullies from oversized goons to shrimpy little punks, could he? Of course not.  Rubbing his eyes gently, Kuai attempted to clear his mind, at the same time trying to come up with the best answer he could give. \"Yes, sir,\" he said as he looked back up at Dr. Yates, \"you're right. The halls were crowded, and I was hoping things wouldn't get as bad as they ended up getting, but I should've stepped in sooner. I apologize for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in silent acceptance, Dr. Yates rose to his feet, turning around and pacing while looking at his back wall, continuing to talk. \"Now, I don't care about the damage to school property. We have plenty in the budget this year to be able to replace a locker or two. And from the other teachers and students that I've interviewed, I understand that there were no serious injuries to any of the involved parties.\" He turned back to face Kuai, coming around to the other side of the desk and leaning against it slightly. \"There are a few things I'd like to go over with you, though, just to make sure we're on the same page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Kuai leaned back in his chair a little and tried to look as professional as possible. \"I'm open for any advice you have for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding his glasses from his jacket pocket and putting them on, Dr. Yates then pulled a manilla file folder from a stack on his desk, reading it before continuing. \"First, one of the students who was involved in the fight, Tyler Phillips.\" He looked back at Kuai, his eyes peering over the tops of the glasses. \"He was just coming from your third period math class. Is that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Yates flipped another page on his list. \"He's an extraordinarily tall boy, if I recall from last year. Nearly as tall as you, correct? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping slightly, Kuai hoped Dr. Yates wouldn't dwell on this subject too much and start to unravel the logic of the reality Kuai and the pendant had constructed. \"More or less,\" he finally answered, attempting to be as neutral as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal didn't seem to be confused about this, merely accepting it as another fact about the boy. He chuckled slightly, the hints of a smile forming at the corners of his lips. \"I can't imagine why such short, slender boys would start to harass someone that size. Do you have any idea what instigated the fight, Mr. Tao?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kuai thought back to the scene in the hallway for a moment, \"I believe Tyler may have accidentally bumped into one of the other boys in passing, and that boy took offense to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Dr. Yates nodded. He remained silent for a moment. \"Bullies are bullies; they'll find any excuse they can to pick on someone, though usually they aim for smaller targets. I'm more concerned about Mr. Phillips, though. Did you notice anything unusual about him during class? Or did he say anything to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai did his best to appear calm as he recalled vividly the conversations he had with Tyler in his room after class as well as in the hallway after the fight. He couldn't tell Dr. Yates about all that, could he? Even Tyler's recent ADHD diagnosis wasn't yet known by anyone at the school besides him, including (Kuai presumed) the administration. It might not be the most shocking thing in the world, but it was something Tyler had told him in trust. Unless Tyler was in physical or emotional danger,  Kuai could not imagine ever violating that trust, even with his boss. Taking a deep breath, he shook his head. \"We chatted a bit about what we were going to be covering this year in class, but nothing like that came up.\" One thing popped into Kuai's mind, something that he had no trouble sharing (or bragging about). \"Oh! He did tell me he was a UCLA fan. He seemed pretty thrilled when he saw my jersey and found out I played for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Yates began to smile a little more broadly. \"You know,\" he said, \"I'm sure you have a lot you could teach Mr. Phillips, about  math as well as about living in a world that was designed for those a foot shorter than you. It sounds like he's already found something to connect with you on in his love for the Bruins; I'd recommend you seize that opportunity and try to establish more things in common in order to establish a deeper bond. Try to identify with him on a more personal level; see if you can try to understand him and get him to understand you. I think if you do that, he'll open up to you, and we might be able to avoid situations like this in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you,\" Kuai thought as he grinned. \"That's a good idea, sir,\" he said aloud. \"I'll get on that immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, sounds like we have a battle plan.\" Dr. Yates said as he brought his hand up to shake. Kuai rose to his feet. As he clasped Dr. Yates' hand, however, the principal's expression became serious once again. \"And, Mr. Tao, if something like this were to happen again, and you were found to be standing idly by a second time, trust me when I say that our conversation would be much different than the one we're having today. Do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let go of Kuai's hand as a slight sense of uncomfortableness began to set in for the teacher. \"Y-yes, Dr. Yates, I understand. I can promise that it won't happen again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Tao.\" Dr. Yates said. \"That will be all.\" Sitting back down at his desk, Dr. Yates picked up another file and began reading it in silence. Kuai turned around and left the office, his heartbeat seemingly accelerated, wondering inside if he would be able to keep the promise he had just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped back into the lobby, he noticed that Keith Larson was still there, chatting with Barbara, the secretary, who looked desperate for someone to rescue her. Kuai walked up to the two, hoping his arrival would cause the boy to move along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, though, Keith just looked up at the teacher, a somewhat sour expression on his face. It seemed to Kuai that the boy's proper aristocratic upbringing was the only thing keeping him from lunging at the teacher and trying to choke him, despite the substantial height difference between them. Instead, though, Keith just tilted his head to the side, making eye contact with Kuai for the first time today. \"Mr. Tao,\" he said, grimacing as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith,\" Kuai replied, responding in just a slightly more  professional manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Keith turned back to the secretary, \"I'll just be on my way, Barbara. Please make sure that message gets to my father before the end of the school day.\" He turned and walked out of the office, Kuai watching him as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he think I am,\" Barbara scoffed, \"his message service? That boy is just the kind of thing that's wrong with this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai nodded in agreement, stepping out of the hallway and watching the boy head to the stairs. \"I shouldn't do anything drastic,\" he thought to himself as he casually pulled out the pendant, \"but that's no reason for me not to have a little fun.\" As Keith started to round the corner, Kuai imagined him quickly growing by two-and-a-half feet, making him about three inches taller than the door he was passing through. Keith's body immediately shot upwards, growing substantially bigger in a flash, until his head banged against the doorframe with a loud CLANG. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww,\" he heard Keith say as the boy rubbed his head. \"Why can't these blasted doors be any taller?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to himself, Kuai quickly imagined Keith back down to normal height and headed the opposite direction, towards the staircase leading up to his classroom. Looking at the clock in the hall, Kuai noticed that the final bell was just about to ring. Hurrying back to his room to avoid the sudden pouring of students into the halls, Kuai had a sneaking suspicion that he still had a little more work to do with the pendant before he could go home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai sat at his desk, shuffling through his papers, makings sure everything was ready for school tomorrow. As he did so, he listened to the sounds of the students in the halls, yelling and celebrating that the first day of school was finally over. He chuckled and shook his head. \"If only they knew how easy they have it now\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knocking at the door interrupted his thoughts - a rather loud one, Kuai thought. He looked up and saw a wide, metallic grin as Tyler slowly stepped into the room. \"Mr. Tao?\" he asked. \"Is it all right if I come in? I mean, you did say earlier that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai immediately rose to his feet. \"Of course, Tyler!\" he exclaimed. \"Come on in!\" He was secretly relieved that Tyler had remembered to stop on by, as he knew that kids with ADHD tended to forget their commitments. He crossed around to the front of his desk, leaning against it slightly, making sure not to put all his weight on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Tyler stood walked up to stand in front of Kuai. \"Thanks,\" he sighed in relief. \"Today's been just--\" He stopped, closed his eyes and shook his head. Kuai could tell his cheeks were flushed -- the kid was definitely overexerted from the day, probably over-stimulated due to a combination of not being medicated along with it being a the first day of the school year. A little bit of sweat was starting to bead up on his forehead, but Tyler quickly wiped it away. \"I guess it's hard to understand,\" he finally said, finally looking the teacher in the eye. Kuai could tell that again he was fighting back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kuai said, resisting the urge to place his hand on Tyler's shoulder, \"I get it. The first day is a lot to take in for anyone, a lot to get adjusted to. Anyone would be justified in feeling a little frustrated at that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Tyler said, slumping down a little. \"I just don't think there's that many people out there who can relate to me. I mean, none of the other kids here at the school have any clue how hard it is to stand out so much like I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like we do,\" Kuai corrected, a warm look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the corners of Tyler's lips to rise a little. \"Yeah. Like we do. I guess you have a lot to teach me about how to deal with being so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, Kuai thought to himself. As he did so, though, another thought came to his mind. Maybe, just maybe, he should explain the pendant to Tyler. After all, with the kid's overactive imagination, he'd probably have no problem believing him. And besides, it might help him feel better about the situation. Then, if he truly wanted, Kuai could change him back to the way he was, though he secretly hoped it wouldn't come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would telling someone else about the pendant really be a good idea? Kuai trusted Tyler enough, but after all, they had only known each other for a few hours. And what if there were any unforeseen complications with somebody else knowing? Kuai probably should put the pendant through some more tests before telling anyone else about it. At least, that would be the safe thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Kuai realized that the room had grown silent, and Tyler was staring at him curiously. \"Hmm,\" the boy mused, \"You look like you have something to tell me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shifted, slightly nervous. \"Uhhh\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Tyler shrugged. \"I mean, if it's a secret or something I don't have to know.\" But as his eyes widened and he started fidgeting slightly, Kuai could tell that Tyler was dying to find out what Kuai was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" Kuai started, unsure of exactly what to say.</span></div></div>",

Besides, he reasoned in the back of his mind, if things got horribly out of hand, he could always use the pendant to change things back, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tyler,\" he said, crossing his arms. \"You're right. I do have something I'd like to share with you. You're probably not going to believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grinned, shaking his head. \"Don't worry about that, Mr. Tao. I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai felt himself smiling in return, glad to hear those words escaping from Tyler's lips yet for some reason also terrified about what they represented. Pushing as many pessimistic thoughts out of his mind as he could, he continued. \"Well, Tyler, I'm glad that you do trust me, but this is going to sound completely insane. Anyways\u2026\" He hesitated, finally deciding he'd been beating around the bush too much. \"You know how one of the first things we bonded on today was the fact that we were both so tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Tyler nodded enthusiastically. \"Up until today I don't think I've ever met someone as tall as I am. It's kinda cool to see that other normal people can be this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai gulped. \"Well, Tyler, up until a few hours ago, you yourself weren't that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, trying to judge Tyler's reaction, but all he got was a blank, confused stare. \"What?\" Tyler finally responded. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I first saw you this morning,\" Kuai continued, \"you were the same height as any of my other students. On the short side, actually.\" He pulled the pendant out from where it was hiding underneath his shirt. \"I actually was able to change you, make you bigger, using this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes went wide as he looked at the pendant. \"What is that?!\" Kuai could tell he had piqued the boy's interest for sure, but he couldn't tell if Tyler was getting excited or angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pendant that my friend sent me. It has some sort of extremely fancy technology involving nanites, which can change the physical properties of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stepped closer to Kuai, trying to see the pendant in greater detail. \"Wow, nanites? Really? I've read some about those, how they might be used to terraform other planets and stuff, but I had no idea that they actually existed yet, or were capable of anything like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched the boy get more and more enthusiastic, Kuai inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. This seemed to confirm his decision to share the truth with Tyler, and hopefully would bring the two of them closer together. How close, Kuai thought, was still to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait!\" Tyler exclaimed, a slight doubt forming on his face. \"If that were true, why would I have the memories of being big like this for my whole life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kuai wrinkled his nose, \"that's something I'm not entirely sure of yet. Nick -- that's my friend who sent this to me -- says that the nanites can travel back in time and change history. I don't really have a clue exactly how, but what's happened so far seems to line up with what he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" Tyler murmured to himself, slowly nodding in understanding. \"Wow! That's really cool, Mr. Tao.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you think so, Tyler,\" Kuai said as he smiled. \"I was half-afraid you'd freak out or get mad at me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning again, Tyler stepped a little closer to Kuai. \"Me get mad at you? Never!!\" He found himself starting to give Kuai a playful punch in the arm, but stopped halfway, realizing he was still talking to a teacher. For a moment, he stood there awkwardly, holding his hand in mid-air, until he finally placed it against Kuai's arm, giving it a friendly pat. \"Heheh,\" Tyler blushed in embarrassment. \"Sorry 'bout that, Mr. Tao.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think twice about it, Tyler. And please, call me Kuai.\" He didn't quite know why he suddenly blurted that out. He'd never really let any of his students be on a first-name basis with him before. But something was different about Tyler. Even though they had just met, he already felt like the boy was closer to him than just a student. It was a dangerous path to go down, Kuai realized, but something just felt right about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\u2026 Kuai.\" Tyler grinned, and then leaned against the desk next to Kuai, crossing his arms in much the same manner. \"I do have one thing I just gotta ask though,\" he said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai turned his head slightly. \"What's that, Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllll\u2026\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But with that pendant in hand, there's no telling how big someone could get, right?\" The boy's eyes seemed to sparkle and he got more and more excited as he talked. \"This could be only the beginning! You could grow me up to the ceiling, or through it! Heck, I could be bigger than the entire school building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai felt his pants get tighter at Tyler's words. He couldn't deny that something like this was what he had dreamed of from the moment he first got the pendant in the mail, but ... was this really the responsible thing to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Tyler...\" Kuai hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" Tyler looked straight into Kuai's eyes with a mix of cuteness and eagerness that Kuai just couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he finally relented. \"But not too much, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Tyler jumped up, shaking the floor slightly when he landed. He stood straight up, posing in a position ready to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiddling with the switches, Kuai made sure that the pendant was set so that Tyler would be aware of the growth but that the rest of the world wouldn't. On a whim, he also flipped the switch to make the world not adjust to Tyler's growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to picture Tyler inching upwards, and nearly instantaneously, the boy's body began to expand. \"Oh, wow!\" Tyler said almost instantly. \"This sure feels weird! But, good, in a way.\" Within a few seconds, Tyler was already taller than Kuai, and his clothes were beginning to stretch past their limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez,\" Tyler exclaimed, beginning to breath more heavily. \"My shirt's starting to feel tight. My pants too! Why aren't they growing with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shrugged. \"I dunno,\" he lied, grinning slightly. He couldn't really help himself. What was already a hot sight was made all the more arousing by the fact that this eight-foot behemoth's body was straining to break free, like a beast trying to become uncaged. And it was pretty obvious that Kuai wasn't the only one getting excited by what was happening -- Tyler's ever-contracting pants had revealed a bulge that was about to burst straight through the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tyler,\" Kuai said, slightly disappointed, \"that's enough for right now.\" Tyler's growth stopped, leaving him at over eight and a half feet. The buttons that hadn't popped loose during the growing experience were barely staying together, and his toned stomach and chest could clearly be seen in the gaps between them. His shorts were skin-tight, riding up his thighs and looking like something between boxer briefs and speedos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't stop!\" Tyler protested. \"It's just getting good! I feel so-- oh!\" He moaned loudly, unable to finish his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't keep going, can I?\" Kuai asked himself. \"This boy's already huge; what would happen if I made him even bigger? Then again... what WOULD happen if I made him even bigger? Hmm...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean Kuai! Please? Just a little more?\" Tyler begged. Kuai caved in and imagined the student growing larger and larger. Tyler grew and grew, filling the room. As he grew, buttons popped from his shirt and bounced off the walls. Tyler's shirt and pants ripped and hung in tatters around his arms and legs, and his boxers struggeled to maintain their grip on his expanding body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler not only grew in height, but in strength as well. His pecs shot out from his body like two slabs of giant meat while his biceps grew to the size of cannon balls. Tyler's ripped shirt also revealed a deep, canyon like, eight pack. Not only that, but the boy's legs grew to resemble oak trees. The boy could only be described as a colossal hunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai got carried away with himself, enjoying Tylers giggles and moans of pleasure.

Plus, Kuai imagined that Tyler would be quite attractive after puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai suddenly realized that he still wore the pendant. The pendant that made his thoughts into reality! So, as Kuai thought of an older Tyler, it happened.

His eyes stayed on Tyler's bulge for quite a while, imaging what incredible beast must lie underneath those oh-so-painfully tight boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Tyler noticed where Kuai's gaze was focused, and a smile crept to his face. \"Well, well,\" he said, chuckling. \"I think I know why you were so interested in growing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back into the conversation, Kuai's face paled as he realized he'd been caught. \"Uh, wait, Tyler, that's not--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I've been fantasizing about you since I first walked into the classroom.\" Tyler licked his lips a little, bringing his hand to his chest, rubbing it slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-- what?\" Kuai stepped back in shock. Had Tyler just said what he thought he'd said? The boy had been every bit as interested in Kuai as Kuai was in him? Maybe this was just a side effect of the aging process, Kuai thought, some false memories that had been created somehow\u2026 But Tyler should be immune to those memories, he realized. He didn't quite know what to think, but if Tyler truly felt that way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. You're by far the hottest teacher I've ever had.\" Tyler's boxers began to rip slightly, and he blushed, but only for a moment. \"That's why I wanted to come by after school so bad.

Stepping towards the hulking giant, he placed his hand on Tyler's pec, feeling the warmth emanating from him and the strong, tight muscle underneath his hand. It felt\u2026 amazing, unlike anything he'd ever dreamed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's\u2026 there's just one thing,\" Tyler said, his eyes half-closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Kuai asked as his heart raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tyler replied...</span></div></div>",

A teenager?!!\" Kuai hadn't even considered this thought for a moment up until now. His original teenage years had been more or less miserable. Sure, he was good at basketball and popular in school because of that, but he also had to deal with being in the closet in a very homophobic family, not to mention the intolerant world of athletics. But maybe, now with the pendant, going through school again wouldn't be so bad. In fact, it might be a whole lot of fun\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't!\" Kuai shook his head. \"What about my job, and Sean, and my house and everything?

I'm sure that they'll make things work out\u2026if you let them, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was right, Kuai thought, things probably would fall into place.

Nick, my friend who made this for me, said that I couldn't use it to change anything about myself. Not without disengaging the safety switch, but that's locked with a passcode that he wouldn't give me.\" As if to prove things, Kuai double-clicked on the button, bringing up the switches, along with the red bar at the bottom. As he slid it, a numerical keypad popped up on the screen, with the words \"Enter Passcode\" above it. \"See?\" he asked, showing this to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle giant nodded. \"Well, do you think you could crack the passcode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shook his head. \"I don't think so. Nick's usually pretty good about stuff like that. I mean, I could give it a shot, I guess, but the odds are against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, causing the room to shake slightly as he did, Tyler thought for a moment. \"Well,\" he mused aloud, \"you could always change me first, and then\u2026 give the pendant to me. I should be able to change you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to speak, Kuai stopped himself. \"I\u2026 I guess that would work. But\u2026 I dunno.\" He wrestled with this idea in his head. He trusted Tyler to not do anything to hurt him, sure, but he wasn't quite sure just how responsible the young man would be; if he'd know when to stop or if he'd go too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your call, Mr. Tao-- I mean, Kuai,\" Tyler said with a grin. \"I\u2026 I just think you'd make a really hot teenager.\" He blushed slightly, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Kuai tried to make up his mind. What was the better way to go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai decided to try guessing at Nick's passcode, which appeared to be a six letter code. Kuai was pleasantly surprised to see this, he expected Nick to go all out on this one. Now it was only a matter of guessing the code...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA code Nick came up with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai got an idea and punched in the code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBIGBOY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPASSCODE ACCEPTED buzzed the pendant as more options appeared. Kuai looked them over and saw that they all pertained to the wearer in some way. There were three options total. One was a basic reality mode, specially designed for the user. Apparently the reality program he used before wouldn't work on the wearer. The second was another clothing/building option with the same function as the one before. The last one was a personal memory alterer. With this option activated, the user's memories would change like everyone else's did in regards to any changes made to people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Tyler asked, \"Will you do it? Will you be a teen with me? We can have an awesome relationship together in school. We can have the life you always wanted.\" Tyler got an adorable pleading look on his face. Kuai finally gave in. He regressed Tyler back to twelve like before. Well, almost. The boy was still a good 6'3'' and was still very muscular. Tyler smiled seeing he was mostly back to normal. \"Now you, Kuai! You promised me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai took a final look around and gave a small sigh. With that, he regressed himself. He was fully aware of his change, but memories of his new life flooded in, replacing those from before. He had still gotten the pendant from Nick, who turned out to be his adopted father! Nick now lived in Kuai's city and was dating Sean. They both had adopted Kuai after they graduated from college. That would set it at about five years ago, Kuai remembered being adopted at age 8, meaning he was now 13. He stood at 6'3'' and was well muscled as well. He and Tyler were both on the school basketball team together, where they dominated their school league. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys now stood outside, and a soft breeze blew. Tyler now had clothing on once more, and Kuai noticed that he himself was wearing a their school's basketball jersey. Tyler looked at the now younger Kuai and giggled. \"You're just as cute now as you were as an adult.\" 'Hmm,' Kuai thought, 'Looks like the settings were still set to let Tyler retain memory of me as and adult.' Tyler rann over to Kuai and plsnted a kiss on his lips while throwing his arms around Kuai's neck. New memories flooded into Kuai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he and Tyler were dating, and were actually in a decently serious relationship and had been so for little over a year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai grew excited feeling Tyler holding him, and did something a little sneaky. With a quick thought, he switched the pendant's settings and grew Tyler until he stood at 7 feet tall. Due to the settings being switched, Tyler took no notice of his growth and continued kissing Kuai, who he now literally held in his arms. Kuai actually enjoyed this moment very much so,and looked foreward to his new life. Now what to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having changed so much in the past few hours, Kuai couldn't help but want more. And, with his now-teenage body's hormones running on overdrive, what he had in mind\u2026 well, it wasn't exactly appropriate for school grounds. Breaking the kiss and placing his hand on Tyler's chest, Kuai looked up at the towering boy -- now his boyfriend, he reminded himself, as giddy as that made him feel -- and said, \"Tyler, why don't we go back to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes went wide for a moment, and a grin spread across his face. \"Oh? What do you think we should do there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kuai shrugged. \"Well, we'll just have to see about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the school, Kuai realized that he didn't have a car anymore, not being old enough to have a driver's license, and that by now it was too late to catch the bus. Luckily, he didn't live too far away, so he and Tyler started walking, heading down the sidewalk hand-in-hand. Every now and then, someone walking by would turn their head and stare at these two tall, muscular boys displaying affection for each other, but Kuai just laughed this off. \"They're just jealous of how hot we are together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce arriving at home, Kuai stepped into the kitchen, seeing both Nick and Sean sitting around the table. \"Hey there, Son,\" Nick said, smiling. \"And hello, Tyler. How was the first day of school for the two of you today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai and Tyler exchanged knowing glances, both trying to hold back their laughter. \"It was\u2026 pretty good, um\u2026\" Kuai racked his brain for a moment, trying to remember what he called Nick now in this situation. He soon realized that he called Nick \"Papa\" and Sean \"Dad.\" He felt a little weird about doing so, as he realized that, as an adult, he had slept with both of these men whom he now considered his fathers. \"Uh, yeah, Papa. Some... interesting things happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Sean smiled from the other side of the table. \"Well, you'll have to tell us all about it at dinner tonight. In the meantime, I'm sure you boys are probably wanting some time for yourselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Kuai turned towards the stairs, but Nick stopped him, reaching out and grabbing his shoulder. \"Hang on a second there, Kuai.\" He looked down, and Kuai's heart skipped a beat when he realized he was staring at the pendant. \"Where did you get that, son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm\u2026\" Kuai tried to think of something he could say that would sound plausible but also wouldn't give away the truth. \"A friend gave it to me as a back-to-school gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Nick's voice sounded doubtful, but he shook his head, turning back to the newspaper he had been reading. Breathing a sigh of relief, Kuai ran up the stairs to his room, followed closely by Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one,\" Kuai said, closing his door behind them and sitting down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tyler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- I guess I'm not sure. Nick was the one who originally gave me the pendant, but I guess in this reality he didn't. But, then\u2026 wouldn't that create some sort of paradox?\" Kuai's brain began to hurt as he lied down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Tyler murmured as he looked down at his boyfriend. \"Who gives a crap? All I know is that, now, you're the hottest boy I've ever laid eyes on.\" The seven-foot boy nearly jumped on top of Kuai, pressing his body against him and starting to make out. Surprised but delighted, Kuai wrapped his arms around Tyler's back, kissing him deeply and squeezing him tightly. He couldn't deny that he, too, found Tyler hotter than anyone he had ever kissed, and he soon realized that both of their bulges were pressing into the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many thoughts were racing through Kuai's mind that he couldn't think straight, but as Tyler placed his hand under his shirt and started to run it up against his chest, Kuai moaned softly, realizing the reason he had come home: to see just if using the pendant during sex would be just as hot as he imagined!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kuai returned to his room without incident and closed the door. He strolled over to his desk and sat down for what felt like the first time all day. His skin melted into the moderately comfortable rolling chair, trying to fully absorb this time of rest. Kuai then leaned over his desk, setting his elbows squarely on the top. He grabbed the onyx-like pendant and turned its glass screen to face him. Kuai swiped his thumb across the smooth surface causing the screen beneath to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really does look like a small smart phone,\u201d Kuai thought to himself. On the main screen were five options. The first was switched on and protected the pendant from being stolen. \u201cNick said it would shock the hell out of anyone who tried to steal this thing.\u201d Kuai chuckled some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike anyone would even try to steal this off of me. Then again, that second switch makes the pendant invisible to everyone but me. And how handy has that been today,\u201d he asked himself rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai slid his eyes further across the glossy screen. \u201cWithout that third and fourth option, I would certainly have a lot of explaining to do,\u201d Kuai said aloud. The third option altered the mind of the person he changed so they would think they always looked the way Kuai had imagined them. The fourth somehow changed the minds of everyone else in the world in the same way. \u201cExcept for me. I will always know. And I bet if I switched off the third option but left the fourth on, the person I change would know too, but everyone else would think it was all normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kuai reexamined the fifth option and got a devilish grin on his face. \u201cAnd this one can alter the material world for the person I change. Basically, if it\u2019s on, their clothes grow with them. If not\u2026\u201d Kuai\u2019s grin got even larger. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that option does other stuff too. Maybe I should ask Nick after Tyler leaves and I\u2019m heading home. What time is it anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shifted his gaze from the pendant to the simple clock on the wall over his whiteboard. \u201cTwo forty five! I feel like I\u2019ve only been sitting here a few minutes. Must have zoned out longer than I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai released the pendant, allowing it to dangle once more from his neck and glanced at the door with realization. \u201cWait a second? Then where\u2019s Tyler? He said he\u2019d come by right after school. Right?\u201d Kuai asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back over his conversation with the big hyperactive boy after his hallway fight and sure enough remembered Tyler asking to come back to his room after school. The time alone had given Kuai an opportunity to organize his room a bit more and get some plans ready for tomorrow. Another half hour passed before he decided it was time to go. Kuai shouldered his large, black satchel over his shoulder and left the building. \u201cI\u2019ll see Tyler tomorrow. Maybe something came up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since sunrise, Kuai could step outside. This was only the first day of classes, so not many people were left on campus as they would be later in the year when clubs and sports started up. Kuai enjoyed the relative silence and breathed in the sunshine as he followed the windy stone path around the middle school building to the teacher\u2019s parking lot beyond. Various blooms along the path and under the trees released a silent symphony of aromas, each more beautiful than the next. A few students were scattered about, sitting on the polished wooden benches that lined the various paths leading around campus. Some were studying; others appeared bored and impatient, probably waiting for their rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai finally slipped into his car, followed the freshly paved road around the campus and passed through the front gates of Wellington Academy, leaving the school behind until tomorrow. He had certainly gone through a long and interesting day and he couldn\u2019t wait for some serious relaxation and perhaps some more experimenting with the pendant on his boyfriend Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably getting ready for work right now,\u201d Kuai thought to himself looping away from Jamaica Pond. After a thirty minute drive away from million-dollar homes and around the snug city of Milton, Kuai finally arrived at his simple but pleasant home in North Quincy. Sea air gently filled his nostrils as he got out of the car. The porch swing where Kuai had changed Sean the day before was empty, but despite his fatigue, his excitement grew to try the pendant once again on his unsuspecting boyfriend. Before opening the door, he switched the material option off, preventing Sean\u2019s clothes from growing with him if and when he decided to change him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Kuai barely stepped inside to see Sean frantically running around the house half-naked. \u201cRunning late again Sean?\u201d Kuai called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Sean\u2019s muffled voice called back from the laundry room. He prattled on in a series of muted high pitch tones for another minute. Kuai only caught the last part of the dramatic monologue. \u201c\u2026no clean clothes left and didn\u2019t find that out until about thirty minutes ago. Now I\u2019m trying to dry my work clothes some before bolting out of here and that dingy old drier isn\u2019t doing the job fast enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai set down his satchel in the living room and moved to the kitchen, closer to Sean. \u201cDid you want something to eat before you go? At least a granola bar or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai suspected that Sean had not eaten anything all day and would probably only snack on sweets after he left. He always did, although no one could tell by looking at his tight, thin body and boyish features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean whirled past Kuai, while hopping into a pair of black socks. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine!\u201d he mumbled through the toothbrush now hanging out of his mouth. Making their work schedules match had always been tough. Sean was still in school and worked nights at a local coffee shop near campus. It was a rare opportunity for both of them to be in the same place at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai decided that he really wanted to spend some time with Sean before he left, and he really, really wanted to find out more about what the pendant could do. He stripped off his button down shirt, throwing it in the hamper and dropped his tie on the nightstand. Kicking off his shoes, he came up behind Sean, who was still getting ready in the bathroom. A white undershirt tightly hugged Kuai\u2019s every muscle as he wrapped his arms around his smaller boyfriend, enveloping his body. Sean\u2019s panic momentarily washed away by the sweet kisses Kuai placed on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a mood,\u201d Sean grinned, putting the clean toothbrush back in its place. \u201cBut I\u2019ve really got to get going to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai was not going to accept no for an answer. He stood knees bent, continuing to kiss on Sean\u2019s neck, pulling the soft reddened flesh between his lips. Kuai rubbed his hand up Sean\u2019s undershirt and across his smooth stomach. He grabbed a hint of a four pack underneath his palm. Kuai\u2019s other hand, slid down Sean\u2019s exposed thigh, gently caressing his skin with the tips of his fingers. Sean swooned, sliding his feet apart and gripping the edge of the vanity. Kuai\u2019s pants tightened as he continued to embrace Sean\u2019s creamy white skin. Then an idea popped into his head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sean unconsciously grinded against the vanity as Kuai gently humped his boyfriend. Sean was helpless to Kuai\u2019s advances. Kuai moved one hand up to Sean\u2019s chest and the other down to his stiffening cock. He rubbed the rod between his fingers and imagined it growing several inches longer and thicker. Within moments, Kuai could feel Sean\u2019s hardened cock continue to grow. He had been seven inches hard, but now quickly reached past eight, still growing. Sean moaned louder and thrust his hips back into Kuai\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai spun Sean around and grew even more excited as he watched Sean\u2019s blue boxers bulge further and further out. In moments, the tip of Sean\u2019s cock broke free from the waist band and continued to grow up his taught stomach. Sean\u2019s eyes were half open, engulfed by the sensations Kuai thrust upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai immediately squatted down and pulled Sean\u2019s boxers down his thick thighs. Sean\u2019s cock sprung out, nearly hitting Kuai in the face. Kuai opened his mouth and pulled on the growing rod with his lips. The feeling of Sean\u2019s cock growing in his mouth was incredible. Kuai could feel all that flesh trying to fight its way free from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth cocks stiffened even more than either thought possible. Kuai\u2019s nine inch meat hurt as it violently banged against the zipper of his dress pants. Sean continued to thrust back and forth, getting more and more excited by the entire event. Kuai could feel his boyfriend\u2019s huge cock sliding deeper and deeper into his mouth. Fortunately, it stopped growing just before Kuai\u2019s gag reflex kicked in. He pulled on Sean\u2019s huge cock back and forth, feeling just how much larger it was with his tongue and lips. Sean\u2019s new manhood forced Kuai to widen his jaw almost as far as it could go. Sean continued to thrust back and forth going faster each time. Kuai could taste the wet juices beginning to flow out of Sean\u2019s dick. They filled Kuai\u2019s mouth and trickled down his throat, out of his control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean moaned louder and thrust deeper. Kuai cupped Sean\u2019s enlarged balls, massaging them with his hand. He reached around with his other hand and firmly squeezed Sean\u2019s tightening butt. Sean gasped and thrust harder. Kuai knew Sean was getting close and had yet another idea for making him go over the edge. He imagined Sean growing another several inches taller and adding even more muscle on his buffed frame. Kuai\u2019s cock throbbed with anticipation, wanting its release too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s whole body vibrated and slowly inched larger. Kuai\u2019s back slowly had to straighten up to kept up with Sean\u2019s growth. Kuai could feel Sean\u2019s cock getting even larger as his boyfriend\u2019s entire body swelled with size. His thighs thickened, each muscle rippling against Kuai\u2019s shoulders. Kuai felt each cheek of Sean\u2019s butt tighten harder and grow larger in his palm. They were hard as rocks, but smooth as silk. Sean\u2019s torso continued to lengthen, giving Kuai a view of his growing six pack. Two deep muscular cuts appeared on his hips and were only growing bigger. Each bulge of Sean\u2019s lower abs firmly rubbed against Kuai\u2019s forehead with every thrust. Sean\u2019s shirt tightened against his body, ready to pop. His boxers ripped some before falling around his knees and finally being caught by his widening calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was as much as Kuai could take. With a loud grunt and a single motion, Kuai ripped his dress pants off his thighs, exposing the boxers underneath. He reached in and pulled out his cock, firmly pulling it back and forth. Both were so close, they began to shake. Sean shoved his cock deeper down Kuai\u2019s throat than Kuai thought possible. He couldn\u2019t even gag. Sean\u2019s cock was so big, it cut off his air. Instantly, Sean grabbed Kuai by the head, bending over. Sean jammed down Kuai\u2019s jaw, spraying thick, hot cum all down the huge Asian\u2019s defenseless throat. Kuai came seconds later, shooting a hot jet of cum right under the huge clefts of his chest, coating his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElation and satisfaction swaddled their bodies in warm blanket of contentment. Neither Sean nor Kuai moved for several seconds after. Sean involuntarily convulsed several more times before loosening his grip on the back of Kuai\u2019s head. Kuai moved first, slowly unhinging himself from Sean\u2019s grip. Kuai slid his head back, revealing a never ending rod of flesh. Finally, he lurched back with a final pull, releasing his bruised throat from Sean\u2019s can-sized cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai looked up at Sean, amazed by just how thick he had become. His enlarged body rippled with tight chords of muscle. He probably stood around 6\u20193\u201d now and his dick was well over a foot long. Kuai took on an uncharacteristically boyish tone. \u201cDon\u2019t you need to go to work, Sean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s body rippled with a tiny tremor as he opened his eyes. His voice whined with exasperation even higher pitched than usual.\u201cAss. You are a hot mess!\u201d Sean heaved with huge breaths, completely unaware of his former self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am,\u201d Kuai smiled softly, eyeing his arousing modifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kuai cleaned the cum off his shirt, Sean continued to bolt around the house to get ready. Kuai finally gave up and just took the shirt off, exposing the enormous bulges of his body to bathroom mirror. Sean finished getting dressed and waddled into the bathroom. \u201cI think that damn drier went and shrunk my clothes!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai looked with the mirror and saw how ridiculously tiny Sean\u2019s clothes were for his new body. Kuai could feel his cock stiffen again. \u201cLooks hot, Sean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean huffed and rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019d look even hotter if I wasn\u2019t walking around like a marionette!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai chuckled, then immediately gave a softening smile. \u201cWe can get you some more clothes tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean simmered some. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to. I feel like if I bend over, they will snap right off of me.\u201d Kuai\u2019s cock thickened at the idea. Sean lifted one of his feet, careful not to snap his pants. \u201cAnd these ratty work shoes have also worn out. They were, like, impossible to get on!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai barely kept his lust in check, begging himself not jump Sean again. Sean set his foot back down and readjusted a very generous bulge going down one of his pant legs. He then took a breath, came up behind Kuai and gave him a big hug, kissing him on his bare shoulder. Sean was much larger than he had been, but Kuai was still bigger. \u201cHave a good day at work, Sean. And maybe they won't notice that you were half an hour late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, let's hope so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean ran out of the house, probably ripping some of his clothes in the process, and Kuai was satisfied. \u201cSeems I can really change anything I imagine,\" Kuai gloated, adjusting his jaw. \"I wonder if Nick would know any more?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...But Nick, you should have seen the fear on his face when he suddenly looked up into the eyes of a 6'3\" ripped beast of a boy! That asshole sure zipped back into his classroom fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai lounged on the porch swing with his cell phone to his ear and his other hand resting on a knee, watching the afternoon slowly fade into evening. Though the sky hadn't yet grown dark, street lamps already were beginning to spring to life, and most cars drove by with headlights on. The air still felt a little warm and sticky with the remnants of summer, but a gentle cool breeze had started to blow off the bay and through the tight streets of North Quincy, making it a perfect day for couples and families to hit the sidewalks for a relaxing stroll or bike ride. Some of these passers-by even looked Kuai's way as they neared, and the large Asian man gave them a friendly half-wave. With such a pleasant night setting in, he began to wish Sean could be home to share it with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds pretty awesome,\" Nick replied, \"and hot too. You should've turned on the video function on the pendant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kuai exclaimed as he sat up straight on the swing. \"The pendant can do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused chuckling filled his ear. \"No, it can't, Kuai. I'm sorry. That was a joke, but it wasn't a fair one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai frowned slightly. \"Well, with everything else it can do--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Nick interjected. \"It's already doing things much more advanced than streaming video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the half of it,\" Kuai said, starting to smile again. \"I just noticed a few hours ago with Sean that I can target growth to... to certain... body parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Nick tried to act surprised, but Kuai could tell this was a function the pendant's creator was all too aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say,\" Kuai stood up and faced towards the street, his legs getting restless, \"that if Sean's theater design degree doesn't pan out, he'll always have a fallback career in porn.\" An elderly woman walking by turned towards Kuai, an offended look on her face. Kuai simply shook his head, his grin getting wider. Scoffing, the woman muttered something to herself, and shambled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's voice laughed loudly in the phone. \"Kuai, you didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the porch steps, his cell phone still at his ear, Kuai stepped out to the sidewalk and began to walk slowly down it. \"Why not? Isn't that the sorta thing you sent it to me for in the first place?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Nick paused for a moment. \"I guess so. But, please tell me you at least told your boyfriend first and turned off the awareness switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai pulled out the pendant and flicked on the screen, confirming that only the fifth switch had been disabled, which he switched back on now to be safe. \"Nope! I'm not sure if Sean would react well if he found out about the pendant at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Nick asked as Kuai rounded the corner of the block, \"I thought you told him about your macro interests over a year ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but he didn't say much about it then, and he hasn't mentioned the subject since.\" Looking both ways as he talked, Kuai quickly darted across the small, two-lane street. \"He probably would go into drama queen mode if he discovered I used the pendant on him without telling him. Wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...Still, you're going to have to tell him someday...\" As Nick grew silent for a moment, Kuai looked up and saw that he was now standing in front of Cavanagh Stadium, a small, city-owned athletic facility. Kuai had always felt that calling it a 'stadium' was extremely generous; it felt much more like a local park, the only features of any note being a small field with soccer nets occasionally set up on either end, a single set of metal bleachers on the side, a track running around the field's circumference, and a small basketball court near the fence separating the area from the street. A group of six teenagers currently were playing on the court, and in the open field beyond, two ten-year-old boys (twin brothers, by the looks of them) threw around a baseball with a man Kuai guessed was their father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing uncomfortable with the long silence, Kuai thought of something he could say. A question finally popped into his mind. \"Hey, Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai sat down on an open bench, out of immediate earshot of anyone else in the park. Lowering his voice, he asked, \"So what exactly would happen if I turned off the third switch but left the fourth one on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you didn't try out all of them?\" Nick sounded surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kuai admitted, \"the only one I changed was the one that affects clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothing and any other inanimate objects,\" Nick reminded him. \"If the subject that's changing is about to burst out of anything in their immediate vicinity, or for that matter shrink down past a certain point, then the said objects will change with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kuai realized he hadn't yet seen this affect anything except for clothing, but to be fair, he hadn't made as big of changes as perhaps Nick was suggesting needed to be made. \"Is that the only way you can change inanimate objects? By growing someone who's near them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick remained silent for a moment. \"Now that you mention it, I guess it is. Maybe that's something I should patch in. I can probably get you some sort of working solution by the end of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Kuai nodded, \"I can wait until then. But Nick, you didn't really answer my question about the third and fourth switches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed. \"Look, Kuai, they may seem related, but the third and fourth switches are completely independent of each other. The third switch only affects the memory of whoever you're changing. The fourth one affects everyone else's memory. Thus, it's possible to have only the person who goes through the changes becoming aware of what's changing, while everyone else treats it as normal, even thinking the changed person crazy for saying otherwise. The reverse is also true; everyone could think someone's been changed dramatically while they themselves believe they've always been that way. What can complicate things, however, is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick rambled on, Kuai unintentionally started to tune out, his attention being drawn by the group of teenage boys playing basketball. He recognized a few of them from around the neighborhood. They looked to range in age from around sixteen to nineteen, and they appeared to be fairly skilled. He continued to watch, noticing a boy sitting on the edge of the court watching them play. Kuai couldn't get a good look at the boy, only making out that he appeared to be younger, maybe thirteen or fourteen, was Asian in origin, and didn't appear to be related to any of the boys playing. \"He does look kind of familiar though,\" Kuai thought. \"Did I have him in a class...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--so that's something you should watch out for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai snapped back to the phone call. \"Right,\" Kuai said, wondering what Nick had just cautioned him to look for, but not wanting to reveal that his mind had drifted away from the conversation. \"Uh...I'll let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick seemed satisfied enough with this answer and moved on. \"So did you make any other changes to your boys? Besides height and muscle... and Sean's, um, 'endowment enhancements', I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kuai shrugged as he answered, \"what other changes would there be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nick replied, \"any number of changes, I guess. For instance, you could change their facial structure, making them more (or less) attractive. You could lengthen or shorten their hair and change the style and color. There's some stuff I probably haven't even thought about yet that you can do. But one thing I really think that you should try out as soon as you can is...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Age?\" Kuai asked. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it sound like I mean, Kuai?\" Kuai rolled his eyes and started to speak, but Nick continued. \"It's age. You picture someone older or younger, and they change. That's about it. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai's thoughts immediately went back to the young Asian boy sitting on the sidelines, wondering if he might be able to help him get into the game. He looked over to where the boy now stood, arms on his hips. An inkling of deja vu came upon him, but Kuai shook it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I could go for that,\" Kuai said. \"in fact--\" He stopped talking, seeing the boy look directly at him, his face now completely visible. Kuai felt a slight chill running down his spine as he realized where he had recognized the boy from. The striking eyebrows, the short-cropped black hair, slightly-pointed nose - they were all something he saw every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking directly at him, the boy smiled a big toothy grin. Kuai's grin. The boy's face... was identical to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\" Kuai said aloud. He tilted his head down and rubbed his eyes, wondering what the hell was going on, how this kid could look so close to -- no, EXACTLY like -- him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Nick asked, worried. \"Are you okay, Kuai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at the boy, Kuai now saw he was walking back and forth. What's more, the boy's features looked different than before. His slightly longer hair covered his ears slightly, and his cheeks were a bit more rounded. He also wore glasses, something Kuai hadn't originally noticed -- or, he was almost sure, hadn't even been there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah.\" Kuai finally said, taking a deep breath and collecting his thoughts before talking again. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, laughing at his mistake. The boy's height and skinniness should have been a dead giveaway that he didn't look anything like Kuai, he thought. He was at least a foot shorter than Kuai had been at that age, and much less muscular. Now that he examined the face even more, Kuai realized that the boy didn't look very similar to him at all, the only thing they really had in common being their Chinese heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I ever think that kid looked like me?\" Kuai asked himself, starting to chuckle in relief. This boy certainly couldn't have any hope of being a basketball star. What's more, he carried himself with a clumsy, goofy demeanor, not the smooth coordination required of an athlete. That, combined with how short he was, meant he'd have almost no hope of making any organized team...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai's relieved smile turned back into a small frown as he started to feel a little guilty. \"...Unless I help him,\" he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I have to do to increase somebody's age?\" Kuai asked, wanting to test this newfound feature out now. \"I mean, age isn't exactly a strictly physical characteristic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Nick answered, \"but if you want him to think he's a certain age, focussing on that number, combined with an image of the boy growing, should be enough for the nanites to do their job properly. Don't worry if you're not exact; they can figure things out pretty well on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Kuai nodded, \"here goes!\" First he pulled up the switches on the pendant and turned the third one off, wanting to see how someone would react when they realized they were changing. His eyes fixed on the young Chinese teen, he pictured the boy slowly getting bigger, trying to narrow down an age as he did. \"Those other boys look to be about seventeen,\" Kuai decided, \"let's try to give him a leg up and make him eighteen.\" Keeping that number in his mind, he pictured a tall, well-built eighteen-year old, big and strong enough that he could stand out on any neighborhood basketball court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy started to grow, Kuai could immediately tell something was different than all the other times he'd grown somebody. The boy's eyes lit up, looking down at his body, mouth dropping open as he saw -- and felt -- his legs stretching out and his stomach and chest swelling up. His face seemed to be getting more defined, his cheekbones sticking out some and his chin becoming sharper. He still had the smooth olive skin and charming smile of a teenage boy-- just a slightly older one. No one else seemed to notice; only Kuai and the boy saw what was actually happening. And, Kuai realized in delight, the boy seemed to be enjoying the feeling. Even from a hundred feet away, Kuai could hear a soft moan escape from the boy's lips, and he saw the boy start to run his hands over the thick ripples and bulges that had appeared under his shirt and pants, on his chest, abs, arms, and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the boy's growth stopped, leaving him the tallest boy on or near the court at an impressive 6' 5\". He still nearly was petrified in amazement, unsure of what had just happened to him. Kuai even saw the boy pinch his arm a little bit, making sure he wasn't dreaming, Kuai guessed. Blinking several times, a huge grin finally showed up on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone on the court scored, and one of the opposing boys looked back over to the new eighteen-year-old Chinese stud. \"Hey, Li!\" he bent over and panted for air, \"Are you gonna jump back in? We're getting crushed without you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi looked at the other boys with disbelief, pointing at his chest. \"Me?\" he asked. \"You want me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we want you,\" a taller boy said, wiping sweat from his brow as he did so, \"you're the best baller in the neighborhood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi's eyes went wide, but he happily accepted, jumping into the group and starting to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai leaned back and smiled. \"That went pretty well,\" he told Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the ball got passed inside. Li reached out and swatted it away, chasing down the loose ball and scooping it up. The Chinese star then bolted to the bucket, jumped from near the free-throw line, reached up and dunked the ball through the hoop. He crashed back down to the court, still on his feet, beaming with pride. The rest of his teammates cheered, and Li hurried back to play defense again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say,\" Kuai finally replied, \"that I just played a little fairy godmother. I saw a kid in need and I helped him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuai,\" Nick's voice bubbled to a laugh, \"if there were three words I would pick that absolutely do NOT describe you, they would be 'little', 'fairy', and 'godmother'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai chuckled as he stood up, stretching his legs. Dusk had set in, and the sky had gone from light blue to an inky shade of indigo. \"Well I'm some kind of fairy god-SOMEthing. At least with this pendant. I can change someone's entire life for the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Nick answered, \"but if you really want your changes to be noticed, you'll need to switch off the four switch soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\" Kuai hesitated to speak. He had grown too comfortable changing things without anyone realizing the differences. He lived in his own private world, having fun without anyone else being the wiser. Allowing the \"change-ee\", as he had just now, to be aware of what was happening seemed risky enough. As he started to leave the park, heading back towards his house, he considered if he was ready to deal with the possible ramifications turning this switch off would mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll consider it,\" Kuai finally sighed, waiting as a stream of cars passed by before crossing the street. \"But, no promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's as good--\" Nick stopped as a knocking sound came through the phone. \"Hey, Kuai? I've got to go. My date's at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Date?\" Kuai grinned, a mischievous idea coming to his head. As he picked up the pendant and turned on the screen, he made sure the third switch was still off and flicked the fifth switch off too. As soon as they were set, he started picturing Nick, in the living room of his San Francisco apartment, holding his phone to his ear. He imagined his friend rapidly growing up to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's with this g--\" RIIIIIPP THUNK \"OW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai couldn't help but burst out laughing when he heard the sound of Nick's clothes tearing and his head bumping against the ceiling. Overcome with hysterics, his eyes started to water, and he wiped away his tears with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bastard, Kuai.\" Nick sounded annoyed but amused. \"Now please, change me back. I don't want my new possible future life partner to see me with my pants on the floor in shreds. At least, not on our second date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai complied, imagining his friend back to his normal height. \"Thank you,\" Nick said, then called out, \"I'll be right there! I just need to, uh...change first!\" He turned back to the phone, his voice much quieter now. \"I'll talk to you later, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya,\" Kuai said, hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of his house now, Kuai looked it over, his eyes finally landing on the second story window where his bedroom was. He didn't really want to go back inside an empty house alone right now, still itching to use the pendant. But Sean wouldn't be home for another three hours, and most of the boys in the neighborhood would probably be inside doing homework or getting ready to call it a night. Perhaps he should put aside the pendant for the rest of the evening, going to bed himself. Or maybe he should wait up for Sean, finally sharing his secret with the man he shared his life with. As he walked up the stairs and slowly opened the door to his house, Kuai decided what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight ended and darkness filled the air. Small pools of light painted the sidewalks on Kuai\u2019s walk home. Halfway back to his house, a few of the street lamps began to flicker. The sidewalk blinked with darkness. Kuai thought nothing of it; lights go out on occasion. His phone rang. Pulling it out of his pocket, the caller ID read \u201cPrivate.\u201d Kuai usually didn\u2019t pick up calls like that, but he felt compelled to do so this time. \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrackling static met his greeting. Kuai walked a few more steps listening to the sound before calling out again. Then finally the whisper of a voice emerged from the pops and cracks of his receiver. \u201c\u2026lie\u2026all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2014!?\u201d Kuai called to the voice more feverishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026lies\u2026\u201d the whisper repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai\u2019s concern instantly switched to frustration, seeing as how he was getting nowhere with the voice. He shoved his finger onto the glass plate, ending the call and threw the phone back into his pocket. More of the lights along Kuai\u2019s path home flickered and went out. The street was still fairly well-lit, but it was getting harder to see. Even the stars were muted in the clear night\u2019s sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust beyond in one of the small pools of flickering light, Kuai saw Tyler, but as the short, scrawny kid he had been before Kuai changed him. His wavy, dirty-blonde locks hid his eyes in darkness. What was a twelve-year-old boy doing out at this time of night? Before he could take another step, Tyler\u2019s form instantly transformed to the body Kuai had crafted, just as big and tall as he. However, he looked pained somehow. Kuai froze in place. Tyler struggled against invisible chains. A burning fire lit inside of Kuai. Tyler's pain worsened. Kuai finally broke free of his stillness, but with another blink, Tyler was gone. An empty pool of flickering light danced naked where Tyler had once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai rubbed his eyes harshly, but saw no one under that lamp light or any other. Picking up the pace, he turned onto his street. His phone started to ring again. Still agitated, he ignored the call, but it kept on ringing; seven, eight, nine times. \u201cVoice mail should have picked up by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone persistently vibrated in his pocket and shrieked its relentless rings. Finally, Kuai ripped the phone out of his pocket, relieved to see it was Nick. \u201cHey, Nick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Kuai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would never guess what just happened. Some idiot calls me from a private number and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick continued uninterrupted, but the static had returned. \u201cThere was some\u2014g I ne\u2014d to tell you\u2026\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone crackled. Kuai pushed the phone closer into his ear while plugging the other one with a finger. \u201cNick? I can barely hear you. Say again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s voice reemerged briefly from the annoying pops and cracks. \u201c\u2026the pen\u2014nt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatic overwhelmed his voice and the phone suddenly disconnected. Kuai pulled the phone away from his ear and unplugged the other. He tried to call him back, but all he got was a busy signal. Kuai almost tried a second time, but realized he was home when he heard the sound of creaking wood under his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatigue overtook him, his shoulders sagged, and his motions slowed. It had been a long day, thankfully about to be over. Kuai fumbled for the keys in his pocket before finally opening the door. Every light was off in the house, shrouding him in darkness. He struggled to find the light switch, slamming his hand against the wall in a series of tired shakes before finding the switch. Before he knew it, Kuai was in the bathroom getting ready for bed. He stripped down to his boxer-briefs and brushed his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face hung lifelessly over his enormous body, completely robbed of life. Kuai even struggled to lift his bulging arm to move the brush across his teeth. He finally finished, turned the water on and spit out the paste. He wiped his face on a washrag, and when he stood back up he saw something completely unexpected. The short Asian kid from the basketball court stared blankly at Kuai through the mirror. Kuai blinked his eyes furiously, turning away from the glass. He felt his body with his hands, ensuring that had not been his reflection he had just seen. Sure enough, every round bulge was accounted for. Kuai slowly turned back. His body filled the mirror once more. \u201cSo..tired\u2026\u201d Kuai said to himself.</span></div></div>",

I guess that big ol\u2019 body of yours just didn\u2019t see me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean looked wide awake and full of excitement. His new dick was already half erect and very impressively laying across Kuai\u2019s side of the bed. Kuai\u2019s confusion momentarily left him as he lay next to his boyfriend. \u201cSo how was work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s smile broke. \u201cDreadful! My shirt ripped about five minutes into my shift, leaving me bare-chested almost the whole time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shapely muscles were nicely accented in the glow of the bedroom. Kuai got a little stiff staring at them and imagining what it must have been like for Sean at work. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t send you home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. I\u2019m the hottest thing in that store. Like they were going to send me home. And that wasn\u2019t even the worst of it. Some old guy started hitting on me when I made his order, talking about how I should get even bigger. I was like, \u2018Hon! I\u2019d kill to be even bigger, but no one is as big as my Kuai!\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai blushed and snuggled up closer to Sean, slowly stroking Sean\u2019s very long manhood in his hand. Without even realizing, Sean\u2019s cock instantly got rock solid and grew another several inches. Sean tilted his head back and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing!\u201d Sean caressed his dick before rubbing on Kuai\u2019s tight abs. \u201cThey have yet to design a pair of pants that can hold me in. I swear it was so embarrassing when this one guy came in. Super cute. He was totally hitting on me. But, for no reason at all, I started to get a little hard. My pants about ripped down the seams. I had to run to the back to calm it down before I could get back to work. By then, the cutie was gone and I was, like, so embarrassed. I know they call me \u2018foot-long\u2019 for a reason, but that\u2019s a total understatement!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s rod thickened more, forcing Kuai\u2019s fingers apart. Had he made him this big earlier? \u201cAnd you said the old guy wanted you bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean huffed a quick breath. \u201cOh yeah! He was totally wanting a piece of this. But I can\u2019t get any bigger. I\u2019ve been this size forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai twinged before snuggling even closer. Kuai immediately began kissing on Sean, and Sean returned the favor in full force. Their tongues swirled together as their hands ran up and down their heavily muscled bodies. As they humped harder into each other, Kuai could feel Sean\u2019s entire body growing once again. His palms grew larger, gripping more and more of Kuai\u2019s body. His tongue filled Kuai\u2019s mouth and his legs slowly began sliding off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai came up for a quick breather and saw how Sean was now as big as him, continuing to grow. All of his muscles swelled with size and strength. Veins engulfed them and pumped Sean larger. Kuai looked down at Sean\u2019s feet and saw they had slid completely off the bed. He was now bigger than Kuai and still going. Kuai felt a violent thrust in the cleft of his chest. Sean\u2019s cock had been growing all this time, faster than the rest of his body. It was at least the size of a twenty ounce bottle, swelling bigger and bigger right before Kuai\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean thirsted for Kuai, his lust overpowering him, forcing him to shove his enormous cock into Kuai\u2019s chest. His muscles barely cupped Sean\u2019s dick as he thrust back and forth. His body continued to grow. He was well over seven feet tall, his growth not showing any signs of stopping. Sean\u2019s head banged into the headboard, but he didn\u2019t even notice. Before Kaui knew it, Sean lifted his boyfriend up with both hands and laid him on top of his thickening torso. Every muscle was so huge and hard. Kuai felt like he had been set atop an enormous mountain that was slowly moving and shifting apart. All of Sean\u2019s muscles were well beyond Kuai\u2019s now and still getting larger. They heard another thud. Sean\u2019s feet slammed into the far wall of the bedroom. He was well over nine feet now. Sean\u2019s cock thrust so high in the air, it looked like it could almost touch the ceiling. From Kuai\u2019s point of view, a lamp post was between his legs and dangerously close to his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean groaned more intensely and continued to violently hump the air. His whole body shook, making it difficult for Kuai to stay on. He held on to Sean\u2019s chest as tightly as he could. Between heavy pants, Sean grunted with a suddenly-menacing voice. \u201cGet\u2014on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kuai had a chance to act, an enormous hand scooped him up and held him over a foot above Sean\u2019s rippling, growing body. Kuai\u2019s heart raced, but now for a different reason. \u201cSean-- you\u2019re too big! I couldn\u2019t\u2014!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s eyes rolled back in his head. He uncomfortably tightened his grip around Kuai\u2019s waist. He held him even higher in the air. Kuai felt the enormous head of Sean\u2019s dick rubbing against his tiny butt. Pre-cum flowed freely from the tip, soaking Kuai\u2019s entire backside. Sean was going to do it. He was going to try and shove a light post down Kuai\u2019s tight asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai shook his head furiously. He tried to free himself, but Sean\u2019s growing fingers held him tighter and tighter in place. \u201cI never imagined any of this! What\u2019s happening!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai felt true panic. Sean\u2019s cock thrust into Kuai but was far too large to enter. That wasn\u2019t stopping Sean. He continued to thrust harder and harder. His body now completely filled the room. All of his muscles were now those of a god. He was the largest person on Earth and still growing, completely outside of Kuai\u2019s control. Kuai tried to imagine Sean back down to the size he had been before but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s voice was immense. His eyes were still rolled in the back of his head, but Kuai felt him looking at him. \u201cI thought this was what you wanted! Bigger\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s eyes rolled forward, \u201cIs\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014Better!\u201d Sean\u2019s face was suddenly replaced with Nick\u2019s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai screamed, but was hopelessly trapped in Nick\u2019s grip. His phone rang, and all of the lights went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai sat up in cold sweat, panting furiously. It took him a moment to focus his eyes and come to terms with his surroundings. Sean slept soundly next to him, sprawled out on his side of the bed and apparently the size Kuai had left him at in the afternoon. The digital clock\u2019s red numbers on the night stand read, \u201c3:45.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai\u2019s panting slowly subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of the dream flooded out of his mind over the next several minutes, leaving him only with the impression of fear and confusion he had felt at the end. Kuai looked over at his sleeping boyfriend once more and was glad to see him sleeping soundly. In fact, Sean\u2019s dream must have been a lot better than Kuai\u2019s, because a huge tent slowly grew straight up in the sheets above Sean\u2019s waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuai\u2019s nerves, finally calmed, allowed him to lay back now next to Sean. He gently gripped Sean\u2019s dick and felt just how hard it was. But fortunately, it was the same size he had left it at. Desiring a little additional comfort, Kaui imagined Sean a few inches taller, forcing his limbs to stretch across the bed. He snuggled in close, wrapped Sean\u2019s long arms around his tight muscles and fell back to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the big day. Christian hopped out of bed and threw his clothes on. He dressed stylishly, a grey shirt and grey jeans with his black beanie on his head, and headed downstairs. Today was his 15th birthday, and he was exstatic to start the day. No, he wasn't doing anything special today. What had him so thrilled was that his best friend, Bryce, had texted him the night before saying he had an amazing gift and couldn't wait to give it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Christian got to the bottom of the stairs, the doorbell rang. \"Christian, could you get that?\" his mom yelled from the kitchen. \"Sure thing, mom!\" Christian opened the doorand saw Bryce standing on the patio with a huge grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryce was a great friend the Christian, but they did have their differences. Bryce was 16, and towered over all other kids his age. He had shaggy brown hair and tan skin. He also sported an impressive phisique, but itwasn't noticable on account of Bryce always wearing colorful, yet baggy, clothes, which really showed off the artist that he was. WhenBryce hadcame out to Christian as being gay, Christian got excited only to find out that Bryce was really interested in another guy at their school, a tall red head named Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Christian opened the door, Bryce shoved a small box into his hands. \"Its something really special! Go on, open it!\" Bryce said, giggling excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian opened the box and  viewed its contents. Inside was a silver dragon curled into an \"o\" shape. Its tail wrapped around an amethyst stone, and there was a small loop with a sliver chain through it on the dragon's head. \"Wow! This is a really cool pendant, Bryce!\" Cheistian exclaimed. \"Yeah! I stopped by this little magic shop the othher day after I heard that they did custom made pendants. I had a design in mind, and they made it! How awesome is that? I still think its weird that a magic shop offered it out of all the other places that I looked, but hey.\" Bryce shrugged. \"I'm really glad you like it though. A lot of time went into that design.\" \"I bet. Well, come on it, make youself at home. I'll be back in a second, I've got some things to put away in my room.\" Bryce gave Christian a quick hug, much to Christian's delight, and headed into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian couldn't help but think to himself as he clasped to pendent around his neck. 'Why can't Bryce want me? I've wanted him for so long. I just wish that he was my boyfriend and that he would share his life witg me, and hold me in his arms out of love instead of friendship.' Christisn had thought and wished this many times before, and felt like nobody heard. He felt the pendant around his neck grow warm. It was metal, so Christian brushed it off as it just absorbing his body heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian went into his room and put away some boxes he had left out. The night before he had been looking through some older photos of him and Bryce from when they were in middle school. As he picked up a box, one photo fell. Out. He bent over to pick it up. It was a picture of him and Bryce that was taken after their school'sfootball game. Christian remembered that day, it wasthe day Bryce finally came out. Christian had come out a few weeks before, and remembered how crushed he was when Bryce had said who he was interested in. Looking at the picture now, Christian noticed something he hadn't before. Bryce appeared to be holding him tighter than before. Before, Christian remembered that the two were standing with their arms around each other's shoulders, but it was ovious now that Bryce appeared to be cuddling Christian in this photo now. Christian got little exited and wondered if his wish finally came true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian finished with the boxes and hurried downstairs, where Bryce was standing in the kitchen. \"Hey, your mom went out to get some cake mix and your brother left for the gym. Your mom said that she trusted you to be alone with me for a littlr while, so I guess I'm in charge!\" Bryce gave a mischeivious smile, walked over to Christian, and kissed him on the lips. Christian was surprised at first, then very excited as he kissed him back and wrapped his arms around Bryce's neck. His wish had come true! He guessed that it had to be the pendant,Bryce did say he got it from a magic shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Bryce stopped kissing Christian. \"I'm so happy we finally get a chance to be alone! Your mom is nice and all, but she would've never let us kiss in front of her. And your brother is a total homophobe. I really hate him. So what do you want to do?\" Bryce asked with a smile. 'So many things...' Christian thought, wondering what other wishes he could have granted.</span></div></div>",

Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, right? \"Ok, but you'll be joining me, right?\" Bryce asked, pouring his full lips. God, this boy was hot. \"Of course.\" Christian replied, his eyes roaming Bryce's body. Oh, he was definitely going to enjoy him. \"Don't keep me waiting for too long.\" Bryce said, trailing his finger down Christian's chest. He gave him a peck on his lips and walked into Christian's room.<br>\r\n    Christian stared after Bryce once he walked away. He snapped out of his trance. He would get a piece of Bryce once he finished experimenting with his new magical pendant. He'd start with something simple. A vase caught his attention. His mom was such a neat freak that wouldn't mind of he did some cleaning.<br>\r\n    I wish this room was cleaner, Christian thought. As soon as he opened his eyes, the room looked like five maids had been working on the room at the same time. The floors shined, all the magazines were stacked in one pile on the coffee table, and the vase was so clean Christian could see his reflection staring back at him. He smiled, satisfied with the pendant's work. Now it was time for Bryce.<br>\r\n    \"Why'd you keep waiting for so long?\" Bryce asked. \"I had some things to do,\" Christian said, walking closer to Bryce who was laying on Christian's bed. \"But now that I'm here, I was hoping you'd have a another present for me.\" Christian continued, falling into the bed. Instantly, Bryce's mouth was on Christian's. They made out for a few minutes, without a breath of air, before Christian made his next move. I wish would grow huge muscles Christian thought. He immediately saw the growth start, though it was more subtle than it had been in the living room.<br>\r\n    Christian's hand roamed Bryce's body, feelings his muscles get thicker and bigger with every breath he took. He had to roll on too of the growing hunk, since he was getting even heavier with each passing second. His short got tighter and tighter until it ripped right in half. Somehow, Bryce didn't manage to notice and continued making out with him. Though he was getting a bit dizzy from the oxygen deprivation.<br>\r\n    The next to go was his pants. The seams ripped, revealing his gorgeous tree truck legs. Bryce pulled back, panting heavily. He the then noticed the changes that had occurred. \"What the heck happened to me?\" Bryce asked, a bewildered expression on his face. We both examined his new hard body. His clothes were rags and got to appreciate his full pecs, his cobblestone and melon sized biceps.<br>\r\n    \"Oh, just a little advancing for you.\" Christian replied, grinning wickedly.</span></div></div>",

The primary focus of this story is on growth, specifically male growth. These guys can grow huge and have their way with everything around them, or age upward and go from boys to men. This is a male-focused story; while the pendant can be used by the guys to affect females, chapters that feature females using the pendant or that feature females growing bigger than or getting more powerful than the main male character will be modified or removed (females can, however, be supporting characters and/or romantic interests).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pendant can also change the world in other ways too. For example, its wearer could wish to become a king, to change species (anthro or non-anthro), or to be given super powers. Whatever the case, the wishes should be focused on making the wearer (and/or his friends) more powerful in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prefer: Giants (male), Muscle growth, bursting out of clothes, gay or bisexual guys, teens, tasteful nudity and sexuality, stomping around cities, super powers, furry transformation, character and plot development.<br>\r\nI allow: Other kinds of growth and transformation, light vore, violence, straight guys.<br>\r\nI dislike (and will delete or modify): heavy vore, scat, watersports, and other \"toilet\" functions, exceptionally poor grammar and spelling.<br>\r\nI reserve the right to change these criteria at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease try to write more than one or two sentences per chapter, and try to avoid simple \"choice\" chapters unless you are following up one of the choices with a longer chapter(s). Feel free to add custom main characters in the open slots, but if you do, please do not put JUST a character description without any actual story, as that post will either be deleted or modified, at my discretion. Also, please try to leave as many choices as possible.
