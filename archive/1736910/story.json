            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The 5:00 show<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim and I been comped tickets to a magic act off the strip.  Generally, we tried to stay in familiar territory among the main casino hotels but being Monday, most shows were dark and this was about the only thing sounding interesting\u2026and besides it was our anniversary and they were free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 years, man it goes fast.  It seems like yesterday we were standing in that church saying our vows.  6 years later, here we are, trying to rekindle the spark that started it all where it all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened and we all started taking our seats.  The arena was small and intimate, we chose to not sit too close to the stage, but still were able to get good seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed and out came a woman who must be one of the magician\u2019s assistants.  She was dressed in a black mini with red knee high boots and a short jacket with sequins.  Her hair looked red, but it could be the affect of the stage lighting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily, some music begins to play and in a blinding flash and smoke, what looks to be the magician appears on stage.  Pretty impressive entry, for what appears to be a very low budget show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe introduces himself as Max Von Crucial, and he is here to amaze us.  Yada yada I think and I start wondering if we are wasting our time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts the show with a few slight of hand tricks but what is impressive is the preparation he must have put into this performance because his attention is always on the audience.  Several time he made direct eye contact with me and I could tell also he spent a lot of time focusing his attention on other members of the audience as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the show, came the clich\u00e9 where he asks for volunteers from the audience.  Not surprising, only a few people actually raised their hands and out of that few, only a couple were selected.  He then started hand picking some of us from the audience, and I was not surprised that he walked our table and extended his hand.  I looked at my husband and he nodded approvingly and encouraged me to go on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn stage there were now, 4 of us, 2 women, and 2 men.  He lined us up and started in with a hypnotic rhyme that immediately calmed my nerves because I had stage fright.  To my left was a red headed woman I recognized from our hotel and next to her was her male friend.  She did not have a ring on so I assume there were not married.  To my right was a younger man who was clearly intoxicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial then walked behind us and stood behind the young man to my left.  I couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but suddenly there was a flash and the smell of ozone in the air.  I then heard the crowd clap loudly but for some reason I could not move, not even to turn my head.  It was a very anxious feeling and I started breathing heavily as to not black out from anxiety.  In through mouth, out through the nose I thought to myself just go with it, what could happen?  It\u2019s only a show, or so I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Von Crucial walk behind me and stop.  The next feeling I had was of the air conditioned room air against my naked body because somehow, that scoundrel had removed my clothing.  The PA system in the meantime had begun that rhythmic lullibye that seemed to have earlier calmed my fears.  It must have worked on the audience as well because my husband did not seem bothered that his wife was standing stark naked on a public stage.  The soothing lullaby continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood there for what seemed like an eternity while Von Crucial went off stage.  From my peripheral vision, I could see him talking to someone and based upon the gesturing that was going on, there seemed to be some disagreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn through mouth, out through the nose I continued to think as my legs began to grow tired from standing in one position for so long until I saw the two figures shake hands and Von Crucial came back on stage, stopping behind the red headed girl standing next to me.   Again I saw a flash of white light and smelled the now familiar smell of ozone. What I saw next was incredible.  Because of how we were lined up, I had a better view of what was going on to my right that to my left and what I saw both amazed and frightened me.  After the flash, the red headed girl, changed right before my eyes.  Her head seemed to collapse into its self, deflating like a pink balloon with the red locks of hair slipping off and falling to the floor like a wig.  Her head continued to deflate until it laid there upon her neck and slopped over onto her left shoulder.  In the folds of the balloon head I could see one of her eyes frantically looking for help.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial then grabbed the tip of the deflated head and pulled it upright, stretching it until it resembled an empty pink hot water bottle, complete with a eyes, nostrils, ears and  mouth.  Von Crucial stepped in front of her and placing his mouth over hers, he began to blow, which started the balloon head to inflate, well, like a balloon.  He stopped when it reached the size of a standard basketball.  He then pinched the lips shut and grabbing her by the nose, he and eventually tied her lips and nose into a knot thus keeping the balloon head inflated.  The flicked it with his middle finger and it sounded just like a rubber balloon and if it weren\u2019t attached to a girl\u2019s body and the two blinking eyes frantically darting about, you would think it was a clever child\u2019s toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the girl was levitated and he positioned her so she was facing up. His stage assistant then pointed some kind of remote control at her and she started to shrink, until she was no more than about 18 inches in length.  She then grabbed the girl out of the air and walked off stage with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the audience sat there, guffawing and applauding as if this were the best show they had ever seen.  Something about the music must be hypnotizing them because the illusion they think they are seeing I think is all too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Von Crucial then set his sites on the young male friend of the former redhead turned balloon head.  He picked up the red hair that had been his girlfriends and placed it on her friends head.  It seemed to fuse with his scalp, replacing his former black short hair with her luxurious set of read ringlets.  The audience applauded and the applause continued as Von Crucial raised his right hand and light emitted from his palm and surrounded the man.  Engulfed in the light, I could see his body start to ripple and shimmer as strange changes began to take hold of his body.  First, his arms started to shrink and were drawn into his shoulders where they were now completely smooth.  His chest was stripped of all of its hair and the small, undeveloped man nipples started to move outward and upward toward the smooth skin where his arms used to be.  The nipples migrated and stopped dead center on the empty arm sockets.  Von Crucial then raised his left arm and a pink light emitted from his palm and surrounded the young man.  Suddenly, from the empty arm sockets two swellings started to develop beneath the small nipples.  It was breasts, somehow Von Crucial was making two tear drop shaped female breasts with small male nipples grow in place of the young mans arms.  If I wasn\u2019t seeing it was wouldn\u2019t believe it.  Perhaps it\u2019s all a hallucination? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two breasts grew to about a C cup, the swelling stopped.  He then levitated the young man, and laying him horizontally, the assistant again zapped him with the remote control and shrunk him as she shrunk his girlfriend.  She stopped when he was nearly 12 inches in length and placing him on a small gurney wheeled him off stage.  I caught a look at his face and it was contorted, he was in obvious pain but no sound came from his silent lips even though I could tell if he could, he would be screaming his lungs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas I next I wondered?  I felt him walk behind me but I was relieved when he continued passed and stopped behind the man standing next to me on my right.  I could not see too much of what was going on because he was actually too far behind me for my peripheral vision to catch what was going on so I stood there, nervous, scared and very uncertain was what was happening and what may happen.  Was this all real?  Or is it just an illusion.  I caught the gaze of my husband as he too sat there.  Judging by the expression on his face he was either drunk or had been slipped a drug of some sort.  Heck, all of the audience I could see had the same, dumb, expression of a mixture of ecstasy and intoxication.  Whatever was happening was not going to be stopped, not by anyone in that audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted by a sudden movement to my right.  I glanced down to see the man next to me had been transformed.  In horror I tried to process exactly what I was seeing because from what I could tell is that the man from the waist down was now sporting two large breasts the size of bean bags, complete with huge nipples where what should have been, feet?  His penis and testicles where nestled in a patch of black pubic hair in his cleavage.  The effect was he was essentially balancing on the two large breasts, but not to well as he wobbled back and forth like a perverted blowup punching bag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant came out and did her duty but this time only shrinking the poor guy down to about 4 feet tall.  She wheeled him off the stage on a utilty cart.  I saw his face wince in pain as one of his foot/nipples became caught in the wheels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy god, I\u2019m next I thought.  I braced myself as he stopped behind me.  In through the mouth, out through the nose I thought as I tried in vane to run, to save myself.  I looked out at my husband, and pleaded with him with my eyes to do something.  He just gave me a thumbs up sign and applauded.  Oh God, help me I screamed mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a flash of red light engulfed me and when it cleared I had a tingly feeling on my face, just below my nose.  I wanted to scratch it but I was totally paralyzed and could only suffer in silence. I could also feel the tingly feeling in my butt crack.  What the heck happened to me I wondered, and as soon as it had started it stopped.  I saw the assistant come to my side and point the remote device at me.  Here it goes I thought, what next, where are we going?  Are we all restored off stage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, there was a burst of noise and confusion as men in uniforms stormed the stage.  The screamed for everyone to get down and you know I would have it I could have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PA system was disabled and with the lights now on, the audience started coming out of their trances.  They looked around disoriented, some looked at their watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI too suddenly found myself able to move.  I heard gun shots followed by a brilliant flash of light and then silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man, white in his mid to upper 40\u2019s stepped into my field of view and asked if I could hear him and if I could move.  I started to answer but was stopped when he yelled at another person in uniform to come and take me somewhere off stage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wrapped in a blanket and we moved to stage left and found a couch to sit on.  Sitting down is when I started to get the feeling that something was wrong, very wrong.  First of all, I was still concentrating on breathing in through the mouth and out through the nose.  When I sat down, I noticed that breathing through my mouth had become difficult, almost like someone had placed a heavy cloth over my mouth.  I reached up to move whatever was blocking my breathing and \u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.I heard muffled voices asking is she ok?  I recognized one of them as my husband but I couldn\u2019t recognize any of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019ll have to lie on her side for the time being, we\u2019re just not sure to what extent the transformation has affected her respiration.  We don\u2019t want to run the risk of suffocation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffocation? I wondered as I slowly opened my eyes.  They fluttered open and I could tell I was lying on my side on the couch.  On the couch, Oh my God I thought as it all started coming back.  Something was wrapped around my face, I reached up to feel what seemed like a handkerchief tied around my neck and pulled up over my cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn through the mouth, out through the nose I repeated mentally but stopped when I realized that if I had a handkerchief over my mouth then why couldn\u2019t I feel it on my lips?  I stuck out my tongue and felt nothing, which confused me because I could feel the cloth against my cheeks.  I licked my lips and immediately pulled my tongue back because beyond my lips, my tongue contacted more skin and\u2026stubble?  That doesn\u2019t make sense, I was almost as if my cheeks were being squashed together and what was up with the stubble?  I don\u2019t have a facial hair problem.   So I tried it again but this time I opened my mouth wide, or as wide as I could but found difficult and hard to part my lips much further than partway because of some sort of pressure being applied to my top and bottom lips.   Sticking my tongue out as far as I could I let out a yelp as someone or something was touching my butt.   I jumped up and in the process bit my tongue and bit it hard.   I reached up to instinctively to cover my mouth and was surprised again when I felt someone touch my butt hole.  I jerked my arm around to swat the offending jerk away and felt nothing.  I spun around and saw no one, no one that is except for my husband and the man in the nice suit looking at me with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What is going on I yelled\u2026well tried to.  I heard my voice but I wasn\u2019t in my head.  It was muffled, and my mouth didn\u2019t seem to work right.  I tried again, same result. The sound was coming from behind me.  I couldn\u2019t hear myself in my ears, the reverberations in my sinus, the vibration in in my throat was simply not there but I noticed this time that I felt something in my butt crack.  I tried again, what is going on??? My mouth felt fat, like my face had exploded.  In though the mouth, out through the nose I reminded myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy husband was by my side now.  He looked at me, he looked sad.  We made eye contact, he looked away.  What? I asked, what happened? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the suit said we need to talk.  I started to sit down and he stopped me.  I think it\u2019s better if we stand, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know of any other way to say this but you have been assaulted and the suspects got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssaulted?  I asked, being more forceful, a task that caused unnerving feelings starting from my lower abdomen extending down and centering just below my sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up a mirror and I looked at my reflection.  I looked the same, save for the red bandana covering my mouth.  I reached up and jerked it down and stared.  Dumbfounded, I looked at my reflection. My eyes were the same, as was my nose and cheeks.  What I was failing to comprehend was centered between my nose and my chin was an anus.  My anus.  It was pink and puckered and healthy and on my face.  Holy crap, on my face, my anus is on my face! It moved, it relaxed and puckered as I clenched and unclenched.    I suddenly beginning to realize why my voice was so wrong and, oh my god, my mouth, my mouth is in my butt crack.  I got woosey and sat down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn through the mouth\u2026.I tried to repeat but sitting on the couch I felt the rough fabric of the blanket wrapped around me press against my lips so I jumped right back up again, biting my tongue again in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss, we need to have you see one of our specialists.  We need to know to what lengths the transformation has gone so please come with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will have to stay here, he said to my husband and we walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting another blanket over my head, we walked outside.  In walking I could feel my butt cheeks rub agaist my lips\u2026.left\u2026right\u2026left\u2026.right.  Oh god I\u2019m going insane I thought.  Walking also made breathing difficult because as my thighs rubbed together, my lips would be forced closed so I tried as much as possible to breathe through my nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were outside, I could tell because we left the air conditioned sanctuary of the concert hall but we stopped outside and heard him knock on a door.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she is he said, take care of her.  She\u2019s one valuable witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was led up some stairs, the floor felt unstable so I believe I was in an RV and it was confirmed when a voice said I could remove my head cover now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019m a doctor, the male voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly pulled the towel from my head and looked down at my feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he said, handing me a surgical mask.  You can wear this, and then no one will ever know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed the mask over my nose and pulled the elastic over my head and looked up.  The doctor was young but not too young.  I was going to be dammed if Doodie Houser was going to give me an examination in my humiliated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome, sit here on the examination table.  He said pointing to a standard examination table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down on the table and he said he needs to do a pelvic exam and motioned to the two stirrups on either side of the table.  Great, all this and a gyno exam I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually nice to be in the stirrups because for the first time since the show, my mouth wasn\u2019t feeling it was as being smooshed between my butt cheeks.  I was not going to spend the rest of my life in stirrups however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor started by asking me some questions.  I told him how old I was and that we were at the show and I don\u2019t recall much else except I ended up like this and pointed to my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think he was surprised at how well I could speak.  I felt him touch the area around my lips and he said it looks as if most of the facial muscles that control the mouth were transferred down there as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay Ah he said.  I opened my mouth and I felt him prod around in there with a tongue depressor.  All your teeth are ok, your tongue seems healthy and over oral\u2026 health appears excellent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did a pelvic exam and proclaimed that my gynecological health was also normal but without xray\u2019s he couldn\u2019t be totally sure about any other issues other than my physical alterations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want to see? He asked and grabbed a mirror.  I shrugged and nodded and he placed a mirror down between my legs and I said up slightly.  It had been years since had even looked at my vagina in a mirror, but it looked normal.  It\u2019s outer lips ringed with dark blonde pubic hair and down further past the peritoneum the corner of my mouth began with it\u2019s lipstick covered lips.  It was sideways, meaning my mouth ran vertical with my butt crack which explains the smooshed feeling I was having.  I opened my mouth, and sure enough if it had been on my face it would look normal but looking at it now it was strange and wrong.  I stuck my tongue out and licked my lips.  Wow is all I could say and as I watched my lips mouth the word wow, I felt like laughing and crying.  What am I going to do?  How am I going to eat?  Is this my existence for the rest of my life?  I stuck my tongue out further, it felt normal.  I ran it around my mouth and felt the stubble of my inner thigh and tiny hairs that were in my butt crack.  I\u2019m going to need a wax job I thought as it all became too much to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to examine your face the doctor said, interrupting my moment.   I reluctantly let him pull the mask from my face.  I tried to look away, ashamed at what I must look like.  I closed my eyes as he touched the area surrounding my anus.  I felt his gloved hand probing my cheeks and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust relax he said right before he slipped a lubricated finger into my anus.  The sensations were bizarre.  I could feel his finger in the butt hole, probing but I could also feel the rest of his hand on my chin and nose.  Other sensations were hitting me as well.  When he inserted his finger I could hear the slurping sound as his lubricated finger slid into my anus.  I could smell the latex of his glove mixing with the subtle odor of  KY jelly.  I wanted to vomit.  I felt and heard his finger slide out of my anus.  I instinctively clenched my butthole, marveling at the new sensations I had in my face as my cheeks were sucked in, almost like I was puckering up to kiss someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you go, as he handed me a handy wipe to remove the excess lubricant.  For the moment I had been breathing through my mouth but I slipped and took a whiff, which was a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixed odor of latex, KY and feces wafted into my nose and my stomach rebelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor, sensing I was going to vomit placed a garbage can between my legs, just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlahhhhhhhh the first wave hit, and I tasted lunch as it passed out my mouth and into the can.  I took a breath and heaved again, this time straining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n the second wave emerged but this time my mouth was slightly closed so some of it sprayed against my inner thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI strained again, a dry heave, which produced something I was not nor could not be ready for.  Out of my anus came an explosion of gas and particulate made up of poop and residual KY jelly.  Oh God, I saw it, I heard it, I felt it, I saw it and I smelt it. I farted and it was right under my nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heaved again.  Oh God I screamed aloud why me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEND PART 1<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After 12 years as a beat cop in one of the nation\u2019s most violent cities, he had grown accustom to murder, rape and other depravities, that is until about 5 years ago working a missing person\u2019s case he stumbled across the works of Max Von Crucial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman, 28 and her boyfriend had hired Von Crucial out of the yellow pages to perform for a mutual friend at a birthday celebration.  Nobody knows what happened to the other 12 guests at the party, their cases are still open, open but cold.  The young man and woman however, had managed to hide in a closet during the show.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe took their statements and initially, had considered them to be suspects.  It was all too far fetched but they both had the same story, with too much detail to be have been contrived.  Either these two were the world\u2019s best liars, or they were telling the truth.  They both we able to describe detail by detail how the guest of honor, a young woman named Debbie Fields had been hypnotized and then essentially dismantled during the magic act. They described in detail how instead of reconstructing the girl and ending the illusion, Von Crucial mixed her parts in ways that were impossible.  Her hands and feet were switched, as was her hips replaced facing the wrong way, so that her buttocks faced forward along with her upper torso. They explained in detail how the assistant shot the girl with a beam of light and saw her shrink to the size of a small child\u2019s doll and then put into a glass container and taken to another room.   When they suspected something was very wrong with the show, the young man called 911 but when the police arrived, Von Crucial and his assistant used the beam of light to shrink the remaining people at the party to the size of dolls and herded them into crates.  Peering through a crack in the door, the young man saw how they then sealed the crates and slipped through a large white disk, stopping only to make eye contact with the young man and winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe took the two into custody and after testimony by two officers who had arrived to see the suspect and his assistant disappear into the white disk we no longer suspected them, but we did place them into protective custody while we started re-examining some cold missing persons cases going back 5 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Cindy were a cute couple, we set them up with new id\u2019s and got them into one of our safe houses were have in one of the better neighborhoods.  The good news was they could id Von Crucial, the bad news, it turns out Von Crucial does not like to leave loose ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had to go to the tape to get the full story of what happened and the sad and improbable ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two months of being in the program, John felt confident that the monster had moved on and he and Cindy were safe, or as safe as they could be.  They had new identities now, he now goes by the name of James and Cindy, now goes by Sherry and oh yeah, they\u2019re married now.  John smiled as he thought about how this bizarre chain of events had resulted in their marriage.   But still, he couldn\u2019t get that cold icy stare out of his mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after returning from the gym, John heard a sound and felt a cool chill in the air of their suburban ranch home.  Spinning, he came fact to face to the man who had been haunting his nightmares for the past two months.  Von Crucial smiled as he pointed at John which surprisingly made him feel suddenly at ease <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think you would get away did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was frozen.  He felt no fear but was fully aware of what was happening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cindy came the room from the garage with an armload of groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial pointed a finger at her and the groceries fell to the ground, an orange rolled across the floor and stopped at Von Crucial\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, stand by your beloved\u201d Von Crucial said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy obeyed, and stood at his side facing Von Crucial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two have caused me some frustration\u201d he said.  \u201cThis young detective you are working with, he is let\u2019s say causing me some financial troubles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy, like John felt no fear but being fully conscious of the situation had a growing sense of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry if I\u2019m not much for chit chat, but in my business, time is money\u201d Von Crucial said.  \u201cWhat am I going to do with you two?  Your friends brought me a pretty penny and you do come from the same lot, albeit a few weeks delayed.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem I have is because of the delay I had one order canceled so, for one of you, this is your lucky day or as lucky as it can get anyway!\u201d and he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was trying to understand what he was talking about.  It was almost as if he considered them to be a commodity, was the whole story behind this some sort of human trafficking scam?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of\u201d Von Crucial said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy looked surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you didn\u2019t think I could read minds too?\u201d Von Crucial said and laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of the niceties\u201d he said, his mood changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at John and John felt his clothes disappear, the cool air conditioned air hitting his bare chest and backside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial then pointed at Cindy and she too felt her clothes disappear.  He stood there for a moment and then began a soft chant.  John felt his face go numb and momentarily he had feeling of vertigo as his point of view shifted slightly.  He felt the same numb feeling in his groin as he felt without pain the sense of skin being pulled and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing, Von Crucial then focused on Cindy.  She too felt her face go numb but not before she felt a tingling in her mouth and the same numbness in her crotch and groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Von Crucial stopped his soft chanting and smiling he commanded the two to turn and face each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clike I said,  I think for either of you this as lucky as you can get.\u201d He said and started laughing louder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy felt whatever invisible bonds loosen somewhat as she looked at her husband.  She was horrified to see that his face had been altered.  His nose and eyes had been shifted up on his face slightly and there was now what looked like an anus just below his nose.  Equally as impossible there was now a vagina, with its plump outer lips pulsing in and out as John appeared to struggle to breath.  Below the vagina was blonde pubic hair on his chin, neatly trimmed into an inverted V, and if it were not for the altered anatomy on his face it would appear to be a regular goatee.  Cindy tried to scream as she looked closer to the area just under his chin at what looked to be a tattoo on the pale, smooth skin just below where the pubic hair ended just above his Adam\u2019s apple.  She looked again, and again she was shocked to recognize the quarter dollar sized tattoo, it was of a red heart and it had Cindy Lou written below it.   She screamed a garbled scream as she realized  it was her vagina, right down to the blonde pubic hair and tattoo she got when she was 16 on her boyfriends face.  She screamed again when she also realized that if it was her vagina it was also probable that her anus was also on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to find words to protest but in doing so, she found it was hard to talk.  It was as if her tongue was swollen and it was hard to control.  She opened her mouth to speak and was again horrified to feel what protruded out from her lips as she closed her mouth around what should have been her tongue.  She quickly pulled it back into her mouth and as it slid in between her lips she noticed how it felt as it did so.  It was almost as if the tip was swollen, but it was also very sensitive a feeling that was somehow familiar but defiantly foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was watching this all in horror, he could see Cindy was reacting to something, something that was upsetting her immensely.   He too felt the invisible bonds release a little and the numbness slowly dissipated from his face.  The feeling wasn\u2019t right though, the way the air felt on his face just didn\u2019t feel right.  For one thing, breathing in and out of his mouth was sending strange sensations through his face as air escaped through his lips which felt swollen.  Exploring his mouth with his tongue he realized whatever this guy did to him he took his teeth for one thing.  His tongue poked around his toothless cavity, it was all soft, no palate no gums, just soft warm skin and very strange sensations, almost pleasant\u2026almost like\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Cindy and he felt his knees go weak as she opened her mouth and out came a penis, with it\u2019s round bulbous head from between her red lipstick colored lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead\u201d Von Crucial said reach for it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn didn\u2019t know how but he instinctively reached for his crotch, only find smooth skin where his penis should have been.  Below that, he was somewhat relieved to feel his familiar hairy ball sack, but it was a bitter sweet relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he said, or tried to say.  \u201cUngahha hghha hahh ha\u201d is what Von Crucial and Cindy heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn reached up to his throat. \u201c Uhgnna \u201c he again tried to speak.  His hand slid up his throat and he stopped when he came to the patch of pubic hair making up his \u201cgoatee\u201d.  It had been years since he had had any facial hair, but even then it had felt different than what was currently on his face.  Where his beard had been course, this was lighter feeling, almost whispy in nature, even the skin on his face through the hair felt softer to the touch.  His hand slid up and over his chin, making contact with the plump outer lips of Cindy\u2019s vagina.  His jerked his hand away in shock.  He made eye contact with Cindy, her eyes were almost full of tears.  He slowly put his hand back to his mouth, or atleast to where his mouth should have been.  No wonder his tongue was sending back mixed signals.   He had a God Damn vagina for a mouth now.  It\u2019s vertical slit taking up the lower part of his face.  He felt around, he felt the outer lips and how if he tried real hard he could use his facial muscles to open it slightly, just enough to get his tongue out.  Keeping his hand over it, he let his tongue explore the alien lips.  He pulled his tongue back into his \u201cmouth\u201d and marveled at the strange sensations as he felt it slide across both the plump outer lips and the thinner but more sensitive second set that resided just inside of his new mouth.   He looked at Cindy and she was looking at him.  He tried to ignore the strange sensations emitting from his new mouth as he slowly slid his hand further uphis face.  He felt the at the top of the vagina as the vaginal lips gave way to smooth skin, and was shocked again when his finger slid over another opening, this time it was small and tight and round and as he gently poked it with a finger tip, the sensation that was returned confirmed to him that he not only had a vagina on his face, he also had an anus just below his nose.  A subtle sniff of his finger confirmed what his mind was still unable to comprehend.  The musky mix of female scent and butthole was the last thing he remembered as he slipped into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tape caught the rest.  On it we could see Von Crucial use his magic beam to shrink John and his assistant then appeared to take him away.  He motioned to Cindy and she became rigid and her body began to shimmer.  Slowly she shrank, smaller and smaller until she was about 6 inches tall.  He then placed a small disk on her head and then like some kind of special effects her mouth opened and kept of opening.  Wider and wider her mouth opened until the penis that was her tongue stuck out, almost erect.  Her body molded itself into a formless cylinder and her teeth dissolved into nothing.  After a few moments where the former Cindy stood, now was an 6 inch penis.  Von Crucial bent down and placed a card underneath it, almost as if it was a paperweight and then he looked at the surveillance camera that had been recording the events and smiled.  Suddenly a bright light caused the film to become over exposed and the recording stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Smith was the first on the scene and after nobody answered the door and with both vehicles in the driveway he became suspicious and forced his way in and called for backup.  Nothing was out of the ordinary that is except for the groceries on the kitchen floor that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective James arrived as soon as he could.  The two witnesses were nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s check the tape\u201d he said, maybe there is something on there to go on.  Agent Smith went into the laundry room to playback the day\u2019s recording while Detective James looked closely at the fallen groceries.  There among the paper towels was something out of the ordinary.  Putting on his latex gloves he carefully moved one of the rolls and stepped back.  There on the floor was what at first glance looked to be a sex toy, a dildo.  What caused him to step back was that it moved.  Using a pair of salad tongs, he carefully picked it up, to his shock it moved again, and fell to the floor making soft slap against the hardwood floor.  This time, using the tongs and a dustpan, he carefully picked it up again and laid it on the kitchen counter.  Looking closely, it moved, almost as if it were breathing??? Rolling it over, he could see what looked like two very small holes on the underside of the \u201chead\u201d of the penis and below those, what could almost be a mouth.  In fact it was mouth with lips and everything.  Rolling it over again, he stepped back, were those eyes?  Looking again in shock, he could see two blue human looking eyes staring up at him from just behind the head of the penis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlink if you understand\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes blinked franticly darting back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective, you need to see this it\u2019s unbelieveable\u201d agent Smith said coming into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry me\u201d Detective James said<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Awakenings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you take my wife?\u201d Jim Tome asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there feeling helpless among the activities going on around him.  He had just finished giving a statement to detective Jon James and now he wanted to see his wife.  It had been about an hour since the detective hustled her away for a medical examination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you, we took her to see our specialist.  You see, your wife is very lucky to have survived this assault, normally we don\u2019t catch up to Crucial in time and it\u2019s typical that his victims either vanish completely or in other cases, they perish due to the severity of the transformation.  On very few occasions someone like your wife survives this attack, your wife is a vital witness and her safety and well being is a top priority to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to know that she is ok\u201d Jim said.  \u201cI need to see her\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in time\u201d the detective said \u201cbut for now, please be patient and understand that we are doing this in hers as well as your best interest.  Please excuse me, I have to interview a few more witnesses.  Make your self comfortable and someone will call on you when we know more.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he turned on his heal and walked back toward the stage area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanice?  Hello?\u201d  She heard a man\u2019s voice say.  Squinting, she slowly opened her eyes to see a concerned, unfamiliar but not strange face looking at her with concerned eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste of vomit stung her tongue and she fought off nausea as she came more and more alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is my husband?\u201d she asked.  For a moment she had forgotten what had happened, blocked it out as some kind of nightmare but the strange vibrations in her lower abdomen as she spoke reminded her of the current situation.  She looked down at her body, thankfully covered with a cotton blanket.  She shuddered to think what was down there, and what her face had been altered as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is waiting outside\u201d the male voice responded.  \u201cWould you like me show him in?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice paused before answering.  She felt humiliated and on one hand was mortified to have her husband see her like this.  She reached up and felt the bands of the surgical mask that covered her lower face below her nose but stopped there.  She didn\u2019t want to touch what was beneath it as if touching it suddenly made it all real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead\u201d she said, softly as if not to cause the unnerving vibrations in her lower belly, certainly caused by the reconfiguration of her larynx and throat.  She could even feel the breath warm against her inner thigh as she spoke.  \u201cOh God\u201d she thought and started to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy\u201d the doctor said \u201cTake it slow, your diaphragm is working double time to bring air into and out of your lungs.  When you feel anxiety you should focus on breathing only from one or the other, be it your nose or your mouth until you get better coordinated with your new anatomy.\u201d  He continued as he moved to the door and whispering to one of the nurses \u201cGo find Mr. Tome\u201d and she walked out of the trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim wasn\u2019t sure what to expect as he stepped into the trailer.  Even though it had only been a few short hours since the assault and he had seen first had already what Von Crucial had done, he still wasn\u2019t prepared for what was going to encounter when he walked into that trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously he stepped into the doorway and he saw an older gentleman standing beside an examination table that was facing away from the doorway.  He recognized the woman as his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJim come over here\u201d the doctor said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the examination table and he saw his wife.  She was wearing a surgical mask that covered her face below the nose and her body was covered with a baby blue blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Sweetie\u201d he said sheepishly and grabbed her hand to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed his hand but said nothing.  She looked at him with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre\u2026.are you ok?\u201d he asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded her head and then started shaking it side to side and began sobbing.  Her eyes welled up with tears and her nose began to run.  She sniffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim thought he could hear a sobbing sound come from further down the table and beneath the blanket.  He remembered the horror as he awoke from the trance when the police busted the show and saw clearly what Von Crucial had done to his bride on stage.  \u201cSurely it had been an illusion\u201d he first thought as he looked closely at her face on stage and how where her mouth had been was what looked to be a puckered, pink anus.  Later, it wasn\u2019t until she had passed out on the couch that he was able to see the full extent of the transformation.  Lying on the couch naked and the fetal position, he could see protruding out of her butt crack the red lips of a mouth\u2026her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down to where her crotch would be he thought again of what lies under the blanket.  Looking back at her face, he thought again of what lies under the surgical mask.  He felt sick.  His wife had been horribly disfigured.  \u201cIs this a life worth living?\u201d he asked himself and then immediately felt ashamed and the thought.  This was his wife, loved her and she needs him more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever is necessary\u201d he said looking at her and then leaning over to embrace her.  He kissed her softly on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor began to explain what physical changes had been made to her anatomy.  He explained that through x-ray he has been able to determine that the magic had inverted her upper and lower GI so that the lower intestine and colon now ran up thought her chest and neck connecting to the rectum and anus that now consisted of lower portion of her face above the chin and below the nostril.  The upper GI on the other hand now consisted of the mouth, tongue and throat complex, complete with bronchial and larynx complex ran inverted from below the pelvis, connecting to the stomach below the diaphragm which had by his best guess been divided into two halves.  The top half controlled respiration through the nose and the bottom half controlled respiration from the mouth/throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn all, barring unforeseen injury or illness I think you should live a normal life expectancy for a woman of your age and overall health profile.\u201d  He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis relieved both Jim and Janice but once again they were faced with the fact that their lives had now been greatly altered, especially Janice\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Jim and finding the courage to speak, softly she said \u201cwhat are we going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know he said, we can move, we can move anywhere and start over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t if I were you.\u201d A voice said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Jim saw detective James come into the small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Von Crucial knows who you are, and he won\u2019t stop at nothing until he gets his merchandise\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMerchandise?\u201d Jim asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding Jim a business card he said \u201cVon Crucial is in the human trafficking business\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim looked at the business card.  It was a strange purplish iridescent color.  In bold letters it read Crucial Wholesale\u2026the #1 source for bio art in the galaxy.  Below that, was some markings that looked Arabic but Jim didn\u2019t know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Recounting the case involving John and Cindy Prince and how Von Crucial had found them in their safe house he let Jim and Janice know that they both, as well as all of the people in the audience that afternoon were in grave danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell where is she?\u201d  Janice asked  \u201cWhere is Cindy now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have her well protected\u201d the doctor said \u201cWe have discovered, the hard way unfortunately that Von Crucial maintains a phsycic link to his victims.  That is how it was so easy for him to find the Princes, even after we gave them new identities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe think we can mask the link however\u201d Detective James said.  \u201cAfter we raided a show similar to the one today we found a box containing some pendants.  One of our specialists in the occult says they are ancient charms thought by the Inca to bring good luck.  How or why Von Crucial had them we don\u2019t know but we can guess that he has a private collection antiquities, these just happened to be lost but we just don\u2019t know.   Mrs. Prince has one that we keep with her at all times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026she\u2019s a\u2026how?\u201d Jim asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she is quit limited in her movement but with some effort she can roll onto her side if she needs to.  Mostly she just lies in her quarters reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReading?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, she can read quite well.  One of her requests has been for books on the occult.  She is quite alert and can communicate with a special microphone we have in her quarters that amplifies and re modulates sound.  Her vocal cords were so transformed that without the special amplification, her voice to us was only faint squeaks.  She uses a small sensor that she can manipulate with her tongue to surf the web or read digital books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to meet her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know\u201d Jim said not sure if he was up to visiting with a disembodied penis, not right now anyway.  He looked as Janice and the both nodded in agreement that now was not the time.  Janice did stop to think that it could be worse.  Perhaps all in all that what happened to her isn\u2019t quite so bad.  She couldn\u2019t imaging what that poor woman was going through, but then again before today she couldn\u2019t have imagined what it would be like to have her mouth and anus reversed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then, I think we should get you two to the campus.  Von Crucial will certainly be out to recoup this loss.  He is the worst possible combination of perversion and greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut these on.  We need to get you two to the campus ASAP.\u201d  Detective James as he handed them each a necklace that had green pendants on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need some clothes\u201d Janice suddenly realized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut these on\u201d the detective said handing her some nurses scrubs.  She pulled the top over her head, carefull not to knock the surgical mask off.  \u201cumm can I get a little help here?\u201d she asked pointing to her legs locked into the cuffs of the stirrups.  Jim grabbed her ankle and helped her out of the right stirrup and walked around the end of the table to help with the other leg.  He stole a glance at her crotch as he walked by.  In the shadow he could barely make out her mouth, with it\u2019s thin upper or right lip and slightly more thik left or what was the bottom lip.  He took a deep breath and looking up he saw that Janice had caught him looking.  He smiled, careful not to cause her any more distress.  Her eyes squinted slightly and he thought he saw her mouth in the shadow of her inner thighs curve and form somewhat of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her other leg was down, Janice noticed how with her legs together her mouth once again felt smooshed, like when someone grabs and pinches your cheeks together.  Sadly, she now knows that that feeling was caused by a whole different set of cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk a little privacy please\u201d she said.  It was muffled but the guys understood and made way back into the staging area.  Totally removing the blanked she drew her knees up toward her chest and started to pull on the bottoms that the doctor had given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to worry about underwear later\u201d she thought and for a moment began to ponder what exactly she would do in that department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrusting her hips up, she pulled the pants all the way and stood up.  Her mouth was pressed against the plastic of the seat as she sat up and pivoted off of the table.  It kind of hurt as she made a move to rub her lip with her hand, stopping as it made contact with the surgical mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhantom pains are how the doctor described it.  Her mind still associates her mouth, lips and tongue with her face so by reflex, when she wanted to touch her lips, she instinctively searched for them where her mind said they should be.  Reaching down the front of her trousers, she found that she needed to spread her legs slightly in order to touch her lips in their new location just behind her vagina from the front.   Trying a different approach, she placed one leg up on the step stool and reached back and under her thigh until she made contact with her mouth.  This proved easier and with her right hand she traced around the fatter lower or right lip now and pinched it.  It felt the same both to the touch and to be touched.  She stuck her tongue out and licked her thumb.  It was salty and by all intents and purposes it felt and tasted normal.  She didn\u2019t want to do any more exploration with her tongue however as she remembered the shock of feeling the tiny hairs and stubble that now surrounded her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her hand out from inside her pants she slid on some sandals the doctor had provided and adjusting the straps on the surgical mask and taking a deep breath through her nose she stepped out of the trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt self conscious as she walked toward where her husband was standing talking to the detective and the doctor.  It felt as if everyone was seeing right through the mask and was staring at her anus on her face.  She felt mortified.  \u201cThey know\u201d she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe van will take you to a safer place\u201d the detective said as he motioned to a white limo van parked outside the main doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor accompanied them to the van.  Jim entered and then turned to help Janice into the seat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a cripple\u201d she said and sat down but let out a yelp as she stood right back up.  Looking down at the seat the shiny metal of the seatbelt reflected the summer sun.  She reached down into her pants and touched her lip.  Bringing her hand up to her face she saw a smudge of blood on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cut my lip\u201d I heard her say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful sweetie\u201d I said and moved the seatbelt out of her.  She sat down and she immediately squirmed a bit and then parted her legs slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to breath\u201d she said but with her mouth smashed up against the car seat all Jim heard was a muffled \u201cIffs jhar oo hreafff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIffs jhar ooo hreafff\u201d she said again but a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cohh fjuh ieh\u201d he heard her say as she crossed her arms and looked sadly out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over to hold her hand and she pulled it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had all but given up on trying to breath out of her mouth about 10 minutes into the trip.  The plastic seat proved to be an indomitable obstacle in getting air in and out of her mouth and the harder she tried the more she should sounds coming from that part of her body.   \u201cGod, he thinks I\u2019m farting\u201d she thought as one particular obnoxious noise caused by her breath breaking the seal between her lips and the plastic seat made a squeak.   That thought made consider again her predicament.  What if she has to pass gas and oh God, what if she has to poop?  It\u2019s going to happen sooner or later.  How will she do this?  Her thoughts go back to college when her friends would help each other by holding their hair back and out of the toilet when either of them had had too much to drink.  She thought of herself now, kneeling in front of a toilet so she could relieve herself one way but having to sit down as usual to relieve herself when she had to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts made her start to cry.  What kind of life is she going to live and how will her husband deal with this?  What is going to happen to their sex life when a simple kiss is now not such a simple kiss?   Oral sex had never been something she was fond of because of insecurities about her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to in the trailer how he had kissed her on the forehead.  Was he so disgusted at what was on her face that he would not ever kiss her on the cheek for fear of being too close to her anus?  She did have to admit that through their entire life together; anal anything was a no go for him.    Was this going to drive them apart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van pulled in to a courtyard surrounded on 3 sides by a small wall and the other a bank of glass doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here\u201d the doctor said as the driver opened the door and offered Janice a hand out of the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding out in the warm desert air, Janice noticed how having your mouth in your butt crack was not a good thing in a hot van on plastic seats as she felt how her lips where wet with sweat.  Perhaps having underwear would help somewhat but that all remains to be seen.  For now, she just swallowed hard and then licked the salty wetness from her lips.  She spread her legs slightly and felt  the breeze that passed through the cotton scrubs evaporate some of the icky wetness.  It was kind of refreshing in a very weird sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the glass doors and were led to what they called a dorm room but it had all the amenities of a luxury condo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the driver brought some supplies in she decided it was time to use the bathroom.  For the last 20 minutes she had been tying to put it out of her mind but nature was defiantly calling and she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.  The last thing she wanted was for someone to know that she was using the toilet so when nobody was looking she snuck into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the toilet she stood there for a few moments building up courage to do what needed to be done and also to guage what had to be done.  She didn\u2019t really feel that she needed to poop so she was confident that all she needed to do was sit down and pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after not being able to put it off any longer she pulled down her scrubs and sat down.  Almost immediately her bladder let lose with a spray of urine.  She focused on keeping her mouth shut tight and stared up at the ceiling, not wanting to imagine what is going on down there.  How disgusting is it to think that just a few inches from where the urine was coming out was her mouth.  A couple of times she felt as if she needed to pass gas but based upon her experience with the doctor, she tried very hard not to let that happen.  Luckily, she got by for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was over and she used almost an entire roll of toiled paper wiping every square inch of skin she could reach and if that wasn\u2019t enough she used a face cloth with soapy water to wipe around her mouth even more before she pulled up her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror she stared into her own eyes.   Blocking the surgical mask with the palm of her hand she imagined that nothing had happened and all was normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting brave, she pulled the mask down.  Slowly it slid down off of her chin, she closed her eyes as she felt it pass over her anus and off her face.  She placed her hand over it and opened her eyes.  That was better, with the mask gone it was easier to pretend nothing had happened.  She stared and tried to will her self back to normal, thinking if she believed that nothing was wrong then everything would have to be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her hand and it was still there.  She leaned closer to the mirror and noticed how her skin closest to the anus was slightly darker that the skin on her face and looking yet closer she could see little hairs in the darker area.  She reached up and touched the skin around the anus.  Again, phantom feelings conflicted with what her eyes and fingers were telling her and what her brain knew or thought it knew.  If she closed her eyes she would had sworn she was reaching around and touching her butt, but in opening her eyes, she still struggled to register that those feelings were coming not from her butt but from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she pulled the mask back up over her chin.  She washed her hands for what seemed like an eternity and walked out to meet her husband.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wrapped a towel around her waist and walked out into the bedroom and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial smiled as he looked at his prey.  \u201cI see you have landed on your feet Janice.\u201d  And with a wave of his hand her expression went blank and she stood rigid, transfixed completely naked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to where she stood, and examined her top to bottom as if admiring his work.  Reaching up he probed around her anus.  If she could, she would have screamed but his magic had practically paralyzed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnjiea, tell our friend in Tucson that it looks like we\u2019ll have her order delivered shortly.  I have one more custom modification to Work Order 42225-4 before it\u2019s ready to ship\u201d he said telepathically <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sir.  Are you ready to transport?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me 5 minutes\u2026 and can you give me the specs for Work Order 42225-8?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment while I query the database\u2026ok\u2026it\u2019s the standard TX4RM-A.  Will you be transporting that as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStandby\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith is hand he brushed Janice\u2019s breasts and they began to shrink.  Like deflating balloons they lost their shape and hung as empty sacks against her chest and upper stomach, nipples erect in the cool air pointing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInitiating portal\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light flashed and in the middle of the room a large oval two-dimensional disk appeared standing nearly 6 ft tall and 4 ft wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice\u2019s body was levitated and adjusted into a horizontal position, and almost as if it were on a gurney, her empty breasts hanging off the side of her torso,  it moved feet first into the portal and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim had been concerned about Janice, and even though he didn\u2019t want to think about what was happening in there, she was still his wife, and he had genuine concerns about her health and state of mind.  However the who anus/face thing was starting to creep him out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to the door and knocked softly before turning the knob and walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial turned to face the door as it opened and smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like we have a TX4RM-A in inventory after all\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I contact our customer?\u201d Anjiea said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, our friend in Cairo may also be interested as well\u2026let him know we just received shipment\u201d  he replied as he contemplated a bidding war between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim entered and at first it didn\u2019t register what he was seeing but before he could react Von Crucial already had him.  With a wave, Jim froze, his face locked into a wide eyed, open mouthed expression of surprise and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial waved his hand again and Jim\u2019s clothes vanished, leaving him stark naked in the doorway except for the talisman Detective James had given him.  Zombie like, he then took a few steps forward to where Von Crucial was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial reached up and jerked the talisman from Jim\u2019s neck and smiled, as he knew now who this new stranger was as their psychic link was once again reinstated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you enjoy the show Mr. Tome?\u201d Max said in a bemusing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim could not answer, but if he could have he would have a few choice words for the man who did such monstrous things to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be just fine Mr. Tome.  My collectors are very serious about their artwork.  You can be assured she\u2019ll be well taken care of.  As for you, after a few modifications I should be able to have you prepped and delivered promptly, to the highest bidder of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnjiea, tell our friends bidding starts at 50,000.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first think he did was wave his hand and all of Jim\u2019s bodily hair disappeared so that he was as fresh and smooth as a newborn\u2026except for the hair on his head which was left untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping behind Jim, Von Crucial then started murmuring in a foreign language and Jim felt his body begin to tingle and vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial placed his hand on Jim\u2019s head and pushed down with gentle but firm pressure.  Jim was helpless as he saw the room grow around him and when his point of view stopped, he felt child like as the dresser and doorways now towered above him.  He felt two hands grab each side of his head and suddenly twist clockwise and in a quick moment Jim was now looking directly at Max Von Crucial\u2019s belt buckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax stepped back for a better look at his work.  The alterations had resulted in a very odd site.  Jim\u2019s entire torso had either been removed or compressed so that all his body was comprised of was a head and shoulders resting directly atop a set of hips and legs.  The final alteration and most visually shocking was that his head had been turned 180 so that he faced backward, over his buttocks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Crucial frowned as he looked at he dimpled, pale flesh.  \u201cThis won\u2019t do at all\u201d he thought and with a wave, Jim\u2019s body shimmered and was transformed again.  What was left of his body changed shape and his skin softened and darkened slightly.  The hips and buttocks became more rounder, firmer and defiantly feminine, as did the legs and around the front, his male genitals now were replaced with the naked bald cleft of female genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, much better.\u201d Von Crucial said aloud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnjiea, do we have any bids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like communications are breaking up, something is interefereing with the feed\" Anijea responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'this wont do at all\" Max said looking pitifully down at the miniscule form of the former jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, alarms sounded followed by voices outside the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective Jon James had just arrived back in the compound from the failed attempt to apprehend Von Crucial at the old warehouse.  The mission had been a failure and he even lost two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, sensors are picking up irregular continuum modulation in building 2\u201d  Officer Joy Peal said as he entered the checkpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the Tome\u2019s are staying.\u201d He said with concern.  \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d he said \u201cI\u2019m not losing another witness to this bastard send everything you\u2019ve got, initiate Code 9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCode 9 Code 9\u201d she said into her radio  \u201cThis is not a drill, report to your staging areas, I repeat Code 9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet your gear, meet me at staging area 2\u201d he said the pretty young redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Across from him was officer Joy Peal, 22, just out of school and his newest member.  She was sitting upright, her read hair down on her shoulders and she seemed to be staring blankly down at her legs that were covered beneath a white sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she seemed un touched by whatever dubious action Von Crucial had performed on them but a closer look started to reveal what had been done to them.  The form under the sheet seems to be out of proportion.  She was an average height woman, standing about 5\u20196, but according to what he was seeing, her legs seemed to extend down the bed, almost to he end of the mattress ending in what seemed to be two large feet\u2026too large for a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstictivly he looked down at his own legs, covered also with a white sheet and gasped.  Thowing the sheet aside, he stared in awe and horror at what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy legs, what happened?\u201d he said staring down at his lower body with the two shortened appendages and small, almost child like black boots on the feet.   Following his legs up, he saw also how the pants seemed to hug his form and were snug against his hips and waist\u2026 and crotch.  Trying to remain calm he reached down and patted his stomach, down the front of the pants <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to talk\u201d Dr. Jackson said</span></div></div>",

It was surreal, he was looking at the small right foot, and wiggling his toes he could feel them move in the boot.  He wiggled his left foot and the small left foot moved to his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Jackson put a firm hand on his shoulder and tried to be reassuring.  \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way out of this mess, the sick bastard switched bodies around between all six members.  Fortunately, preliminary tests are all positive and so far there are no other physical abnormalities but until we do complete physicals we can\u2019t give you a clean bill of health and certainly until psychological tests are complete I cannot release any of you back to duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman\u2019s scream shattered the room.

The fatigues were form fitting and judging by what he was seeing he now had quite some form.  He chuckled as he thought about his ex wife and how she would be loving this right now.  She would really be enjoying this and he hoped she would never find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his hand flat against the zipper and found himself shocked at the realization that not only did he now had Joy Peal\u2019s legs and feet but essentially also everything from the belt line down, including her hips, butt and genitals.   He could feel his hand against \u201chis\u201d abdomen and he slid his hand up and under his tee shirt.  The skin about two inches above the belt was very soft and smooth, it was also very sensitive to his rough callused palm but a distinct line was felt where the smooth skin gave way to his normal mildly hairy stomach which felt rather coarse in direct contrast with Joy\u2019s smooth and soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtocol says you need to put this on\u201d Dr Jackson said as he handed him a necklace with an iridescent pendant on it.  Jon recognized it as the Inca protection jewel that the victims of Von Crucial must wear in order to remain hidden from his telepathic link.  He grabbed it and put it on over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does Joy have\u2026mine?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid so\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now?   Have we contacted HQ?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBenson has been contacted, he\u2019s requesting support from a team from A.G.E.N.T .  Their experience with the paranormal is unmatched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell check me out doc.  I\u2019m not going to sit on the sidelines for this.  I can still operate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlow down Jon, you\u2019ve just been through a major transformation and lived to tell us about it.   Let\u2019s not put the cart before the horse on this and first thing tomorrow we\u2019ll start a battery of physical and mental tests.  NSOPS needs bodies, yes, but we cannot afford a detriment\u2026you understand that.  We\u2019re moving you and your team onto campus, someone has already on the way with extra uniforms and other necessities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all of that in my locker, my field bag is packed with 7 days worth of supplies and equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJon, look at yourself.\u201d  Dr. Jackson said pointing to his legs.  \u201cDo you really think your uniforms and boots will fit you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon paused, and considered the obvious fact that nothing he owned, save for his shirts would fit him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI have work to do\u201d  John said softly and started to stand up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy does it Jon, here let me help you.  Nurse, bring that wheelchair over here please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing against Dr Jackson\u2019s shoulder, Jon slid down off of the gurney.  It took longer than expected for his feet to touch the tile of the floor, but they eventually made contact and his knees buckled slightly.  His back ached a little and his stomach felt like it had a Charlie horse but he stood up straight and looked up at Dr. Jackson\u2026and looked down\u2026and looked up again.  He felt like he was standing in a hole, or the Dr. was standing on a step or something because being 6\u20191 and the Dr. also being close to his height they always looked eye to eye.  Now, however, he was looking up to make eye contact with his long time friend.  Looking down, again he remembered he wasn\u2019t the same as before and the switch with Joy has left him short about 3 inches.  He looked at he small black boots, marveling at how small they were and rocking slightly back and forth he noticed too that it was harder to balance on them and he staggered slightly.  Sticking his arms out he regained his balance and looking back up to Dr. Jackson he smiled and said \u201cSee, just like riding a bike\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit\u201d Dr. Jackson said motioning to the wheel chair.  \u201cNurse Gable will take you to your room.  I\u2019ll send a wake up call for you at 0600, get some rest and for God sake, don\u2019t take that pendant off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down slowly and marveled at how his butt seemed to take up much more of the seat than it used to and Nurse Gable pushed him out of the triage area and down the hall.<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are\u201d she said and stopped outside the doorway of room 108.  Stepping around the front of the chair, she extended her arm.  Jon grabbed her arm with one hand and with the other pushed off on the arm rest and stood up shakily.  She opened the door and walked him in slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mechanics were the same.  Walking no matter who you are is simply one foot in front of the other.  Doing so day after day for 35 some odd years becomes second nature but to suddenly have the equipment replaced does cause some issues.  Nurse Gable said the brain remembers, but the signals from the brain to the new muscles, tendons and nerve groups have been re-routed.  The brain remembers yes, but the muscle memory and the brain need to be in sync otherwise the movements are less fluid and it is going to take some time before full coordination can be reestablished, if ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was walking, yes but it was slow and my new feet tingled as if there were waking up from being asleep.  On the kitchen counter was a standard issue duffle bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can find uniforms and supplied in there.  Here is my pager number, please call if you need any help.  I\u2019ll be on duty until 0800.\u201d She said and smiled.  I didn\u2019t realize it but she was also making herself available for any \u201cFemale\u201d questions I may have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you know\u2026if you have any questions about stuff\u2026\u201d and she glanced down at my lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon felt himself blush, \u201c yeah sure, umm I\u2019ll be sure to call\u201d  trying to sound confident but was again suddenly hit with the reality of it all because in honesty what would he know about such things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you like, I can speak with Joy and see if there is anything special you need to know about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecial?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Like STD\u2019s, PMS, or even pregnancy.  You have inherited a whole new way of life Detective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon doubted that STD\u2019s would be a problem.  Peal seemed like a good kid but the thought of the other things made him wonder what exactly are the cards he\u2019s been dealt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon yawned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some rest, the Dr. prescribed a mild sedative.  The bedroom is the second door on the left.\u201d She said as she turned to walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed and Jon was left to his own thoughts. The sedative was starting to kick in so he decided to make way to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding by the bed, he noticed how the bed seemed higher, probably a result of his lost 3 inches.  Turning to sit down, the bed didn\u2019t hit him right at the knees anymore and he found he had to hop slightly to get his butt up on the mattress.  Joy\u2019s shorter legs were going to take some time to get used to and sitting on the bed with his feet not touching the floor was another reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPivoting on this butt, he swung his legs up and started to lie down.  He winced as it felt like a pubic hair was caught and pulled in the elastic of his underwear somewhere \u201cdown there\u201d.  Up until now he was blocking from though about the strange sensations he was getting from the lower regions of his new body parts.  The sharp sting of a hair being pulled however was not something he could just block out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI better take these off\u201d he said and sat up to remove the boots from his feet.  He untied the laces and slid the small boot off.  He was somewhat relieved that he now only had standard issue white socks where he was half expecting pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot seemed impossibly small, and taking a breath he reached down and slid the sock off.  The small bare foot was tipped with red nail polish. He wiggled the tiny toes and stared shocked at what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed the boot and sock from his left foot and lay back on the pillow.  Reaching over to grab the phone, he dialed HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBenson here\u201d a voice answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom, its Jon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJon\u2026.I heard.  How are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel fine, in fact that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling.  I can\u2019t sit on the sideline for this\u2026you know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,  I know but we\u2019re over our head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen is the AGENT team arriving?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a meeting at 0900 tomorrow, if Dr. Jackson will sign off, I\u2019ll reinstate you to this case but it\u2019s up to the Dr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Tom, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some rest Jon, that\u2019s an order.  We\u2019ll talk more tomorrow.\u201d  Tom Benson said and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The early morning light was peeking through the window shade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking gingerly toward the bathroom door, he stooped slightly as standing full upright increased the need to express his bladder, not to mention a slight twinge in his lower back caused him to slouch slightly to quell the small, sharp pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for the doorknob and missed, fumbling he redirected his aim a little higher and turned the knob and walked in.  He ran a hand blindly along the wall reaching for a light switch, again finding one a little higher than his first flailing attempt. Sensing relief, he grasped the belt buckle and fumbled with it until he felt it release and the belt loosen slightly.   He tried to pull the pants down but they stopped, wedged against his hips and he realized he would have to undo the button and zipper to get them all the way down.  The sense of urgency increased with each passing heartbeat as he fumbled clumsily with button, finally ripping it off out of frustration and panic sending it shooting across the room, hitting the closet door and bouncing onto the vanity with a click.  He jerked the pants down, along with a handful of underwear down and out of habit, made a grab for his penis, only to feel his fingers bury themselves in a patch of soft pubic hair.  He groaned and turned to sit, jumping up with a yelp as cold plastic met warm flesh because in his haste, he had forgot to lift the lid.  Cursing, he turned and flung the thin plastic up and turned to sit again, this time hitting his mark.  He paused, as if to ponder what to do next.  Relaxing and spreading his legs slightly, a sudden burst of fluid half streamed and half sprayed from between his legs, down into the toilet bowl.  The relief was instant, and as quickly as it had started, it stopped.  Arching his back he looked up and sighed, \u201cThat was close\u2026\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over to grab a handful of toilet paper, he felt cooling drops of moisture collect and drip into the water below.   Taking a deep breath he reached straight down between Joy\u2019s legs to dry, gingerly he dabbed at the area.  Unable to see what he was aiming at, he just pressed the wad of paper against the entire area.  The feeling was so strange as the paper pressed against Joy\u2019s anatomy, sensations his brain struggled to register were being created by the pressure of the tissue in his hand against his borrowed equipment and he must have used a half of a roll of paper before he felt he was satisfactorily dry.   Before he stood to pull his pants up, he stole a glance at the two, pale and hairless thighs that extended out before him as he sat on the toilet.  He touched the right one carefully, his hand felt warm on the cool, soft flesh.  It, like it\u2019s counterpart on the left side looked thinner than \u201chis\u201d thighs.  While the skin appeared to be completely smooth, there was a distinct presence of stubble, indicating Joy had not shaved her legs, or upper portion at least, for a couple of days.  He remembered how his ex wife would alternate between shaving the entire leg or just the bottoms depending upon need.  Sliding his hand down over the soft, round knee, he felt the shin area and how it was considerable smoother than the thigh and concluded that Joy had followed the same practice of only shaving the entire leg when necessary.  He couldn\u2019t believe that these two smooth and feminine legs were attached to his body as he paused to think about how running his hand over the smooth legs would under normal circumstances cause some arousal, but at this point he felt nothing.  Looking down, he saw how just below his chest, about 6 inches there was a distinct line where his mildly hairy chest and upper stomach stopped and completely smooth and paler skin started.  A slight paunch of a belly was interrupted only with a few dimples of cellulite and an oval shaped navel that Jon gingerly stuck a finger into.  Below that, the pale skin was completely bare except for a small patch of strawberry blonde pubic hair resting at the conjunction of the slightly parted creamy thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the waist of the pants closed with one hand, he started to walk carefully out into the bedroom.   As he passed the bathroom mirror, he caught a glimpse of the side view of his body. His tee shirt hung below his waist, but the profile was not that of which he was used to seeing and he swallowed hard when his focus fell upon the swell of Joy\u2019s rounded butt from underneath the tee shirt.  Putting the vision out of his mind he walked out into the bedroom trying to ignore strange sensations emitting from his crotch as his thighs gently rubbed together with each step.  He tried hard also to not focus on the way his butt cheeks jiggling slightly with each step he took.  The underwear Joy had been wearing yesterday fit snuggly but for some reason it felt as if half of each butt cheek was hanging out, rubbing against the more course cotton blended material of the uniform bottoms and moving uncontrollably with each step on the hard floor.  To quell the feelings, he started taking shorter strides that seemed to help somewhat and even made walking a little more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to use the phone in the kitchenette, he walked out the bedroom door and down the hall, getting more and more confident with each small step.  Looking down, he still couldn\u2019t believe that the small feet were now his and he swayed a little bit as he lost concentration and lost his balance for a moment.  He thought it was best just to keep his eyes up and focus on getting from A to B before he fell and broke his neck.   An object near the front door caught his eye so he walked over to it and bent over carefully to pick it up.  Bending at the waist he groaned slightly as the slight pain in his lower back returned causing him to step forward slightly and kneel to finally grasp the yellow envelope.  Using the door knob for leverage, he stood back upright and made is way to the kitchen counter.   Detective Jon James was hand written on the outside.<br>\r\nA note was inside, it was telling him that there was a change of clothes in the duffle bag on the kitchen table and to pick what he needed and return the rest to Dr. Jackson\u2019s office when he came for his examination at 7:00.  Walking to the kitchen table, he opened the bag and dumped it onto the counter top.  He found a pair of blue sweat pants that fit a little snug in the butt but otherwise were a good fit if not a little too long in the legs.  Joy obviously had a shorter than normal in-seem which would explain some of his loss of height.  The only foot gear provided was a pair of what looked to be one size fit\u2019s all medical slippers, that were slightly too large but functional and there was not a change of underwear provided<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nDropping the pants and kicking them to the side, he looked at his reflection in the mirror, marveling at the abrupt convergence just below his ribcage of Joy\u2019s pale, smooth skin and his slightly tanned and hairy skin.   Joy\u2019s waist was also considerably smaller than his rib cage, which created an exaggerated hourglass silhouette when he studied his new form.  His 42 inch chest and upper torso was pinched inward at the convergence line and stayed that way until the mass of Joy\u2019s classically feminine hips flared outward.  Jon ran his hands along the convergence line, the skin tingled slightly, and he moved them down along Joy\u2019s hips and across the stomach, stopping at the navel.  Placing his thumbs in the elastic waistband of the underwear, he slid them down around the thighs.  In the mirror he could see the neat patch of strawberry blonde pubic hair covering what closer examination proved to be the puffy and slightly open cleft of Joy\u2019s vagina that hung there gaping with a strange weight.  He looked down and noticed about a 2 inch gap that allowed him see daylight between Joy\u2019s two thighs where they connected with the hips, and as hard as he tried, he could not squeeze the two legs together to close the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the washcloth, he began washed the area, careful to not rub too hard as to inadvertently violate Joy\u2019s equipment.  The feeling at first was as though he were running the washcloth over his scrotum, but it did not take too long for the feelings to change, and soon a familiar \u201citch\u201d started to grow, as did his need to scratch it.  He stopped suddenly realizing where this could be going and decided it was not the time or place.  Reaching down to pull the underwear back up, he caught glimpse of the white cotton crotch panel of the underwear.  Stretching the briefs out further so he could see better,  he noticed it was caked in white, flaky crust and further back on the panel, the fabric was stained, slightly darker with more of the crusty substance.  Starting to feel disgusted, Jon reached down through Joy\u2019s legs with the washcloth and scrubbed the area around Joy\u2019s anus.  The area felt sore and sensitive,  and once he applied what must have been too much pressure so the rough cotton washcloth slipped slightly into the orifice causing Jon to wince slightly as a pain caused him to flinch and clench his teeth.  He tossed the washcloth into the sink and thought twice about pulling up Joy\u2019s soiled underwear before finally sliding them down and kicking them under the toilet.  He decided to go without underwear instead of wearing Joy\u2019s dirty pair, and in his rationalization, it was not as though he needed any support anyway.   He turned to grab the pair of blue sweatpants off of the door knob and stole a quick glance at Joy\u2019s pert, pale butt.  Looking closer, he could see what appeared to be fading red lines on the smooth skin and what looked like a combination of old and new bruises.  Turning Joy\u2019s backside further toward the mirror, he saw a large bruise in the small of the back and in the area he had been feeling the twinge of pain.  There were also small circular scars in random pattern across the upper part of the buttocks lower back.  \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d he said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His watch beeped.  It was time to meet the Dr.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wouldn\u2019t elaborate to me.\u201d Dr. Jackson replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry?  I wonder what for?  She didn\u2019t do anything, she can\u2019t feel responsible for this\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it goes deeper than that.  She had lots of questions about the transformation and how you were.\u201d  The Dr. said  \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, aside from losing some height and the lower half of my body I feel peachy!  How do you think I feel?  I\u2019m scared doc, what if I\u2019m\u2026we\u2019re, stuck like this?  The tread mill damn near killed me.  I can\u2019t run, these short legs are hard to control and I keep losing balance on these damn feet\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJon, take it easy, we think the coordination will return, it\u2019s just going to take some physical therapy and the balance will come also, just give yourself some time.  All in all your cardio stress test turned out positive, as is your blood pressure.  We don\u2019t expect your coordination to be 100% for quite some time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much time?  My team\u2026NSOPS needs me.  Are you going to clear me?\u201d Jon pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still want to do a complete MRI and physical exam and we have some puzzles we want you to complete.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPuzzles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, just some brain teasers, we want to see what the loss of testosterone and sudden rush of estrogens will do to your thought processes.  Jon, you realize you\u2019re not 100% male for the time being right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am up here\u201d he said pointing to his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but female hormones are powerful chemicals and we don\u2019t know what to expect as your brain begins to be affected by the influx of the new chemicals that are now flooding your endocrine system.  The question is how will it affect not only your brain and decision making, but your heart and other major organs?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe loss of testosterone also concerns me.\u201d  The Dr. said \u201cYou have to realize that that makes you\u2026well you is not only your physical state but also the careful balance of chemicals surging through our bodies.  Pending the outcome of the MRI and physical I am holding you out of duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words echoed in Jon\u2019s head.  Not fit for duty was something he could not take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s get this over with\u201d and he jumped up to sit on the examination table.<br>\r\nHe slid off the blue sweat pants and rested them over Joy\u2019s abdomen, feeling exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut your legs in these and lean back on the table and do try to relax\u201d the Dr. said gesturing to two stainless steel posts at the foot of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy\u2019s legs Dr.  I\u2019m just borrowing them.\u201d He smiled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor removed the blue sweats that Jon had been using to cover himself and stepping around the end of the table \u201cyour going to feel some pressure, like  I said, just relax and concentrate on deep breaths.\u201d  He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon flinched as he felt something cold and hard make contact and enter him from somewhere down below.  The pressure wasn\u2019t pleasant or uncomfortable until the Dr. did something that caused a sharp pain shoot down his right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d the Dr. asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little, I can\u2019t describe it but it was sharp but it has stopped now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon felt the Dr\u2019s fingers probing and pulling on parts unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk just about done\u201d the Dr said and changed gloves \u201cTell me if you feel any pain ok?\u201d he said as Jon felt gloved fingers begin probing and touching the area around Joy\u2019anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor took a deep breath and let it out slowly.  \u201cHave you had any pain with your bowl movements?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have not had any yet doc\u2026why?\u201d he replied, hesitating to tell him about Joy\u2019s soiled underwear and the experience he had as he tried to clean the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor removed the latex gloves and said \u201cGo ahead and stand up\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon slid Joy\u2019s legs out of the metal rests.  \u201cCan I put my pants back on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one more check and then yes, you can put them back on but for now please stand, turn and lean over the exam table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing??\u201d Jon said as he felt the Dr\u2019s hands touching the sensitive flesh of Joy\u2019s butt and lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow well do you know officer Peal?\u201d Dr. Jackson asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is there something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong isn\u2019t the word I\u2019m looking for.  This is a very sensitive area we\u2019re in now.  We have privacy issues, chain of command issues\u2026. It appears you have inherited a few complications from Joy. Um\u2026have you noticed the marks on your\u2026her butt\u2026the small round scars?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw them as I bathed this morning but I couldn\u2019t tell exactly what they were.  My first thought was chicken pox scars.\u201d  Jon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so too until I noticed they were not random but, umm they are in a pattern.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean she put them there, are they tattoos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not tattoos, they are scars Jon and in my estimation made from a lit cigarette.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood God\u201d Jon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey appear to be in the image of a smiley face with two eyes and a mouth.  Along with the bruising\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did notice the bruises, I figured they were from training or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought of that too, but these are long and precise\u2026probably caused by a piece of wood or fiberglass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas she assaulted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, and looking at how the rectum is swollen and distended\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean distended?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, shit Jon as a friend and not a doctor, guy to guy, this girl has been taking it in the ass hard and long and now you\u2019re stuck with the ramifications.  I will prescribe some ointment to reduce the swelling and I\u2019ll put you on an antibiotic until we can get more history from Joy.  The injuries are constant with blunt force being applied to the rectum.  Whatever it was, it was big and whoever her partner was not gentle.  Until the swelling goes down, it\u2019s hard to say how much permanent damage there is and that would also depend on how long she has engaged in this behavior.  We\u2019ll know more in the next few days.  Go ahead and pull your pants back on.  I\u2019m sorry about this man.  There\u2019s more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the gynological exam revealed that Joy\u2019s labia major and labia minor are showing signs of loss of muscle tone, some atrophy in the vaginal canal and minor scaring.  It seems, her taste for the rough stuff isn\u2019t limited to the ummm back door action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon started to process all of this and he couldn\u2019t believe he was stuck like this.  He was also equally shocked at the presumable double life Joy Peal had been living.  Honestly, she would have been the last person he would have thought would be into such self destructive behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets get those other tests done Jon, and  I will meet with my staff this afternoon when the blood work is done to discuss putting you back on duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Doc, I\u2019ll be ready\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, just do the exercises and remember I have to consider the mission as well, not just your feelings on this.\u201d He said as his pager went off   \u201cI have to go, Jon, the Commandant wants to talk.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him hi for me will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, go take your tests and I\u2019ll see you later this afternoon.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon tentatively started to pull on the sweat pants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should start wearing underwear Jon.  The injuries Joy has to her anus and rectum will probably result in some minor leakage.   I also noticed some residual fluid draining from her vagina that may cause you some embarrassment.  I\u2019ll have the nurse outfit you with some proper undergarments and sanitary napkins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon pulled the sweats up and tied the draw string feeling confused and scared.  The idea of being stuck like this for the rest of his life was starting to weigh on his mind.   Vagina, leakage, napkins\u2026.all he could do to maintain his sanity for the moment was to concentrate on how to get the bastard that had done this to him and countless others.  He did consider himself lucky as he thought about the horrible ending that the Tomes had endured and how just a few doors away, Cindy Prince, reduced to no more than a disembodied penis managed to survive on hope on hope that someday she\u2019ll be restored and reunited with her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon slipped on the white linen slippers on his small feet and walked out the door.  The nurse was waiting with an envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome this way\u201d she said  \u201cDo you have to take a break?  This may be a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon thought about how nearly peed himself this morning but thought against taking a potty break.  The whole regiment of practically disrobing, sitting and drying just to take a piss was something he never wanted to do again but in reality he knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen.  Nature always calls but \u201cI\u2019ll take my chance\u201d he thought and walked out of the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A noise startled him and he turned to face the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig\u2019s office called me, they said you had been injured on duty\u201d the woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon looked suspiciously at her and then remembered he still had her listed as a contact in case of an emergency.   Dr. Jackson\u2019s nurse must have called her after what happened last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said you may need some help, were you shot?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u2026Jen I don\u2019t think this is such a good idea right now, and I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon stared at his ex wife.  Time was certainly being kind to her as she seems more beautiful with each passing year.  She still had not remarried since their divorce but he admired her independence and truthfully doubted that she would ever remarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look\u2026different\u2026 have you lost weight?\u201d she asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that, I\u2026uh\u2026it\u2019s a little complicated.\u201d He stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me take that..\u201d she said as she started walking toward him, reaching out for the small suitcase he was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped as she got within a few feet of him and with a confused look on her face asked again \u201cAre you sure you haven\u2019t lost weight, you seem\u2026different\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, now that he had Joy\u2019s shorter legs, he now looked damn near eye to eye to his ex wife.  Out of reflex he stood up on his tiptoes but could not hold the position for long as Joy\u2019s calf muscles were not accustom to supporting the extra weight of his upper torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer noticed Jon seemed nervous and bounced up and down on his tiptoes.  Surely something was wrong, his normal confidence was not showing in his voice.  She looked down and again was confused at how the blue sweat pants he was wearing bunched up at the feet, nearly covering them.  The tee shirt he was wearing hung low and snug at the hips, which seemed wider and lower than normal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who is she?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Jon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour girlfriend, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve just been with another woman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d Jon asked annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Jonny, a woman knows.   I can still smell her on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lump formed in Jon\u2019s throat. \u201cGod\u201d he thought as he remembered what Dr. Jackson had told him about Joy\u2019s injuries and the fluids draining from her vagina.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJen, it\u2019s not what you think...we were attacked last night..and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to justify anything to me, we\u2019re divorced now, I\u2019m a big girl and it\u2019s only fair that you have moved on\u2026but for God\u2019s sake Jon clean yourself off.  You reek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly jealous and knowing that, made Jon feel good in different sense.  This proved she still had feelings for him, but for now, he had to clear up this misunderstanding, no matter how embarrassing it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen, come and sit\u2026we need to talk.\u201d He said and guided her over to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat and winced in discomfort as tender flesh was pulled.  He sniffed and, she was right.  He could smell the obvious musky odor of female sex and his stomach rolled as he realized the smell was coming from him.  Jon glanced over at the suitcase the nurse had sent him home with.  In it were the necessities, his prescriptions, some clean underwear, uniform bottoms that were the correct size, some socks and a box of napkins she said to change at least twice daily until the discharge stopped.  He felt humiliated now to know that there was no way the nurse, nor his long time friend Dr. Craig Jackson had not smelled the odor but they were too polite to say anything, he just didn\u2019t pick up on their subtle hints.  Shit, how could he?  For the first time he started to feel very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be hard to believe\u2026\u201d he started<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer White sat in silence and started at the small, slender foot.  The stubby toes, tipped in red polish wiggled nervously.  All that Jon had just told her was so hard to believe, but she could not deny the physical evidence presented before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead touch them\u201d Jon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t I need to.  So all  these reports of missing people have been because of this Von Crucial person?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid so\u201d  Jon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why are you here?  I mean, why didn\u2019t he take you too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t know, the only explanation I have is this guy didn\u2019t want to bother with us, he only wanted to slow us down.  He\u2019s not a killer, there\u2019s no money in it but in his eyes, my investigation was interfering with business and by slowing me down, he\u2019s been able to create a cushion between us and them.  We\u2019ve been close on a couple of occasions, but actually apprehending this guy has been almost impossible and perhaps it is.  Until we can find a way to reverse and prevent these changes, he has the upper hand for certain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mention his business, what do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe think he operates a human smuggling ring.  We have been monitoring several bank accounts of some persons of interest worldwide and occasionally, we have noticed a large sum of money being wired into an off shore account after every kidnapping spree.  Judging by the types of powers VonCrucial seems to possess, it could range from sex trade, to human oddities to even rare art.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer directed the conversation back to Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are you going to do? How long do you think you are stuck like this?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.  It could be days, weeks or years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at her ex-husband, picturing him going through monthly periods, yeast infections and who knows even menopause caused her to shake her head.  Jon was always the poster child for masculinity.  When they were married, he played the roll of hunter/gatherer to a tee.  As a law enforcement professional, his was the role of the alpha male and always rose to the top among his male peers.  What would this transformation do to him?  How his is psyche will handle this remains to be seen, she could understand why Craig has not placed him fit for duty yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm so do you have any questions?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d  Jon replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you seem to be having some freshness  issues.  I am here for you if you need anything\u2026advice\u2026or if you just need to talk\u201d  she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, she\u2019s treating me like I\u2019m one of her girlfriends\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate that Jen, I really do but the nurse gave me some pamphlets to read and there is always the Internet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen realized the embarrassment he has to be feeling and for a moment felt silly for even offering to help.  When they were married he refused to let her help him, even when he just had a cold, how would she have expected him to accept help with the female problems he has now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave to spoken with\u2026what was her name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mean Joy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, um is she ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, all I got from her is a note apologizing.  At the time, I didn\u2019t understand exactly what for but now, I think she wanted to let me know that she was sorry that I am paying the price for her lifestyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, please let me help you with this\u2026and she reached into her purse and produced a small plastic bottle with yellow fluid in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNail polish remover.  I\u2019m sorry, but red isn\u2019t your color.\u201d She said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon reached up to adjust the shower head.  Having lost a few inches of height, he found that the most mundane things such as adjusting the angle of the flow of a shower head were now almost totally new experiences.  Only 48 hours ago, in the same shower this feat was simple and required little thought.  Now, barely able to reach the showerhead, even on tip toes it was a frustratingly almost impossible task and after nearly slipping and breaking his neck, he gave up, but not without slightly altering the flow so it shot over his head, blasting the back wall.  \u201cI\u2019ll fine tune it later\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right in there?\u201d he heard is ex wife\u2019s voice asking from outside the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine, just a little trouble with the hot water.\u201d  He lied.  It killed him to be honest about this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and had to admit to himself that he was glad she was there.  He wiggled his now bare toes, still feeling disbelieve that the toes and the feet, legs and hips they were connected to were on him.  \u201cAt least they are not red anymore\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the soap bar and began to lather his arms and chest.  The warm water felt good.  Out of habit he soaped his hand and ran it down his crotch.  His stomach fell as just for a moment everything had seemed normal\u2026 that is until he reached down and was reminded of what had happened.  The pubic hair was soft, and finer than his was.  Careful not to harm any of the healing flesh down there he gently rubbed the area with the soapy hand.  The nurse had said not to scrub the area but to gently massage with warm water and soap to keep the lesions clean and reduce the chance of infection.  Bending over to wash his legs he noticed how the stubble had grown over the last day.  But even feeling a little \u201cprickly\u201d, the legs were much smoother than his could have ever been.  He reached around and washed his now fleshy backside.  It too was very smooth and soft but he winced as he got a little too aggressive when washing between the cheeks.  Moving toward the back of the shower he turned so the water hit the back of his head and ran down his back.  Gently spreading his butt cheeks, he arched his back as the warm water ran down his back and over his tender anus rinsing the soapy water.  Curious, he touched it with his finger tip and.  It was still swollen, and compared to what his anus felt like, it felt huge and with little effort at all he could slip the tip of his finger inside.  Jon thought of a picture he had seen in a porno magazine of a woman with her partner\u2019s foot stuffed to the ankle in her ass.  What that type of shit Joy was into?  Reaching further past the anus, his fingers came into contact with the outer lips of the vagina.  They too felt swollen and even with his legs almost together they were parted, as if ready for anything to enter.  He thought again of the porno magazines with the women and their worn out parts.  How they seemingly effortlessly inserted beer bottles and other objects like bowling pins.  He was repulsed at the thought of what depravity Joy had subjected her body to for it to be in this condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door startled him.  \u201cJon, can I get you anything, I\u2019m heading to the cafeteria\u201d His ex wife asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet me a soda and some chips\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad she was here, but she cannot stay.  It was too dangerous.  Von Crucial had him marked; it was only a matter of time before he came to claim his property.  All he had to do was set the perfect trap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon unzipped the duffle bag and emptied the contents onto the bedspread.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and began taking inventory of 7 pair each of regulation cotton panties size 10, cotton socks small, 1 each boxes of tampons and sanitary napkins, 3 pair of fatigue pants size 12, 3 pair of exercise shorts size medium, 1 pair of sweat pants size medium, 1 pair of running shoes, size 5 and one pair of boots, size 5.  He picked up one of the boots and marveled at how small it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning from his deep thoughts as he grabbed a sanitary napkin, pair of underwear and some sweat pants and then retreated back into the refuge of the bathroom, the only room with a lock.  He would need his privacy for the next few minutes as he applied the prescription creams to the tender healing flesh of Joy\u2019s\u2026now his privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one leg up on the bathtub, he blindly smeared the cold ointment into the loose lips of his vagina, his stomach sunk as he easily first slipped two, three and then four fingers knuckle deep into the sloppy canal.  It stung for a few moments and he stood breathing through his teeth, as it slowly subsided into the normal distant pain he now lived with.   He turned and caught his reflection in the large mirror on the back of the door.  The scars on his butt seemed a little fainter, thanks to the vitamin E ointment Craig had given him.  Trying not to look, but like a bad accident he couldn\u2019t help but gaze at the curvaceous backside he now had.   There would be no way to hide the curves, even in the oversized sweatpants he wore earlier in the day, his hips and butt stuck out from his narrow waist.   He had tried to push thoughts of the future out of his mind but ever increasingly, he was thinking about the what if\u2019s in this deal.  He stood and faced the mirror.  His love handles protruded slightly over the transition line between where his mildly tan skin converged with the soft pale skin of the lower half.  He still marveled at how even if he stood with his feet together, there remained a gap between his thighs at the crotch giving him a bowlegged look.  The meaty outer lips of the vagina gaped open with darker purplish inner lips protruding outward.  His center of gravity was shifted way low, not only due to the obvious differences in male and female skeletal structure, but the loss of height due to Joy\u2019s much shorter legs.  After washing his hands, he sat on the toilet and then removed the paper from the adhesive strips from a sanitary napkin and pressed it into the crotch of the underwear he had brought in.  The nurse had said he would need to wear one of these at least until the last of the sores on his crotch had healed and then perhaps sparingly as needed. At first he protested but she assured him, as humiliating as this all was, it was nothing compared to his underwear getting stuck to an open wound in such a sensitive area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on the underwear and then the sweatpants he checked himself out in the mirror before walking out.  He pulled at the sweat pants trying to stretch them so they would not hug is curves so much.  They fit well, too well and he was extremely self conscious of the flatness of front of the sweats, except for the slight mound of the pubic bone, which seemed to mock him as he imagined what it should look like had things been normal.  He made a mental note to ask for a slightly larger size of sweat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon clutched at the pendant hanging from around his neck.

He could see Janice hovering over the stove, her beautiful long legs stretching out far beneath her little lime green negligee, her perky little butt bouncing around to a tune she had in her head. He couldn't believe how lucky he was to be married to wife as wonderful as Janice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowed his steps in order to creep up behind her sashaying backside, her head bobbing up and down as she hummed a sweet tune and made her famous apple bacon and chorizo scramble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're there Jim, I could hear you stomping down the hallway like every morning, sit down and I'll serve you in a minute\" she called without even turning around and missing a beat while cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled softly and drifted over to the kitchen table, and fluttered through a music magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nengrossed in an article about an interview of him and Janice's favorite band going on tour, he was distracted by plate of hot bacon, and eggs being centered on the magazine top, the smell assaulting and engrossing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks great Jan\" he looked up towards her only to find her on the other side of the table, her back to him pouring coffee from the machine for them. He shrugged it off and decided to dig into his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nengrossed in his food, he didn't notice when Jan dropped off his cup of coffee and sat down opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always said you make the best eggs hone----\" his voice trailed off into a startled gasp as he sat slackjawed at the sight in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"whats the matter Jim? You feeling okay\" Her voice now coming out muffled from between the two large plump soft cheeks that dominated where his wife's face used to be, her entire head was now nothing more than a feminine backside, at the very top cascaded her hair with her trademark curls falling down on both sides with one or two strands that occasionally strayed forward and got caught in what was now the crevice of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't tell if she was staring at him, or if she could even see him, the only sign that what he was looking at was his wife were the curls of her hair and the muffled voice that reverberated out of the creatures tanned wrinkled hole, no eyes to speak of. She continued to act as if nothing was wrong and he watched with curious horrified eyes as she lifted up her cup of coffee and as well in her other hand and long hard plastic straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recoiled visibly when she inserted the straw into her anus mouth and proceeded to sip her coffee as if it were the most normal thing in the world, her \"mouth\" had a little tendril of smoke emitting from it as she withdrew the straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, i think it's a little too hot!, What do you think Jim?\" He had no words, he could not believe what he was seeing, his wife had been disfigured beyond human thought and she acted as if this was her normal form, he was confused and scared and it seemed like the world around him was getting bigger and he was falling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jim I'm so sorry I forgot about your condition, let me help you\" She got up from the table and went over to him, her hair obstructing the crack of her face for the briefest moment, her cheeks wobbling to and fro with every movement of her neck, she still retained her perky little butt, however it was not where it should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to back away and get as far away from her, he tried to rise up from his chair but his legs wouldnt respond correctly and he ended up falling face first into the floor of the kitchen, he scrambled to get up as fast as he could but its as if he was trying to walk in reverse, he felt like a tadpole, he couldn't feel his arms and all he managed to was flail about his legs wildly without direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy please calm down, Im sorry I forgot, let me help\" She came over to him, and flipped him over, it felt strange and unreal his body felt like a mess and everything was twice as tall as it should be. Janice loomed over him, her \"face\" peering down at him smooth curving flesh that wobbled like jello while making cooing noises of comfort, sounding muffled and disturbing and more like little farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked him up like he was nothing, and carried him towards the other side of the table, cradling him beneath his head like a baby, all he could was stare stunned at her 'face\" as she carried him, all the while making those farting noises with her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"here we go jimmy, your feeding chair!\" she announced with her cheeks moving side to side excitedly. He looked to where she pointed his head and saw a strange device that looked like someone didnt follow the instructions correctly when putting together a toddlers feeding chair, the table was facing the back side of the seat and leg holes of the bucket seat were on the side near the padded headboard. The whole chair was covered in pink and covered in a care bare motif.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was even more confused, Janice and him were newlyweds, they didnt have kids and never really talked about it after their marriage, she continued to carry him over to the chair and soon found himself being inserted inside of it, and somehow the strange poorly constructed device fitted him perfectly. He was shocked, he should have been cramped and uncomfortable and yet he felt his head hit the back of the padded headboard as well as his legs swing freely from the leg holes in the bucket seat. This shouldnt have been possible, physically it didnt make sense and here he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide for the choo choo train!\" his wife came at him, her butt face seeming to be giggling as she advanced on him with a glittery pink spoon filled with what looked like baby food. And shoved it into his mouth without warning. He just let it drool out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, my poor girl doesnt like her food? let me kiss you and make you feel better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle girl? what was she talking about, what was going on here, why couldnt he move his arms, he was trapped with his insane disfigured wife, bound to a baby feeding chair, the world was spining out of control and then he remembered. The magic show, the freakish transformations, that horrible cackling man and his twisted grin. The pain, the torture his wife went through, the struggle of trying to deal with her deformity. And then he came back and his wife was being sent into some black hole, he cried out for her and then that horrible twisting and sinking feeling, and then it got worse as if his entire body was twisted inside out and back again. The horrible blinding light and incoherent screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbeneath his head snuggled comfortably in the bucket seat were two larger than normal, wide feminine hips, the slopes of the top of his buttcheeks spilling outward towards the bottom of his neck, he gaped. A high pitched female voice, something that sounded more like it belonged to a ten year old little girl escaped from the plump juicy lips that adorned his innocent female face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed, and screamed all the while his wife and her butt face advancing on him, wanting to give him that comforting kiss that he desperately needed. Her facial butt cheeks undulating too and fro while puckering her already puckered mouth hole. Her ass obstructing all view of everything else as she smothered him in it. The feel of her soft downy skin flowing over his face was the last thing he remembered as everything turned black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Shall, I think she's waking up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Nurse Simms, please see to it that she gets the attentions she needs, adjust her to her condition\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, poor thing...Is she the one that was with the capture team? is she a member?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No as far as I can tell, she was just there when they went to extract the Tomes, Its not Janice thats for sure, she was already modified by the mage. and the Tomes were already gone before the team got there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's a Jane doe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"seems likely, however we wont truly know who she is until she's awake, look at her...poor thing looks like she's having a nightmare\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already set up accommadations at Mrs. Spears manor for her, there is someone with a similar modification she can room with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Nurse Simms, she'll need all the help she can get to adjust\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw a curtain above him, and towards the side...was he in a hospital? He tried calling for help and the mewling got louder and more hoarse, turning into a high pitched whine that nearly hurt his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his mouth, and the noise stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat noise....it was coming from...him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream came rushing back to him, than his memories slowly. He couldn't move his body properly because he had been...been, oh god Janice! what did he do to her! do to him!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared and anxious he tried to move his body as if he was walking backwards and he saw underneath white hospital sheets a long slender female leg rising from them, the back of its calf, towards a delicate ankle and petite heel connected to a small foot curved like a womens, with cute little toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified of the sight of it, he needed to test if it really belonged to him, he closed his eyes and calmed his breathing. He opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd saw the backwards leg wiggle its petite little toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming and cursing as best he could his voice came out sounding tinny and small like someone had kicked a puppy, he thrashed on his bed and struggled to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on dear, I'm coming to help\" a female voice announced. He froze, someone was here, someone would see him like this, he was petrified, and embarrased beyond belief and most of all scared of who was out there and where he was. In his condition he was nothing more than a helpless little disfigured...thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtains were pulled aside and a woman came into view, she was dressed in nurses scrubs and looked to be no more than twenty five or younger, she was cute with an upturned little button nose, a dusty complexion with sparkling emerald gray eyes and brunette hair with two bangs falling down on either side of her face. He looked into her eyes and for a moment pictured Janice on their wedding day, her smile and that loving look she gave him when they sealed their vows. He felt a slight sting at the corners of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down on him, a sad smile on her lips and clutching her left arm towards her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here honey, please stay calm and I'll help you, You dont need to be afraid anymore you're in a safe place now, HE cant touch you here\" she cooed to him and patted him gently on the cheek, and she came back with moist fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point he realized he was crying, silently, but the tears were dripping from his face. That was all it took for the dam to burst, he was so caught up with it all he didnt realize the girlish sobbing was coming from him, the nurse leaned over, grabbed him by his head and leaned him over her shoulder and gently rubbing the back of his head and distinctly feeling the oddness of his ass coming into contact with her bosom, his knees bending the wrong way and his \"front\" sitting on his calves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse whispered soothing words in his ears and hair, and he gave up trying to hold back anymore tears, he could feel moisture on his cheeks that werent coming from his eyes. The nurse was crying with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while they stayed like that and his tears and sobbing gently ebbed away, till he was just barely sniffling anymore. She pulled back and softly leaned his head down towards the pillows and cleaned his face with back of her hand. He looked up at her, momentarly dissapointed at the lack of continued comfort he got when she stopped hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There honey, it's good to have a cry now and again, I'm here to help and I'll always be your shoulder to cry on if you need it\" she wiped away her own tears and beamed a hundred watted smile at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe honestly did feel alot better than he woke up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Nurse Simms and I'm your personal Liasion!\" She said proudly and saluted him cutely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err..right sorry, I'm not really used to this yet, i've only been her 6 months  myself and I'm still learning the ropes, I'm just so nervous right now, and you must be too I...errr\" she looked lost, and she seemed to be embarrassed. I was amused and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe must have seen the blank look on my face when she cleared her throat and tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I tend to ramble. Let me explain better, right now you're in the PRC, that stands for the Paranormal Rehabilitation Center, a govermental clinic set up to help citizens that have been affected by abnormal, paranormal incidents such as possessions, poltergeists, mythological entities, alternate dimensions, Alchemy, dark Magicks and unicorns\" She stated as if reading from a teleprompter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Unicorns?\" His voice shocked him, it was small and soft like a little girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly had a grave, serious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, unicorns...they are extremely deadly and malicious creatures, capable of unspeakable horrors\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you cant be serious\" he gasped in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am serious, and dont call me shirley\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puffed up her cheeks and snorted, giggling wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry sorry, I know this is odd for you but I coudln't help myself and frankly humor really is the best medicine, some patients react differently hopefully I didnt offened you, Im so nervous I get kind of giddy and silly...and....I'm rambling again\" She blushed heavily and looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay, I...I actually do feel better, please thank.....thank you\" He still couldnt understand how that girlish childs voice was coming from him, but he looked at her blushing still and gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh whew, I'm glad, the last patient I tried to help didnt go over so well, He was very angry and hostile towards me Im gald you and I could get along\" she seemed relieved, and started rambling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sorry now that we've gotten all that out of the way, lets get down to business, I am to be your personal Liasion, I am hired by the PRC to accompany and rehabilitate select patients who have recently been victims of the Rouge Mage know as Max Von Crucial, I am to assist you in your daily activities and day to day needs. I will be your guide to functioning as best of a normal life as possible while being in a thearupeutic enviroment with similarily affected individuals, this includes, physical and mental therapy sessions as well as possible medical and technological tests that you can opt for or out of, this includes plastic surgery, limb transplant or selective expiremental procedures. All of your needs and amenities are provided for with help of the Goverment, and the spears family foundation for crucial victims.\" She blew out her breath having said it one long sentence without break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im sure now that you have many questions, and Im happy to answer any that you have, please ask away\" She tittered cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot of information to take in, and through it all the most important of questions was floating through his head, he gathered up his cute girly voice and asked in the most pleading and cute way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...where Is my wife?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Simms, horrified gave a startled gasp and pushed a button on the side of his bed. She started yelling down the door of the hospital room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DR. SHALL!!! DR. SHALL!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe turned back towards him, hand over her mouth, tears at her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered in fear, his panic overtaking him again at her reaction, he was hyperentilating she rushed over and tried to calm him while crying uncontrollably, it made everything worse, he was colvusing now and taking deep breaths that were choking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse pushed a button near his head and slowly the blackness consumed him once again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other was a male voice, he could make out some words, he was trying to calm down the nurse who had a bad reaction to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she\" his voice was small and worried, like a little girl that had her candy stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices stopped and the curtains parted, stepping through was a somewhat short older man, with wild gray hair and even wilder bushy gray eyebrows that looked like wooly catipillars on his face. He was comical looking, it seemed fitting that his Doctors coat seemed two sizes too big for his frame, a stethoscope hung from his neck in a way that made it seem as he were a child playing dress up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was momentarily stunned as a nasty thought entered his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear, because of what he was at the moment, his form twisted into some sort of bizzare feminine plaything at the whims of some sort of mystical madman. He felt vulnerable and weak. As man, it was rare he felt this way but now he was gripped with a paralyzing terror that he could be taken advantage of at any moment and there would be physically nothing he could do about it, he doubt his new form had any sort of physical strength, and he couldn't fathom how he would coordinate his few remaining limbs into anything that would protect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was at the mercy of complete strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe was interrupted from his thoughts by the doctor waving his hand in front of his face, apprently having frozen in his internal dialogue.

He shuffles to the front of your bed and pulls out a clipboard with two folders in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lets get to discussing your changes\" he seems excited and has a little giddy glint in his eyes as he shuffles from one page in the folder to another. This scares him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your changes are similar to one other patient of ours, whereas your torso has been reduced and your spinal column rotated in an extreme manner. Most of your internal organs are intact with others having been reduced to suit your form, while others have simply vanished to make room\" he extracts an photo of an X ray from the folder with several notes and arrows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of your internal organs, such as heart, stomach and intestines have now been located behind your left buttock, your lungs now compose of thirty percent of your internal cavity, however have been deformed to suit the curvature of your body. they have been altered so that each \"cheek\" holds a small lung that is encased within stretchy pliable cartalige like your lungs resemble something of a fleshy webbing surrounded by large firm deposits of fatty tissue created to protect them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Additional changes seems to be your digestive system, you no longer have a stomach and you do not contain womb like a female should, you also do not posses a large intestine any longer, instead you have a large bladder, and an additional vagina complete with labia and clitoris where your anus once was, it seems you are no longer capable of solid food. since your changes are somewhat similar to another patient of ours you will be entered on her liquid diet regimen starting today, you wont need to eat much but you must have proper dosages of protein and vitamins\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim just nodded his head in silence stunned beyond words, what kind of life is this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all very fascinating really, well sorry but it's just me being a doctor, I get the chance to study and figure out all the subtlties and wonder of the transformees bodies, some of it is astounding in its intricacy, some of it is rather mundane like yours for example it seems like you were given a body system similar to an amphibian. Not that interesting like some of the others but you seem to fall under one of the three basic categories for a transformed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im happy you're excited that Im nothing more than a human frog\" ...He answered bitterly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you said there was someone like me?...and my voice..\" he looked down with embaressment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ah yes Gina, yes she has a similar modification, although hers is a little more complex, but very similar. and dont worry about your voice, we've noticed that in the full body transgender transformees, it takes a while for the new hormones, bodily functions and your vocal chords to catch up, sort of a mini puberty. Your voice should be adjusting to a normal tone with more use and time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he wont sound like a child, a small ounce of hope perhaps, but what good is that if he was nothing more than a freak, but wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said something about a ...a foundation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes the Spears foundation, You'll meet them soon enough, you will be taken to the foundation for rehabiliation purposes and then given options and deciding what you would like to accomplish to alter or enhance your condition. Luckilly for you, you fall into the Physical transformee category, much easier to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Category?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you see most transformees fall under three certain categories. Physical transformations such as yours include body modifcations such as you have and internal transformation, such as you have.

We call it dimensional because physically its not possible to exist and be alive yet there remains a concious living being within, these are the most tragic of all of them, imagine trapped in something that was once your own body and nothing you can do or say, just some object, with a will and a brain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The Third is the Merger transformees, these are individuals that have been....combined into one another, sometimes its resmbles something like one body absorbing another, there are still traits of the other left behind, although in all cases we've had both retain a seperate consciusness. In other cases its something like  a siamease conjoinment, two heads or two bodies etc, depending on the circumstances these could be the most difficult to treat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now not to say that Max is a three trick pony, these are only the most common of  transformees, however there are other differing cases, but it would best if you werent aware of those, some things simply arent decent.\" He let that warning linger in the air cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I'm needed at the Ops base, so if you'll excuse me I'll send in Nurse Simms to prep you for your departure to Mrs. Spears foundation, have a good day Mrs. Tomes, I will be seeing within the week to perform a follow up physical exam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he pushed a call button on the side of the bed and was out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could was sit there in the silence of the hospital room numbly digest all the information he was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later he heard a soft rapping outside his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Simms arrived looking somewhat agitated, she was fidgeting with her hands and she looked unsure of herself, in her hands she held a bundle of clothing, what looked to be a pair of black pants and various pairs of different womens underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I need to help you get dressed\" she announced sadly.</span></div></div>",

The feelings it produced disturbed him greatly however, the underwear were tight and snug against his large feminine rear and rode up a little on his crotch, he could feel the sides digging into his \"back\" and the odd wrong feeling it produced, his back still felt like his front and his front felt like his back, but when he moved or looked down everything was all wrong. It also wasn't very comfortable laying down in his current position, his neck had no support and the bundle of pillows the placed there slipped when the nurse started changing him, however if he were to be moved to a sitting position he would only eat a facefull of pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he fell out of his daze the nurse had already hauled him out of the bed and into a wheelchair, it was an odd orthopedic adjustable wheel chair so the legs, arm rests, and back could be removed and fitted however they like, it seemed custom made and worn, it wasn't new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was able to face forwards in this chair and have a comfortable posture sitting as his new body allowed, it was the strangest feeling as if he was sitting on his chest, but his chest was very soft and cushioned, he could feel every breath he took as his butt cheeks expanded and contracted with every breath making him feel like he was slowly rocking in his seat up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't take it, call it the new hormones, the wrongness of his body, whatever you call it he broke down and cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse noticed a few trickles of moisture fall down her patients face, it was better she not be involved, sometimes it was best to leave some to their own emotions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip down to the transport van was in utter silence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rotten eggs and sulfur assaulted his senses as he was rudely awakened from one of his fainting spells, it was becoming increasingly common for him to lose his composure in the face of such oddness of late, maybe it had something to do with his new female hormones or if he was still in shock. The smelling salts were being waved under his nose by a slender womanly hand. He wanted to grab the hand and move it away, but when he attempted this motion all he served to do was kick weakly at the air with one of his small feet and wobble in his wheelchair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, I forgot...I'm a fucking freak\" Jim spat bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of that!\" Jim was startled as a voice to his left shouted at him, his eyes widened in surprise as he encountered an the bizarre sight of Mrs Spears disembodied head sitting atop a table beside him. Her head was perched atop a small custom made stand lined with some form of silk choker cradling her \"Neck\" that led to a silky sock that contained the other half of her ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rude to stare honey\" Mrs Spears chuckled at the young woman's shocked eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I I I'm S..sorry\" Jim stuttered as he blushed and turned his head away, annoyed as his longer hair covered his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, about it honey, I would be concerned if you didn't stare, at least you're mind isnt as damaged as some other poor souls\" Mrs Spears spoke sadly, but perked up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I didnt catch your name honey, I know I come off a bit strong but It's best to get used to your new situation sooner than later\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....My name....is..Jim, Jim tomes....I...eh\" He couldn't finish his sentence, hearing his own voice was painful to his ears, it made his situation all the more real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your a TeeGee, well as you can see me and my husband happen to be experts in dealing with those who experienced a shift in gender\" She explained as she motioned to below her chin, the long serpentine sock covered appendedge attached to her neck, and looked to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim almost forgot about Mrs Spears second half, literally in this case. Her decapitated body idly standing to his other side, still clad in nothing but it's birthday suit. Her body was the epitome of feminine sexuality. Even in his situation and the oddity of where he was couldn't completely eradicate his most base male instincts, feeling a warmth and tingling in his \"chest\" and \"back\" as he admired the bizarre sight of Mrs Spears headless body. He shook out of his bad thoughts and studied Mrs Spears body more closely, it bent down a bit and waved at him. Nestled in the place where a normal neck would have been was a slightly up raised mound raising from between the shoulders, a mound that wouldn't have looked odd if it was between a womans legs. Her body seemed to notice as Jim stared at it's \"neck\" and waved it's finger at him, it reached behind Mrs Spears head to a piece of fabric hanging off a hook attached to her head's holster. It daintily raised the this garment above it's shoulders and behind it's arms as if putting on a shirt. Jim nearly choked back a cough when the body was done, having applied a silky pair of red frilly panties over it's shouders to cover up it's bare vaginal mound above her collarbone. Jim was silent, this nude \"headless\" body having dressed itself in a single pair of panties it wore over it's shoulders to cover up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont mind Daniel, He likes to lay around\" Mrs Spear chuckled. Jim looked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He?\" Jim intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course, you're not the first to change sex...Daniel is my husband.\" She said proudly. While the body moved her side and struck a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...umm can...He see us?\" Jim asked, he could not find any trace of a face or eyes while he examined the headless pantie clad shouldered body posing comically behind Mrs Spears head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure he can, He can see, and hear us...the only thing he's incapable of is speech, which is rather difficult to do when you no longer have a head...or mouth...or anything resembling vocal chords..He's fully versed in sign language however, which is very helpful as other changed guests this is the only way of communication they have left.\" Mrs Spears body...well \"Daniel\" made motions with her hands in subtle ways to express it's speech, his limited knowledge of sign language allowing him to piece together the motions as \"Nice to meet you\". Jim gave a small weary smile, as Daniel gave a fist pump and gave a thumbs up at being acknowledged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youll have to excuse his enthusiasm, he's very greatful when people treat him as a person rather just an extension of myself, dont take it the wrong way but he's become extremely vain over the years\" She said the last part in a whisper, however Daniel overheard and did her best way of expressing a pout, cocking her shoulders and putting both hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How\" Jim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that dear?\" Mrs Spears was distracted as Daniel continued to pout silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can he see...there...he has no eyes?\" Jim asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that's on odd question\" Mrs Spears said dumbfoundedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? How? I dont mean to sound insensitive to you...Daniel, but you being alive is in impossibility. and you Mrs Spears...how can you even survive in such a state...it's scientifically impossible\" Jim shouted, causing Daniels shoulders to droop. Jim was suddenly filled with a bit of guilt at his sudden outburst, these two ...people were here to help him and he was doing nothing but whining. Mrs Spears face was overcome with a look of intense exhaustion, her older features having become more defined as weariness crossed over it. When she spoke it was in low tone filled with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"twenty five years\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"whu...\" Jim was cofused and concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty five years since I last heard Daniels voice, Twenty five years since we last held hands....twenty five years since we last kissed\" Mrs spears was staring down, her eyes drooping with the memories of her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty five years since I last saw any of my friends and family...twenty five years of...\" Her words were silenced by the touch of Daniels fingers to her lips, her body bending downwards and lifting Mrs Spears head to her bosom, cradling it like newborn baby and caressing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry\" Jim said sadly. She felt a strong wave a guilt wash over him. He gazed down at his form in the wheelchair, he didnt think he could ever get used to what he now was, and he guessed that the feeling was very common amongst the victims of The Magician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont be\" a muffled response came from Daniels bosom, Mrs Spears should her head and Daniel placed her head back on the pedastal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont be sorry, what that mad man did to us is inhumane and cruel. You are new to this world and it's understandable to be angry, In fact it's a sign of a healthy mind. No one deserves this. I used to be like you actually...I hated what I had become, I felt trapped and scared and helpless...I didn't know what was to become of me...everything felt unreal, like a nightmare you couldn't wake from. The more I lingered on these thoughts the more I loathed myself, I felt into a darkness and I admit that on occasion I've tried to....end it\" She paused abruptly, her face becoming serious and stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont want that to happen to you\" She smiled sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Jim was silent, taking in her words, did he even want to live if he was like this? a twisted freak? He looked over at Mrs Spears eyes, and looked back down unable to meet her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna lie, it's...painful and it will be extremely hard and difficult to come to terms with your situation but...You arent alone, We are all here for you. If it wasnt for Daniel, I dont know what I would have done...he cared for me, and helped me sort through my darkness when no one else could. I may be the \"Head\" of the foundation but Daniel has been the heart and soul of this facility since day zero\" She smiled at Daniel, her body folding it's arms over it's chest in embaressment, a slight tinge of redness developed under collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this emotional scene between Mrs Spears and Daniel no matter how odd evoked something within Jim that caused fresh tears to fall from his eyes, his thoughts were filled with nothing but visions of his wife. Would he ever see her again? Would she even still love him as he was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey what's wrong?\" Mrs Spears said while Daniel bent forward and gently laid a hand along the smooth curve of his ass below his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That monster, He took my wife...I...I miss her dearly\" He said lowly, his girlish voice sounding broken and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god honey...I'm sorry, I didnt know\" Mrs Spears gasped. She looked down at Jim. Her legs curled underneath his thighs. Her young beautiful female face showed nothing but despair. Daniel gently wiped away the tears that fell from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry Jim. But...You should have hope...dont give up..the PRT (Paranormal Recon and Tactical team) has a very high success rate at finding some of Max's warehouse, I'm sure there is a good chance your wife will be in the next one\" Mrs Spears declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she'll still love me?\" He asked in a childish voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it honey...You'll probably find yourself closer than ever...we have many couples rehabilitating here together, they've become nearly inseperable and many were rescues as well...just have patience and you'll see your wife once again\" Mrs Spears spoke hopefully. For once this caused a smile to grace his elfin features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mrs Spears...I'll do my best to....adjust\" Jim smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you feel that way, lets go meet your roomate and get you settled in\" She gestured with her chin as Daniel gave Jim a playful punch in the chin and picked up Mrs Spears head underneath it's arm and grabbed Jims wheelchair in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to meet Gina\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Setting up everything took a little longer than they thought it would, as a result...he was unable to open proceedings that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place might prove promising don't you think my dear?\" Max addressed Anjeia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" his assistant responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax then smiled as he lit up a cigarette, then he seemed to study it for a moment before stumping it out. \"Filthy habit!\" he muttered, before looking around at the theater's decor. \"Certainly not Las Vegas\" he shrugged, \"but I guarantee we'll get a few more products for the market\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will sir\" Anjeia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Anjeia, don't be so formal around me\" Max pleaded with his amnesia-struck assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Max\" she apologized, as she checked her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax just threw her a gentle smile. \"You look fine, as always!\" he assured her. \"Now...what do you say we see what the streets of this town have to offer us, me may get lucky\" Max chuckled, as he took hold of Anjeia's hand.</span></div></div>",

Max was dissapointed, he enjoyed an audience, the crowd and their reactions were like a drug to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'C'mon maureen!, just give me one chance! I swear I wont let you down again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance jack, every time I agree to go out with you all you try and do is get into my pants, We never even got kissing before I had you pawing at me and groping me like a horny little kid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im just lonely and I got needs, I dont really have alot of self control!, I promise I'll stop drinking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"pfft you stop drinking and I lose my best customer, but maybe i'll consider it, theres more to this bar than booze\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww mar, but your cooking is lousy!, why do you think we all get drunk when we come here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a real flatterer you know that jack, whatever ....OH!

She nodded approvingly and went to fetch some glasses, he sighed and wiped his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax studied the two and from their conversation with eachother already knew how he could help enlighten their lives! Well he couldn't wait to begin. So he didnt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So jack, I couldnt help but overhear, seems your having trouble trying to catch the sweet girl in the bar\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, well...We've always been good friends since she started college, and we had classes together. We both took english classes and I was always fascinated how she was a sci fi geek like me, we got along real well and went out a couple times\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuut....\" Anejeia interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...I was always too eager, and she didnt want any of it, we had more dates but it ended the same...I would get nervous and try to...well you know\" he gestured embarrasingly towards below the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I could help you with your problem friend, you and her could be together and There would no problem for you to get into her pants any time you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'id say your crazy, but at this point I'll give anything a shot\" jack sighed in defeat, not taking what Max say seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment maureen returned from the back with freshly cleaned glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax gave jack a chesire grin and turned to maureen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fellas, whaddya like?' she asked cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax gave maureen a lecherous grin and maureen seemed to stiffen up, that jack didnt like at all one bit, but he let it go, Maureen wouldn't be caught dead flirting with a jerk like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sweetie pie, I was hoping you would let my friend jack over there see what kind of panties you wear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack spit out his beer and stared at the man, he couldnt believe how arrogant this fool was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Maureen announced cheerfuly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just stared at her, thinking she was going to show this guy how she dealt with jerks like him, she kept a small revolver behind the bar, filled with blanks but it was enough to persuade the average druken joe to scram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand pulled her blue jeans right off her legs, and kicked them off to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared dumbfounded, he was transfixed by the sight of a half naked maureen, the girl he yearned for and lusted after for quite some time, as she pulled off her pants and revealed to him, that she wasnt even wearing any panties, she went commando! his maureen never wore underwear to work!? his cheeks burned and more blood was pumping elsewhere rather than his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, naughty little girl you even shave too!\" Max grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, she was shaved but the hair she did have was trimmed into a cute little pattern, the curly hairs forming a little arrow shaped goatee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now jack, lets help you with your little problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whu\" Jack tried to say as it felt as if he were being sucked into a whirlwind the world getting blurry and everything feeling cramped and mushy, almost if he was melting like hot wax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why wasnt jack doing anything!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed, inside of her only since to the outside observer all they saw was a half naked girl smiling like a dope behind the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was melting! Oh god, it was like his flesh was turned into butter and he melted. It was disgusting. Maureen was crying. She had grown to like Jack as a friend, and really enjoyed her time with him but she never had the heart to tell him she was really a lesbian. She went out with him those few times out of pity, but couldnt get over the fact that it felt more like going out with her brother rather than a lover. Besides she was already in a relationship with a girl she met in the english class as well, but she would never tell Jack that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now this man was smiling at her, while Jack was dying and I couldnt even move a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Jack vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did he go? did they finally kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to the floor gasping, out of breath and with tears streaming down her face. She remembered jack and got up to look over the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes empty, as he just fell out of them lay in a heap at the bottom of the stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for the revolver hidden at the bar and turned it at the man the woman smiling evily at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying and shaking she aimed it at them, and they laughed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the trigger, trying to scare them and gun started to vibrate loudly. confused she looked at her hands and dropped it on the floor, her gun had been transformed into some sort of sex toy, it resembled a gun however the barrel was now long rubber dildo, and the handle now an electric vibrator for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...whe....jack....why...\" She cried hysterically towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax just chuckled and he and Anejia strolled towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it very subtle and fitting\" Anejeia chimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Maureen I've got a long night ahead of me and as for jack, well you'll find he's exactly where he always wanted to be\" and with that they casually walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaureen was hysterical, they said that jack was okay, but where was he? she had stopped crying and looked down towards her \"Gun\" and kicked it away in disgust at with her bare feet. She should probably get some pants on, she looked around and spotted her pants towards where he kicked the \"Gun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent forward to retrieve her pants and looked towards her legs and stopped suddenly. She was staring at a pair of eyes nestled above her trimmed pubic hair. She thought they were a tatoo, but then they blinked rapidly at her and started moving around as if panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed the color of the eyes, light green with specks in them, Jacks Eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell down backwards on her butt still looking at her crotch and they winced as she fell down hard on the brick floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was mostly in shock from everything else that happened so she wasnt really thinking when she brought one of her hands towards her crotch and fingered at the eyes above her pussy. They looked annoyed and winced again as she prodded them clumsily. They felt real to her, she couldn't see out of them so that means they could only be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?...\" She whispered carefully. The eyes seemed to nod and light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unprepared as her lower lips seemed to slide together and open up on their own, her labia flapping wildly and her clit wiggling enticingly. She gave a sharp gasp and put her hands behind her as the sensations of her own living pussy expressed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack stop!\" and Immediatly he did as told, she came down from her suprise and took a few breaths before looking back between her legs, she reached her hand down again and the eyes went crosseyed as she inserted her finger into her folds and felt around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes on her crotch seemed to go half lidded as she probed jacks mouth, and felt around. Exploring her new genitals until she confirmed what she could feel inside, and pulled it out. Her pussy had a tongue as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of it, and ran towards the front door, locked it shut, sat down on one the stools and cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A born loser if she ever saw one, never really fit in with other crowds and too meek to assert himself, spending most of his time getting drunk, high or whatever else would occupy his time in the most non productive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was younger the other two, but he obviously looked up to these other two as role models, smaller, shyer but easily coerced into being the others little errand boy.

Their mouths sank int their faces until nothing was left but a blank area.  They panicked, hands searching their faces for their lost mouths.  \"Be still!\" she hissed.  The both of them froze, their eyes the only parts moving, erratically searching for escape.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe turned back to the young man.  His face was frozen in fear, but that only made Anjeia all the more excited.  She caressed his face, cooing to him, telling him it would be all right.  Of course, it would not, and he would know soon enough.  His facial features softened, becoming more feminine while his skin became smooth and shed all of his body hair except for his head.  His chest puffed up and out, becoming an enticing pair of A-cup breasts that were perky and soft.  The young man clutched his groin as his penis shrank away until it was absorbed by his body, only to be replaced by a plush new pussy.  His transformation was nearing completion, his body filling out the new curves and his face becoming more and more beautiful.  However, Anjeia decided to leave his short haircut, she thought it looked fairly interesting anyways.  When it was done, there stood in his place a buxom beauty wearing a polo shirt and beige shorts with a look of utter bewilderment.  She put a finger to the new female's lips, indicating that she was not to speak yet.  She obeyed for fear of worse repercussions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia motioned for the two men to come to her, and they obeyed.  She violently took their heads in her hands and pushed their faces onto the young wo(man's) tits.  Their bodies shimmered and began to melt into the girls bosom.  As hey did, her breasts grew in size.  the more the men melted into her the bigger they got.  By the time that both men were absorbed up to their wastes, her breasts had become massive F-cups.  Their legs were being absorbed, but their dicks and anuses were not.  Near the end of the transformation, the only thing left of the men were their dicks which faced upward on the girl's tits,and their assholes under their sacks.  Anjeia giggled, as their cocks became a nigger, reaching a foot long each, but all of their pubic hair disappeared and their dicks became a little more feminine looking.  As a final touch, she decided to give their mouths back.  The asshole holes plumped up and took on the sharp of very feminine lips which were large and supple.  One began to speak, but its new seductive voice was muffed byt eh huge hairless ball-sack in front of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with her work, she excused the new she-monster with her nipples mumbling curses at her.  the girl ran out of the bar to who knows where.  Anjeia didn't care, as she had obviously pleased Max greatly.  She could see him from across the bar, absolutely beaming with joy. </span></div></div>",

He felt tension building and building, his muscles cramping over one another as if he just had a major workout and the tension got stronger and warmer and more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin soon started rippling in waves like water, each motion his skin became firmer, more defined and taut with muscle and definition, his skin tone was even changing becoming more tan and shinier the more his muscles developed. His arms inflated like balloons, becoming massive hulking shoulders that were thicker than his entire waist used to be, ending in large meaty fists with veins that pulsed with strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmeanwhile his body developed further down below the belt, his thighs and calves pumping up with vein bursting muscle, until his entire body was nearly straining against his once oversized clothes, his body was built with enough muscle to put a champion bodybuilder to shame, complete with the full body tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"vogue for me baby\" she cheered to him, and soon he found himself in control of his own body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfilled with testosterone, adreniline and fear, he chose to obey her words and soon enough he was posing in various muscle man stances, his rational mind having taken a back seat to the amount of hormones racing through his body, he became overcome with raw lust for the woman admiring his muscles and soon tore off his pants and advance toward her, at which point she started pointing and bending over laughing harder, the over muscled young man stopped in his tracks and followed where her finger was pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his entire body had changed to the point of being unrecognizable as his original pale scrawny one, his tiny penis remained intact, looking even much more pathetic attached to his herculean body, overcome with rage and embarassment he charged at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP CUNT!\" he roared fists raised high, she stood in front of him and charged back, confused by this he was unprepared as she caught his fists like he was nothing and leaned in for a gentle kiss, which left his lips tingling with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry big boy, I'll make it much much bigger if you like\" she breathed in his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you can?\" he asked his mouth drooling to her face so close to his<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing...but.....It's gonna cost you\" she whispered while licking his ear and making him shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doo iiiit, I donts shcare!\" he asked nearly numb with anticpation and pleasure at her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled cruelly, went down on her knees and started kneading his member, each palm gently carressing it like a piece of dough, with each roll of her hands his manhood grew longer and thicker, more veins and it's skin changing hues to better match his new body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsoon his member was twice the length it was, the larger his cock grew the more changes were occuring to other parts of his body, as if his own penis was eating up all his masculinity, unnoticed by him his thighs and calves swelled with deposits of fatty tissue, his ass inflating and his hips widening with each inch his cock grew longer and thicker, so was his body gaining small traits of femininity. His muscles remained but his body gained a shape more fit to that of a female body builder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger and larger his cock grew till it passed his belly button that now curved downward attached to his much wider and rounder hips, his cock continued to crawl up his body and reaching the bottom of his breasts and inched their way past his expanding cleavage, the feelings of his own cock nestled between his own breasts sending shivers throughout his entire body....breasts, his breasts....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuh dduhh fuugh!?\" he shouted, looking down at his chest in a panic, and gasped as droplets of drool escaped his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nstarring back at him was a pair of tits that could put a porn star to shame, huge globes topped with erect nipples the size of a grown mans thumb, and areola that puffed up around them, easily each as big as an official NBA basketball, they stood firm against his frame his upper body muscles being put to use to naturally and proudly display his assets, and nestled tightly between them poking through his shiney tan new cleavage his own meaty prick still growing ever longer up to meet his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body became stiff again as he stared down at his own huge cock crawling through his giant tits, his fear growing every second it inched closer and closer to his face, trying desperately to move his head to no avail as it neared his lips....and passed right through with no resistence whatsover. beyond disturbed, he tried to pull back and close his mouth but found his lips werent responding, he swirled his tongue in his mouth to find his teeth and found only meaty walls of flesh and a slighlty salty and sour taste. further probing only found his ever growing cock forced deeper down his throat and he could do nothing but lash at it futily with his tongue, which only proved to stimulate himself to the point where he gave up trying to fight back and happily acccepted his own cock further down his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia stepped back as she finished with her latest experiment, and watched as the bewildered musclebound she'male she created began to slowly and steadily fuck the meaty pussy that replaced her mouth, the large clit that replaced her nose growing large and erect between her eyes while sucking down her own penis that would never grow flaccid and balls that would never empty, never once had she tampered with the young mans mind, leaving him a slave to his own pleasures, the only movements she made other than bobbing her head up and down on her own shaft were to mash and tweak her breast against her massive cock every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe directed the face fucking muscle bound shemale to the door and out to meet max, it walked slowly, every step forcing her to hump her own face more and more, while Anjeia turned back to the rest of the victims who watched everything unfold.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anjeia walked over to the young man, seizing him up as she closed in.  He was muscular and handsome, the generic school jock if there ever was one.  Anjeia saddled up to him, one leg around his waist and her hand in his pants.  His girth wasn't anything to be ashamed of either, and was the exact opposite of the previous victim's.  It grew erect under her touch, and Anjeia was fairly impressed with the youth's endowment.  However, she was here to impress, not be impressed.  Her fingers firmly gripped his cock at the base, balls and all, and she tugged it upward.  It came loose with an almost inaudible pop, and soon she was holding the jock's cock before his eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia idly rubbed it with her hands, admiring it.  IT was obvious that the jock could still feel her touch, if his eyes were any indication.  Even as she toyed with it, it grew harder and a drop of pre formed at the tip.  There was a loud 'slap' as Anjeia whacked the jock in the face with his own prick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuhuh bad boy, not until I am ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then left the jock and headed towards the young woman.  Tears were streaming down here face in abject fear as Anjeia slowly approached her.  She wiped them away with the head of the cock, cooing sweet nothings to the girl and teasing her with the dick as she made up her mind about what to do.  As she drew the cock across the girls lips, an idea struck her.  She opened the girls mouth and removed her tongue with her free hand.  Then she stuck the penis into the girl's mouth, base first and fused it with the bottom of her mouth.  The girl's eyes stared down at her deformed face, her lips unable to close now due to the cock stuck in her mouth  The dick itself pushed her upper lip almost to her nose, while the balls, unable to fit inside, hung over her lower lip.  And yet, Anjeia still was not finished.  She tugged on the head of the penis, making it look like she might pull it out, however the cock instead began to stretch and stretch until it reached all the way down to her breasts.  She then gripped the girl under the chin and pulled her head clean off of her body, but something trailed her head as it was yanked out. From the boys view he could see the girl, already doomed with one cock on her head, had now grown a humongous cock from the underside of her head now too.  This one was almost equal in length to her torso, but was about a foot longer and almost as think as her neck had been.  Satisfied with the result, Anjeia tossed the head aside, which caused the girl to become entangled in both of her cocks, and walked back over to the boy.  She caressed his chin with her free hand, the other still holding on to the tongue.  She then squeezed his face hard causing his mouth to open wide, and she dropped the tongue in.  She then closed his mouth, and watched the magic work.  His cheeks bulged out in odd angles, and it became apparent that the tongue she had placed in there was violently thrashing about.  While this was going on, the jocks body was changing.  His shirt bulged out as breasts began to grow upon his chest, and his pants and underwear fell down, revealing his blank crotch and new slim waist.  His face, with the tongue still worming around in it, became much more feminine, and in fact, it came to look exactly like the girl that had just been transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments he, now she, was an exact copy of what the girl had looked like before, sans vagina.  Anjeia quickly fixed that, as a hole appeared in the center of his crotch, which grew into a new pussy almost immediately.  Then, just like the girl before him, Anjeia took his/her head of her body and another long dick neck was attached to it.  She threw his hea into the pile of cock that was the earlier girl and set to work.  She placed both hands on the headless jock's shoulders and pushed down, hard.  The top portion of her body sank into her waist except for her breasts and arms.  Anjeia detached the arms as well and placed them on the previous girls body, just below her original arms.  She then turned her attention back to the reduced girl.  She was now nothing more then tits ass and legs, and that was exactly what she had wanted.  She picked the the jock up and carried the reduced girl over to the other girl.  Then, she spun the legs upside down so that she her legs were aimed at the ceiling.  She made sure that their vaginas were facing the same way and then she firmly planted the jock's torso onto the other girl's blank shoulders.  Where the jock's form ended, that being the tits right above her navel, the other girl's clavicle fused, filling in the blank area left by the absence of her head.  It looked as though the body had a second pair of legs and breasts for a head.  With a wicked grin, Anjeia went and picked up the two dick neck women.  She grabbed them by the tip of their new dick necks, and dragged them to their new shared body.  She Shoved the jock into the upper vagina, sliding her thick neck penis into the their body until it's head came out of their lower pussy and rubbed against their thighs.  Likewise, she took the girl with a dick for a tongue, and inserted her into their shared anus, pressing hard until her cock jutted out from between their lower butt-cheeks.  Pleased with her latest demented creation, she lifted their frozen state and order them to walk out to Max.  The girl tried to scream at her as their body made its way outside, but her lips were too tightly wrapped around the penis attached to her mouth.  Speaking of which, the jock attempted to yell at her too, but all that came out was a gargled \"spluh\".  When the jock opened his mouth, several long tongues spilled out of it, each covered ij saliva and rubbing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia blew them a kiss as they made their way out the door and to their new owner(s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to her next victim and chose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anjeia silently appraised the young woman slutty clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me girl, do you enjoy your job?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman suddenly found herself in control of her own body again, and tried desperately to make for the exit when her vision started suddenly spinning and falling. Two soft female hands smothered her face and she was looking directly into the eyes of the perverted witch woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you a question girl, I've relieved your head of its shoulders, and if you continue to disobey me or start screaming, i'll just have to make sure you wont have anything to scream with\" Anjeia spoke dangerously, spinning her head around to show her her headless body frozen in mid run, the young womans head began to sob into Anjeias hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, there there, baby girl, everything I do is for pleasure, yours and mine...it's nothing to be afraid of, you...of all people should appreciate that\" she cooed, cradling the womans head, slowly her tears abated. The young woman continued to sniffle quietly into anjeias bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"see, now...lets see if we can continue this conversation with some level headedness\" bringing the womans head to face her own, suprisingly eliciting a giggle from her. This suprised Anejeia, most of the people she changed were cowering in fear or pleading for mercy. Intruiging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" she looked over at the womans body, and noticed for the first time the hard little points that capped off each side of her sheer tube top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me girl...did seeing what I did to those people arouse you?\" The head in her hands gasped, and tried to turn away while she flushed red, Anjeia chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" The young woman tried futily to look away, useless as it was she returned her eyes to face anjeias and began to plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...I dont want to be a freak....just..let me go and I'll never tell anyone about what I saw...I promise\" she begged, anjeia began to gently smooth away her tears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry baby, I have to change you\" The girl lowered her vision in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"however....I like you, I'm feeling a bit generous....you tell me what you want done to your body...and I'll change it at your discretion...and...and...i'll let you go afterwards\" Anejeia looked nervously towards the entrance, she hoped Max would understand. The womans head looked up at her in surprise and tried to nod excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be creative now\" Anjeia said as she angled the womans head to face her frozen headless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia wondered what the girl would come up with, it was very rare that she and max let anyone willingly change their own bodies, half the fun of their magic was watching their victims squirm in helplessness. Their terror and pathetic forms gave her such a high no drug could simulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make me shorter...not to short though...I've always been self concious of being to tall\" Anjeias was interrupted from her thoughts by the womans request, dissapointed although with how mundane it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is that all you can think of girl, I'm doing you a favor here, I said be creative or I'll just come up with my own ideas\" Anjeia said impatiently. This caused the head to in her hands to began panicking, biting her lip and staring back at her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"can you...make me shorter, by a foot...but....turn my feet into high heels?\" Anjeia considered her request and smiled, it was just kinky enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"watch closely\" She said as held the womans head to her breasts and waved her hands up and down the headless body. The young woman gasped as she watched her body dwindle in size her once former five foot eight inches shrinking. Her proportions keeping their overall shape, until she reached a height of four foot eight inches just as she asked. She marveled at the sight of her miniature body...almost doll like in appearence with none of that unnescesary pudgy distorted look you would find on most people of similar height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ncircling around Anjeia bent down behind the body and pointed the womans head at the back of her heels, as the shoes she was wearing seemed to melt off her skin and and the red hue spreading out permanently tattooing her feet a vibrant crimson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the way you think, about the heels, it's subtle enough...so I'm going to add my own flare...but this is my final warning, the next set of changes have to be more exotic or I WILL do as I please with you\" Anjeia warned, causing the girl in her hands to flinch. Rolling her head over she gave her lips a quick little peck causing the girl to gasp as she suddenly regained feeling and movement of her detached body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this..this is ....increadible.\" The girls head stuttered, she was interrupted as she felt the next set of changes begin, her heels having completely absorbed into her feet, leaving her with a shiny bright red foot that tapered into a sharp point the shape of an open toed sandal, the stilleto having fallen away. Her heels were forced off the ground until she was balance on the tips of her feet. A seam was inching it's way up from her \"toes\" down the middle till it reached the end of her heels, she gasped as the seam suddenly blossomed from within. The soles of her feet having become a pair of sturdy sensitive labia, as she shuddered at the sensation of the bones in her legs become hollow or dissolve completely. Her breath became ragged as the tips of her heels started to bulge, a fleshy hole burrowing outwards as the large pair of clits extended downwards towards to the floor. Each heel clit was structured specially, she would be able to extend them at will and would be able to balance on them with no discomfort, having being made sturdy and capable of resisting the elements. Making even walking a sexual experience from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how it's done honey, I'll even make you a special pair of shoes to go along with those new built in fuck me pumps\" Anjeia giggled, laughing at the sight of the headless body stumbling around on it's new feet, trembling at each step. The womans head moaning within her hands. She snapped her fingers in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back to me honey...The next set of changes, I dont have all day\" It took a little bit before the young womans head could focus again, and she flushed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gasp...huff...uhh...oooh....give me....Large breasts...huuu\" she huffed out, Anjeia was about to give up on the girl and her mundane changes when the headless body shuddered and fell to the floor groping itself madly, and her head letting out a long moan, she started screaming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh, Large breasts...mmmmw with mouths instead of nipples,...and....tooongues....and sensitive tongues.....and my ass, please, ooooh some breasts from ass, UuuUUUhhh with large teats....UGH! and...and...my asshole, huff...huff into ..aaaaahhhh cunt...oooooooooooohhhgoawd\" her body writhed on the ground, alternating rubbing at it's heels and using the lubricant leaking from her soles to rub in between it's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you girl, you're free now\" Anjeia smiled bringing the womans head in for a kiss, stuffing as much as her tongue down her throat as possible. The woman couldn't see but felt her body changing, her breasts swelling with an unnatural warmth, Her breasts grew into a size far larger than would be normal of a woman her stature. Her nipples grew large and thick, the tips inflating and then growing flat against the areola as they split sideways becoming a pair of luscious bee stung lips, each with a natural glossy red tint. The lips parted as a pair of tongues slipped between them and slathered against the sides of her breasts, each lick feeling as sensitive as her own pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass became bloated with tissue, rounding out and becoming firm. They sagged very little, with fat filling in all the right places. Each cheek developed  largish nipple within the center, she moaned harder as each of the areola soon inflated becoming another pair of luscious lips, instead of tongues the inside of each mouth sucked upon the sensitive nipple within. The warmth soon spread between her new pair of breasts, her wrinkled anus began to flower outwards, fleshy lips developing. The pussy that replaced her ass was larger than normal, it reached all the way up to her tailbone, where now a large golfball sized clitoris wiggled back and forth from. She reached back to tweak at this new growth as a heat surged throughout her arms, which spasmed with pleasure. The palms began to split and soon another pair of vaginal lips adorned each palm, each of her middle fingers having been converted into a flexible clitoris as well. Anjeia could no longer keep up with the girl as she was soon caught within the throes of multiple coelescing orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to go home honey\" Anjeia cooed, as she commanded her body to stand, trembling through it's orgasms. Bringing the womans head over it's shoulders, she kneaded between them until she worked her fingers in past her knuckle in the newly grown cunt at her collar bone. The final gift she gave to the woman unnoticed all this time, her neck tapered down into a large feminine penis. Anjeia made sure her shoulder pussy was tight enough and her dick neck thick enough for her neck to balance properly. With a final kiss to the moaning girls head, she gently lowered her neck into it's new home, eliciting a long groan from all five of her mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need these...now hurry, and go out the back door so max doesnt see you\" She laid down a pair of odd strap on sandals at her feet and instructed her to put them on, when she did so her pussy soles were soon impaled upon a pair of medium sized gently vibrating dildos, sheilding her sensitve lips from the dirty ground. Anjiea quickly conjured up a large trenchoat and scarf, throwing it over her shoulders and fastining tightly while trying to keep her from fondling herself. Wrapping the scarf around her now sticky neck, she ushered the woman towards the back door. Anjeia smiled a rare gentle smile as she watched the woman wobble pleasurably into the darkness, pleased with the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more to go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The store was nearly vacant now, only faint scents of sex, the store clerk and Anjeia herself remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sugar, dont take it personal...It's just business\" Anjeia was sure that Max was getting impatient, she got carried away with the last change...one that wouldn't even be making them any profit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to stay and watch you squirm, but time is money honey\" She tittered to the frozen store clerks face, her hands began to move in strange sensual gestures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia didn't spend as much time on his transformation as the others, she had clients to please. The best sellers of their catalogue was by and far transformed young women, of course this doesn't mean they're all born that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swipe of her hand the store clerk was left in the nude, leaving him wearing nothing more than the thick amount of curly hair that carpeted his chest, arms and legs. The next swipe of her hands literally blew every single hair off his body not on his head. A couple more gestures had his skin smoothing over and becoming tan, his chest widening and his waist shrinking. His height diminished with each inch his pecs inflated with soft fatty tissue. Hips widening into firm cushions, and his groin curving inwards has his manhood was slurped into his body like a limp spaghetti noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was satisfied, in place of the store clerk now slim beautiful bare naked woman topped off with the head of an slightly balding older man. The clerk felt every sensation as his body shifted underneath his frozen face, panic flooding his eyes. Anjeia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to make such a fun toy\" gripping the clerks head she brought her lips in for a kiss, while massaging his head. Each second the kiss lasted, years seemed to slip off his wrinkled features, softening and becoming feminine. Patches of shiney brown hair filled in the missing spots of his balding head, reaching down to his now petite shoulders. His eyes fluttered as they changed from dull brown to a now vibrant green with large plucked eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia pulled back and admired the face of the new woman, which just oozed sex and sensuality. Large innocent doe eyes, petite button nose atop full blood red lips pursed in a permanent pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the fun part\" Ajeia cracked her knuckles as she pulled back and grabbed at the womans shoulders, forcing her above the store countertop. The clerk felt a bizzare sense of vertigo  and pressure in her abdomen as she was manhandled by the with woman, as she was pulled further over the countertop. Her vision came back into focus as she stared up at the witch woman from a lower point of view, however she could still see the edge of the counter in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia stared down at the distorted womans form, as she seemed to become aware of the latest change. A truly bizzare sight. The former clerk now only stood two and half feet tall at most, her body was literally squished down into itself. Her breasts took up most her torso and forced her chin directly into her cleavage, her large breasts looking outrageous compared to the rest of her body. The bottom her breasts completely obscured her groin, of which now housed large plump labia with a bloated clit. she no longer had any legs to speak of, her feet connected directly into her upper thighs, making her ass seem huge. She pitifuly tried to waddle away while her hands attached only at her shoulders now flapped uselesly against her breasts, sending the flesh at her chest and backside to jiggle enticingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and now for the finishing touches\" Anjeia reached down and palmed at the waddling womans face and pushed her over onto her back. Anjeia kept her palm over the womans face as she struggled to bend her body forward, like a turtle unable to get off it's own back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia pulled her hand back and helped the poor thing stand up straight atop the counter, pleased with the changes she made. The womans face looked no different before until Anjeia reach forward and started gently kneading at the womans large pouty lips and pinched them shut. With a wicked smile into the panicking womans eyes she pulled at her lips and felt them give way. Her lips attached to a thick fleshy stalk that slipped free from the small hairless moist slit beneath her nose. Anjeia set the lips attached to the underside of a small thick penis aside and reached towards the womans nose this time, pulling until it to gave way revealing it to have been attached to a large dick as well, however behind it was only a small puckered anus. She continued this until all that remained on the poor girls face was a cluster of three small pussies surrounding a tight little sphincter. Her eyes, mouth and nose each attached to the base of a small thick penis, her eyes were situated to look upon her somewhat featureless face. Anjeia proceeded to remove the womans ears in the same manner, leaving behind moist cunts on each side of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll make such a cute little fuck toy, Mr's fuck head!\" Anjeia giggled as she repeated the motions of removing each of her hands and feet in the same way, now completely helpless. The womans eyes teared up at the end of each of her eye shafts, however the tears obscured her vision as they were now a thick milky white. the former store clerk resembled an obscene version of a mrs potato head doll, all of her parts being interchangeable with eachother. anjeia freed her nipples from the pussies on her chest and stuck them in the cunts where here eyes once were, the disembodied lips moaned as the penis it was attached to rippled in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe completely re-arranged the face of the poor girl, her eyes replaced the nipples on her breasts while her feet and hands were switched around. Anjeia finished her off by inserting her mouth penis into the waddling womans asscrack, her pouty red lips smothered by the large firm cheeks. She spent a little time teasing each of it's bare orifices while muffled moans escaped the creatures behind as it steadied on its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll fetch a high price indeed\" Anjeia grinned. She bent forward to retrieve her bounty when the front entrance chimed, and three men ran in wearing ski masks brandishing weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ON THE GROUND!\"  the middle one demanded to anjeia, her body obscuring the transformed store clerk. Max must have let them in on purpose knowing full well that Anjeia could handle herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is gonna be fun\" she smiled enticingly and strutted towards the men.</span></div></div>",

Each was carrying a gun in their hand and pointing it in every direction to anybody that might pop out unexpectedly from the aisles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, what is this...there's only this bitch here\" The masked man on the left said. He pointed the gun in her direction while the other two did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the store clerk cunt!\" The middle one barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...this dont feel right, somethings wrong here\" the one on the right said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid the clerk stepped out, but I'm sure I could help you three\" Anjeia stated as she dropped her arms and folded them to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck man, You said this was going to be cut and dry...what is with this crazy bitch\" The left one shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, we only have her to deal with now right? she's just some stupid slut, forget about her and get the cash from the register\" The middle one said, waving the gun around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, but what about the safe, without the clerk we aint got no safe...this whole thing is going to be a bust\" the right one stated, lowering his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis started a heated argument involving all three, as they quickly escalated into a loud shouting match. Anjeia became irritated at being ignored so suddenly, these three couldn't seem to work well together and they did a horrible job at coordinating a robbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat loudly and ceased their arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rude to keep a lady waiting gentlemen\" Anjeia said impatiently. The masked robber on the left became quickly enraged, pointing his gun back at her and advancing slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shut you mouth you stupid bitch, Or I'll shove more than just this gun down your throat you fucken cunt...now be a good little girl and get on the fucken --\" He was suddenly cut off as voice cut off abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, You're such an asshole\" Anjeia mocked as she snapped her fingers and silenced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked robber that was approaching her had stopped in his tracks, he seemed to struggle a bit, his head moving wildly as he began to silently panic, his eyes widened in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man...the fuck is your problem\" the middle robber asked, watching his partner thrash wildly around, not saying a word even though he was the most talkative of the group. He dropped his gun in his panic landing at the other two robbers feet as he reached towards his collar and began to peel the mask from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you doing you idiot dont take off your mask you'll blow your.....JESUS FUCK!\" The robber on the right yelled in disgust at the sight that greeted him when his partner unveiled his face. A large pink sphincter had replaced his mouth and nose, the only facial features left were his helpless panicked eyes above it. He began to claw at his face, being careful not to touch the wrinkled pink hole that he believed now replaced his mouth and nose. His panic caused him to hyperventilate which caused small obscene sounds to escape his face. He trembled and staggered over to the other two robbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY WOAH BACK OFF YOU FREAK...WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?\" The left on shouted while pointing his gun towards his asshole faced partner. Quickly forgetting Anjeia standing calmly smiling like a chesire cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mister tough guy afraid of your own friend now\" Anjeia giggled. The Robber shouted at her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO...YOU WITCH!....OH GOD THIS IS SICK!\" He screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, stop being such a pussy...actually you know what...start being one!\" She snapped her fingers once again, and suddenly the scared robber had suddenly dissapeared like a pop soap bubble. His clothes fell the ground, his gun clattering loudly on the linoleum floor. The last unchanged robber was stunned at the chaos around him, all of sudden his simple liquor store theft had turned into some bizarre otherwordly nightmare, he saw his partner struggling to breath and come to terms with his new changed state, his chest puffing up and down while he could hear small flatulant sounds eminating from his \"mouth\". The sudden dissapearence of his other partner just served to further his shock. He looked towards the grinning woman in the store and did the only thing he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I give up\" The robber said, and dropped his gun and put up his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...so easily? thats it? not going to scream and run away or try and shoot me\" She asked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know how you did what you did, but I dont care...please let me go\" He stated calmly like a robot, he was in an intense state of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry honey but I cant do that, I have to complete the set after all\" She grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber was confused, what was she talking about, complete the set? She gestured oddly as she pursed her lips and blew him a kiss. He groaned as he suddenly felt very light headed, the ski mask on his face suddenly felt very tight and confining but oddly comforting, his head felt heavy and odd. He glanced towards his anus face partner, his eyes above his wrinkled hole were pointing at him with fear in his eyes. He reached up to his pull the mask from his face and felt something weird beneath it. As he touched his face, his fingers encounter the cotton of the mask and felt the odd firm yet squishy flesh beneath it. Fear engulfed him and he yanked the mask from his head, struggling as it seemed to stretch and bend his vision in odd ways, and catch on his nose causing an intense feeling of wrongness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia chuckled as the last robber discovered his change, his head having become truly large and fat womanly breast, the only features being a large thumb sized nipple perched cutely below his panicked eyes. He wobbled it to and fro causing him to become diizzy fast. She sighed, she could relish in their fear all day long and never tire of it, but she had more to do tonight and dealing with these bozos was just a bit of fun on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already bored me, lets just finish this up shall we?\" She gestured  as she waved her hands and watched with some amusement as the two remaining robbers vanished as well leaving beneath nothing but a pile of clothing. Anjeia perched down to the pile of clothes that once belonged to the man with the anus on his face, and rummaged through them until she let out a coo and said \"found you\", pulling forth an strange fleshy lump. She petted the lump gently for a while as she admired it's form. A large pair of disembodied feminine buttocks, along with two swiveling eyes situated above its tailbone blinking in confusion. She cradled it under her arm and went to root through the next pile of clothing, beloging to the the boob headed robber. Repeating the same motions and pulling forth another fleshy lump. This one in the form of a large Q cup sized breast topped by humongous erect nipple nearly two inches long and an inch thick. Anjeie flicked the nipple idly watching as the eyes above it flinched in pain and then widened as small beads of milk dribbled from it's nipples tip. Situating the large breast underneath her other arm she approached the last pair of discarded clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnjeia placed the ass and the boob on the floor facing the clothes and proceeded to pull every piece of fabric away until the floor was bare, the only thing left was a pair of boxers covering and odd lump that moved very slightly. Anjeia quickly snatched up the boxers and unveiled the new form of the robbers partner, the ass and the breast were considering their new situation as they looked upon their friends form. He now resembled some sort of perverted slug, a quivering lump of flesh about ten inches long and four inches wide that flared out at its midesection and tapered of to a point. It's front was nothing more than a wet drooling vagina, an large eyeball situated at point where you would find a womans clit. It crawled pitifully on it's own \"face\" using it's cunt to grasp the floor and undulate it's inner and outter lips to move itself, leaving a slimey mess wherever it moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well gals, I think it's time to meet max\" She laughed and picked up the pussy slug, along with the ass and boob. She wondered what to do with the pussy slug when she came up with a wonderfully delicious idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better start sucking honey or I'll leave you where you fall\" She said into the eye clit of the pussy slug, it blinked as Anjeia picked it up and placed it's pussy directly on the turgid nipple of the sentient breast, it automatically began to suction itself to the breasts surface completely engulfing the nipple and covering the areaola. Smiling in satisfaction, she gathered up the ass and breast, it's eyes rolling back in pleasure as the pussy slug sucked and sucked at it's nipple. Anjeia wondered if the ass felt left out and idly jammed her thumb up it's hole, the eyes widening in shock as it could do nothing but pucker and grasp at the intruding appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I'm going to have to get you a pacififer....and maybe some diapers\" Anjeia joked. As she strutted towards the convient store exit to greet max once again.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is the place to further play with the adventures or mis adventures of the evil magician Max Von Crucial. For those of you who are new, Max Von Crucial is a \"business man\", using magic, he transforms people into objects and sells them on the open market. The transformations are usually sexual and perverse in nature and his victims rarely escape but it does happen.  I find the stories of the \"escapees\" are the most intersting :)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease see the accompanying yahoo group at <span class=\"clblue\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Max_Von_Crucial/</span> for further background.  I will be posting some of the first chapters here, then as you get the feel for Max, you are free to take him to places I haven't thought of yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Initial Cast of Characters</b><br>\r\nMax Von Crucial<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal Name: Unknown<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20190\u2019\u2019<br>\r\nWeight: 175lbs<br>\r\nEye Color: Black<br>\r\nHair Color: Black with Grey<br>\r\nPlace of Birth: Unknown<br>\r\nAge:  Unknown but appears to be mid fifties in the current incarnation.<br>\r\nKnown Relatives:  Unknown <br>\r\nBusinesses Associates:  Several anonymous located worldwide<br>\r\nMarital Status: Single<br>\r\nHistory:<br>\r\nMax is an ageless being that has taken on several different forms since the 1700\u2019s, currently terrorizing North America in the desert Southwest.  Previous case investigations happened in 1950 in Lima,  1920 in Cairo, 1875 in Beijing, 1850 in Constantinople, 1810 in London the first such report in1710 again in London.   The details of these reports are still classified Top Secret, however with the creation of the Dept. of Homeland Security in 2002, the events themselves were downgraded to Secret from Top Secret in effort to consolidate intelligence.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPersonality: Max appears to be gentle, very charismatic.   Intelligence believes he lures his victims into a false sense of security and then unleashes his hell upon them.  In truth, Max is perverted, greedy, sadistic and manipulative.  Money, power and perfection seem to be his only motivating factors.  If it doesn\u2019t make monetary sense, then he\u2019ll move on, which is why he often leaves victims behind who would not bring the maximum market value.   Max believes in a prophecy that says when he dies, a female will take his place.<br>\r\n************************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVonCrucial orgranization:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax has one sidekick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal Name:  Anjeia Stoykovitch<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20198\u201d<br>\r\nWeight 120<br>\r\nEye Color: Green<br>\r\nHair Color:  Black<br>\r\nPlace of Birth:  Believe to be Belgrade<br>\r\nAge:  Believed to have been born in the late 1700\u2019s, but appears to be in her early 20\u2019s<br>\r\nKnown Relatives:  Deceased/unknown<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality:<br>\r\nAnjeia is quiet, calculating and drives a harder bargain than Max which is why he has chosen to keep her rather than transform her and recycle her into the market.
