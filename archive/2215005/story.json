Conan was on his way home from school when he received a text message from Haibara, she decided to stay home at school, apparently, she was close to completing a permanent antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan ran as fast as he could to Agasa's house accidentally bumping into a few people along the way. He stooped once he passed by the gates of the Kudo Mansion. If he was going to return to his original body, then he was going to need some larger clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan dashed inside the Mansion and grabbed his old clothes and quickly ran to the house next door.  Once inside he saw Haibara standing in the middle of the living room, wearing her usual lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is it?\" Conan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaibara held out her right hand, revealing a small white pill. She warned him about the potential side effects that may occur with this new antidote. Conan plucked the small pill from her hand and made his way to the bathroom.
