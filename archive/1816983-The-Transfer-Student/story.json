Standing up you streach and go into your bathroom and take a shower. Standing in front of the mirror you adjust your bra and smooth your skirt. Staring at your face in the mirror you are worried  that you have a bit of shadow on your face. Quickly you remove it, leaveing your face perfectly smooth.<br>\r\n\"I hope nobody can tell that I'm a boy\" you think as you walk down the street to your new school, Ayame Academy.<br>\r\nAs you walk in the front doors you smile as you walk down the hall. As you continue down the hall you become aware of a lot of wispering around you.<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Look at her! Who is she?\" says a boy behind you.<br>\r\n\"You spacecase!

You are so shocked to see that the hallway behind you is full of students watching you intently and wispering among themselves. Still looking over your shoulder, you turn the corner and run into another student. The other student falls on the floor and you fall on top of him. A sudden hush fills the corridor.<br>\r\n\"Mmff\" a voice says from under you \"Well, since I wasn't fully awake I guess I am now. Are you hurt at all?\"<br>\r\nYou open you eyes and find yourself looking at one of the most beautiful boy you have ever seen. He has freckeled nut-brown skin, dark red hair, and brillant blue-green eyes.<br>\r\n\"Umm...Hello. Are you okay?\" he says<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you ask \"Oh, uh...umm, me? umm...I-I-I'm fine. yeah, I'm great.
