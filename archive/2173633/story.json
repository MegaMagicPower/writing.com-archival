She couldn't exactly remember what happenned, but for now all mattered was that she was alive, free and on an island probably.  She could hear the noises of the crashed plan not so far from her, maybe she was not the only one to have survive. She wasn't sure sure about what to do, try to help the other was probably the only thing to do, she didn't want to be alone after all. But what if the US Marshall Edward Mars has survived to ? the one who arrested her and brought her in that plane .<br>\r\nAnyway for now Kate decided to reach the ground, and climbed down the tree carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the meantime, a group of few passengers jus woke up and helped each other, but the whole environnement they where in was so big, they couldn't believe that it was real, it was like they landed into a kind of giant Island. Many of them were scared, and due to the confusion, one of them decided to be in charge of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Listen to me, we'll figure out where we are, but for now i'm asking you to remain calm. We have survived and we will continue to survive as long as we stay together \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's the personn talking ?</span></div></div>",

But Claire couldn't do anything more than taking a sunbath at the beach, thought that she tried to help the camp by her way. Being pregnant didn't mean she was useless, and she intented to prove it. But today, there were nothing she could really do.  So she took a nap at the beach, when something's strange happenned : she felt like a presence all around her. It was not her companions, it was something different, she couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the meantime, a man being too curious about the \"giant visitors\" coming from the sky was walking around a giant blonde and pregnant woman. His friends warned him to not approach any giant, but it was useless. And now he looked at a giant beautiful woman sleeping on the sand, wondering what to do.</span></div></div>",

Claire couldn't remember how many days, weeks are months they were here with no one to rescue them. Her life for now was here, with all the survivors and Aaron her son. <br>\r\nBut these was not vacations, mostly when you have a black smoke monster into the Jingle, or the \"Others\", some people living on the island, who were hostiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Charlie ! \" Claire headed to her closest friend among the survivors with her baby in her arms. \"i was wondering if you can take care of Aaron for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sure i can help ! let me take him \" Charlie replied always excited to help Claire. \" Is there something's wrong ? \" he asked while hugging the boy in his own arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I think, i just need to be alone for a moment, i mean, i'm taking care everyday of Aaron, i don't get anytime for me \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ooh ! You know i can come with you, i'll have Aaron with me you'll don't need to...\" Charlie stopped, as he realized that Claire just said she needed some free times.  \" Just don't get too far ok ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah. Thank you Charlie. And please don't tell Jack \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No problem and if you have any problem just scream and i'll come \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded and left Charlie and Aaron together. She started to walk all along the beach, barefoot on the water. She didn't want to go into the jingle anyway.
