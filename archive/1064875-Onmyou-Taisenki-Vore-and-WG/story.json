These humans have Drives, devices that allow them to work with their Shikigami partner. When in battle, if a Shikigami is destroyed, the Toujinshi loses any memories they have gained since they met their Shikigami and bonded. <br>\r\n   Shikigami are all unique, and belong to certain groups. Many of them have an anthropomorphic appearance. Shikigami have basic attacks, but more powerful attacks can be used if the Toujinshi moves there Drive in certain directions in certain patters, creating a 'seal'. Example-The Toujinshi moves their drive up, down, left and then left, which creates a seal, and the Shikigami they have will use a special attack, also known as a Hissatsu.<br>\r\n   Shikigami are summoned by positioning the drive in front of oneself, and saying- 'Shikigami! Summon!' as well as pressing a button on the Drive that makes it morph into it's true form, usually by two side panels flipping out.<br>\r\n   When a Shikigami comes out, they say their title and name, and then 'Kenzan!' Example: When Kogenta the White Tiger is summoned, he says- Byakko No Kogenta! Kenzan!<br>\r\n   That about concludes the overview on Shikigami.</span></div></div>",

Kogenta seems to not need to eat, but, in this story, that's different. <br>\r\n   Kogenta's fur is white, and his stripes are blue. His eyes are a reddish color.<br>\r\n   A basic reference pic of Kogenta can be found here-<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19625069/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1962...</a> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   \"Riku! Slice the In!\" Kogenta said to his partner. Riku Tachibana did just that, maneuvering his Drive in a certain way, constructing the Seal that did one of Kogenta's basic attacks. <br>\r\n   \"Hissatsu! Crescent Moon Dancing Fists!!\" Kogenta said as he leaped forward, his claws swiping through the air, destroying the horde of Youkai(demons) before them. <br>\r\n   The youkai were shredded by the Shikigami's incredible power, dissapearing. But then, an orb of swirling red and black energy ball appeared in the sky where the youkai were previously. A crimson lightning bolt shot down, striking the ground and leaving a small crater in it. Just barely, Riku and Kogenta could see a shadow within it as the smoke cleared. Two blood red eyes could be seen gazing at them through the smoke.<br>\r\n   \"Heh heh heh, excellent work, Kogenta of the Byakko...\" the figure said.<br>\r\n   \"Who the hell are you? How do you know my name?\" Kogenta said in anger. He always had a tendency to get angry at the stupidest things.<br>\r\n   \"Heh, an attitude, just as I was told that you would have...\" the figure said stepping into the open, revealing it's body.<br>\r\n   He was a tiger! He looked very similar to Kogenta, except his fur was black where Kogenta's was white, his stripes were red, a contrast to Kogenta's blue ones. His hair was no different, black and red. His eyes were blood red, his claws also had a crimson color to them. His tail, instead of having a bell strapped to it like Kogenta's, had a blood red crystal strapped to it. A necklace lay around his neck, having several blood red crystals on it, the largest towards the middle. He wore armor, red, with gold and black outlines. He wore red gauntlets. He wore a martial arts belt, a sheathed sword in it. Oddly, he had no armor on his lower body, simply dark red pants with sandals. He had a bulge in his crotch area, indicating he was a male. <br>\r\n   \"I am Kansama. I am from another world. You see, I was chasing a counterpart of mine known as Kansani. He looks just like me, except he's blue and white mostly. He and his partner, Hikaru, dissapeared. I mistook you for him, so me and my partner developed a portal here. I've done some research, and I know you, the legendary Shikigami of Trust, can help me get back to my home world...\"<br>\r\n   \"Like I'd help you! I can sense you're evil!\" Kogenta said, growling. \"Riku! Call out Sokkaido Kotetsu so I can finish this creep!\" <br>\r\n   Riku began to move his Drive in another specific pattern, forming the symbol that would bring out Kogenta's powerful sword, the Sokkaido Kotetsu. Kogenta grabbed it by the hilt the moment it emerged from the depths of the portal. <br>\r\n   \"Time to finish you!\" Kogenta leaped up, sword prepared to strike, and aimed right for Kansama. Kansama chuckled, drawing his own sword from it's sheath. Oddly, Kansama's sword was black, the hilt red and black, and blood red designs running along the metal blade. <br>\r\n   \"Feel the fury of the Yinblade! Yin Slash!\" Kansama swung the blade towards Kogenta, their blades colliding, a struggle between the two emerging. Kansama then charged his strength, quickly, knocking Kogenta's blade away with a strike, then slicing into Kogenta's flesh. Some blood sprinkled on the Yinblade, and Kogenta yelled in pain as he hit the dirt.<br>\r\n   \"I apoligize, Kogenta, but I have a rival to hunt. Goodbye...\" Kansama sheathed his sword, and dissapeared as a flash of lightning hit the ground where he stood.<br>\r\n   \"KOGENTA!\" Riku said running out to Kogenta's injured body, holding Kogenta in his arms. \"Are you okay?\" Riku was in tears.<br>\r\n   \"Yeah, just..argh...fine..\" Kogenta said, covering the slash, which was embedded in his abdomen, right over where his stomach would be on the inside. <br>\r\n   \"You need to rest.\" Riku said, calling Kogenta back into the Drive. He walked home, worried about his Shikigami. <br>\r\n   A few days later, Kogenta seemed fine. He was playing a game with Souma, a young boy who lived with Riku, probably barely ten, but who had a college degree, making him the boy genius. Kogenta usually only fought, as he claimed that's what he was meant to do, but he wanted to prove he was fine. The wound had basically dissapeared, amazingly. <br>\r\n   As they played ball, Kogenta suddenly heard a loud rumbling sound, very close. <br>\r\n   \"Huh, what was that?\" Kogenta said in confusion. He then noticed, it seemed to be coming from inside of him. <br>\r\n   After a brief inspection by Souma, Kogenta learned the shocking truth...what he heard was his stomach growling, and what he felt was it rumbling. <br>\r\n   \"My..stomach? Odd...Shikigami don't have stomachs, from what I've noticed...\" Kogenta said. He was right, Shikigami did not have to consume in order to live; they were spirits, only needing rest and battle to live. <br>\r\n   \"You're gonna have to eat, I guess...\" Souma said.<br>\r\n   Kogenta thought. He had been offered food before by some friend of Riku's, who happened to be obsessed with him, despite being unable to see him mostly. She called him 'Tora-san', and once latched onto his leg when he appeared physically before her. (Shikigami can appear in Spiritual form outside battle, when they are only visible to Toujinshi, humans who can bind with Shikigami, but are visible to everyone when called out physically.) She offered him food several times, but his response was always- \"Who the hell would eat that?!?\" Kogenta then sniffed something. His mouth began to water, his belly growling as well. It was...<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Kogenta then noticed the scent was coming from Souma. His stomach growled again, even louder then before. He realized it: His body wanted him to eat Souma!<br>\r\n    Kogenta ignored it, and quickly decided to get back to the game. \"Nah, I think I can go another round before I have to eat, like you say I do.\" Kogenta said smiling.<br>\r\n    Souma smiled and ran over, tossing him the ball, which Kogenta caught with relative ease. He then tossed it as Souma, who caught it. Souma tossed it and Kogenta strangely missed despite his efforts, it going behind him. <br>\r\n    \"Aren't you going to get it?\" Souma said.<br>\r\n    \"But I'm wounded aren't I?\" Kogenta chuckled.<br>\r\n    \"Fine...\" Souma said smiling, walking over. \"Kogenta, you lazy bum.\" he chuckled jokingly. Kogenta chuckled. Then he turned around, and noticing Souma with his back turned, completely vulnerable. Kogenta's mouth watered as he took a deep sniff of Souma's delicious scent once again. His stomach growled almost painfully now, demanding nourishment. Kogenta's instincts basically took over, as he tackled him to the ground. <br>\r\n    \"Kogenta, what the hell?\" Souma said. He started to giggle as he felt Kogenta's tongue go down his body, lapping at the back of his neck and his cheek. Kogenta flipped Souma around so they were looking at eachother, licking at his entire face. <br>\r\n    \"Kogenta, stop, that tickles!\" Souma said laughing, petting Kogenta slightly while trying to get him off him.<br>\r\n    \"You taste so good I could just eat you up!\" Kogenta grinned. Souma giggled. <br>\r\n    \"Is that so, Ko..\" Souma went wide eyed when he saw Kogenta's maw wide open, descending on him. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n    \"I said I could eat you up, I think I will.\" Kogenta said before opening his maw wide and descending again.  <br>\r\n    \"Sorry Kogenta, but I'm not lunch!\" Souma said as he reached for his Drive, taking it out slowly. <br>\r\n    \"Shikigami! Kou...\" Souma was unable to summon his Shikigami as Kogenta knocked it out of his hand before he could say \"Koujin\", which would have called out Fusanoshin to save him. <br>\r\n    Kogenta then waved his index finger from side to side. \"Tsk tsk Souma, I'm afraid that bird will have no purpose besides being next course.\" he chuckled, bringing his maw down on Souma again, no distractions getting in the way this time, and he quickly took the boy's whole head into his mouth. Kogenta continued to pin him as he shredded the boy's shirt, he wouldn't let it obscure his flavor. He already was mmm-ing at the boy's taste, he never thought it'd feel so good to eat. <br>\r\n    Kogenta took a large gulp, bringing the boy's neck and shoulders in. The boy tried to squirm, yet he was still pinned, rendering his body useless. Kogenta kept re-arranging himself so he could swallow Souma efficiently, surprised he was capable of swallowing the boy whole as he seemed to be doing. He swallowed again, the boy's chest sliding into his mouth, and he gulped until the boy was in up to his elbow. Kogenta stood up, the boy kicked Kogenta in the stomach, yet he felt Souma's kick like a flea bite. He swallowed again, the boy's stomach sliding into his greedy maw. Kogenta reached up and stroked the bulge in his throat that his young meal was making. He decided to try and calm Souma down, so he began to lick across Souma's belly, the boy kicking again, this time out of joy as muffled giggles came from inside Kogenta, and when Kogenta swallowed Souma's waist in after tearing the boy's pants and undergarments away, he remained still, breathing slowly as his head began to poke into the tiger's hungry stomach. <br>\r\n    Kogenta couldn't resist a lick of the boy's crotch as his tongue tasted every part of him, he seriously doubted any part of this delicious meal wouldn't taste good. He swallowed again, Souma's thighs sliding into his mouth until he was stopped at his knees. Kogenta continued to swallow him steadily, Souma sliding in inch by inch, Kogenta's belly swelling as Souma's body entered it, his shirt expanding to fit it. When Kogenta reached the boy's feet, he removed his shoes and socks, leaving his bare feet visible. Kogenta's tongue pushing against their undersides, in addition to a gulp, forced them into his mouth. Kogenta closed his mouth, sealing Souma within him. He licked across the boy's feet for a while, getting a few giggles when he licked the bottom, smiling as he gulped, sending the last of the boy down to his hungry stomach. <br>\r\n    Souma was forced into a fetal position inside Kogenta's warm, humid stomach, though he found he could move a bit, as Kogenta's soft, yet muscular, stomach walls would give way if he pushed enough. <br>\r\n    Kogenta then heard another sound, and blushed as he looked down to notice his shirt had ripped a bit, the bulge Souma made in him clearly visible. He then felt a n odd sensation in his body, and it forced his mouth open, a large belch coming out. The tight confines of his stomach grew even tighter as most of the air was sucked out due to the belch. He felt a few squirms from Souma inside, but the small boy soon abandoned hope and accepted fate.<br>\r\n    Souma noticed Kogenta...was alive. He could hear a gentle sound in the backround, almost lulling. He knew it was a heartbeat. Apparently the thing that gave Kogenta his gluttonous hunger made him alive as well, as Kogenta also was breathing. He closed his eyes, oddly feeling comfortable inside this organic prison, falling asleep.<br>\r\n    Kogenta sat down against a wall, smiling and sighing happily as he rubbed a claw over his large stomach, savoring his meal. He yawned, feeling tired. Luckily for him, Riku was a bit busy inside the house, making a meal. Kogenta chuckled when he realized how much better this meal more then likely was compared to what Riku made, he couldn't cook to save his life, as he was told by a friend of his. Kogenta then hugged his belly. \"Thank you Souma...\" he said before drifting off, taking a literal catnap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As the two of them slept, both Kogenta and Souma were having wet dreams. Souma's was of the feeling of being swallowed again. The tight, yet loose confines of Kogenta's stomach felt like he was becoming part of something greater than he could ever imagine. And so he slept, eternally and peacefully as the the juices started to go to work. Slowly his body began to disappear, the tight walls of Kogenta's stomach shrinking as Souma disappeared into him. The boy was ignorant of his situation, too relaxed by the feel of Kogenta's stomach and heatbeat all around him. Eventually his body disppared into Kogenta, giving the Shikigami nutrients in order to grow bigger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His muscles hardened slightly, his body grew a couple of inches; but were ignored since his clothes could still fit him, and his powers had grown as well. For Kogenta had absorbed both Souma's body and his spirit. Making the boy a part of him forever. Kogenta unconciously rubbed his stomach as it shrank back down and mumbled \"That's a good meal.\" as he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But Kogenta didn't realize what his meal had done to him. For he was in his own dream. Though it was different from anything he had ever experienced before. He was in a mountainous area, and trees completely surrounded what appear to have been a large city. But it was built like a ancient city from a thousand years ago. Temples adorned the streets and boys, nothing but half naked boys, girls, and teens, they all seemed to be praying to a statue. It was a statue of a  White Tiger forged from Diamond. Or more specifically Kogenta himself. 'This is weird.' He thought as he looked on from afar. The statue was a perfect likeness of him. Even down to his *ahem* nether regions. Which seemed to bulge quite nicely in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly the image before him vanished and he was thrusted at the speed of light. Sent to the largest and most impressive of the temples. It was in the middle of the city and was overwhelming in looks. It actually looked more like a castle than a temple. And as Kogenta watch the door's open, a force was pulling him inside. \"What the?!\" He called out as he moved into the temple. And what he saw completely shocked him. Not to mention causing him to turn a beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were hundreds and hundreds of naked boys there, all of them bowing and praying to the person sitting upon a giant white throne. They were all chanting \"Eat me. Eat me!\" As they continued to bow. But what caught Kogenta's surprise more was who was sitting on the throne. It was him! And he was completely naked! What was even more shocking than that was that he had a bloated stomach, having eaten several of his worshippers. But then he noticed another person was on the throne. Naked as well, it was human who was cuddling into Kogenta as he played with the boy's balls gently. But he couldn't see who it was. And as he tried to look closer, he then saw that it was....BAM!</span></div></div>",

Riku did not know what to say, it was the first time he saw starving Kogenta. <br>\r\n\"Er...I don't know what happened to you but it looks like you need to eat something...\" said Riku. Riku gave him a thigh. Kogenta hesitated, but tasted it. He chewed slowly and swallowed, then ate the rest within ten seconds. <br>\r\n\"I'd never thought it would be so pleasant to eat something...\" he said, throwing away a bone. Riku seemed to look for something.<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for ?<br>\r\n-Your drive...It was in my pocket, but it disappeared...\"<br>\r\nKogenta didn't answer. <br>\r\n\"But what the hell is going on ?

He always breathed but didn't need to do it, and could stay under the water as much as he wanted. With a hesitating hand, he put his hand against his chest, and what he felt made him provoke a small groan.<br>\r\n\"I...I have...I felt a heart beat...my heart beat...<br>\r\n-So it seems that you became alive.\"<br>\r\nKogenta feel weird. The idea of not being immortal anymore made him gasp. <br>\r\n\"Riku, I need to find him.<br>\r\n-Who ?<br>\r\n-Kansama.<br>\r\n-But you're not healed ! <br>\r\n-I don't care !

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    As Riku and Kogenta walked(Kogenta wasn't very used to it, usually being carried around in Riku's Drive until called into battle, and naturally complained about it.), they didn't understand how they could find Kansama. There were no clues that led to that tiger from the darkness. Another problem was how they had to dodge sight by civilians. It wouldn't exactly be normal seeing a young boy walking with an anthro tiger now would it?<br>\r\n    Riku found solutions if they were spotted, saying it was a costume or that Kogenta was a stuffed animal(He carried Kogenta for that one, which was difficult for Riku due to his weight, and also had to deal with the smacking Kogenta gave him afterwards.)<br>\r\n    Finally, after about an hour of searching all over the local area, still nothing turned up. Riku and Kogenta sat on the edge of the sidewalk, both sighing. No one was around, so they could take a break with ease. They suddenly heard a yell from nearby.<br>\r\n   \"Hey let me go!\" a voice yelled in anger.<br>\r\n   Riku and Kogenta got curious, and walked towards the source of the sound. They reached it, and saw a wooden fence. The sound came from the other side. They peered through a hole in it.<br>\r\n   \"Why should I do that kid?\" a figure said. Kogenta gazed in shock. Upon closer inspection when the figure turned their head towards them, he noticed it was Kansama! He had a grip on a boy who was probably around Riku's age. Kansama suddenly gazed at them with glee, his face curling into an evil smile. <br>\r\n   The kid kicked Kansama in his knee. Kansama flinched slightly from the sudden pain, but his grip remained strong. He pulled the boy's face towards his own, looking at him with pure anger. He then tossed the boy down in the dirt in front of him.<br>\r\n   \"You filthy human...you filthy mortal...\" Kansama said raising his claws. \"I hope you enjoy where you're gonna be going! Samalysis!\" Kansama's claws glowed, and shot a beam of black lightning at the boy. Before he could even get up, the boy was struck. His scream of pain was heard for only a few seconds before he lay still. They thought he was dead, but upon closer analysis, they realized his eyes were moving, he was mostly paralyzed. <br>\r\n   \"And now...I'm afraid I have to get my revenge for what you just did...\" Kansama said licking his lips, his pink tongue going across his lips, and a black line was clearly seen going down the middle of it. Kansama moved closer, eyeing the boy, almost curiously. He grabbed the boy by his collar, holding his face up to his own. What creeped Riku and Kogenta out was how Kansama's black tail began to grow longer, wrapping around the boy's lower parts like a snake constricting it's prey. <br>\r\n   \"Now...time for dinner!\" Kansama said with a sinister grin. He opened his mouth impossibly wide, more then large enough to swallow the boy's head. He quickly changed his strategy, he wanted the boy to see the outside world to the very end, so he flipped the boy's position so his feet were near his mouth while the boy's head was within his tails coils. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Kansama quickly removed the boy's shoes, then his socks. He took a deep sniff, smelling the boy's bare feet and enjoying their scent, the fact that his mouth watered afterwards showing it. He quickly licked them, purring lightly at their taste. He licked them for a bit with his rough tongue, before finally taking them into his maw, closing his lips around the boy's ankles. <br>\r\n    Kogenta and Riku gazed in absolute amazement and horror as they saw how easily the boy was being swallowed. Kansam used his claws in a swift movement to remove the boy's pants, shredding them to bits and leaving him in his boxers. Kansama was enjoying himself as well, as the boy slid in slowly but surely, inch by inch, until he reached just above the boy's knees. <br>\r\n   &gt;Enjoying the show?&lt; a voice seemed to say in Kogenta's head.<br>\r\n   \"Wh-Who said that?\" Kogenta said.<br>\r\n   &gt;I did, I'm using telpathy, you pathetic excuse for a Byakko.&lt; Kansama's voice said clearly as the boy's thighs slid into his maw, a large bulge forming inside his throat.<br>\r\n   \"Who are you calling pathetic?!?!\" Kogenta yelled. Riku looked at him in confusion.<br>\r\n   &gt;Are you deaf? I said you, clearly. You don't deserve to be a white tiger, such a noble creature and a servant of the god Byakko.&lt; Kansama's voice said, while he gulped down the boy's waist before shredding his shirt. Kansama's tail released it's coils, shrinking back to it's original size as well, while Kansama now supported the boy's weight with his arms. <br>\r\n  \"That's it! I'm going to turn your ass into a black smear on the pavement!\" Kogenta said jumping high over the fence, speeding towards Kansama, claws ready. Kansama smiled around the boy's mass in his mouth, jumping high into the air, moving side to side to avoid Kogenta's swipes. He smiled evilly as the boy's stomach entered his mouth. He landed on the ground with a soft thud. <br>\r\n  Kogenta rushed downwards. \"Now I've got you!\" he said as he was about to slash Kansama. He then felt he couldn't breathe. He looked, he noticed Kansama's tail had grown longer, and had wrapped itself around his neck tightly, choking him as he crashed into the ground.<br>\r\n  Kansama gulped the boy's chest into his mouth before hungrily sending that down his throat as well, a large bulge in Kansama's gut and throat was visible. Kogenta then saw the boy's eyes shed a tear before they too dissapeared behind Kansama's lips. With only his arms remaining outside his mouth, Kansama played with them a  bit, tasting them, taking his time as Kogenta was in such a tight grip due to his tail. Kogenta then saw the boy's arms slip down Kansama's throat as they were slurped up like noodles, descending into his mouth, his throat, and finally into the tight confines of his stomach. <br>\r\n   \"Urrrrrpppp!!!\" Kansama belched, patting the large bulge in his abdomen. \"Such a mystery to me...humans are such filthy creatures...yet they taste so damn good...even in this world.\" He chuckled, turning his gaze on Kogenta. <br>\r\n   \"You wanted me, well, you got me now, Kogenta...I don't know what I'll do to you...I could eat you, tear you to shreds, even have some \"fun\" with you... Tell you what, I'll let you decide!\" Kansama said, faking a kind smile. Kogenta mumbled something that couldn't be heard due to how low he was forced to speak. <br>\r\n   \"What was that?\" Kansama put his ear near Kogenta's mouth, also loosening his grip on Kogenta's neck a bit.<br>\r\n   \"FUCK YOU!!\" Kogenta said as loud as he could, the sudden tone hurting Kansama's ear, who flinched. Kansama looked in anger. His tail loosened his grip on Kogenta completely, except wrapping around his ankles and binding his arms against his body, making him helpless. Kansama lifted him high up in the air with his claws, which almost pierced Kogenta's neck. <br>\r\n   \"You son of a bitch!! You think that was funny?!? Well, now I get to decide what happens! And guess what, you won't be using any of those attacks of yours, since I took your Drive, your immortality and your contract with that stupid boy over there!\"<br>\r\n   Riku looked on, he had to help Kogenta! He didn't have Kogenta's Drive, but maybe if he did the hand symbols that were usually performed with a Drive, he could use Kogenta's powers and save him!</span></div></div>",

He rubbed his still swollen belly. \"Luckily for you, I'm full right now, or you'd be getting an up close trip through my digestive system! Meanwhile, I'll have to find something else to do...\" <br>\r\n   Kansama then noticed Riku out of the corner of his eye about to do a hand symbol. <br>\r\n   \"Not gonna do that kid! Shadow Snare!\" A large black rope-like beam of energy shot out of Kansama's hand and wrapped around Riku behind the fence, tying every part of his body up. Kansama gave it a strong tug, making the rope, and Riku, crash through the fence and land on the ground. Kansama made part of the rope dissapear, leaving Riku on the ground tied up.<br>\r\n   \"And now...where was I...Oh yeah!\" Kansama said.</span></div></div>",

Kansama then bent over and got on all fours, after untying a knot in his martial arts style belt, causing his pants to drop. Kogenta was a bit surprised when Kansama's tail lowered him downwards, his face only a few inches from the black-furred rump of his enemy. <br>\r\n    \"Ah, just imagine...soon you'll be sealed behind those!\" Kansama chuckled, and Kogenta was a bit disgusted when Kansama's tail thrusted the side of Kogenta's face into the cushion of flesh that was one of his buttcheeks.<br>\r\n    Kogenta gazed in horror and Kansama reached his two hands back, and parted them, allowing Kogenta a glimpse at the pink, muscular ring that led into Kansama's bowels. He was also a bit surprised at how clean the area around it was.<br>\r\n    \"You're probably wondering why my rear is so clean. Well, I guess you're going to get to know it better anyways, so I'll tell you. I come from a race of creatures called Menokama on my home world. We have the rectum and such, but we have evolved beyond the need to produce wastes, absorbing everything or converting it into energy. Therefore, that would explain why my rear is so clean. Now here goes nothing!\" <br>\r\n    Kogenta's face was pushed forwards, and his nose entered the creature's back door first. Kansama must've been right, the chamber inside didn't smell as bad as he thought it would, yet it did have that \"innard\" stench to it nonetheless. Kansama's tail quickly forced the rest of Kogenta's head beyond the hungry muscle, as well as much of his hair. <br>\r\n    Kansama had resumed his all fours position, purring in pleasure as his rear devoured it's prey. He then felt a hard feeling in the lower part of his body. He peaked down, and noticed it was him getting an erection. Kansama ignored Riku, who seemed a bit appaled at the combined site of Kogenta getting swallowed by a butt and the site of Kansama's hands running over his own long erection. <br>\r\n    Kogenta was forced to relax mostly, Kansama's tail was still gripping onto his arms and legs to bind him. He felt the muscular chamber around his head grip him and pull him inwards, his whole neck, chest and shoulders coming in after him. He sighed, knowing he couldn't escape for the moment.<br>\r\n    Kansama continued to purr, his tail would have been wagging out of control had it not been constricted around prey. His hand was moving faster and faster over his red member, grinning at the disgust Riku was feeling over in his bindings. Everytime Riku tried to turn away, Kansama would make Riku's binds come to life again and force him to look in his direction. He thought of making the boy come over and force him to suck him off, but shrugged off the idea, he wasn't very much for young rape, and he usually mated with only one human, his male partner in battle, Hiraku. <br>\r\n    Kogenta felt another muscular contraction, and his head was buried in the soft and flexible, yet muscular and strong, walls of Kansam's rectum as his abdomen and elbows entered Kansama's body. Kogenta himself was getting his senses overwhelmed, the heat and strange comfort of the flesh around him was actually making him question if this was a bad thing.<br>\r\n    Kansama could read emotions very well, it was one of his abilities he had recieved when he was made in a lab as a dark clone of Kansani. He sense Kogenta beginning to enjoy the situation and smiled, seeing he joined the majority of his prey who realized how great being swallowed could possibly be. He focused both on his masturbation, rubbing harder and faster, trying to get an orgasm just as Kogenta's feet would enter him, as well as swallowing his meal. <br>\r\n    With a few more muscular contractions, Kogenta's waist and thighs joined him in the bowels of this beast. Kogenta was enjoying it, he had realized, and Kogenta actually lay against the fleshy walls, trying to get comfortable. When Kansama trusted Kogenta enough, the grip of his tail was released, and the tail began to leave the chamber. Kogenta quickly grabbed it, but instead of cutting it as Kansama had feared, Kogenta rubbed it against his cheek, almost saying thank you. He released it, and the tail left the chamber just as Kogenta's feet were slipping in.<br>\r\n    Kansama knew his orgasm was approaching, and he quickly used a single finger to tuck the last piece of Kogenta, the tip of his tail, into him. His anus closed after it, relaxing after the delightful labor of swallowing the tiger whole. Kansama's belly now hanged very low, just centimeters from the ground due to the combined weight of Kogenta in his rectum and the slowly digesting, yet sleeping in bliss, child in his stomach.<br>\r\n    Kansama yelled in pleasure and pain as his seed shot all over the ground beneath it, a black fluid with  red ink-like coloring trailing throughout it, hitting the ground in such force and volume it turned some of it into mud. <br>\r\n    Kansama stood up, his belly shifting as he did so. He quickly pulled on his pants and re-did his belt. He then glanced at Riku, who looked very frightened. He chuckled and walked over, his gut swinging side to side. He crouched on his legs when he reached Riku, running his claws through his hair gently, showing he did have a slightly kind and gentle side, something he had unintentionally inherited from his counterpart. He lifted Riku's chin up with his hand, and gazed into his eyes.</span></div></div>",

He had his fingers positioned under his chin in the fashion that he was thinking about something. Kansama's crimson eyes were going up and down Riku's body, studying him, helping Kansama's mind process what would happen to the young boy.<br>\r\n    \"Luckily for you, kid, I'm kinda full right now.\" Kansama let out a small burp as if to show it.

Riku was now had a strong feeling of happiness in him, he never knew his real parents, as he was born 1,000 years ago and sent into the future. He thought he knew his grandpa, but it turned out even he was false. And here, this enemy of his had offered to take him in.

He pulled off his shirt, revealing his broad and muscular chest, and he began to flex and pose, showing off to his two struggling victims. <br>\r\n\"Do you like them, pests? Soon, you will have the honor of adding your otherwise worthless mass to this magnificence!\" With that, he began clawing and tearing at their clothing. Though Riku cried out and Kogenta roared, neither of them were hurt by his claws, which never even nicked them. No, he was going to make sure they were completely unharmed when he added them to his body. Soon they were naked from the waist up, and Riku's shiny, smooth skin made a nice contrast to Kogenta's soft, fluffy fur. They would feel so good inside of him! He manipulated his tail and the ropes to change their position so he could tear off their pants and shoes, and soon they were completely naked, with Riku looking very frightened and Kogenta looking furious. He gave both their rumps a taunting pat, then pressed their faces against his pectorals. <br>\r\n\"Lick my nipples, brats.\" When they refused, he pressed them harder, the pressure from his hands and the rock-hard pecs causing great pain. Finally, Riku's tongue flicked out and he very reluctantly began to lick. Kogenta's skull nearly broke before he gave in, but eventually his warm tongue was lapping at Kansani's other nipple. The black tiger purred loudly. His stomach was full, a cute young boy was licking his chest submissively and the proud Byakko had been broken to the point were he was forced to please the superior cat. But it was about to get even better. He began to put pressure on their heads again, but this time they found themselves slipping forward, as the nipples they had been licking were now slick enough to let them start sliding inside. They began to struggle again, but their bindings held them tight, and their faces started slipping the growing pink nipples. His chest began to swell as their heads were pushed inside of him, and he pressed harder and harder, finally popping both sets of shoulders inside of himself, crying out in pleasure at the sensation of such large objects being forced inside his sensitive nipples. Inside, Riku and Kogenta were being squished into almost impossibly tight chambers, the thick muscle of his chest forcing them to constantly move to avoid getting crushed by every small contraction. It smelled so weird inside, the sheer musky odor of maleness making them both gag, and some sort of sweat-like liquid was getting into their mouths and soaking them as they entered. They kicked their legs wildly, but it was no use. Now that their arms were trapped, there was no more need to keep them tied up. Kansani snapped his fingers, and Riku's ropes disappeared. He wiggled his hips and his tail unwrapped from around Kogenta and returned to normal size behind him. It was truly a sight to behold, a black-furred tiger man with a wiggling, bulging stomach and a naked human and white tiger boy being forced into his chest. Now their chests were inside of his chest, and they were soon inside up to their stomachs, their kicks growing weaker as realization dawned. They knew they weren't going to escape. Kansani loved it when he got both a human and their partner, it was such a nice sense of completion and totally humiliating the fools who thought they could go up against him. He could reach their legs now, and used them to pull the slowly weakening boys deeper into his swelling chest, purring loudly at the sensation. Inside, both of them used their arms to try and create some space, but all their strength could barely give them enough room to breathe, and the sweat-like stuff was getting everywhere and making their skin feel warm. It was already almost boiling hot inside of Kansani's chest, it was a struggle just to keep from passing out. He had to give them credit, they weren't giving up completely, not even when it became obvious how hopeless it was; even the weak and submissive human was fighting hard. But it was all for nothing, because they both belonged to him now. He continued to pull with his arms and suck with his chest, and now their cute behinds vanished from the world forever, and once he got to their thighs, he stopped using his arms. Instead, he put his hands at his rips, and assumed a flexing position, and began to suck them in through sheer muscle power, their legs getting slurped up with some almost disgusting sounds as sweat and milk-like stuff dribbled out his nipples, like drool from an over eager pair of mouths as he finished consuming both boys, his nipples shrinking back to normal size. They were forced to curl up tightly inside of him, almost impossibly small as his muscles worked to mercilessly compact them, and from the outside his pectorals just looked very big, not like they contained a pair of young men. His nipples, red and supersensitive from the stimulation, continued to dribble the weird stuff that Kogenta and Riku were coated in, and he reached up to tweak them. It felt so good just to touch them that he almost came right then and there. He looked down and was almost surprised to realize he was hard. His hungry chest had demanded so much of his attention that his cock had gone unnoticed. Kansani freed it from his pants and gave it a few brief jerks as it stood to proud attention, then resumed tweaking his nipples, feeling the two boys squirming in his chest, and the kid from before starting to digest in his stomach. He imagined the scene, the boy in his stomach having fallen asleep as Kansani's gut churned and worked to turn him into part of the great black tiger, and the two little brats in his pectorals being forced to curl up tightly, wiggling helplessly to resist his huge muscles...! He came right then and there, great spurts of black liquid shooting high into the air, landing on the ground far away and turning into puddles from sheer volume. Kansani began to relax, rubbing circles around his nipples as he felt his captives turn over inside of him, his rumbling purrs washing over both of them. </span></div></div>",

He began to lose his will to resist as Kansama's tongue seemed to move over his and around his mouth, exploring it. He began to forget Kansama was the enemy due to this strange...\"feeling\" he was getting. Maybe this is what Riku told him what love was like. Maybe this was lust, the desire for sex. Maybe it was both. He didn't know, they were new to him. He began to do as Kansama was doing, his tongue began to play with Kansama's, his arms running up and down Kansama's back. <br>\r\n   Riku looked on, he didn't know what to think about what he was seeing.

Kogenta looked at Kansama with dissapointment, frowning, almost giving him puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n   Kansama chuckled. \"Want more? Why don't you remove your clothing, then we can have some real fun.\" Kansama licked his lips. Kansama's tail removed itself from Kogenta completely, and resumed it's normal size of around 3 feet. Kansama turned around, and began stripping in front of Kogenta. Kansama's belly was flattening out really well, the boy was mostly gone, allowing Kogenta a glimpse at the black tiger's form.<br>\r\n   Kogenta then had a choice. He could either see this \"fun\" Kansama spoke of(and which he was highly anxious to see, since it was supposed to be even better than that short kiss.), or he could strike Kansama while he had his back turned so he could disable Kansama and so he could help Riku.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Kogenta seemed to loose balance, collapsing against Kansama in a kind of pleasure he had never experienced before. ha! you like that don't you!? well trust me... your going to like what happens next even better! Kogenta gasped in surprise as Kansama lifted him up, flipping him over so that he was on his back and his waist was in the air, his thighs held up by Kansama. what... what are you doing?  he asked, surprised by Kansamas sudden roughness. having fun! Kansama laughed shredding Kogenta's boxers and shirt with his long red claws, scratching Kogenta lightly in the posses. aah! Kogenta yelped, struggling lightly before giving up again, understanding that at Kansamas current size he would be unable to free himself... even if he wanted to. Kansama just laughed at Kogenta's weak a temp at freedom, pressing the head of his hard, throbbing shaft against Kogentas asshole, enjoying Kogentas surprised face. at first Kogenta hated the feeling of Kansamas cock pressing lightly against his tight ass but he came to enjoy it as Kansama pressed his inter head into Kogentas ass. he continued to tease him, pressing in a small amount of his large cock before pulling out suddenly until Kogenta couldn't take it. he grabbed Kansama by the waist and pulled closer, forcing the length of his cock deep into his ass. Kansama and Kogenta both cried out in pleasure, Kogenta overwhelmed by the felling. slowly Kansama began to push in and out of Kogenta, loving how kogenta would tighten his ass as he pulled out, almost willing him to stay inside. as Kansama began to speed up Kogenta felt a strange feeling in his lower stomach, a pressure he had never felt before. he was slightly afraid of this odd feeling and tightened his mussels, trying to hold it in but was unable to do so for long. he cried out in ecstasy as a milky white liquid erupted from his long hard shaft and sprayed across his stomach, some landing on his chin. Kansama smiled lightly, pulling his shaft from inside Kogenta and stretching over him, licking up Kogentas cum, starting at his lower waist and working his way up to his cheek. as Kansmama licked Kogenta's cheek Kogenta looked over, seeing Riku still tired on the ground, a black rope holding his arms and legs together. Kansama, noticing that his plaything was distracted, looked over to see Riku as well. hey kid, he said, why not join in? lifting up one hand he opened his palm and the rope came undone and flew back into his hand. Riku stared forward, not knowing what he should do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh no you don't, Kansama!\" The black tiger's mouth closed very abruptly when Kogenta raced  forward and punched him under the chin, closing his jaws with a painful sounding 'Click!'. <br>\r\nThis stunned the dark creature long enough for Kogenta to slash at his tail, freeing the boy. Riku grabbed the kid under his armpits and dragged him to a safe distance. Unfortunately, this was all the time their surprise attack bought them. <br>\r\nKogenta had been too distracted with making sure Riku and the boy got away, and failed to notice Kansani regain himself. The white tiger was quickly reminded not to let his attention wander when the black-furred foot came up and Kansani gave him a vicious kick to the stomach. <br>\r\n\"You little pest...\" Kansama hissed, his tail lashing angrily behind him. \"You have the gall to not only attack me, but hunt me down and interrupt my meal?!\" His foot came down to crack Kogenta's skull, but this time the Byakko rolled out of the way to dodge it. <br>\r\n\"You eat humans? You sicken me! Just when I thought you couldn't get any more loathesome!\" Kogenta snarled, dropping to a crouch and performing a spinning kick that caught Kansani in the same knee the human had injured him in. The black tiger's eyes went white and his mouth opened in a soundless cry of pain before he dropped down to his good knee. He looked up just in time to meet Kogenta's fist, and it sent him sprawling. But Kansani was a strong opponent, and he struggled to rise, only to be felled by a unfair kick. <br>\r\n\"Riku! Get the boy away! He might come after him again!\" Riku nodded, and dragged the kid away as fast as he could. <br>\r\nKogenta was truly enraged. Shikigami existed to protect humans. To see something that looked like him not only wish to hurt a human, but actually eat him? It filled him with fury. <br>\r\nHe gave Kansani no time to recover, only striking him again and again and again, until the black tiger lay unconscious on the ground. <br>\r\nKogenta stood above him, panting, surprised at how ruthless he had been. Kansani deserved it, but still...<br>\r\nAnd he still didn't feel satisfied. How dare Kansani do such a thing? Come to think of it, the mere fact that he was about to do it so readily must mean that he had done it many times before already. That revelation filled Kogenta with renewed anger. Kansani would have to pay. But how best to punish him? <br>\r\nHis stomach growled again, distracting him. Drat, he was hungry yet again. It was so frustrating, he never seemed to get full, and there was nothing good to... He looked down at Kansani. Yes... that was it! The perfect punishment, and the solution to his woes. <br>\r\nHe grinned darkly, and knelt down next to his fallen foe and began to remove the rough, tasteless clothing. He pulled off Kansani's shirt, and licked his bare arm as he did so, shivering with delight at the flavor. He used his claws to deal with the fasteners and knots, and soon Kansani's top half was bare. His pants were held on only with an obi, that was easily severed. He found himself staring at Kanani's round, black-furred butt as he pulled the evil creature's pants off. Looking at them stirred some sort of vague impulse inside of him. He wanted... what? Then his stomach growled again, reminding him of his duty. He finished pulling the pants over Kansani's feet, and then picked up the bare feet, licking his lips. How had Kansani do it? It just seemed like he'd opened his mouth, and kept opening it and... Kogenta tried it, and was surprised at the ease and painlessness of opening his mouth wide enough to admit Kansani's feet. He shoved them both inside, and paused long enough to wet them with his tongue and suck on them for flavor. Sadly, he wouldn't get a chance to savor his meal, as he had to hurry before Kansani woke up. He grabbed hold of the firm legs of his dinner, and nearly choked when he tried to shove them in. He tried swallowing, but that didn't have enough of an effect. He realized he had to do both with careful timing. A little practice, and he had the right rhythm. Shove, swallow, shove, swallow, shove, swallow, never too much too fast. Soon he was was Kansani's knees, and then his muscular thighs, and then that tempting butt was right under his nose. He wished he knew what he wanted to do with it, but gave up when no answer came. He just gave it a regretful squeeze, and carelessly lapped at the odd organ that hung on the underside of Kansani's body as he swallowed his ass. Whatever it was, it tasted really good! He'd have to try it again sometime. Now Kansani's hips were in his mouth, and the black tiger was beginning to stir. Quickly, Kogenta grabbed his enemy's hands and opened his mouth wider to shove them in, trapping them completely as he swallowed his way up to the stomach that must have been the doom of many. That thought renewed his anger and banished any ideas of mercy. Kansani was food and deserved no better fate than that. <br>\r\nMore awake now, a groggy Kansani tried to twist his head to see what was going on. His eyes went wide with shock and disbelief when he realized he was being eaten. No! It couldn't be happening! And yet he couldn't struggle away, couldn't use his powers inside the body of another magical creature, and help was an entire dimension away. <br>\r\n\"<b>No</b>!\" He screamed desperately. \"I am Kansani! I am the greatest warrior of them all! I am insatiable, I am invincible! I will <b>not</b> be <i>food</i>!\" But for all his anger and frantic attempts to escape, Kogenta relentlessly swallowed, using his big paws to pull more and more of him inside. <br>\r\n\"No! No! No! N-\" His cries stopped abruptly when Kogenta's lips closed over his face, and the Byakko gave one last mighty gulp to send the still yelling, muffled voice down to join the rest of him in the white tiger's stomach. <br>\r\nHe noticed with little care that his stomach had ripped. Nevermind, it was meaningless compared to what he'd gained. He patted his frantically bulging abdomen, then let out a titanic belch, shaking the trees nearby. The shape of his stomach was much less round now, and he could see more details of Kansani's trapped form. <br>\r\n\"Ah... Just think, Kansani, if you hadn't cursed me, I never would have been able to do this!\" This just seemed to drive Kansani crazy, and Kogenta lay on his back to moan softly and rub his stomach. Who would have dreamed there could be pleasure such as this? Even the greatest battle could not compare to having a hated enemy slowly die in your stomach, pleasing you to their very last breath. <br>\r\nHe let out a smaller belch, and Kansani's movements grew even more frantic. He knew his time was running out. <br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kogenta was distracted from this newfound joy by Riku's return. <br>\r\n\"Kogenta! Are you alright? Ko-\" He stopped, staring in disbelief. <br>\r\nAnd as Riku tried to make sense of what he was seeing, Kogenta was feeling very thoughtful. If he wasn't a proper Shikigami anymore, that meant Riku wasn't his Toujinshi. That meant he didn't have to do what he said. In fact, Kogenta was the stronger of the two of them. Maybe it was time Riku started doing what he said... And Kogenta had a whole new world of pleasures to explore. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grinning evilly, Kogenta got to his feet and reached under his bloated stomach to hold it up and keep it from getting in the way, then raced towards the shocked RIku. His human friend turned to run, but he was easily knocked down, and when he rolled over to look at at Kogenta, he was pinned in place by a gut full of squirming Kansani, and he stared up at the leering face of his Shikigami. <br>\r\nKogenta was really enjoying this. He'd sometimes wrestled with Riku, but it was mostly just a brief tussle before the human gave in. Kogenta's former Toujinshi, Yakumo, would have fought forever, but Riku was much, much more submissive. And truthfully, Kogenta had a lot of fun play-dominating Riku. The human was just so cute and helpless... Pinning him under the wiggling weight of his trapped foe just made this all the sweeter. Except that Riku looked really scared now, and Kogenta didn't like that at all. His grin faded and he reached down to stroke Riku's hair, ignoring the fact that it made the boy flinch. <br>\r\n\"Oi, Riku... What's with that look? You can't be scared of me, can you?\" He knew that Riku had every reason to be freaked out, but he knew the best way to make Riku change his mind about something was to make him feel guilty. Riku was not to be pacified so easily, though, as he looked between Kogenta and his Kansani-filled belly frantically. <br>\r\n\"You... you ate Kansani! You ate him! But... how could you... why... I...\" His sputters were silenced when Kogenta gently laid a finger across his lips. He had to think fast, now. He'd mostly been acting from anger and impulse, and he had to phrase his excuse carefully to the kindhearted Riku if he wanted him to understand. <br>\r\n\"Hush, Riku... Yes, I ate him. He must have eaten many people, and now he is facing his karma...\" He kept his voice calm and soothing, only his lashing tail betraying his worry. No matter how much joy he knew his new ability would bring him, he knew it couldn't compare to Riku's friendship. He had to find a way to keep both, and his words would be the key. \"I have destroyed many other Shikigami, some with my sword, Kotetsu, others with my power, and many with your help. Now, thanks to Kansani's curse, I can do it with my stomach.\" He patted his stomach for emphasis. Now it was time for some creative lying. \"Just like Shikigami, he is immortal, but it will take a long time for him to come back, maybe hundreds of years, and he will have learned his lesson in Naraku by then.\" Somehow, Kogenta knew that Kansani wasn't going anywhere. He didn't know how he knew, but he was certain that the black tiger's fate would be much more... ;fitting' to one so evil as he. But Riku would never know if Kansani came back or not, so Kogenta could get away with his lie. He smiled when he saw Riku relax. Of course Riku believed him, for why would Kogenta lie? The Byakko reached down and gently took hold of Riku's hands and put them on both sides of his stomach. \"Go ahead, feel for yourself.\" Gingerly, Riku began to rub the sides of Kogenta's stomach, making the white tiger purr loudly. Oh, to feel rubbing both inside and out...! Riku even began to nuzzle the fleshy prison of Kansani, clearly starting to enjoy himself. \"Good boy.\" Kogenta purred, petting his human's head. <br>\r\nEventually, they got to their feet and headed for home, Kansani finally accepting his fate and falling unconscious inside the victorious Byakko. <br>\r\nThey had spare rooms, but Kogenta wanted to stay with Riku. The boy pulled out another futon and set it next to his own, and they lay down to sleep, Riku curled around the gurgling gut that held the slumbering, doomed black tiger. <br>\r\nHis stomach so stuffed with food, and such a long day behind him, Kogenta soon fell asleep, and his stomach truly began work on Kansani. The wicked one was massaged and kneaded by the soft, hot walls, as the liquid he was bathed in started soaking into his skin, into his entire body, and he slowly began to merge with the fleshy container. Kansani felt all his anger and disgust and hate melt away, and he joyfully accepted the union between himself and Kogenta, yielding all his power and knowledge, and just a bit of a dark side to the Byakko. In his sleep, Kogenta's body began to grow, his muscles becoming bigger and a little more sharply defined, his maleness tripling in size, and his white fur taking a slightly darker tint as his stomach shrank and returned to muscular flatness. He purred, his dreams filled with naked, teasing black tigers that swore they were his for all time. Of course that was enough to get him excited, and his firm member was almost painfully hard when he awoke just before dawn, his mind arush with newfound knowledge and hunger and desires. </span></div></div>",

Nothing like a good hunt.\" He smiled and sheathed his sword on his back.<br>\r\nThe Byakko continued to rub his belly as he walked away from the mountains. <br>\r\nTo an onlooker, it would have seemed an impressive sight, but he knew all those Yokai were only a simple meal.<br>\r\nThey were creatures of vice and human suffering, and had little substance.<br>\r\nEven swallowing a human would make a bigger bulge than the one he had now. <br>\r\nHe licked his lips at the memory of that last evil Toujinshi, and belched again, causing another avalanche. <br>\r\nAfter he had walked for a ways, he paused and sniffed the air. <br>\r\nThere was a new scent on the wind, but who was it...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Riku checked the clock on his phone, more to try and calm himself than seeing what time it was. <br>\r\nHe had to wait for the full moon to appear from behind the clouds before he could go, and the clouds didn't care what time it was. <br>\r\nEarlier, Kogenta had come out of his Toujinki with a strangely serious expression. He'd told Riku that there was something they had to do tonight to cement their relationship as partners. He'd refused to say anything else, and only told Riku that the ritual had to take place in the Fukamaden, the world of the Shikigami. <br>\r\nThe only way to get there was through a Kimon, a portal that only opened when it was struck by the light of a full moon. <br>\r\nSo now he waited, wondering what the ritual would entail, and if they were ready, and if it was dangerous, and if... And then there was no more time for wondering, as the light of the moon streamed down from the heavens and through the open door of the shine, resting on the floor and making the circle of strange symbols glow with purple light. Riku readied himself, then stepped forward and fell down into the strange world of the Fukamaden. He seemed to float slowly, yet the floating landscape of four seasons rushed past him, and everywhere shogi floated in mid-air, the paper doors seeming infinite in number in the world of the Shikigami. <br>\r\nEventually, his decent took him towards one that opened wide, showing bright light before he landed in a pile of pillows. Shaking himself to clear his head from the long, strange trip, he looked around. It seemed like some kind of cave, with a few decorations here and there to make the place feel more like a home. It was actually pretty nice looking. <br>\r\n\"It's my home. This is where I live between Contracts with Toujinshi.\" Riku was startled when Kogenta's voice came from behind him. The Byakko stood with his hands on his hips, looking very pleased with himself. \"I don't need to be summoned here. This is my home, so I have the power to appear here whenever I want.\" He sat down on the cushions next to Riku, then reclined, stretching and yawning. \"I always wanted to show you this place, and it's the ideal location for our ritual.\" Riku politely looked around and admired the decor before turning back to Kogenta expectantly. <br>\r\n\"Kogenta? What exactly is this ritual?\" He wasn't scared, not really. He was more nervous. Riku had no idea what they would be doing, but Kogenta had spoken about the ritual in grave tones. It was a big deal, and would affect his future with his best friend and partner. He really hoped he wouldn't mess up somehow. <br>\r\nKogenta was quiet for a few more moments, then sat up and turned to Riku, staring at him intently. <br>\r\n\"Riku, I'm the Shikigami of Trust. That means that there has to be a great amount of trust between me and you.\" Riku opened his mouth to say that he did trust Kogenta, but the white tiger raised his big paw to stop him before he spoke. \"I know, you trust me as a partner, and I trust you as a partner. You've come a long way from the boy who didn't know anything about Shikigami or Toujinshi...\" Riku blushed from the rare compliment. \"And yes, you trust me to win battles and protect innocent people, just like in our contract. You trust that I'll always protect you, just like I know I can trust you to try and protect me.\" Kogenta didn't mention the fact that it was very strange, almost backward for a Toujinshi to fight to project his Shikigami, but it was also very touching, and the Byakko appreciated it more than he dared say. Now was not the time for soft thoughts, though. This ritual was very important. Riku was the Head of the Ten-Ryuu, and he might not survive unless his bond with Kogenta was as strong as possible. <br>\r\n\"But it isn't enough. Riku, I want you to trust me more than you do. More than you've ever trusted anyone. And there is only one way to make that happen. A test. A way for us to prove that we are worthy of one another's trust. Are you ready?\" Now Riku really was scared. It all sounded so ominous, and Kogenta had such a hard expression. But Riku wanted this. He wanted to be closer to Kogenta, as much as he could. The timid Toujinshi slowly nodded. Kogenta looked satisfied. \"Good! Now, the ritual works both ways, and we both must take our turn, so I'll let you choose who goes first.\" Kogenta still hadn't said what he needed to do, so Riku was left wondering who was to prove their trust to who. He took a deep breath and made his choice. </span></div></div>",

Riku was puzzled, then a little alarmed when Kogenta looked at him and said \"Oi, Riku. Better take off your shirt, otherwise it will be ruined.\" <br>\r\nUnsure of what else to do, RIku pulled his shirt off as well, putting it next to Kogenta's shirt and gloves, which were soon joined by the Byakko's shoes, the bell on the end of his tail, and lastly his pants and fudoshi. Riku blushed furiously as his now naked Shikigami strolled towards him. \"K...Kogenta, what kind of ritual is this?!\" <br>\r\nThe white tiger chuckled and put his large hands on the human's bare shoulders to reassure him. \"Relax, Riku. I'm not after your virtue...\" He lifted one paw and extended a claw to gently trace Riku's lips. \"I mean it, just relax. You are the one who is in control, now. I place my fate, my life, my future and my immortality in your hands. I trust you, Riku.\" And with that, carefully inserted his claw into Riku's mouth, and suddenly shoved his whole hand inside! Riku tried to rear back, but Kogenta's other hand was holding him in place. Instead of piercing the back of his throat at he'd expected, the claw and Kogenta's whole hand slipped easily down his throat. Riku thought he was going to choke, but he swallowed the Byakko's hand as easily as water, and the calm smile never left the tiger's face. \"See, Riku? Not a problem.\" Riku was too frightened by what was happening to process what Kogenta had said, but then he lowered his head and shoved that inside Riku's mouth as well, followed by his other shoulder. The human was forced to hold onto Kogenta to keep his balance as the white tiger pushed himself easily down Riku's throat, his tail lashing excitedly behind him. Riku's throat bulged with Byakko, and he mindlessly rubbed the sleek fur of his Shikigami as he fed himself to his human, inch by inch as Riku reflexively swallowed, until Kogenta's hand was in his stomach, followed by his arm and then his head popped inside the human's tummy. Riku whimpered when this happened, feeling such alien but not unpleasant sensations from having something big and live inside of him. Kogenta was <b>in</b> him! How was this even possible?! But he had no time to fully contemplate it as the shift in the center of their gravity forced him to sit down, his mouth stretching wider to admit more and more of Kogenta's slim, muscular torso, helpless to resist. Now Kogenta's hips approached his lips, and he blushed to see the firm, tight ass of his partner getting closer. It was only normal for a boy his age to be curious about such things, and he did have something of a small crush on the aggressive, heroic Shikigami he'd contracted. Of course this would be the moment Kogenta stopped pushing himself inside, seemingly content to be half inside and half outside of his human's body. Was this the ritual? Was he trusting that Riku would try to pull and vomit him out, rather than push and swallow him down? <br>\r\n\"Oi, Riku!\" Kogenta's impatient voice was muffled, but audible. \"Hurry up and finish! My ass is cold!\" Distressed and confused, Riku grabbed hold of Kogenta's butt (Oh, it felt so nice in his grip...!), and pulled, gulping hard and sending it join the rest of Kogenta, and tipped his head back to point Kogenta's legs at the ceiling, and swallowed them and his tail, finally sealing both feet and tail-tip behind his lips and gulping, until his lap was filled with his grossly distended gut, full of moving Byakko. <br>\r\n\"Kogenta!\" His distress and confusion made him shout so loud his Shikigami wince and cover his ears. \"What the hell is this?! Get out of my stomach this instant! What are you doing? What's going on? Why-\" <br>\r\n\"RIKU! Calm down!\" Even inside of his stomach, Kogenta had a way of radiating authority. Riku shut up, but still looked very upset. \"This is the ritual. The ultimate show of trust. Inside of your body, you have total control. You control what happens to me. If you want to, you could digest me and gain great power. All you have to do is say 'I cancel our contract. You are mine.'. It's called Sakashiki, and you could use it to take my body and power as your own.\" Kogenta rubbed the walls of the stomach fondly. \"But you won't. I trust you, Riku. So I'm just going to take nap, and when we wake up, I know you'll let me out so we can finish the ritual.\" He yawned and stroked the walls again. \"I trust you.\" He repeated tenderly. And with that, he curled up and soon fell asleep. <br>\r\nRiku was left feeling awed by both the bizarre ritual and the amount of faith Kogenta had in him. Surely most Shikigami could not believe with their whole heart that their Toujinshi would not take their power for their own? He rubbed his stomach, feeling how oddly good it felt to be so stretched out and full and blushed at the realization that his very naked crush was actually sleeping <i>inside</i> of him. <br>\r\nNow, he made his choice of what to do. <br>\r\nCould Kogenta trust him?</span></div></div>",

He stepped forward, and began to remove Riku's outer shirt. The human seemed a little confused, but graduated to freaked out when Kogenta pulled his shirt of. \"Kogenta! What are you...?\" <br>\r\n\"Oi, relax, Riku. You need to remove all your clothes for the ritual.\" Riku was still a little uncertain, but allowed Kogenta to finish pulling his shirt off. He stepped back then, and blushed as he slowly removed his own pants. <br>\r\n\"So... is this a bathing thing, or...?\" He couldn't manage to look Kogenta in the eyes, and his shyness wasn't at all helped by the fact that his Shikigami had folded his arms and was boldly staring at him as he undressed. He wondered if it would be like the simple trust exercises he saw on TV, where one person would fall back into the other's arms. He doubted it would be that simple, as such things were the closest the modern world could get to mass producing a complicated relationship like trust. He didn't dare suggest something like that to Kogenta, who had raged at the television for hours when he saw it demonstrated. But what could require him to take off all his clothes? It would leave him in a very vulnerable state, was that it? He had to trust Kogenta when he was at his most defenseless? Maybe he would just have to put on some ceremonial garment. That idea appealed to him, as the ancient costumes of the Ten-Ryuu had always seemed really cool and natural to him. Maybe he would have to wear one and slice a special kind of In as part of the Ceremony. <br>\r\nBut Kogenta just gave him a toothy smirk. \"Something like that.\" Kogenta reached down and pulled off his own shirt, yet didn't remove anything else. Riku was more confused than ever, and had gotten his shoes and socks off. Now he was just wearing his underwear, and was very reluctant to remove it. Kogenta just looked at him expectantly and waited. Half turning to the side, Riku tried to hide both his rear end and his maleness from his partner as he quickly pulled down his underwear and covered himself with his hands, his face deep red. <br>\r\nKogenta just chuckled at his shyness and stepped forward. \"Alright, Riku. Now comes the hard part.\" His face lost its mirth and he looked very serious. \"I'm going to start the ritual now, and it will probably frighten you.\" Kogenta wanted desperately to tell his human that all would be well, that he would never even consider hurting him, and that he would even find the experience pleasant if he just relaxed and tried to enjoy it. Unfortunately, he couldn't say any of that. The ritual required the utmost Trust, and Trust was something you gave freely, not in return for reassurance. Oh sure, if your heart had been broken and you doled out Trust sparingly, it was understandable that you had to be comforted before giving it out. But Riku trusted friend and foe alike, and if he didn't prove that he trusted his own partner without limit, they were in trouble. \"...If you become to scared, just tell me so and we'll stop.\" He couldn't help but add that part. Riku was his Toujinshi, and as such was owed Kogenta's devotion, but somehow this human was very precious to him. And seeing him naked and trembling and afraid like this make Kogenta want to break the rules and tell him everything. <br>\r\nNo, he had to be strong. \"Alright, Riku, give me your hands.\" <br>\r\nRiku wanted to reach out instantly to demonstrate his Trust, but his hands moved slowly. He couldn't help it, he was very uncertain. But that was alright as far as Kogenta was concerned. Reluctance wasn't a problem, so long as it ended with demonstrating that you trusted in spite of your fear. He gently took Riku's hands into his own much larger paws and raised them up to his mouth, rubbing the soft skin of the back of Riku's hands against his lips. <br>\r\nRiku was blushing for an entirely new reason now. Kogenta regretted that they wouldn't have more time to play like this, but he knew it was best to start and finish the ceremony so as not to draw out Riku's suffering. <br>\r\nIn one smooth motion, he pushed both hands inside his mouth and swallowed, dragging Riku forward as his arms were gulped up to his elbows. The look on Riku's face now was priceless, and Kogenta fought back the powerful urge to laugh. This was serious, dammit, and if he laughed he might honestly choke, and this was the last way he wanted to die. He swallowed again, this time putting his arms behind Riku's back and pulling him forward as he did so. The scene almost resembled a lover pulling his precious one closer, a vision that was not lost on Kogenta. He shoved it to the back of his mind, as now was not the time for such thoughts, either. Riku looked very afraid, and yet his mouth was firmly shut, either because he was keeping his end of the deal by not objecting, or because he was too frightened or shocked to speak. It would still count as Trust so long as he didn't struggle or cry out, but Kogenta didn't feel this was fair, so he looked as calm and professional as he could with a pair of arms in his mouth, and rubbed the back of Riku's head to calm him. Riku did seem to calm down just a little, and stopped weakly tugging back against the suction of Kogenta's throat. Their faces were almost touching now, and Kogenta couldn't help but pause and stare into Riku's eyes. They'd never been this close before... No! Later! Ceremony first! He opened his mouth much wider, and took RIku's head inside. <br>\r\nHis tongue lapped the frightened boy's face, and he gulped again, and again, until the upper section of Riku's back was inside of him as well. The human tasted so nice...! To feel his warm, living flesh sliding down his throat was exquisite! He really hoped that Riku would be up for doing this again. He reached down to Riku's waist and lifted him up, where the human's legs kicked feebly, and began using gravity to help him consume his friend. Kogenta couldn't help but notice that his human's bare ass was not unappealing as it wiggled above him. The Shikigami scowled to himself. He probably should have resolved all these unspoken issues before they began, and yet he was certain they would be easier to get through once they had established the vital bond of Trust. <br>\r\nHe continued to swallow and now his tongue licked Riku's belly button which prompted a shuddering giggle all through RIku's body, and made the Shikigami smile. The Shikigami sniffed his friend, and was pleased that Riku had washed himself thoroughly before he went out this night, as it made him easier to swallow and more palatable for the tiger's tongue. To avoid anymore awkwardness, he opened his mouth wide again and engulfed Riku up to the top of his thighs, and couldn't help but lap at the human's maleness when he did. Both of them shuddered pleasantly at that, and Kogenta kept gulping to avoid thinking about it. <br>\r\nSoon, Riku had pooled entirely into Kogenta's stretching stomach, and the furry mound bulged out in front of the white tiger as he wrapped his tongue around the human's feet before sending them down to join his friend inside of him. His ears were perked, but all he heard were the gurgles as his stomach accepted its new occupant and Riku's faint whimpers. <br>\r\nHe sighed with relief. Riku had passed the test. Now there was just his part of it, and then Riku's turn. He rubbed the Riku-shaped bulge fondly and smiled. \"Oi, Riku. You alright? I think you guessed by now that this is the test, and you passed.\" He could actually feel the tension drain out of Riku inside of him and shivered. It... his stomach felt so <i>sensitive</i>...! He could feel every inch of his human's body, and he was loving it. He didn't even realize he was wearing a dopey expression of contentment as he sank to the ground, clutching the bulge. \"Don't worry, you're safe, of course. In the morning I'll let you out, and it will be my turn.\" Riku started to speak up, but Kogenta tightened his abdominals firmly to hug him more tightly. \"Hush now. I know you're tired, so just try and get some sleep...\" The human began to realize this was true, and the warm and comfortably wet walls of Kogenta's stomach were strangely soothing. He was asleep before he realized it, leaving Kogenta awake and lounging in his pile of pillows, stroking the bulge and thinking. <br>\r\nOf course Riku was safe inside of him...<br>\r\nBut did he really have to let him out in the morning? It seemed much too soon... </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">   This story takes place in the anime universe of Onmyou Taisenki. Since many of the Shikigami characters(They are these spirits that work with humans and fight for them) are furry, it only makes sense this series would be used for some vore eventually. In addition, WG(Characters getting fattened up) is allowed as well. You can make your additions WG, Vore, or both!<br>\r\n   Rules-1)You may use any kind of vore except hard vore(Chewing,tearing,blood,etc). In other words, unbirth,oral vore,anal vore,etc. are all allowed. <br>\r\n        2)Homosexual or heterosexual love and/or sex is allowed.<br>\r\n        3)Fancharacters are allowed in the story, but you must use an official character somewhere along the line.<br>\r\n        4) Regarding WG, try not to make the WG too outrageous, you can make them have very large bellies, but try to keep them able to walk(Even if with some difficulty X3) If a char must weigh several thousand pounds, find some means to increase their other limbs' size to make it proportionate. <br>\r\n        5)That's basically it. Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I do not own Onmyou Taisenki or related characters.<br>\r\n   </td>",
