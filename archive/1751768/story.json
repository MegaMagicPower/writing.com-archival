            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yui gazed down at the wooden surface of the table she sat at, her eyes fixated on the emptiness it presented to her. Like always Yui had came to the Light Musics clubroom in hopes of getting things done within her band \"Houkago Tea Time\". Unfortunately, all she found was the silence of a near empty club room that, quite honestly, was doing a very fine job of depressing her a bit. Thankfully, Yui wasn't the only one here today, a little ways away from her Mio Akiyama had just arrived and, having telling her that Ritsu would be late, had gotten her things situated for when the others would arrive and was now working on writing a song for them to practice...provided they would arrive on time. Was it expected to be like this on certain days? Sure, after all, people do have lives to attend to outside of the club and thus, their not always destined to show up on time and ready to do stuff like Yui was today. However, the fact that this has happened for sometime now only seems to worry the bass player a bit more than it should. More importantly on the empty seat ahead of her, the visage of their Keyboardist, Tsumugi Kotobuki, being absent from her view. Normally Mugi, as everyone would come to call her, would arrive with snacks and various other knick-knacks they could use for maybe the band or an upcoming performance. Too bad, this was not the case today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, this would be the third day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third day in which Tsumugi didn't show for their club activities. Yui wanted to think that nothing had really happened to Mugi but...after three days of her not showing up for both the club and school...it was only natural that Yui's mind began to shift into worry. This was starting to get a little worrisome, Mugi's never been absent more than three days before and now that the third was about to come to a close, it would soon lead up to the longest time the keyboardist had ever been away from them. Sure, maybe Yui was worrying a bit too much on it, but the fact that she also didn't know the reason why Mugi was so scarce around the club seemed . Maybe...Mio knew what was going on? She always seemed like the most sensible one of the band...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mio...\" Yui muttered, her voice being the only source of noise in the silent clubroom. The sound of Yui's voice awoke Mio from her reading and toward the worried bass player ahead of her. \"Do you think Mugi-chan's okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio knew what Yui was speaking of, it was a question that's been on everyone's mind for the days she's been absent. As a result, it wasn't exactly something she could effectively answer like she wanted to. The reason behind Mugi's disappearance was a mystery that even she would like to know the solution of. \"Ah...uhm...\" Mio didn't like having answers for these sort of situations, but it couldn't be helped...not when Mio was just as ignorant on the whereabouts and condition of their beloved keyboardist. Of course, this didn't mean she couldn't answer the question, \"...Mugi's probably fine...she's probably come down with something and has to stay home from school.\" Yeah...maybe that's it. People get sick and, when they get sick, they stay home from where ever they normally hang out at and what not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...was this really the reason...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mugi being ill was really the only thing Mio could possibly think of that could explain her extended absence from the school scene, the other leaned more toward something coming up with her family that caused her to lose time at school. Either way, Mugi wasn't here...and folks were starting to get worried about her either way. Namely Yui who took a lot of concern in her band members when it came to their overall well being. With Yui's question answered, Mio turned her attention back to writing that song she had focused on before the concern of Mugi arose. However, as soon as Mio wrapped up a single verse revolving around frilly socks and...kittens, an increasingly saddened sigh swept across the room, the source being no one else but Yui, her upper body lazed across the table she sat at as she practically radiated of negative emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should try playing something to take your mind off of things...?\" Mio spoke up, trying to find at least some way to get Yui up and about, instead of down and out. She was used to seeing Yui upbeat and cheerful, always giving the band the encouragement...it was almost unnatural to see Yui so...out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caaaaan't...\" Yui whined in a childish tone, \"I'm too worried about Mugi-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that didn't work. Mio took a moment and scrounged her mind for another solution to this problem, the black haired guitarist scratching the side of her head as several half baked ideas came and went through her sea of thoughts. However, as Mio attempted to pull a mental rabbit out of her hat... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone~\" Came a largely familiar voice, the sound of it alone doing well to perk Yui's spirits and arouse Mio's surprise. Turning from their position they came to see Mugi coming into the clubroom a smile on her rounded face. Out of all the things Yui liked to see...she never would have thought she'd be so happy to see Mugi's thick, eyebrows again. Almost immediately, Yui sprang from her seat and trotted over to the keyboardist. \"Sorry, I'm late I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mugi-chan, you're back~\" Yui chirped loudly, completely interrupting Mugi's explanation as to why she was absent and coming to embrace the keyboardist in a friendly hug, thrilled to see her friend after 3 straight days of her not being around. To Yui, it was like a miracle that she was able to return and in perfect health at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was only gone for three days...\" Mugi commented with a nervous chuckle, her gaze running over to Mio for answers as to why Yui was so anxious to see her after only 3 days of being apart. The guitarist merely gave her a shrug in response. \"A-Anyway, it's good to see you too, Yui-chan...you as well, Mio-chan~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, although I do have to wonder why you were absent for three days, were you sick?\" Mio questioned, Yui letting go of Mugi as she realized that the unknown could easily be answered right here and now. However, as Yui took a moment to release her grasp on Mugi, the true visage of the keyboardist came into full view. Mugi's body had underwent a mysterious set of changes in the short time she's been absent and the over all appearance of their friend had expanded all over, from breast to thigh. For starters, her exposed legs were looking a little more shapely and plump, her hips also seemed to have widened a small amount. The already generous bust she had originally had ballooned up a cup size or two and was now resting lazily atop a rounded, plump belly that was bulging against the blazer of Mugi's uniform with it's increasing girth. Mio was quick to voice these observations in her next question. \"...And did you gain weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this would have been an insult to many girls Mugi's age, especially since the Mugi herself was rather sensitive about her body, Mugi merely chuckled at Mio's question as she set to enlighten them on what had happened to her. \"You could say I was sick, yes...but I'm well now.\" Mugi told the two curious high schoolers, her hand gravitating the bulging middle she bore. \"I had a rather...romantic encounter with a special someone a few nights ago, the morning after I had found I wasn't feeling well and decided to stay home. My parents insisted I stay home for 2 more days to make sure I would get better again. Over that time I found myself eating...quite a bit and well, you can see how this came about.\" Mugi giggled poking her tummy, her finger almost barely managing to sink into the layer of pudge she had supposedly accumulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's how-\" Mio froze as she recalled the phrase 'romantic encounter', \"W-wait, did you say romantic encounter!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, why yes...I met someone very special several nights ago...\" Mugi answered, with a warming smile and a soft blush on her cherubic cheeks. Mio blinked for seconds, her confusion on who this someone Mugi 'romantically' encountered was and what it would mean for them as a band...</span></div></div>",

His name his name his name!\" chirped Yui with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we both bumped into each other and I accidentally spilled my soda on him. Even though he did say 'not to worry' I did feel rather guilty about it! So we went to the bathroom to help clean up his shirt. Then we properly introduced ourselves, and I found out his name is Sojuro Nishikawa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he look like? On a scale of one to ten how ddi he look?\" asked Ritsu, eager to learn more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looked cute, and he had a bit of a sheltered personality and has brown eyes with black hair. After I helped him clean up we decided to hang out for the night at the concert and we danced together quite um...interestingly...\" Mugi blushed, remembering how they danced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" oiled Yui, her eyes looking sly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afterwards, he decided to walk me home. Since my parents were out to dinner(this is was early at night by the way) I invited him inside and...we sampled a bit of my dad's sake and...um..one thing lead to another and the morning after I felt quite sick, and the rest is history!\" Giggled Mugi. Mio's eyes went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Romantic encounter...sick the next day...could it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Mugi-chan's got a boyfriend first!\" whined Yui, before smiling again. \"Still we gotta go meet him again! Did you get his email?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I think I may have did exchanged emails let me-\" she was interrupted by her stomach growling, to which she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'll be right back. I'm going to the vending machine. Anyone want to come with? I can text Sojuro-san while we do so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Yui and Ritsu in tandem, Mio nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the girls walked out of the classroom. Mio's mind was still on the thinking railroad though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It makes sense...with the age limit here in Japan being 14...but still for Mugi-chan to get...' she shook her head.

Although, she did seem rather happy about who she met, but Mio couldn't be sure on if Mugi was really...well, pregnant. The factors all matched and the shape did as well, but could Mio really draw that conclusion here? Well, she could but it'd still be worth a try to actually ask Mugi about it all and see what she thinks. Perhaps...she already knows but, wants to keep it a surprise? Gah, so many questions and uncertainties and not a lick of answers to sate these persistent curiosities. Well, there was one way to clear all of this up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to ask her.\" Mio told herself, peering outside to see the trio of school girls crowded near the vending machine further down the hall. Mio couldn't exactly make out what they were saying but, she could tell they were enjoying the conversation quite a bit. One thing Mio seemed to take note of was just how much Mugi was eating. While both her and Mugi were known to keep watchful eyes on their weights, Mugi seemed to have a disposition now where none of it even mattered. This being revealed by how many snacks she held in her hand. Sure, she was hungry but, to not even Mio would want to go through 4 bags of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio took in a deep breath and stepped out of the classroom, making her way over to the chattering group that seemed to be bombarding Mugi with all manners of attention and questions. As she drew closer, Mio could begin to hear just what it was they were talking about...and not any of it was focused on Mugi's expanded frame or (supposedly) increased appetite. \"Leave it to them to forget about the details...\" Mio sighed with exasperation, her visage seeming to catch Mugi's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, hey Mio-chan~\" She greeted, seeming to finish off the first bag of chips as she tossed away the hollow remains of the bag into the nearby trash can. \"We were wondering when you would show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was...just getting things organized.\" Mio replied, only telling part of the truth on her hesitation to join them. Mio's eyes drifted to Mugi's rounded belly, it's large form pressing heavily against Mugi's uniform in protest of being contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mio-chan! Mugi said she knew of a place where we could play if we really wanted to~!\" Yui blurted out, Mio's train of thought derailing in a violent manner and almost being enough to jar her right off her feet. This...wasn't what Mio was particularly interested in now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, that's great, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she said that , and we could get paid a lot of money if we play there!\" Now it was Ritsu's turn to burst in with an opinion that...Mio didn't need or want to hear at the moment. Mio didn't speak up this time, her voice lost in the paranoia of having her questions thoroughly kept at bay by the two energetic teenagers ahead of her. For some reason...Mio felt that she might not be able to talk to Mugi until sometime after school when Ritsu and Yui were not around. This mostly being proven true by how the two seemed way too focused on the rounded Mugi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio sighed and shook her head as she prepared to continue the day with a burning question buzzing within her skull for the rest of the day. \"<i>...I'll just ask her after school...it should be easier to do without them around.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Mio had feared the rest of the day was perhaps one of the more anxious days she's ever had in...quite a while. The curiosity of knowing whether Mugi was pregnant or not continued to bother and eat away at Mio's mind, while nothing of the madness sort, it was still quite frustrating to try and focus on academics with such a burning question still crackling in her brain like a freshly built fire. Even so, the day did not last forever and, soon enough, the school day at Sakuragaoka High School came to an end. While Ritsu and Yui were quick to head off home, Mio lagged behind a tad if only to catch Mugi on her way out. Something else that also was different about Mugi was that she was slower than normal, if only by a small amount. This seemed to be attributed by her awkward way of walking, which seemed to be like a light waddle, at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, Mio and Mugi had managed to meet up as the former had planned, the both of them walking to Mugi's home. Mio didn't seem to express concern of the distance between their homes. As they walked and talked about the day each of them had, Mio finally decided to come forth with her question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Mugi.\" Mio said, gulping a lump in her throat as the blonde gazed to her. I couldn't help but notice that you...look a lot different from before.\"  Even though Mio was aware that Mugi ate quite a lot today, she was still willing to walk on egg shells around the phrase 'did you gain weight'. \"Listening to your story, it's made me believe that...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made you believe what, Mio-chan?\" Mugi said with a tilt of her head, a stray hand giving attention to her swollen middle. Mio had to resist staring at it's size, though she did take note in how a few passing men didn't seem to mind ogling Mugi's new size, mostly in her much larger and quivering bosom plus that of her wide, swaying hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it made me think that you were...y'know...\" Oh great, the one point where she was supposed to seek answers and she's getting all bashful about saying it. A small blush raced across Mio's cheeks as she mustered up several nerves to continue with the magic word that would make or break this conversion. \"...Pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi paused where she was, blinking her sapphire blue eyes in a sense of bewilderment. The blonde then gazed down to her belly, taking note of how rounded it was. Mugi...didn't think she was pregnant, or at least, she didn't feel pregnant. Sure, there was that one time after lunch where she did but, that was due to being bloated with that big meal she had. After that, the sensation subsided and she...well, felt like Mugi again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mugi...?\" Mio spoke up watching as her friend seemed to be processing her words. \"W-well, maybe you're not pregnant after all, I...I just thought you were because of the story and how you looked. Sorry if I freaked you out or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi snapped out of her line of thought just in time to catch Mio shrinking from having inquired to her on if she was pregnant. \"No, no, it's fine, Mio-chan. Really~\" Mugi said with a smile, resuming her waddle alongside Mio up the street of the city. \"Honestly, I don't think I'm going to have babies anytime soon. I think I'm just...well, getting a tad bit chubby.\" Mio looked to Mugi for a moment, trying to recall if she actually heard Mugi admit to her that she...was getting chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And you're okay with it?\" Mio asked with a slightly quirked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't feel any worse even though I'm getting bigger. Soo, maybe it's not all bad?\" In truth, Mugi really didn't hold any ill emotions towards putting on weight now that she was getting a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...just so long as you're happy, then I suppose everything's fine then.\" Mio said, with a smile as her mind was finally put at ease with it's curiosities and questions. With her mind free of it's previous burdern Mio found herself a little more interested in what Yui and Ritsu were practically orgasming about earlier today, Mio turning to Mugi for a moment but found her attention diverted by a display of televisions within an electronics store. Mugi was quick to mimic her train of sight as she found her blue eyes glued to the dozens of televisions showing an...odd program of sorts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe televisions all displayed a barren and forboding landscape, buildings in a state of disrepair and ruin as well as mentioning the downfall of the economy. Violence was quick to show up thereafter as an ominous male voice fortold of a dark and  time in the future if things did not change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the atmosphere of the program changed dramatically at the showing of a woman that was obviously heavy with child and donning a simple, but elegant sundress. \"We need young minds...young minds to lead our country.\" Said the woman, hands stroking across the taut surface of her gravid middle. \"To brighten out future...\" Soon, more gravid women step foward to, all of them seeming to be dressed in the same garb. The once bleak set of clips that had rolled beforehand had now changed to represent something a bit more positive. Children in classrooms, then fast forwarding to these same children graduating then <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>At Hakutaka Industries, we believe our future lies within the cradle. Our children, they will be the ones to carry us to new heights and dreams. With our new program, those interested will give those who wish to have children the wish they want granted. We will provide aide and assistance to those with child; college grants, funds, we at Hakutaka will see to it that no family is left behind in these rough times. Please...think of the future and remember that you can make a difference...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that final line, an eye catch of some popular anime announced it's triumphant return and allowing Mio and Mugi to focus back on the reality they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a weird commercial...\" Mugi noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stepped out of bed, put on her jammies, and walked to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of grooming, she returned to her bedroom to check up in her closet and heard a loud vibrating sound coming from her desk. She walked over and inspected her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey Mio-chan! Mugi-chan is inviting the ban over to her family\u2019s ocean villa for the weekend! Get back to me ASAP ^_^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui-chan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: Azunyan is no longer feeling sick too. She can come by as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio blinked. \u201cOh yeah, she WAS sick wasn\u2019t she\u2026\u201d The thought totally blew past her mind and she realized that Nakano Azusa was sick with a common cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness it was something like that though. No doubt Yui and Ritsu will bombard her with the same questions the asked Mugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is puzzled on what he reaction could be. Whatever the result, Mio couldn\u2019t help but feel intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I better ask mom if I can go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-X-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoooow! This is Mugi-chan\u2019s villa!\u201d said Ritsu who practically orgasmed at the sight of the beach behind the white western-style mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to practice here is gonna be great!\u201d Added Yui. \u201cI wonder what type of food they got here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls quit it,\u201d said a slightly smaller girl with twin-tail black hair and a slightly mature disposition. \u201cWe haven\u2019t practiced in a while. How can we increase our skills if we don\u2019t hone them regularly like a muscle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Azunyan you sound so cute when you try to sound mature,\u201d cooed Yui. Azusa merely puffed her lips and looked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She WAS talking mature\u2026\u2019 thoight Mio, carrying her bass case. The other girls were also carrying their band equipment save for Ritsu, who didn\u2019t need to bring her drum set thanks to Mugi already having one. As Yui\u2019s mother waved goodbye and drove off, the girls walked up to the door and Mio knocked. Several moments later and the Light Music Club was greeted by a Mugi in a yellow two piece swimsuit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was eating on a chocolate bar, and the weight was much more evident now that she had less to conceal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what she looks like now: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blyzzarde.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=48#/d2tzk15\" target=\"_blank\">http://blyzzarde.deviantart.com/gallery/...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh my she gained even more weight!\u2019 thought Mio with raised eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiether Yui nor Ritsu shared her or Azusa\u2019s sublety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Mugi you\u2019re fat!\u201d They both said at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uneasy silence as Azusa just gawked, both at Mugi\u2019s increased size, and at how blunt her seniors were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the blonde merely chuckled. \u201cWell yes I have put on a few, but it\u2019s not like I am concerned or anything. I\u2019m still me right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you are Mugi-chan!\u201d Smiled Yui. Ritsu nodded her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Azusa had her mouth agape. \u201cMugi-san what happened to you? Did I miss anything while I was at home sick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yui and Ritsu would rattle off their mouths, Mio took her by the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s better if I can explain it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-X-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly two hours of band practice in the backyard, the girls sat down by a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzusa-san I think you were a tad bit slow on the guitar during that second song, but otherwise you did good,\u201d critiqued Mio. Azusa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight I\u2019ll take that into consideration.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd for you two,\u201d she turned towards Ritsu and Yui, were both staring out to sea. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t get so distracted we\u2019d have finished with that fourth song on the first go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we finished still Mio-chan! It\u2019s okay!\u201d Smiled Yui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did that song over ten times from the top\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cbut it\u2019s by the beach~,\u201d whined Ritsu. \u201cI wanna go swimming now~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have the whole day ahead of us and-\u201c Mio was cut off by a sudden growl. She turned toward\u2019s Mugi was patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOopsie. I guess I need to refill the tank,\u201d giggled Mugi as she sat up and walked towards the door and into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi noticed how bigger her posterior has gotten, as did Azusa\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026was it really a guy?\u201d Whispered Azusa into Mio\u2019s ear. When the band was setting up, Mio told Azusa about Mugi and her significant other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I asked her if she was pregnant yesterday and she said she was fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing sick for a couple of days after she met a boy and had some \u2018fun\u2019 with him?\u201d Said Azusa in an incredulous tone. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill\u2026I want to believe that Mugi may have just put on a few. Nothing wrong with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Yui and Ritsu are right,\u201d said Azusa. \u201cShe may BE knocked up, and if she continues eating at this pace, as well as being heavy with child? She\u2019ll be bigger than those woman from that odd commercial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean that Hakutaka commercial right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho wants some cake?\u201d Cooed Mugi as she brought out a tray and cake with white frosting and strawberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe please!\u201d said Yui and Ritsu in tandem. Mugi sat down, causing a slight creak in the chair and placed out the four plates and offered the spatula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you,\u201d grinned Mugi. And then\u2026</span></div></div>",

You know the other club members only tease you because you're a junior, the only one close to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what it's like being short.\" Azusa mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're still growing aren't you\", Jun said. \"I remember you grew a centimeter last time we had our physicals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A centimeter nothing to get excited about\", Azusa grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least your still growing\", Jun whined. \"I stopped growing in middle school.

Her height was the only thing big sis had that allowed her to keep the title of big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, she's just your older sister\", Jun said with a smirk. \"I'm sure she'll get over it, no matter how much taller you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUi stared down into her glass. \"Yeah, sure.\"</span></div></div>",
