I have a sufficiently muscular body, barrel-chest, round butt-cheeks, kind of beefy but not overly buffed, pretty much the body of a serious athlete. Growing up with four brothers, two older and two younger, I spent a lot of time wrestling and messing around with them, this led me to have some sort of fetish for domination. I'm looking forward to dominating my opponents, from forcing them to sniff the darkest and muskiest parts of my body to go as far as to fart until they pass out. I don't actually care for the win, as long as I get to dominate my opponent as much as I can I will keep the match going until I feel satisfied, or until I think I could seriously regret prolonging the match... Despite all this, I'm not the strongest fighter, which means I can lose, and I'm aware of that, so I'm always careful at the begging of a fight, especially if my opponents are more intimidating than me, however, I tend to lose that wariness once I start winning. While fighting I try to wear as little clothes as possible, believing they would somehow interfere with the nastiness of my stench, I only wear a black pair of speedos, and a jockstrap under it, in case I decide to use my bare butt to torture, my opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Feet:</b> Although these are not my favorite, since I walk barefoot everywhere it's logical they would be very bad<br>\r\n<b>Farts:</b> Ungodly. I have learned to fart on command and even realized how to make my farts smell worse...<br>\r\n<b>Body Musk:</b> Deadly. Working out to have a decent body makes me sweat a lot, the problem is, I never wash my body after workouts.<br>\r\n<b>Butt:</b>  Deadly. For some reason, my sweat and musk concentrate in my armpits, groin, and butt, which makes them smell horrible.<br>\r\n<b>Breath:</b> My breath is actually pretty tolerable... As long as I don't decide to burp.<br>\r\n<b>Stink Resistance:</b> 75<b>/100</b> Me and my brothers always used stink to mess with each other, especially farts, which made me very tolerable to other's odor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Special Abilities: </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fatal Gas:</b><br>\r\nI mastered a way to make my gas smell worse than ever and actually make them slightly visible. I can fart or burp a special concentrated greenish gas that can knock out someone with low stink resistance, and really disgust someone even if they are totally resistant to conventional stink. Since people can actually see it, it could be avoided if they have enough time to react. It could knock someone out in mere seconds if I release it too close to their face. To use it, it takes a lot of gas build up, so I must not fart or burp for a while for it to be fully effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sudden Sweat:</b><br>\r\nI can suddenly sweat a lot, this will make my general body musk (Armpits, groin, and butt) smell much worse for as long as I keep moving or struggling to make myself sweatier. Once I stop moving for a while, my body odor will go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brotherly Support:</b><br>\r\nI can call my four brothers to help me in a fight. They all look and smell similar to me, except my two younger brothers are shorter than me and my older brothers are a little taller. They all will help me against my opponent for a little while, until they get bored or if they see that even five of use can't take on them. They get bored quickly, so they don't stay for too long. I only call my brothers if I find myself in desperate situations or if the fight is too easy and I want them to have fun with my victim as well. They will only come once, and they might not be that helpful... (See Brotherly Rivalry below)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Weaknesses:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gas Frailty:</b><br>\r\nEven after spending my life with smelly guys, I never quite developed a resistance for farts, they smell worse than every other thing to me, and my nose becomes very sensitive if farts are released too close to me. My brothers would use this all the time if they intend to defeat me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Brotherly Rivalry:</b><br>\r\nEven if I call my brothers, they may decide to turn on me or each other if they just want to have more fun. This means that once they torture my opponent for a little while, they might just decide to have some fun with me instead of them. They can even get distracted by each other. If this happens, they usually stay longer in the fight. They will keep this going as long as none of us is in real danger, if they feel like someone is not doing this for mere fun they might start to help me again. It doesn't happen much... but it happens...</span></div></div>",

They mine resources at our whims or face the stink.  Seeing as this opponent was also a Wolf,  I eagerly stepped in the ring, ready to enslave them as well.

I use my overwhelming strength and muscle mass, specifically in my hind legs, to over power my enemies and force them into a corner, where typically they tap out after a few humiliating farts to their face convinces them that they are no match for me. At least that was my original description\u2026 I have been a slave to a champion since I lost a battle to them and they have trained me in stink resistance, and have been the cause of my mutations, I have disappeared for a while during this and almost became a legend, though specific champions do tell of my existence; though not outside of my masters fart chambers\u2026 During this training my flames have turned a bright green tint, I have learned finer control of my flames and have developed new strategies on how to use it\u2026 I am no champion yet, however I have stats nearly similar now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet: Pretty Bad, as hooves pick up little debris off the ground, however powerful knockout weapons.<br>\r\nFarts: Unbearable, but high volume due to the nature of my large size.<br>\r\nBody Musk: Unbearable, as I have not had a wash in a very long time.<br>\r\nButt: Between Unbearable and Ungodly, as a slave I was not permitted to wash as a part of my training, it did not go so well for my scent.<br>\r\nBreath: Ungodly, I brush regularly, but do not use toothpaste as it is a figment of the liberal media to convince us to buy useless appliances and pastes. I have taken much stink to the mouth through my mistresses training, it has caused my breath to be nearly as bad as her farts.<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 67/100, as I am a horse, I have a rather large nose and my nostrils run deep, so I am sensitive to smells, however my mindset and my will at any moment can cause my actual resistance to be much higher, as I am a muscle bound horse, I am not likely to put up with stink, or being humiliated for too long before a special ability kicks in, my stink resistance has went up over 40 points since I lost to my master and have been trained by them, however I do not deal with stinks too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial Abilities: <br>\r\nHysterical Strength<br>\r\nHysterical Strength I cannot control, it happens during a fight or flight response, such as moments of fear, or moments of extreme rage, being humiliated, especially by an enemies butt, increases the chances of this occurring. My strength is increased 3 fold as my brain allows control of entire muscles, as to the standard 33%, but enough science. At this point I can usually break out of any bounds or holds that may be frustrating me, or overpower my foes, it all depends on the variables of the engagement however. If I am unable to break free, this ability looks more like a big hissy fit and I imagine would be amusing, however I have never had this ability let me down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncineration<br>\r\nI concentrate my gas to use my burning tail to let out a rancid flaming fart, the damage dealt depends on the foe I am facing and their defence against flame. This ability takes a while to build up, as currently my gas is not concentrated enough to burn unless I have had time to concentrate it. Which also means I cannot use this move for at least 3 turns after farting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire Breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being exposed to much stink training at the hands of my master, my breath has become so foul that by utilizing my flame control; I am able to ignite it and cause a stream of green flames, I can use this to take down aerial targets as I hit them from afar and singe their feathers, disabling flight; or to melt incoming ice attacks and humidify incoming water attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW ABILITY: SIZE CONTROL<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tinkering with the inner workings of a Poke\u2019ball, and some horrible failures which were barely recovered from, I figured out how to adjust the inner workings of a Poke\u2019ball, specifically the mechanism that controls the size of a creature it is trying to absorb or expel.  In doing so, I have figured out how to use it, at a short distance, to increase or decrease my own size, or that of my opponents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enter the ring and give my butt 3 big smacks  and moon my foe immediately, \"You don't look so tough Mr. Big Bad Woof, come kiss my ass like the bitch you are.\" I say as I wiggle my butt at them looking back with a grin.</span></div></div>",

My rump is enormous and filthy, terrible farts, massive turds larger then a person, and wet swampy slop from my crack casually dropping. Flies regularly flock to my ass only to die with my next fart. I am the perfect mix of muscle for raw power and fat for a huge godly ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial Abilities:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha Stinker: My stinks are unstated. No matter how bad you stink. No matter how high you raise them. Your stenches will never be half as bad as mine. I can be beaten of course, but it must be through skill and strategy. As far as raw power and stench goes, I will always outclass you. My moves cannot be copied, and if they would be cancelled/blocked, they instead deal half damage. All of my stink attacks are KO moves. If you do not reply within an hour and a half, I win. No ability may block or prevent this effect; my stench is THAT bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize Change: I begin at twelve feet and can grow larger or shrink my opponent as desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStud's Fortitude:  I am immune to sluggishness, instant KO, and status effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod's Shower: I release a giant tidal wave of piss on the victim, marking them as mine. Unless they can shrug it off, they will become my slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevour: I swallow the opponent whole and turn them into shit. 90 minutes to escape my stomach as usual. If successful in a team battle, it fully heals me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling Sky: I take a massive shit that rains down to crush all below, destroying the ring if successful.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s not quite the brightest bulb in the bunch, but he\u2019s strong, fast, and extremely sadistic.   He has no fear of pain and loves dishing it out, whether that\u2019s mentally, physically, or straight to his opponent\u2019s pride.  He\u2019ll do anything he can think of to reduce an enemy to a groveling puddle on the floor, and he\u2019ll laugh maniacally all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, unfortunately, has a pride that could eclipse the moon.   He\u2019s never experienced defeat, and can\u2019t fathom the concept of loss.  He fights because he expects to win, and there\u2019s nothing he loves more than seeing an opponent finally understand their place and submit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities:  Wesson has extremely long, spindly limbs ending in massive, gnarled claws.  In a typical match he\u2019ll use them both to great effect, wrapping his opponents up in a powerful embrace and sinking his claws into their flesh to anchor himself in place, preferably with their snout buried in one of his more pungent assets\u2014 under his uncut cock, deep in his pits, against his feet, or even inside his unwashed ass.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis teeth are plenty sharp, but it\u2019s not the piercing fangs that are the major threat, Wesson\u2019s jaws are strong enough to crush bones.  Even if the conventional weapons fail, his breath is enough to finish the job; his diet of carrion does nothing to help his oral hygiene, and lesser opponents have been floored by a single whiff.   Stronger, more scent-resistant opponents are still often shaken by the smell of death washing over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he\u2019s in control, the foul hyena gets off on using painful holds, fear, and superior strength to force his opponent to perform humiliating acts in front of the live audience.  As a result, he usually draws a large crowd just itching to see his opponent squirm.   Defeated opponents have a tendency to leave the ring marked for life by his near-fatally foul hyena butter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he\u2019s taking a beating, Wess becomes more and more wild, and gives in to a cackling mania of snapping jaws and slashing claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther noteworthy information:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered from head to toe by such a recognizable, unwashable stench, many of his defeated opponents have nowhere in society that they can go, so they end up crawling back\u2014 often literally\u2014 to the Hyena to serve in his ever-growing pack.  As a result of the company he keeps, and his own filthy habits, Wesson is unphased by most musks and filth, and even revels in them.  </span></div></div>",

The arena is too small to get tired in, it's part of the reason Wesson loves it.  The prey cannot run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wess ponders the cat's meaning a chuckle escapes the hyena's throat.  The sudden sound and flash of emotion makes several in the audience jump and squirm uneasily.   Then, just as quickly, he has it back under control.   His jaw forms a snarling grin, his canine nose wrinkles to bare teeth that look more menacing than jovial, and then his mouth closes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings, and Wesson doesn't waste any time.

He felt the impact of the mat <i>through</i> the poor thing's body and watched its eyes go blank with the impact to its head   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA concerned expression flashes across the hyena's features:  His ears fold back against his head and his tail tucks low.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't done,<b><i> it better wake up.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pokes at Alpha with his muzzle, taking a deep breath of the runt's inferior scent.  Surprised by its potency, Wess shivers in delight against the small prey thing pinned underneath him and takes in another lungful of his toy's unwashed body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done playing, he knew his prey's scent would be long forgotten, buried beneath his own.  He had to appreciate it while he could; soon it wouldn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha's body shakes with coughs when he finally gets air back into his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess picked the runt up by the scruff of his neck and hoisted him up to eye level.  He makes eye contact with the smaller creature and interprets the expression there as a delightful combination of shock, fear, revulsion, and just the tiniest hint of the glazed over fog of resignation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess begins to shake silently with laughter.  Still holding his opponent at arm's length, supporting his squirming mass one handed with apparent ease, he doubles over.  The hyena's body shakes violently, causing the cat to jerk about in time to his still-silent laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Wess gets his laughing fit under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter builds visibly in his chest, its path is almost visible as it reaches his throat.  He makes the mistake of raising his prey up to eye level once more.  Laughter explodes from his grinning muzzle.  Wild, crazed laughter booms through the arena.  It continues unimpeded for minutes until even the audience and referees begin to squirm uncomfortably.   Each new wave of laughter carries Wess's fetid breath.  The scent of carrion and rot wash over the prey in his grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the laughter fades to wheezing attempts for the hyena to draw in air. It feels like the whole world goes silent in the maniacal laughter's absence. One last spasm works its way out of Wess's body with a faint chuckle before he brings Alpha in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a busy night ahead of you, are you ready to get started?\"  He asks the cat, the question oozing with sadistic glee and leaking barely contained laughter.   He stares at Alpha silently and with unblinking intensity, sincerely waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped the little guy would fight a little more, but unless the other fighter had something better, he supposed ultimately it didn't matter.  Either way, the hyena was going to have his fun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already planning how to get his victim to remain conscious as Wess forced him to suckle the potent pheremones straight from his anal glands.  All the others broke long before they got there, but this one seemed special.  The Hyena would take it slow, and even try his hand at being nice.  Maybe if he started with something more tolerable, like his breath, and worked his way down, allowing the prey to acclimate to his scent this one wouldn't get ruined.  And if he did, well, that was fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thought crossed his mind, Wess licked his lips, and grinned a dangerous yellow-toothed grin.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The You Vs Who revival was so popular, by popular demand, I have opened up another whole new one!   Fresh blank pages for writers everywhere :D!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------PLEASE READ ENTIRE INTRODUCTION-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- EDIT 2012, BELOW RULES NO LONGER HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED FULLY, If you wish me to step in, send a message; as for now I have decided to let the story go wherever the writers wish, I claim no responsibility for material posted however if one wishes it be removed, I can arrange that, have fun. -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will be many introductory blanks, to see recent posts, click that, if you cannot find new competitor then create your character and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are signing on to fight somone who has already posted their character, you CAN NOT make your character stronger than theirs, you must be equal or less, unless otherwise stated in the first poster's chapter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules are; Can either be a Humiliation Match or Strikeout, if you want to chose both, copy and paste your charachters details under both categories.<br>\r\n-Please finish all current fights before starting others or reach a mutual pause between fighters.<br>\r\n-Humiliation matches are the only matches you are allowed to give up. However the looser has to do three things the winner demands. Try not to put your character to shame. <br>\r\n-REFEREE: I will be the Referee of all matches, I will respond quickly, if I do not respond within 2 days of a needed response then all rules are forfeit and anything goes. I can be hurt/knocked out, any pins that take place while I am unconscious do not count and are just for the humiliation. When I am unconscious it lasts 5 chapters from the Writer who knocked me out's perspective, so a total of four. <br>\r\nThreatening the Ref to pull things in your direction is encouraged however can only happen if the Ref has declared your enemy to be in the Sluggish Status(Explained Later) for two chapters, if you harass/humiliate/threaten the Ref, your enemy cannot defend him for 3 of your own chapters. My giving in will be judged solely on your writing style, techniques, how bad the consequences for not giving in will be, my own dignity, and like or dislike of writer, so in a nutshell messing with me is a risky move but, you can demand I declare you a winner and if you got me to agree the opponent should be in a sluggish status already then this is your best bet probably. You both can try to get me to give in at the same time, if you fight me I will fight back for how much my character can, you can team up against me and see who I declare winner or call a round two, or anything else you might wanna ask the Ref.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SLUGGISHNESS; If you as a writer believe your enemy should be senseless and weak due to multiple chapters of heavy pounding, message me, and if you are technically correct for how they really would be feeling, I will decide on allowing them to go into a one to two chapter sluggishness, where all of their attempts to fight can be easily countered, and they are practically defenseless, however can still kick out, except kick out response time is decreased to 2 chapturs of your post with a pin in it. (this is the status your enemy must be in before you can try to humiliate or threaten them into taking your orders.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Location; can be anywhere the first poster chooses, the I as the Referee will always be there though. <br>\r\n-NO SELF-DECLARED WINS. If you pin somone, they have a time limit in which they must respond or else they loose, this time limit must be at least two hours. Time things right, everyone sleeps. If one person is already being owned but keeps kicking out, I will declare a winner myself. <br>\r\n-TRY TO WIN. Please create your favorite character and try to win, you shall face other winning competitors or a newbie if you have a win under your belt already. Do not write with intent of loosing.<br>\r\n-Fight for at least 3 to 5 chapters before trying to end the match. <br>\r\n-The readers choices must have at least one where they are allowed to make their own moves to escape yours(Readers Choice). The others are up to the writer of that chapter. <br>\r\n-If a writer successfully kicks out twice, the pinner will have to do one command by the ex-pinned until they can keep fighting. This is to encourage timing your pins well and to contain access pinning. These commands cannot cause the commander to win.<br>\r\n-ABILITIES: Your character can have any abilities they choose, be aware of the first writer's abilities, and be sure to make your own to counter them. If an ability is not stated in the intro page, it cannot be added, unless you win a fight, if you win, you will be allowed to add an ability and also modify your character slightly. Abilities can hender opponents if not properly countered, KO abilities cannot KO enemies unless they do not reply within a time limit of at least one and a half hours or more if you set a time limit after using a KO ability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut up your bio, battle choices, and wait for people to battle you!<br>\r\nDon't be afraid ^-^! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI encourage Dragons and Anthros, Furries, etc any species goes as long as it is not too rediculas, like a puddle or any non living stationary object... Except a virus... Other than that u mus b living. Virus vs Germ.. What kind of virus is made to target bacteria?! hmm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun and make your character Pwn the intarwebsz challengers! <br>\r\n</td>",
