When I cup my hand and hold it over my ear I also hear the ocean. I'm certain I can also smell humid salty sea air. It must be the ocean. I like the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open and walk through the blue door. Sure enough I stumble, literally, onto a sandy beach. The beach quickly rises to high cliffs and forms a beautiful bay. To my delight the sun is setting in the distance. I wish I had remembered to pack a jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around to mark the place the blue door let me on to the beach so I can return to it when I've had enough of the sea and sand. Wait. I'm sure it was here a minute ago. I'm certain I walked through a blue door on to this beach. Well, it's not here now. I guess I'll have to find another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's see. The sun is setting. There's a lovely dense jungle made up of palm trees, I hope they have coconuts, and dense undergrowth where I'm certain a blue door once stood open. I'll bet there are large snakes and other nasty creatures in all that undergrowth. I won't know until I pluck up the courage and walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hiking I must go. Oh, look here there's an animal trail I can follow. It will probably take me to a lagoon. A lagoon will be a perfect place to camp for the night and the next day and the one after that and...Where is this lagoon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold up, what's that I hear? Voices. A celebration maybe. Sounds like a party. I love a good party. Maybe they'll have an entire buffet laid out. A buffet of coconut dip and plantains. An entire meal of local delicacies. Probably most of them fruits and coconuts. I'm almost tired of coconuts already and I haven't even seen one yet. On the other hand I am very hungry. All that door sniffing did work up an appetite. A grand feast does sound lovely, as long as I'm not the main course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh here we are. Don''t those fellows look like their having a good time. What with their eye patches, their peg legs and cutlasses. All toasting each other around the fire. It looks like guys night out. I should fit in perfectly. They do seem a bit rough around the edges but their just blowing off steam. Boys will be boys after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well helloooo gentlemen. Mind if I join you?\" I think that's what I just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sure there's a record player around here some where because I'd swear I just heard the needle scratch across it as the music abruptly stopped and everyone is looking right at me. Some are looking at me in surprise. Some are looking at me suspiciously. Some are looking at me like they want to stick their swords through me and use my body as a nice planter. If they do use my body as a planter I hope they plant geraniums. I do like geraniums with a path down the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. What's this? They've just burst into laughter. What's so funny? Hey. You guys. What? Is there large badger behind me that's about to eat me alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well helllooooooo gentlemen. Mind if I join you?\" Well now I know they can understand me. Now that they're repeating back to me what I said. It sounds rather sarcastic though. They all seem to find it funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. I just said that. I just politely asked if I can join your little soiree. Your guys night out. Your celebration of life today, which will probably make you wish you weren't alive tomorrow morning. But I wanna have fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just will not stop. I wish I had a watch. This is probably some kind of world record for hooting, hollering and carrying on at my expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!\" one of them just said between fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain? Who is he talking to or about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain! When did you...ha ha ha ha...get so...ha ha ha...hoity toity...ha ha ha...hoity...ha ha ha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man spit it out. I know you can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoity toity...ha ha ha...what does even that mean anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you guys are enjoying yourselves but I'll never understand what your trying to say unless you finish a sentence.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your captain?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop mockin us, sir. You're are bleedin captain you are.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The way I did this was I kept sneaking toward the back of everyone until night time fell upon the place.  This place and the people here are so odd I'm surprised this place or alternate reality even has day and night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of the sudden, I realize that it's dark and wonder how I'm going to see after I move too far away from the odd people.  I look up into the sky and notice that it's a full moon.  This light will help me get around fine and will have to do for now.  Now, my stomach's growling wildly!  Good thing I have my little pocket tool knife with me!  I'm going to use it to carve a long wooden sphere to catch fish on.  I seen this on a t.v. show, I think it was on National Geographic.  Good thing I seen this, I'm sure I'm going to get tired of just eating coconuts!  I wonder how I'm going to even be able to get the coconuts down anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got to try, I'm starving now!  And, I'm thirsty!\"  said the man who went through the blue door wondering when he's going to get to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man remembered watching how to get coconuts down from the tree.  He applied those techniques perfectly.  He got at least two down.  The t.v. show also taught him how to open the coconut, he also used the technique that he saw on the show and after several tries, he wanted to give up but kept at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is tough!  My goodness!  I'll keep trying!\"  the man said while his stomach was giving him hunger pains now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now he banged the coconut with all of his might on the large rock he found.  The coconut busted open with a loud sound.  He knew that it would eventually give way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness this finally busted open!  Now I'll use my pocket knife to cut it out with.  Forget the other one, I'm sure eating one will be good enough.\"  said the man greedily carving out chunks of coconut and nearly swallowing them whole due to his extreme hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the man was finally done eating the last of the coconut he ate.  He went to look for a long stick to carve a wooden stick to sphere fish on.  He found one after he looked around for a short while.  It was near the outside of the grove of coconut trees.  He spent hardly any time carving a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to have to sleep here, but I should get a little rest.  No, I'm going to remain awake, anything could try getting me on this island, let alone natives.  I don't want them to kill or eat me!\"  said the man concerned about his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man finally got up and left his sphere near the coconut near the large rock he hit the coconut on.  He decided to wander around the island looking for the blue door.  He spent a long time looking for it.  He suddenly came across another door but it wasn't the blue one.  He was disappointed to see it.  It wAsas a yellow one.  Exhausted and tired with only a coconut in his stomach, he decided to take the yellow one, but refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that I'm not taking this one.  I'm going to look for the other doors,\"  said the man unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the man continued his search, he found the blue door, brown and red one.  He was confused on what to do.  He knew he had to choose one though and will choose one in a moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had sparkling white stars all over the place which I thought was odd.  I wonder if there was a source it was originally coming from?  I stood in place looking all around myself to try to find out about this further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where or what might be causing all of these little white stars?  I've never seen anything like this before.  But, before I start looking, I'm going to see if I can find a little something to eat,\"  said Charles while beginning to look around for a kind of berry to eat.  To his surprise, he came across a blueberry bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?  Blueberries!

He wonders what this is.  He stops eating the blueberries and goes to investigate this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  What is this?  I've never seen anything like it,\"  said Charles in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.  I am the forest deva of this forest.  I'm here to tell you about the doors you must choose.  I need you to go through the yellow one next, then blue, then brown and finally red.  Those doors are fine, but you will be in danger with the red one.  You must be careful in that one or you could die,\"  warned the white star deva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.  Do you know where the yellow door is?  This forest seems to go on forever,\"  said Charles looking a bit overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's right over there.  Go to it now.  The sooner you go through the doors and find each door the sooner you can go home,\"  said the white star deva while disappearing into a whole bunch of seperated white stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charles heads to the yellow door.

The blue one's suppose to be next.  I wonder where that door is?\"  asked Charles curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Jonni.  Who are you?\"  said Jonni a litte boy about the age of 9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Charles.  It's nice to meet you,\"  said Charles wondering where Jonni's parents are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're wondering where my parents are.  I'm also stuck here like you are.  I live in your neighborhood.  I've seen you cutting your grass while you've been home a few times while I was outside in the front yard playing with my friends.  I'm happy that I'm here, I've made a sandcastle and found a quarter,\"  said Jonni happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's nice here and I'm happy for you.  Listen Jonni.  We both need to look for the blue door.  That's where I was told to go next,\"  said Charles hoping that Jonni will listen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I understand.  But who told you this?\"  asked Jonni curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A white star forest deva.  Very interesting he was too.  Did you see anything interesting while you've been here Jonni?\"  asked Charles curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.  Just that I found a quarter,\"  said Jonni showing Charles the quarter and smiling proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should leave that here so your parents don't wonder where that quarter came from,\"  said Charles hoping Jonni will listen and understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Charles, I will.

They must have searched for a while because it was starting to get dark.  They were hungry.  Charles carved a long stick out of a tree branch near by from a forest and made a sphere out of it from what he learned on National Geographic.  He then built a fire and they had a large fish for their supper.  When they were done they continued searching for the blue door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep looking Jonni.  I know it's exhausting but we have to find it.  At least we had something to eat for supper now,\"  said Charles happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was good!  Thanks Charles!\"  said Jonni merrily back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of the sudden, after they reached being on top of a slight sand mound, a glowing blue door appeared.

After we enter into it, I was told we have to be careful there!\"  said Charles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with you on that!  Let's go now!\"  said Jonni while scurrying around with Charles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of all things, Charles found a ring with a giant diamond on it.  He put it into his pocket.  Now he at least found something good that came out of this door!  They kept searching and searching and noticed that they were both getting really dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try going over that mound over there.  I bet the door's behind it,\"  said Charles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so gross!\"  said Jonni frowning to Charles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but we have to find that door!\"  said Charles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After they reached the top of the mound they thought that the door would be behind, they came up empty.  They were very disappointed!  Dirty and tired they wanted to give up but they didn't.  Charles found another mound and after they reached the top, they found the red door and quickly went through it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had no idea where they were.  Little did they know, it was really a volcano...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where we are Charles?\"  asked Jonni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea Jonni!  I wonder what we're suppose to do!  What door are we suppose to take next?!  I wasn't told this!  I'm sorry Jonni!  Perhaps it's the green one we started out taking.  I guess we'll look for it and it will lead us back home,\"  said Charles worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, a rumbling sound could be heard.  Jonni and Charles feet were shaking, and they were wondering what was causing this.  Charles wondered if this was what the white forest star deva warned them about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  I think we're on a volcano!  We have to find the green door and get off of here as soon as possible!\"  said Charles frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!  Not a volcano!  Ah!\"  said Jonni scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jonni and Charles ran down the hill as fast as they could.  The volcano then erupted.  The lava kept getting closer and closer to them.  Charles told Jonni to keep running and to never look back behind him.  Unfortunately, Charles was caught by the lava and Jonni lived.  Jonni found the green door at the bottom of the volcano and jumped into it right before the volcano got him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ The End! ~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
