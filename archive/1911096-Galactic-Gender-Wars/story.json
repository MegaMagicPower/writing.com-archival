Those who lived on enormous gas giants had to be grown to miles in stature in order to be able to withstand the enormous gravity of these plants; while those who colonized tiny asteroids had to be altered to microscopic proportions in order to eke out an existence on such a small rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some unknown reason, a rift has also occurred between the genders. With cloning now the sole method of procreation, males and females decided they no longer needed each other and fought a bitter war on many of the planets in the universe. On some planets, the males prevailed, while on other worlds it was the female gender. The vanquished gender was then ethnically cleansed or enslaved by the dominant gender. Over time the conflict began to spread out into space, as each gender sought to conquer the entire universe for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe universe is a vast battlefield full of numberless individuals from each gender. Where shall our story begin? Keep in mind the mass of the planet also determines the size of its inhabitants. This is just a starting point.</span></div></div>",

Overall, the climate of Aphroditia II is almost identical to that of Earth's Mediterranean region during the summer. Here, women rule, but males are tolerated-a very rare event in the galaxy. (Cloning is still used here, men are mainly used for sexual satisfaction) Generally, women grow to around 7 feet tall, but 8, 9, or even 10-foot tall women are possible. The typical woman here has a large set of breasts, typically H or I, a large butt to match, and is strong enough to lift an Earth rhino. Males, on the other hand, have shrunk: the average man is only around 3 feet in height, but penis sizes average out to be almost 12 inches. Given the warm climate, people almost never wear clothes.<br>\r\nAphroditia II's geography is one of many small inland seas fed by rivers, with hilly ridges, open plains, and large forests being the main types of terrain. Settlements are scattered throughout the planet, but they are the exception, rather than the norm: the typical Aphroditian lives either alone or with one or two close friends, usually with one male shared among them for sexual needs. Of the two, living alone is usually the path taken by most Aphroditians, in small houses built out of wood from felled trees.<br>\r\nThe plant animal life on Aphroditia II are also strange: it's all from Earth. This planet was terraformed several centuries ago to simulate the Mediterranean islands, and flora and fauna from this area was used to populate the planet, including recently extinct species. As a result, dwarf elephants, wild boar, fallow deer, pygmy hippos, red foxes, and so forth fill in the animal portion of the planet, while oak, olive, cedar, pine trees, etc. fill in the plant portion.<br>\r\nMales are treated reasonably well, and mistreating one is frowned upon, but men are still considered inferior. Most men rarely leave their mate's bedroom, often doing small chores around the house, such as washing dishes, cooking food, and cleaning the house.<br>\r\nAll in all, though, Aphroditia II is quite a nice place. But is it what you want?</span></div></div>",

The crushing mass of these behemoths is so powerful that those hardy individuals who choose to call these worlds home have been forced to enlarge themselves to extremely massive proportions.

Sadly, a Brown Dwarfian male or female will occasionally amuse themselves by conquering, toying with, or outright destroying an Earth world (or smaller), though these events are somewhat rare. They do, however, find Gas Giant worlds as attractive prey, and thus the epic battles between them and the Gas Giantians are legendary throughout the universe.</span></div></div>",

The shafts of light hung in the air, and the advancing day slowly brought them to the foot of a bed, and began to trace them up the body of Princess Aquaelie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inching light that started at her feet took a half hour to reach finally illuminate her face; slowly brightening the lithe, supple features of a young woman engineered over a million years to be the epitome of grace. The light sparkled from her pale skin in silvery whorls of intricate body markings, made up not of metallic ink by the protruding towers, tunnels and landing pads of an entire civilization. As the Queen's youngest daughter, no expense could be spared in Aquaelie's defense, inside or out, and colonists from Aphroditia II had been convinced to settle within her body, supplanting its natural functions with an industry and defense tens of billions of women strong. If the infrastructure needed to mark her skin were cities and foundries on awe-inspiring scale, to Aquaelie, as she stirred in the morning light, they were visible only as a slight metallic accent all along her body in pleasing designs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning briefly, she slipped her legs from the bed and got to her feet, stretching out to her full height, her slim, naked form stretching from head to toe just a smidge over ninety-thousand standard miles. As she glanced out the windows at the world-dwarfing crystal spires and gorgeous gardens of her homeworld, the Princess' Violet eyes sparkled with enthusiasm as a smile curled her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came of age today, and would finally be allowed to leave the world of her birth at will. She turned from the window and marched across the room, her velvet hair fanning in an arc about her before settling behind her to the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day she'd anticipated all her life, but she shouldn't rush things.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she exited her room and slipped into the washroom behind it, Aquaelie could already hear the sound of water  pouring into the bath. She loved a nice hot bath in the morning, even if strictly speaking it was a pointless exercise. The people who called her body home were quite capable of running such maintenance, and during the day she knew \"massive\" starships would be casually orbiting any part of her body, intercepting debris before it could dirty her royal form, and scraping it away with military-grade beam weapons if it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo her baths were merely a luxury, one impossible for the unfortunates not of Alpha-Amazonian descent. The crystal-clear bath was over-large even by her standards, and the amount of water needed to fill it could have supplied the oceans of untold worlds. Slipping gracefully into the water, she gave a groan of delight, relaxing back and closing her eyes for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps caught her attention, as she glanced aside to see the slight form of a red-haired, freckled woman. Each lineage of Alpazonians had been developed to accent some aspect of femininity foremost. If the tall, lithe form of Aquaelie accentuated an ultimate grace, then the petite, nigh spritely form of the lower class girl accentuated a demurity expected of her role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in a shimmering blue rube, like all clothing composed of strands of diamond fiber, the girl knelt and placed a tray of wafers and glass of wine at the edge of the bath. Her Princess gave a small nod of acknowledgement, her long fingers picking up one of the little treats to take a dainty bite. Much like bathing, eating was not entirely necessary. The industry that existed within her body powered it by means of fusion plants, tiny contained stars that existed spread throughout her body. Their ability to recycle for her was astounding, and precluded anything so unladylike on Aquaelie's part as excreting waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the treats she so enjoyed were made mostly of metals and sugars; those things needed to keep her population alive and productive. The wine, on the other hand, was pure indulgence, several zetta-gallons of liquid passing through her lips just for the simple pleasure. It was thoughts like this that made her feel good. Some Alphazonians lived their lives as if they were normal, and the universe were small. But Aquaelie took immense satisfaction in knowing her true scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would there be anything else, Mistress?\" The red-headed servant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to regard the woman, the Princess raised an eyebrow, her musical soprano saying...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was a special day indeed, and Aquaelie could forgo a bit of her usual morning luxuries. The first thing that came to mind was to speak to her friend Freya, and discuss just what they would do with her new found freedom. She stepped quickly over to her wardrobe, opening it to sift through her more casual garments. She picked out a short, backless white dress, complemented with a ever-so-light sleeveless purple jacket with waist-length tassels running from it's shoulders. She then slipped on a pair of knee-high, high-heeled boots to match the dress, and elbow-length sequined gloves matching the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully dressed she closed the wardrobe and made her way through the door and into the palace proper, each motion economical, perfectly graceful and poised as befit the proper image of a princess. It was only a short jaunt down the hallways of milky white crystal to Freya's quarters, her long-time bodyguard not permitted to stray too far from her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could well have been the ca-clack of her heels echoing down the hall that roused the other woman, but as she arrived to find Freya already waiting at the door, Aquaelie knew better than to doubt her timing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach lineage of Alphazonia was dedicated to an aspect of Feminity. The ruling house, and Aquaelie, were immaculately designed to be graceful. Their servants, Demure. Freya...embodied endurance, and perseverance, the most important aspects of a proper warrior. The loose-fitting navy blue pants she wore could conceal her legs and hips. Conversely the tight garment of the same color that circled her upper body, baring her midriff, arms and shoulders, left nothing to the imagination, be that the swell of her sizeable breasts or the smooth lines of her developed arms and abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lady,\" she said with a sincere smile, giving a slight bow to Aquaelie before standing to her full height once again to look down at her, deep green eyes sparkling. Generally it would have been unseemly for another line to have the audacity to be taller than a royal, but even by the Alphazonian standards, Freya was an amazon at nearly a hundred and five thousand miles tall. But then no expense was spared, in protection of the Queen's darling youngest daughter, and there was no being in existence, let alone even the largest lowly <i>man,</i> who could contemplate physically challenging Freya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freya,\" Aquaelie responded in proper fashion, giving a slight nod of acknowledgement as her slim form slipped past her towering bodyguard and into her room. As Freya stepped in behind her and closed the door, Aquaelie took a moment to look around, admiring the things she had collected on her trips away. There was a shelf on one wall where rested the disabled hulls of enemy warships, and even a globe on her desk that the princess knew was no mere navigational instrument but yet another spoil of war. The thought that soon <i>she</i> would be the one travelling the stars, taking prizes and conquering worlds, threatened to break her princessly composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what she didn't break herself, Freya was happy to do for her. \"Congratulations, 'Elie!\" The woman said excitedly now that they were out of public view, putting her arms around the princess from behind and lifting her in a brief but heartfelt hug, her snow white hair mingling with the blue-black of her charge's for a moment before she set her back down and stepped away. \"I know how much today means to you...so I've already gotten us cleared to leave whenever. Her Highness recognizes how excited you must be, and said she wouldn't keep you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful!\" 'Elie responded with a broad smile, taking a seat in one of the large, comfortable chairs scattered about Freya's room, \"I mean, it's really hard to believe that I can finally...well, go, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do know. I remember how excited I was...\" Freya chcukled, \"Well, that was only a few years past though,\" she said as she looked around her room pridefully, \"just imagine what sort of things you and I can bring back in another four years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Frey, I just can't wait to get started,\" Aquaelie responded...</span></div></div>",

The gorgeous crystal hallways, lined with works of art and trophies of war, slowly give way to more subdued construction; though still made of the same diamond-like substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrive there are a few of the \"small\" ships belonging the royal family still parked in their respective places, while along one wall a large number of jetpack-looking apparatuses hung in neatly ordered rows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, M'lady.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although almost the entire human race has divided into mutually hostile genders throughout the galaxy, for various reasons there were the occasional exceptions. The vast distances between the stars kept many worlds in isolation, and over the course of millions of years many developed along diverging paths of social and even biological evolution. Not every planet embraced cloning and the schism of the genders. Some continued to practice the ancient methods of sexual reproduction, and on these worlds the male and female genders lived together in peace and harmony, and did their best to maintain neutrality as their sisters and brothers fought against one another in the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch is the tale of Humania Pacifica, a massive Brown Dwarf in orbit of a binary star in a relatively isolated region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Humania Pacifica was among the very first Brown Dwarves colonized by Humanity millions of years ago, back before the great schism occurred and humans had first mastered the massive biological altering required to endure the severe conditions of Brown dwarf worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to their relative isolation, the inhabitants of Humania Pacifica were spared from most of the propaganda by the male and female factions who sought to instigate revolts and lure the planet over to their side. Another factor which worked in their favor was the sheer enormity of the people. At an average height of 65,000 miles tall, each inhabitant in their own right was larger than most planets! Even among Brown Dwarfians, there were very few who even came close to this size, and fewer still who managed to exceed it. Thus far every invasion force sent against them by male or female factions has been easily and decisively crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Humania-Pacificans (or Hum-Pacs for short), take great pride in their neutrality and independence, and view themselves as the protectors of all Mixed-Gender planets throughout the universe. Although the Hum-Pacs tend to be isolationists and generally seldom venture far beyond their star system, they do welcome Mixed-Gender refugees from across the universe, and so the Humania Pacifica star system is home to countless space ships of various origins. The size of these ships varies based on the size of their occupants; some spaceships are as large as planets, while some are as tiny as specks of dust. None however are as large as the ships manned by the Hum-Pacs themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHum-Pac starships are extremely massive and tend to hold a crew of only one or two with almost no exceptions. This is because it may require an entire star system worth of raw materials just to construct such a vessel. This means billions (if not even trillions) of smaller beings must be robbed of their homeworlds just to create a starship for a single Hum-Pac man or woman. In times past Hum-Pac miners routinely stripped star systems clean of all raw materials, and wiped out untold trillions of smaller beings in the process, leaving only lone stars void of all planets within a radius of many parsecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, new laws have been passed which forbid the wanton genocide of smaller civilizations. Nowadays, Hum-Pac mining operations require that the indigenous civilizations be gently removed from the planet and placed in a protected reservation as the planet is harvested and smelted down into usable ores. Afterwards, after the starship is completed, the indigenous civilization is grafted to the livable interior of the starship either as a non-functional part of the decor, or in some cases as functioning crew to help with the maintenance and operation of the starship that was once their homeworld. Some Hum-Pacs have protested this as legalized slavery, but proponents defend the practice as necessary, and certainly more humane than the outright genocide that occurred in ages past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that we have a good deal established about the background of Humania Pacifica, whom will we follow from this point onwards?</span></div></div>",

Over the millions of years since humanity first set off into the stars there have been countless inter-species wars, conquests, and sadly in most cases these ended in slavery and genocide of the less technologically advanced native species. However, from time to time humanity encountered a species they could not conquer, and one such example were the Jevulans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen humans first arrived in the Jevulan system they found numerous planets, including a massive brown dwarf in orbit of a red giant sun. The smaller planets were soon colonized, as humanity had done with similar planets for thousands of years, but the expedition of colonists sent to Jevula Prime vanished without a trace. Although scans had detected no signs of life, it was clear that someone (or something) had killed the colonists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears passed by, and humans living on the other worlds of the Jevula system wrote off the massive Brown Dwarf that dominated the heavens as a cursed world, and no further attempts were made at colonization. This would have been the end of the story, but for the strange reappearance of the massive landing craft that had been used by the disappearing colonists. They had survived after all! Or so it seemed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human inhabitants of Jevula II, a moderate sized world, screamed in terror as the landing craft nearly equal in size to their entire world touched down and flattened an entire hemisphere deep into the mantle of a planet much to small to accommodate a landing craft of this immense size. Millions were instantly killed, and entire cities were wiped out of all existence in the blink of an eye. This sudden near doubling of the planet's mass severely altered the planet's rotation as well as greatly increasing its mass, which had the effect of nearly doubling the gravitational pull of those who were fortunate enough to be on the opposite hemisphere of where the ship had landed. This effect, although not immediately fatal, meant that an individual who normally weighed 200 pounds now weighed 400 pounds, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who survived were horrified by this sudden annihilation of so many people, and couldn't help but wonder why the colonists of Jevula Prime would do such a thing, especially after having disappeared for so many years without a trace. As the doors of the spaceship opened at last, two beings of unimaginably gargantuan proportions stepped out and towered like colossus over what remained of Jevula II.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese gargantuan beings...</span></div></div>",

There are several small cities and towns all over the planet, some above ground, and most are safely underground. A large, powerful matter, anti matter engine is at its core, generating a strong magnetic field all over Eden, and it keeps the miniature world warm in space, regardless of where it is. It generates a strong force field that keeps the atmosphere in, and most invaders out. It also provides power to all of the small world\u2019s cities, the world\u2019s defenses, and even the asteroids small spacecraft that can leave Eden when needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eden orbits a yellow dwarf star similar to that of Earth\u2019s sun Sol, but Eden\u2019s sun is much smaller. Unlike other worlds, this small world can leave, and go elsewhere if it has too, because it has two powerful engines that are located on its two poles. The planet has a thick rocky crust, and all of its water is fresh, not salty. Miniature lush green plants of various types cover most of its surface as well as miniature animals, and humans. The unusually attractive miniature humans of Eden are all around 3 inches, or 7.6 cm tall, depending on their age, and gender. The population of this tiny world is Caucasian, White. They are a religious, conservative culture where both genders share almost equal power, with the males having a slight edge. They still speak English, and they have a weird, constitutional parliamentary form of government. They have a Prime Minster, a Senate, and a Lower House. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They have a police force, and a respectable military. Small defensive satellites orbit, and protect their world too. In addition, various kinds of military space ships, space fighters, tanks, and other types of equipment protect Eden. They even have miniature nova bombs, and small black hole mines, which are powerful enough to destroy an attacking force from even a brown dwarf star. Because of their defensive stance, very few have ever attempted to invade these tiny, but impressive people, and their world Eden is thrived for millions of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, space on this small world is limited, and overpopulation is a problem, so occasionally, so-called volunteers are forced to leave New Eden for an unknown fate. These tiny, undesirable humans are placed in a nice, long-range shuttle-craft, and are sent off to the nearest Earth size world, or asteroid size world that is within range.

Her footsteps rang loudly through the deserted vessel, making it feel eerie and dead despite all the elegantly curved structure of the hallways, with their wooden paneling and indirect lighting, could do. In fact the long-dead designers attempt at cheering the ships interior up simply backfired given what Angela had to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight million years was a long time indeed. Everyone she'd ever known was dead, along with her entire species for all she knew. Well, or so Aea said; it occurred to her she may just need to search the ship for any misplaced passengers herself. In the meantime she had to admit to being extremely curious just what sort of cargo they must have been carrying to be intercepted as they had been. After all, with their near-monopoly on scaler technology, she hadn't thought there was any other species who would attack a human vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew closer to the armored center of the ship, Angela found herself directed to a small vault-like chamber she didn't recall being in the official deckplan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what am I looking at, Aea?\" She asks, raising an eyebrow as she paced around the large tube in the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, have a look,\" Aea said, the holoemitters projecting a tiny, floating woman in circuit-board-patterned uniform who got Angela's attention and directed it to the tube with a little flourish. The armored plating slid away layer by layer, until it revealed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...but why?\" Angela's eyes went wide as she saw the armored stasis tube contained a very familiar blue-green world, the Earth shrunk to the size of a basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well we've always had enemies,\" Aea said with a small shrug, \"It just happens that these ones were...more potent than we figured we could deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sent Angela for a loop, \"We can shrink our homeworld down to this, but can't fight off whatever it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty Fifty,\" Aea said, \"So caution was decided to be the better part of valor. We tried awful hard to keep anybody from finding out on which vessel Earth was being shipped...I guess not hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly,\" The security officer muttered, wondering how many people had even been informed it was to happen before they'd simply been shrunk and locked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look on the bright side, they're safe, right?\" Aea suggested, raising an eyebrow before her hologram flicked back off. \"Either way, I think it's about time you started making some decisions. We are still trapped on a floating wreck, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Angela breathed, calming her nerves, \"Here's what we'll do.\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">20 million years in the future humanity has colonized the entire universe and has genetically modified itself to be able to inhabit every planet, moon, and asteroid as efficiently as possible. Those who lived on enormous gas giants had to be grown to miles in stature in order to be able to withstand the enormous gravity of these plants; while those who colonized tiny asteroids had to be altered to microscopic proportions in order to eke out an existence on such a small rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some unknown reason, a rift has also occurred between the genders. With cloning now the sole method of procreation, males and females decided they no longer needed each other and fought a bitter war on many of the planets in the universe. On some planets, the males prevailed, while on other worlds it was the female gender. The vanquished gender was then ethnically cleansed or enslaved by the dominant gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time the conflict began to spread out into space, as each gender sought to conquer the entire universe for itself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as far as rules and such as concerned, I am going to keep that to a bare minimum and have only 2 rules, but these two rules are extremely important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule 1: Do not hijack someone's chapter and take it in a wildly different direction than intended. I cannot stress this enough. If someone is building up to something, do not make an abrupt change. This has happened to me many times in many interactives and it pisses me off. This is why I have to have my own interactive so I can control and get things back on track. If you want to steer a storyline off into another direction do so gradually, and keep options in place so that the previous author can continue on in their intended direction. This way everyone wins. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you make a chapter and someone hijacks it and steers it off course in a direction you don't like, send me a message and I will edit as necessary. I will try to avoid deleting anything unless there is no other choice.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule 2: Additions must be of a somewhat reasonable level of quality. I don't demand total precision, but I do expect to see the chapters be of a reasonable length and detail and with an acceptable level of grammar. If you can't write at least at a 6th grade level then please don't bother contributing at all. It is better to have no additions at all than worthless ones. Again, I will make edits if I see fit, but I will try to avoid deleting chapters unless they are completely without any merit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo basically that's it. There's just those two rules. Other than that anything goes. If you want to add something controversial like gay stuff, toilet stuff, incest, or whatever go right ahead. I may not like it personally, but I have no problem allowing it as long as the above rules are followed. I support free speech so I will allow anything, but remember to keep choices in place for others to do their thing as well.</td>",
