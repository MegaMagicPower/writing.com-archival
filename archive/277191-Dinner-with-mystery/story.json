My head ached as though I had been drinking. I struggled slightly to remember if I had indeed gone to a bar the night before, but nothing came to mind. Except a faint strain of music that played through my mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head and tried to clear it. Ah! The dream! What a dream... I smiled. \"Wonder what I ate that-\" I pulled back the door to my closet and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful long black dress I had bought not long ago. I wasn't much for dressing up. It was simply elegant. But it wasn't the dress that made my hand shake. It was the note, pinned to the waist of the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door to your soul lies behind thick walls of stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I slipped into a shirt and a pair of jeans and padded down the stairs. He would be at breakfast already. I could scold him then for coming home without telling me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny!\" I yelled, flying down the stairs. \"Danny!\" There was no reply. But the house our parents left us is large... he had to be somewhere. Maybe he was unloading his luggage from that ancient old truck of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny!\" I shouted, a smile on my face as I threw open the door. My smile faded. Danny's truck wasn't there. I ran around the house into the garage. No truck. Danny *wasn't* home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped and felt a chill run up my back. Danny is the only one who had a key to the house, besides me. I felt as though somebody was watching me. I turned and ran into the house, my heart pounding. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw the phone and lunged for it, as though it might dissapear. I snatched up the phone and tried to control my shaking hands. Who to call?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa... something whispered. Call Lisa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair on the back of my neck raised, but I dialed the number. It rang once. Silence. It rang twice. The phone suddenly picked up on the other end, and there was a frantic scrambling as though it had been dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" a voice nearly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike? Where's Lisa?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dead sobbing on the other end. I became alarmed. \"Mike! Mike!\" I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's- she's-\" He broke down crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Lisa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's dead!\" he wailed.</span></div></div>",

But what a cryptic message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set the card down and crossed my arms. Now what? I felt goosebumps raise up on my arms and back. The phone, as if in response, suddenly rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped, then felt a little foolish. What was I? A child to be frightened of ghosts and bogles? I smiled and shook my head, reaching for the phone. A little dream. That's all it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cleared my throat, trying to sound awake. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a muffled sob on the other end, then a masculine choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Chills passed over my entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Lisa,\" the voice sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly relaxed. \"Mike! Mike, what's wrong?\" Mike had been married to Lisa, my best friend, for five years. I hadn't heard from Lisa for a few days. What had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa- she's-\" Mike choked, unable to finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike! Spit it out! Did Lisa get in an accident? Is she sick? In the hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's- dead.\"</span></div></div>",

The only information  you recieved is from a silver letter saying \"Dinner with mysteries\" and a note \"someone will pick you up at eight\". Reading it again, you feel your blood moving through your body faster and faster. The attraction it has on your discovering soul is far more bigger than the sense of realism. You pick your long black evening dress and wear the best pearls around your sweet velvet neck. The doorbell rings as you open the door an old grey man stands in front of you, no word is said, you just follow him into the back of an old English car. As you cross through new landscapes the car stops in front of a big entrance with the sentence, \"The door to your soul lais behind thick walls of stone\". Suddenly a black silk robe is pulled around your eyes, covering the sprinkling stars that give you that innocent look. The car moves on and suddenly you hear sweet music, you wonder where it is comming from but soon you realize it is the alarmclock waking you up, leaving you awake with a thousand question, and many more hopes. But not long from now, the night will cover the sunfilled land and hopefully the car will drive again.\r<br>\nAnd there te story starts\r<br>\n</td>",
