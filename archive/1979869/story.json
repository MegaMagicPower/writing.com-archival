The two V's in the name jutted out the top of the sign with an animated neon picture of a set of jaws engulfing a 50's classic roadster designed in the googie style of architecture that pervaded the entire lot. It really was a relic, still maintaining it's celluloid film reel projector and speaker stands for individual vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concession booth was there mostly to pacify its human customers with overpriced popcorn and snacks of processed meats with questionable consistencies. It was attended at the moment by a twitchy crocotta whose teeth were always bared and fur that was a greasy disaster that put the food selection to shame and his human co worker who was constantly shifting his eyes to the other nervously. If he was lucky, the crocotta would be turned off by his horrible case of acne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll other food items were to be found in the parking lot...for the monsters. The privacy of watching a movie from a within a vehicle as well as the freedom to choose from a broad selection of couples for a monster couple to share. Drive-ins were meant to be romantic, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuxtaposed to the setting was the film itself; an accomplishment in cinematography featuring a story chock-full of charismatic lead monsters, gratuitous sex, ultraviolence, and human consumption. Box office gold. Thus the collection of viewers filled the spots to the maximum. Bikes, sports cars, military vehicles, and even classics that complimented the aged look of theater were parked in parallel as the screen blazed with the first major battle of the flick.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking between the parked cars moved a human dressed entirely in black except for the twinkling pieces of metal riveted into the leather of his outfit. His face was clean shaven and the black, shaggy hair atop his head swept back to accommodate his use of a helmet. The aroma surrounding him was strong with cologne, cigarettes, and alcohol despite being just shy of the human drinking age. As he passed by a group of bikers much like him, only they consisted primarily of hyena-like gnolls, he was eyed hungrily by a few before their sensitive noses crinkled at the artificial and offensive musk and turned their attention back to the sole human member in their group, a younger boy already tethered to the pack leader's bike with a leash and donned in their PVC bondage gear complete with a ball gag, shutting up his feeble pleas. The bland expression on his tan face coupled with his rather troublesome wear and distasteful smell the only thing keeping him from being another potential member of this gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on his way, he stopped before the concession stand and ordered a large popcorn. The crocotta rang it up, not even taking his eyes off his human coworker who was nervously fumbling around trying to refill the popcorn machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there, Brett,\" came a sultry voice from behind him. The human turned to see another human, a female, lean up against the counter beside him. First thing that was apparent was her stature. Brett was not short at six feet, one-hundred-eighty pounds, but she was tall, towering half a head above him and if the powerful legs that filled out her tight pants were any indication to her upper body wrapped in that red and white, armored jacket, she had the power of a steam driven hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Nicole,\" replied Brett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The drop's on your cruiser; do you have the envelope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett paused a moment to pull a yellow envelope from his jacket. \"Right here,\" he said, handing it to her when he noticed the human server staring at the exchange stupidly with a bag of popcorn held in his hands. Nicole held the envelope, but he held on too for a moment. \"What are you looking at?,\" he snapped, causing the server to jump. Brett snatched the popcorn bag with his free hand. \"Get lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you shouldn't draw this much attention to yourself. It doesn't help that you dress like this,\" Nicole said acerbically, tugging at the hem of his collar for emphasis. Clad entirely in leather outerwear, Brett was only a few garments short of looking like a BDSM enthusiast, but despite the attention that they attracted, the studs adorning his leather actually carried a practical value. He just shrugged, not bothering to explain the nuance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not get excited,\" he said, leaning back onto the counter flicking a single kernel into his mouth, grimacing as the oil left a slick coating on the inside of his mouth. \"I doubt that I look any more appetizing than the guy those hyenas have tied up. You on the other hand...\" Brett gave her a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point,\" she growled, dropping her voice to a whisper, \"I'll be in the clear after this, but what about you? Magic users are scanning the streets tighter and tighter. They know the tough-guy act when they see it. What if you are caught with that package?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what these are for,\" Brett tapped one of the many steel studs on his jacket. Nicole blinked for second, making Brett chuckle at her confusion. \"And by the way, wasn't a weapon supposed to come with that box?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that weapon is the one I'm carrying right now,\" She crossed her arms, \"and I don't feel like going anywhere unarmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett gave her a glare. \"And you think I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled wryly and patted her left side, where she kept her weapon. \"You get to carry this boy until you make the drop. Once the drop is made, there should be compensation for your weapon.\" Her eyes suddenly shifted to the side and the smile was lost. \"Heads up,\" she nudged her elbow into Brett's side, \"we've got a Black and White prowling around. We better finish this and split soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, Brett followed her gaze and saw a police bike riding past the ticket booth. Both riders remained relaxed, Brett still reluctantly chowing on the popcorn, nonchalantly. The officer got quite close, dismounting just a few yards from them. A pair of raised ports for ears could be seen atop the helmet as well as a muzzle protruding from its open face, and a bushy, black tail with white stripes swaying behind the figure stood out against dark of night and the officer's black uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Brett got a good look he \"Now that really is a Black and White. Do you think she plays both the good cop and bad cop?\" He could see that it was indeed a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole jabbed him hard in the ribs, but he barely flinched. His remark was not picked up by skunk's sensitive ears, luckily for Brett, because her belt was fully equipped to dish out maximum pain. She removed her helmet, freeing her ears to perk atop her head and her tied back hair to fall free. Her stone cold eyes in the darkness regarded the two bikers for a second before dismissing them, striding forward with confidence. Despite the quiet air of authority she gave off, Brett couldn't help but catch a glimpse of the toned posterior of an athlete as she passed by, tail swishing to and fro making the view all the more hypnotic. He wondered what else could that bullet proof vest be hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole cleared her throat, bringing his eyes back up. \"How about we get back to business and exchange our pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Brett agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me,\" Nicole led the way. Her sportsbike was near the center of the lot which required some weaving away from cars with monsters laying on the hoods. Once there, she pulled Brett down to sit with her and lean back on her parked bike.  Side by side, they continued to feign watching the unfolding scene where the hero finally kisses his love interest for the first time. \"Where's your piece?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your arm around me and open your jacket.\" Brett knew what this was about, so he complied, putting his right arm about her shoulders and opening his jacket to the first belt. \"Just let me handle this.\" She pulled a revolver out of her jacket, hiding it from prying between her thighs. She ejected the barrel to show it wasn't loaded before flipping it back and in a quick motion slipped it into Brett's jacket. Nicole leaned her head on Brett's shoulder as she skillfully pulled his gun from its holster while replacing it with her own, the entire act looking like a couple getting intimate. She inspected Brett's 10mm Auto, racking the slide to see that it too was unloaded before slipping in into her jacket and zipping back up, Brett doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember our first exchange?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you pulled your gun on me and I drew my knife?\" Brett chuckled, eating another handful of popcorn, choking it down for no reason. \"Yeah, you could have blown my brains out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we've always been on two sides of mutual interests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound worried,\" said Brett, \"but you're getting out, so no problem. What's your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett looked at Nicole as she sat staring at the movie in silence before she said, \"It's nothing I'm sure, just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In our line of work, they say that's something you can't afford to do,\" Brett replied. He pulled two loaded mags to his pistol from his belt. \"Take these, I'm getting out of here.\" Nicole offered him an ammo cylinder before taking them. Brett took it without a word, got up and left. The movie was atrocious and he had places to be. Once again he passed the gnolls, all of them enjoying the movie while their prisoner struggled futilely with his restraints off to the side.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brett's cruiser was a sleek design with the handlebars and console set low, the seat a little higher than normal, and the underside lifted higher and more narrow with the forward foot pegs lifted to grant more road clearance. It also had optional rear foot pegs behind the seat and an electric clutch, all indicators of a performance vehicle. Chromed instruments of power were held under the black body, the water-cooled V-Twin not boasting the greatest of speed, though for its division, it delivered the greatest balance any one could ask. Built for long hours on the road, yet capable of incredible power when pushed to the brink of its boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett took his place on the seat, ignited the engine, kicked up the stand and eased away. He might have been dressed like it, but he was not one to cause a scene. The mufflers were quiet and did not disrupt the other moviegoers as he circled the lot to the exit. He flipped his light on once he was facing the boundaries of the lighted screen, and just in time to spot the crocotta finally making a move on his human coworker, bursting from the stand like greasy furball in hot pursuit of the frantically fleeing teen. Poor bastard, Brett thought as the two disappeared between the cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was just about gone, only leaving the dimmest glow in the west corner of the black sky. In the opposite direction a full moon was rising to cast silver rays across the cold plains of the desert at night. And Brett had the pleasure of riding all the way through the sight. He stopped halfway down the dirt road he was on that lead to the highway, remembering out of habit to don his studded halfshell helmet, though he supposed he could have gotten away with it tonight if he just wore the goggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a cracking noise came from the lot. Brett turned sharply in surprise. Those weren't firecrackers. Two shots rapid, followed by a staccato exchange of a firefight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEngines roared behind the high fence, followed by the crunch and screeching of metal being destroyed. It sounded like a getaway was happening. A sports car barreled from entrance, fishtailing and wheels spinning out underneath, spewing dirt and debris behind it. Headlights blazed across Brett as he was suddenly put in the path of a rapidly accelerating death machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe throttled hard, kicking up rocks and dust from the dirt road as well, not caring whether they hit the moron's windshield. He just had to get out of the way of the lunatic driver. The highway was set before him--two directions, no time for choices.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Near the back in what was possibly the sweetest spot to park, the best view, stood an orange sports car with two parallel black stripes running down the center of its length. The design was a classic by only a few decades, a coupe with sharp angles instead of sleek curves along its body, looking much like a knife ready to cut with an undoubtedly powerful engine under the hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wielder of this vehicle was very fitting. Sitting in the front seat was a werewolf, smiling toothily as the blood began to spurt from the bodies on screen. He was in his wolf form, humanoid with a canine skull and dull grey fur covering his body ears to neck and all four paws, only a sliver of white ran down from his forehead, between his golden eyes and ended halfway across his muzzle. The rest of his fur-covered body was concealed by clothing, an expensive black sports jacket over a white t-shirt and designer three-quarter jeans complimented by a belt sporting a shining buckle. He was truly dashing on first sight to any of his kind and anyone of the canine persuasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a moment wonder whether the humans being neatly chopped in half  by the lead female's swords were really only special effects. The moves of the villain's genetically enhanced superhumans were impressive, those were definitely fake, but this gorefest had to be real. He chuckled at the comic mewling of a crony who was just disemboweled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Steelie, let's get something to eat,\" his date said from the passenger seat. She was another werewolf with rust colored fur and icy blue eyes. Like many werewolves, she opted to dress less and had no shirt to cover her furred breasts, though for some reason she had on a pair of black cut-offs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, Bitch,\" he replied, throwing her a smirk. \"We've just gotten to a good part. And don't call me 'Steelie', it's Steele.\" His eyes went back to the battle. The werewolf named Steele was much too busy shoveling vast amounts of popcorn into his maw as he watched with intent to bother dragging a pair of squirming humans to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't stand this stuff,\" his date shook her bag of popcorn, eying it with disgust. \"And if you like this scene, I'm surprised you're not hungry for some human too.\" She didn't really like the scene and the senselessness of it all, and while she preferred her humans whole, it did kind of remind her of her mother's home cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteele leaned his seat back, stretching his arms and legs out and revealing his frame to be on the short side for a werewolf at just inches shy of eight feet, though it still boasted the naturally thick and powerful muscles of his species, if not more powerful. Another thing his position revealed was the growing bulge in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're so impatient,\" Steele chuckled, \"then I've got something you can snack on, right here.\"</span></div></div>",
