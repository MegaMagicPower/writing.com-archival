You slide the disk in your Xbox One and grab your Xbox controller and select the menu. You waited until the title screen loaded and then you press start to begin playing. However, instead of playing, your TV screen flashed white. The flash grew brighter and brighter until you suddenly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be a long time, you slowly wake up to a large room with what looks to be wood structure interior. \"Ugh, where am I?\" You asks your self as you look at the large room your in. \"What is this place and how did I get so small?\" You ask yourself, but your thoughts get interrupted as you hear the sound of giant earthquakes. You turn around and you see a familiar look orange, two-tailed fox. \"Is that Tails?\" You again ask yourself as Tails...</span></div></div>",

Or maybe you became... fictional? Is that how this works? Whatever the case, you were able to move as the giant fox walked closer to you, each step causing a small tremor. Your mind didn\u2019t even register moving, getting his attention, or even getting out of his way until he was right over you. And by then it was too late... or it would have been if he didn\u2019t suddenly stop right before you. Looking up you noticed his eyes focused on you curiously. You guess it was pretty obvious by your form, stance, and limited movements that you weren\u2019t a doll. You soon felt his white-gloved hand gently wrapping around you as you were lifted up to his face for a closer inspection. You nervously waved and tried to say hi, but you were so quiet and nervous that you doubted he heard you. Finally he seemingly finished his inspection and smiled at you.

And to your utter surprise that the inhabitants are two rabbit-woman monsters and one blue cupid thingie. From what gathered from eating bread crumbs and bits of whatever random fruit you have to find in your scavenging and exploring, the two weird rabbits both appear to form a typical familial unit, with the bigger more mature creature acting as a parent and the smaller one was the child. With the weird angel thing as a household pet like a dog or cat in your world. Life for you includes staying out of sight and eating the scraps of their foods when they aren't looking. The whole ordeal has been frankly dehumanizing and stressful, making you feel like some filthy rat. Your clothes reduced to mere tatters. Hair grew long and messy. You can't help but feel a certain level of contempt for these beings as they go through their everyday life as normal while you eat their table scraps like some diseased vermin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with that contempt, alongside curiosity and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel a sense of general sense of awe at the sight. Which only did wonders for repressed sexual desires you gained. You couldn't release it due to fending for yourself. You were simply going mad as your baser urges keep you up hours into the night. The occasional sight of the older rabbit in a surprisingly revealing red-colored silk night grown made your head nearly burst. This is just only the tip of the iceberg of your extended stay in this hell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until now..\" You mutter to yourself and sourly scowled as you made your way toward the living room's floor, going far from the little hole in the wall that you have been calling home for the past weeks. The itch in gotten so bad that you <i>have</i> to relieve your self. There you spot the smaller one laying on the floor, absentmindedly reading a book. With her human-shaped feet facing your general direction. You always had a rather healthy foot fetish, so the sight of her feet was like water in the desert. Your hungry eyes feasted on them. Just like the rabbits from your world, they were <i>large</i> to the point where they were fairly disproportionate in comparison to the rest of the creature's body. They had the typical elongated length associated with lagomorphs but had a definite plumpiness that added girth to her feet. Thus having a certain wideness that was just made your knees quivers in utter anticipation, But like an human's, their feet lacked pads and soles. Your cock was harder than it ever been in your life as her flat chubby bulbous toes wiggled and flexed, causing small wrinkles to form on the dusty wide and expansive soles. Quietly revealing her more claw-like nails that are messily painted in bright orange.  The sight of it all made your pale skin damp with sweat, arousal and urges override your line of thought as you approach the bunny like a hungry wolf...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut happens next?</span></div></div>",

Causing you to stare at her massive form, at this distance this was the absolute closest you ever ventured towards these beings. The gentle rays beaming through the nearby windows made her soft orange hair shine brightly-making seem almost golden. Her face wrinkled as her mouth opened-letting out a soft yawn and revealing her upper buck teeth. Her right hand tenderly rubbing her tummy as a faint breeze caused her skirt blown upward. Revealing her unmentionables, simple white panties. The sight made the crotch of your makeshift shorts to noticeably tight, causing your body to be wrack with shock with primal desire and arousal. But yet, despite your underworked cock starting to grow as your blood filled it's veins your old sense of morality and decency starts to trickle back in your deprived psyche, Shame, and guilt over the fact you about take full advantage of someone a while ago. Even now, your cock wants, no <i>begging</i> to you to debase her body with semen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Exactly like a <b>dirty</b> vermin'</i> With a small shake of your head, you let out a long stuttering sigh. You may have your gripes about these giants...but you weren't a monster. But the thoughts couldn't dwell as loud *<u><b><i>Tawoosh</i></b></u>* sounds filled the air. Causing you to see the giant rabbit!  The doughy toes scrunch while the muscles in her large feet visibly bend and flex as the colossus began to go on the move!  Your blue eyes trailed her from her slim legs stare at her orange auburn orbs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking you realize...that she was looking directly at you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have been found out!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith knees now filled jelly, you tried to run back to the safety of the hole in the wall...the keyword here, however, is  <i>tried</i>. You didn't even manage to get in twenty steps as her hand enveloped your entire form in her soft furred fingers. The soft almost cotton-like quality of the fur combined with the soft perfume of honey and jasmine did little to soothe the now growing sense of dread festering in your gut. Light flooded back as you were staring face to face with the titan. Her nose twitch and wrinkled, undoubtedly getting used to your scent. Her soft eyes held not a smidge of malice-if anything they were pleasant and warm, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Mister. What is your name?\" The youth asked a very simple question with the most friendly voice you have ever heard from. But you could only look around her palm with your darting eyes. Too scared to say anything, let alone do anything. This cause the rabbit's smile rapidly curve into a worried frown. The sight of your state only made her heartache, so dirty and wearing tattered rags for clothing. All of this just made her mind up on one thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She'll help you no matter what!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

While this might not would impressive at first that small cottage can be a nightmare when you\u2019re shrunk to a size somewhere between a mouse and a doll. The house had two inhabitants, a woman and her young daughter. As if living in a house of giants wasn\u2019t crazy enough, both of these women were anthropomorphic rabbits. Yeah you\u2019re still getting used to that one. The child seems friendly enough, but you still avoided her, not exactly too keen on being kept as a pet or plaything by her. As for the mother, you did consider getting her attention before, but she was so utterly massive and imposing that simply being in the same room as that colossus immediately replaced such thoughts with a flight response and you would find yourself hiding instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past few weeks you lived off any food you could snatch for yourself, which wasn\u2019t easy. These rabbits were really clean and didn\u2019t leave any messes uncleaned for long. What little you could get did not forbids much sustenance and you gradually got weaker. This brings us to today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sneaking through the living room as the older of the two was sitting on a couch reading a book and eating some cake, you figured enough crumbs were bound to fall to keep you going but at one point a large chunk of cake fell off the rabbit woman\u2019s fork and onto the floor below. Normally you\u2019d know better than to go for this, but you were so hungry now that you didn\u2019t give it any thought, you ran for the large chunk of food like it was mana from the heavens. Unsurprisingly as you were digging in, you heard a loud gasp up above. Looking up you saw the titanic rabbit looking down at you. You tried to grab some food and run but the rabbit was much faster and grabbed you between two fingers lifting you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive set of eyes examined your fearful form closely, trying to make sense of what you were. You were terrified that she would consider you vermin and kill you, or maybe toss you outside where a bird or something would eat you. But instead she smiled and lifted another piece of cake up to you. \u201cPoor thing. You must be starving.\u201d Her sudden kindness caught you off guard. But it didn\u2019t take you long to grab and eat the sweet that was as big as your head. Your stomach finally felt full for the first time since you got into this mess and a large finger started petting you. \u201cBetter\u201d her voice echoed above. It was so soft and calming and motherly that is managed to dispel all fears. You nodded and thanked her. With that she cleaned up what was left and looked back at you</span></div></div>",

It was the first time in a long while that you've been looked at by anyone at all, much less with such an...enrapturing gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...it's okay. You can relax now,\" she hummed warmly, loosening her fingers' hold on you and letting your form splay out in her gloved hand. The pleasant feeling of her natural body heat warmed your back, while the rest of you was exposed to the chill of the ambient air. Something about the look in her eyes both soothed you and made you feel nervous, this time in a different way. Just moments before, you were dreading that this was the end of your life. Now, you were left to wonder what she had in store for you, equal parts tense and enthralled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the stillness, she lifted her other hand and pressed a thumb gently into your front. Soon, she began ever-so-slowly rubbing your body, inadvertently(?) feeling up your chest in the process. The lack of human contact you've had has made any slight touch feel intense, so when she started stroking you so softly, you couldn't help but instantly melt into her embrace. You even hugged the digit, nuzzling your face into its covered pad. A lilting giggle rang like music in your ears; obviously, you weren't the only one enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth of her clothed finger calmed you further, replacing the frigid air with pleasant heat. The eyes that intently stared at your tired figure went from entranced to concerned. Vanilla had noticed just how bad of shape you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're so cold, dearie. Let me help with that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your vantage, you'd gotten hints of her breath before. Nothing, however, could have prepared you for the sight of her plush pink lips puckering up, ready to blow sweet relief onto your frigid body. You blushed furiously; most of the time, when you see someone making this kind of face, they're usually gonna do a <i>lot</i> more than just breath on you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embarrassment you felt was instantly overwhelmed by the soothing wave of breath that wafted over your form. It was warm, enticingly so, and a strong, yet pleasant scent of vanilla was all you could smell as her exhalation overtook every last iota of fresh air you could get. You blissfully shudder, taking in the wonderful sensation of Vanilla's breath blowing towards you. In tandem with the relaxing breeze, a little shock of arousal surged through you as your bare member was pinned against your waist--not by a teasing finger, but by the natural gust that came through the rabbit mother's dainty lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took note of your quivering, and saw the ecstatic smile on your face. Your 'excitement' didn't go unnoticed, either. She chuckled as she drank in the adorable sight before her. It was time to switch things up a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, you're cute as a button, dear. I could just eat you up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tensed up as you heard that last bit. The hand you were on shifted slightly closer to Vanilla's beautiful face, and you started to lose yourself in the mesmerizing view of her plump, pursed lips. No, that's <i>absurd.</i> She wouldn't <i>really</i> eat you, right? Not after all of this...right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up with a start. Your head is throbbing, and you can't seem to remember what happened to you. All you can really think is that you feel...different, somehow. And it's...really hard to breathe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes. You could tell when you first came to that wherever you were was somewhere really damn bright. With slight hesitation, you open your eyes just a bit, figuring that if this headache you have is a migraine, you'd only be making it worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight that meets you nearly made you pass out a second time. You were lying on the ground in the middle of a lush, green patch of forest\u2014or is it a jungle?\u2014but that wasn't what scared you...it was that everything was HUGE! What would normally be insignificant blades of grass were nearly as thick as your own legs and grew up to your chest; hell, even the smaller weeds around here were much taller than you! Luckily, there wasn't anything around. You don't want to think about what kind of bugs live here, let alone the 'regular-sized' animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, something catches your eye; it looks like the base of some large stone structure. Very narrow, as if it's sticking up into the sky, like some kind of pillar\u2014not that you can really tell, with the massive leaves overhead. With no real hope of shelter anywhere else in sight, nor anything better to do, you decide to trek to this unusual landmark. The journey is long; the location might've only been a few minutes' walk if you were normal sized (relatively speaking), but now it could probably take more than an hour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the spare time to wonder about your predicament, such questions being: Why did you wake up in some random jungle that you've never seen before? What could've possibly transported you here? And why is everything so big? Or is it that you're small...? Uncomfortable with the direction your line of thinking is going, you choose to focus more on the scenery. The plants here are really quite lush; even if you were normal-sized, the trunks still look like they'd stretch up, like they were trying to reach at the heavens. Speaking of, how far up is this place? You felt pretty out of breath when you woke up, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're on Mount Everest or something; especially considering that you don't even know what the hell brought you here. Jeez, why does everything you think about keep coming back to that?! It's stressful enough to <i>subconsciously</i> acknowledge that you're in the middle of nowhere for no real reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop, take a few deep breaths (that still don't seem to relieve your lungs too much), and continue on. As the distance closes between you and the stone structure, the foliage seems to fold back, giving off an heir of importance to whatever it is that caught your eye. This also allows you to get a better look at what exactly 'it' is; it turns out that the pillar you guessed it to be was only part of a <i>much</i> larger structure. There were lots of them, edging the corners of terraces that reminded you of a book you read on Mayan agriculture. The outermost pillars were interconnected at the top by more stone, while the interior had seven larger, each with a flourish at the top, like a watchtower. And at the center, there was what looked like a...massive, glowing gemstone?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind that, it looks like there's someone there, sitting on the bottom steps of the gem-shrine! Short, with bright, orange hair. Wow, that's a lot of orange...all over their body...are they even human? You guess you can't rule out your 'everything is big and I'm my normal size' hypothesis just yet. Even if approaching a gigantic stranger isn't the best idea at your current stature, it's probably a better one than just standing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resume your trek towards the steps of the shrine, now intrigued by both the structure itself and the person you're about to meet. As far as you know, they're the only other person here. Maybe they're in the same boat as you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way there, any plant life larger than grass eventually peters out, leaving a small clearing that encompasses the shrine. Among some detritus strewn on the ground (if you had to guess, you'd say it's because of erosion), you can make out some tattered white cloth and shards of what look like broken jewelry. Was there a group of people here? A tribe, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your journey is finished. You've reached the steps of the shrine, and are peeking out at the person you saw before. Strangely, they hadn't moved much at all, not even standing up or pacing around idly. A closer look at her face reveals that she is indeed not human, but still some kind of mammal. She's wearing a long, green skirt, patterned with diamonds that alternate between red and pale yellow, one inside another like a matryoshka doll. Adorning her right arm, collarbone, and forehead are ornately designed bands made of gold and slotted with a type of blue gem. She has large, sky blue eyes, with wristbands to match. Strangely, she only has a short, white, high-top shirt that almost looks like a bra. The same type of linen cloth you saw on the ground is wrapped carefully around various parts of her body; her left arm, her dreadlocks, and some long, winding ones around her legs, down to her large, auburn feet, which lie on pretty, white sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weird as it sounds, she's kind of...beautiful, in her own way. She looks terribly forlorn, though, with the way she's hunching over, barely holding up her head with her hands, and looking off into nothing. Did she live here, and something happened to her people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a powerful urge to help her, but there's not much you can do from here, at the foot of the steps. Surely, your presence would at least help to distract her from whatever's on her mind at the moment. But from where do you decide to approach her? Her feet are the closest to where you are, and it shouldn't take much to attract her attention from there, given that it would take one movement of her neck to see where you are; however, it isn't necessarily the safest place to be. If you go for her waist, she'd probably also notice you easily, but she could just as soon scoot over and crush you from there. Besides, she might not take kindly to you being so close to her unmentionables. Finally, you could try to crawl over her back and to her ears, but that could also end in you getting flung somewhere.</span></div></div>",

Now you were seeing what appeared to be some sort of Jungle setting and it was the middle of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard grumbling echoing above you. It sounded feminine but by no means was this voice girly. It didn\u2019t take long to find the source as right behind you was a massive orange animal of some sort. She walked upright like a human and even had human like features, but she was covered in orange fur and had a curious looking snout. She was also dressed, though her outfit made her look like a feral jungle dweller more than a civilized being. You were almost too scared to speak as the gigantic animal girl looked down at you unsure what to make of her find. You feared that she would view you as food or something, but instead she simply reached down to grab you, dropping you in a bag hanging around her waist and sealing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left in darkness as your prison shook about with the animal girls movements.

Just adding what I have saved, with some minor grammar corrections and editing to cohesion}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days ago you were out on a boat with some friends. It was pretty fun. You were relaxing on the deck when the sky darkened. The tides and waves got really crazy and you ended up being tossed from the ship. You tried to get help and return to the ship, but it was no use. The boat only got further and further away before you finally passed out, expecting to never awaken again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, you awakened on a beach somewhere on an unknown island. You didn't see any other people around and the whole place seemed deserted. You wandered aimlessly through the island trying to make the most of a bad situation. Though you didn't see any animals so far, there was plenty of vegetation. In fact the trees were absolutely massive, as were their fruits. After a nervous first try to see if it was edible, it was clear you weren't going to hungry here. However, today lead to one of your biggest discoveries about the island. You stood in complete awe of the sight, at first believing it to be a ditch or something before you got a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistake that it was a giant footprint. A rush of emotions filled you as you stared. You saw another not too far from this one, and even more after that. You weren't alone on this island, and on top of that whoever this other person was, he or she had to be gigantic. The footprints were so huge you could lay inside them. By comparative scale, you'd probably be barely three inches to the giant... assuming you weren't actually three inches. The massive plants certainly seemed to have a new meaning with this revelation. Not that the exact nature of your sizes really mattered now. At the moment, you carefully followed the tracks, curious about what exactly you were sharing the island with. The journey took almost the whole day, but you eventually stood before a huge shack fairly close to one of the beaches. Your heart pounded, but you felt it would be easy enough to inspect the building unnoticed and made your way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sound of waves echoed in the distance and the faint smell of sea water tickled your senses, you inspected the rooms. It wasn't too large, but the owner clearly had some essentials like a kitchen, bathroom, and living room. You saw some junk and ship parts laying around before a noise started to echo. You quickly hid and waited... but nothing came. Soon the sound echoed once more. It... kinda sounds like... snoring? Your heart finally slowed up after the initial scare. Still, maybe this would be a good time to investigate the owner to see exactly what you were dealing with. Though perhaps you tried your luck enough for one night and should keep away from her for now.</span></div></div>",

Careful not to disturb the owner, you slowly make your way towards the centre of the room so you could see whoever was on the bed better. To your surprise, the figure was an anthropomorphic raccoon of sorts, its body covered by brownish-orange hair along with dark brown fur surrounding its eyes and ears. Beside its intimidating size, it didn't really look that threatening, and who knows, it might just be able to help you. After deciding to approach it, you climb onto the bed. You start to make your way to its head when you notice how small its body is. Granted, it was still huge compared to yourself, but if you were at your normal height you'd probably be about two to three feet taller than the animal. As you get closer to its head you also noticed it had really small and hard to see cleavage. Well at least now you knew it was a girl. Shortly after that discovery you finally make it to her head, her hot breath almost knocked you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hot gusts of air rushed over your body, you quickly grabbed the bed to hold your place. The giant orange creature's breath had a bit of that morning odor to it, but at the very least, the heat was a welcome change after wandering around in the cold dark for the past couple of hours. Inspecting the sleeping giant a bit more, you figured that your best hope would be to get her attention as soon as possible. Of course, it was easier said than done as this, humanoid raccoon looking girl was out like a light and your size certainly wasn't doing you any favours with waking her up. On the other hand, maybe it wasn't such a good idea to wake her up, right? You don't even know if she's friendly or someone willing to kill you. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

You approached slowly as the terrain sank with every step, making walking a bit more difficult than normal. You used this time to inspect the room itself. Looking around, this girl was clearly a fan of boats and sailing. There was a model ship on a table nearby, various maps and sea charts on the walls, and even a cute captains hat that was most likely her size. Learning a bit more about this giantess you were surprised when you realised that you had already reached your destination.Laying close to the bed and staring at the ear, you decided to call out normally so not to startle her too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Um excuse me, please wake up?\" Your tone was a bit shaken as you were unsure how to go about with this. Her ear flickered slightly but otherwise she didn't really seem to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you called out a bit louder. Her ear twitched more but she still remained out like a light. You needed to raise your voice more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY WAKE UP!\" you shouted. You quickly covered. your mouth afterwards but it seems that this one finally did the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant the girl jolted awake and sat up, looking around frantically. Her sudden movement and her hand planting down on the bed next to you for support caused you to tumble towards the new dip in the bed towards her orange fuzzy hand. \"The heck was that?\" She asked groggily in a thick Australian accent. Before long, she felt something hitting her hand and shifted her focus to the strange new figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her massive blue eyes moved closer, they were still partially shut since it was still the middle of the night, but as they got a better look at you they started to widen.

She must not have felt your little tumble, because she didn\u2019t immediately crush you in the process of getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Coulda sworn I \u2018eard some noisy bloke makin\u2019 a racket.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around the room, not entirely sure of what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounded like it was somewhere in this room. Did some psycho break into my house? Crikey...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves in such a way that leaves her hands propping up her body. While she did this, you quickly scampered back up the slope of sheets, not keen on having your life ended before you could even talk to the person you were trying to get the attention of. Her fingers barely catch one of your legs; you struggle, and soon pull it from under them. A sinking feeling appears in your stomach as you realize that it might not have been the best idea to wake her up at god-knows-what hour of the night it is, especially since you apparently did so while whatever dream she was having was getting good. Should you really make her aware of your presence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the blazes\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like you don\u2019t have a choice in the matter, as you feel an enormous hand, very slightly dampened with night sweat, haphazardly clamp your body between its furry fingers. You\u2019d almost say her fuzzy grip was comfortable, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that she grabbed you at an awkward angle that left your legs split and one of the pads of her digits pressed square against your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lifted up close to her face, her massive eyes squinting down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIzzat some kind of doll? Looks like one of those humans, more than anythin\u2019,\u201d She guess while opening her fist and getting a closer look at you. Immediately after you could move your limbs again, you waved at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can you hear me?! I need help, I\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeh, and I need some sleep, mate, but I ain\u2019t getting any now,\u201d she grumbles, cutting you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring down at you for a moment, she ponders aloud what she should do to you, now that she\u2019s alert enough to keep her from sleeping. \u201cOkay, you little mozzie, I\u2019ve thought up some things that I\u2019m going to do witcha. I\u2019m knackered as hell, but that don\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a bit of fun,\u201d she sneers, \u201cSo I\u2019ll let you choose. I\u2019ve got two little punishments in mind for ya.

Relying solely on fear fueled instincts you immediately started tapping her thumb, hoping for the best. The massive raccoon girl smirked a bit as you finally made your decision. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d pick that.\u201d She said as her breath rushed over you with each word. The fingers suddenly released you and you fell ask to the bed. Though the landing was far from comfortable, landing right on your shoulder, the mattress was soft enough that no real damage was done. You rolled over and looked up, curious if that was the punishment, but of course you weren\u2019t getting off that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant turned around and walked near a window looking around the floor. You considered fleeing or at least trying to hide from her, but at your size and from up on the mattress your hiding options were limited and you weren\u2019t sure if you\u2019d be able to scale down the bed and make it to the door fast enough at your size. And heaven help you when she catches you trying to sneak away. And so for better or for worse, you stayed put, hoping that after this punishment is over she\u2019ll be in a more reasonable mood. She finally returned and dropped something else onto the bed, barely missing you and causing you to bounce on the mattress a few times. It took you a moment to identify the object through the dim lighting and the incredibly close position but you soon managed to recognize it as a shoe. The giant animal girl sat down on the mattress causing you to bounce and tumble once more before she grabbed the foot ware and turned it so that the mouth of the shoe was right in front of you. She wasn\u2019t going to actually make you- \u201cAlright mate. In ya go.\u201d She said in a commanding tone. You simply stood at the entrance to this cave feeling the warm air coming from there. The heat and the slight odor you could sense really made you not want to enter this shoe. The massive raccoon grew impatient once more. \u201cOi, are ya deaf down there or is your brain so tiny you can\u2019t grasp basic orders? Get in the there before I put ya in there myself.\u201d Yikes. This is not good at all. The idea of running once again enters your mind. Though it\u2019s doubtful you can get far from her. Still you\u2019re almost desperate enough to try it as the heat and odor waft from the entrance of the shoe. Maybe you could try bargaining with her. Or rather get on your knees and beg to her for mercy or at least some other way to apologize for bothering her in the dead of the night.</span></div></div>",

Goosebumps run up your back as you are given a closer look at the footwear. There were crinkles and small tears in the fabric. What little you could see of the rubber sole was covered in dirt. All of these things considered, it was pretty obvious that this raccoon was a very active individual. You curse you luck and look back one last time, hoping against hope that you might spark some iota of pity in the giant raccoon girl's mind, enough that she might just let you go. Unsurprisingly, this was not the case. In fact, she only seemed to grow more irritated at your hesitation. A gust of warm wind blew your way as she shifted a large, pudgy foot over to your position. Large, powerful toes rapped against the tongue of the shoe, and in an instant your world was completely blotted out by the menacing sight of her fuzzy sole. You yelp, and scramble your way past the heel of the tennis shoe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you could feel a stark difference in the atmosphere as you leap inside the tennis shoe. The air was uncomfortably hot and stuffy; it was almost like jumping into a rainforest. Marine laughs at your panic, and tilts the shoe back down, preparing to shove her foot right in. \"There ya go, small fry. Hope you payed attention in insole school, 'cause ya sure ain't riding a thong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout at the unexpected movement and trip into the middle of the massive, pronounced footprint that covered most of the insole. You gasp as you faceplant into the moist, musky surface. Your tongue unfortunately dragged against it, inviting a potent mouthful of dried sweat onto your taste buds. Gagging, you attempt to wipe your away the sour taste, but the terrain shifts further, and you tumble down to the end of the shoe, smacking your face down into the sweaty fabric over and over again as it revisits your mouth for seconds, thirds, and fourths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you stop rolling as your body lands in the toe section. The world is spinning around from that little trip you took, but it slowly settles down after a moment. Just as you think you might get a moment of peace, however, you feel your surroundings rumble. You look forward just in time to catch five orange toes and the ball they're attached to barreling down the entrance towards you. Your heart leaps out of your chest as the terrifying sight swallows you whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the raccoon girl finishes putting her sneaker on, she scrunches her toes to make sure the little annoyance was still there, getting what it deserved. To her delight, she could feel your soft body get sucked into the gap between the ball of her foot and her toe pads. She squeezes you once more, then shuffles to the side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat from her skin had started to reactivate the hidden, ground-in odors of the shoe, to you (and your nose's) abject horror, and your tongue was still crying out in disgust from it's little date with the sweat-laced fabric of the sneaker's interior. Not to mention, the smack of feet was far more potent now that you were smothered between damp, spongey insole and soft, smelly toes. Your olfactory senses were already overwhelmed, causing you to hyperventilate, pumping even more of the ripe stench into your lungs. You already feel yourself tearing up at the complete invasion of your respiratory system. This was <i>not</i> going to be a fun ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarine's face brightens up as she feels you struggle weakly under her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know what? This was an amazin' idea! My dogs already feel way comfier, and all it took was a little padding. I bet I could even snooze a bit more. That is, if I don't want to teach this little mozzie even more of a lesson...\"</span></div></div>",

You also suppose that it's not terribly safe here, either; she could roll around in her sleep, after all. Based on your reasoning, the best place to be before you inevitably try to come in contact with the only person you're aware of is most certainly not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking good on your logic (which you're pretty proud of, honestly), you make your way to the edge of the bed once again, and attempt to crawl down the plain white bedsheets and back to the (relative) safety of the floor. Since they're not even tucked into the bedframe, they shift easily, meaning one side became very lopsided, with the sheet nearing the floor at one point.

Oh well; at least you figured that out before you actually attempted to wake her, because that could've gone south <i>real</i> quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly coarse fabric makes for a useful climbing surface, even if your weight sometimes changed the shape of the creases you climbed down on. However, you can't help but feel like there might've been something you overlooked when committing to getting back to the floor this way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anything happen while you climb down?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just figured you\u2019d hide under the bed and wait to see if she was getting up. But before you could get off the sheet, the raccoon started to shift and turn about tugging the bedsheet and pulling it up faster than you could process what was happening.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After being resuscitated by Doctor Eggman following her brush with death during the fight against the Iron Queen, Lien-Da insisted on honing her abilities with an unprecedented fervor. She had some unused storage space in her ship that she commandeered and converted into an extensive training ground. Now, she planned to put it to good use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unleashed everything she had against the dummies that populated the grounds of her personal dojo. They swung from retractable wires that hung from the ceiling, moving quickly, erratically, and unpredictably. She brandished her bullwhip in a long, horizontal sweep, knocking away several dummies in one blow, then used her momentum to roundhouse kick another. Catching an opening between the moving bodies, she somersaulted over several downed and live dummies, finally landing on one, ripping it from its wires, and digging a heeled boot into its makeshift head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLien-Da laughed and laughed, soreness and euphoria swelling through her body as she pushed herself to her limits, blood pumping, pores sweating, hair hanging down. Her training session went on like this for hours, all of them spent batting and whipping and kicking away at the decoys, dropping them one by one. Eventually, not a single dummy was left hanging. She looked around the room, witnessing the results of her own carnage. The dummies\u2014some of which just so happened to have crude faces of Regina and Julie-Su sketched onto them\u2014were strewn about. Only a handful of them were in shape to be repaired; the others had large, deep gashes through their heads and torsos, some of which were bisected from each other. She wasn\u2019t entirely used to the electrical powers her cybernetics gave her, but she quickly figured out how to channel it through her whip, charring a couple dummies and their stuffing to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she took in this display of her power, she noticed something moving in the periphery of her vision. Something near the door. Gripped by curiosity, she went over to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up all of a sudden, sitting on cool linoleum and leaning against the wall. The immediate unfamiliarity of your environment dawns on you. This is not your beautiful house! Its\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. You can\u2019t really see much from here, just some bare, charcoal grey floor tiles. The panels themselves are a lot larger than you\u2019d expect, probably the result of some oddball architect\u2019s decisions. You should probably get a better vantage point if you want to find out where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling yourself up from your relaxed position, you stretch your arms and catch a glimpse of the ceiling\u2014and holy hell, it is HUGE! Someone could probably fit a 32-wheeler vertically in here! Are you in a warehouse or something? Since this place is so big, it\u2019s a good idea to stick to the wall you were laying on, in case you get lost. You press your hand against it and move forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you\u2019re traveling, you hear some loud, intense smacking in the distance, and something that sounds like someone throwing a massive exercise mat onto the ground. Both sounds keep up, sometimes interspersed with grunts and\u2026chuckling? Just what the hell did you stumble in on?! You quicken your pace, running alongside the wall, and looking somewhere, anywhere for a door, or hovel, or anything that you could hide in. Unlucky for you, it seems like the wall is impenetrable. A long, uninterrupted stretch of rubber is lined along the whole bottom edge, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything you can hide under in the immediate vicinity. All you can hope for is that you reach a door before whoever the hell is seriously messing shit up doesn\u2019t come your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, you think you can spot some light leaking out in the distance; there\u2019s a break in the rubber! There must be an exit! The smacking and yelling is getting more violent and common, until suddenly, after one last thud, it stops. A long, hearty, pompous cackle echoes throughout the room. Loud footsteps boom out towards you. All your self-preserving instincts ring out: you need to run. You make a mad dash towards the light source, ignoring everything else around you. It\u2019s getting closer, closer\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you reach the opening you trip, smacking flat against the ground. Your lungs were screaming, and each attempt you made at scrambling up to your feet was met with your shaky body crumbling to the ground. The footsteps grew louder and clearer. No\u2026you were so close\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look towards the source of the sound. Something\u2014no, someone\u2014<i>enormous</i> was towering above you, in a dark, skintight suit (one that undeniably shows off her curvaceous figure). The sky above you darkens as she lowers a red hand towards you. Her soft, slightly sweaty fingers wrap around your crumpled form, lifting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLien-Da brings you closer to her head to get a better look at what you were. You seemed like some kind of doll, but since you were moving...you were alive. As her grip lessens, she lets you splay out in the palm of her hand. There you were: a tiny human; one that snuck into her dojo, no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. Seems like these days, <i>all</i> of my problems are small,\u201d she quips, poking you in the stomach. \u201cTell you what, pipsqueak. Normally, I\u2019d just hand you off to the Interrogation division, but I\u2019m feeling pretty sexy right now. Instead of being sent down to a dark room to experience some boring old excruciating torture, how about you come with me?\u201d You feel your heart sink into your chest. Just what the hell did she think you were? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLien-Da giggles at the dread creeping onto your face. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a sourpuss. Why else would you sneak in here~?\u201d Her free hand runs slowly, seductively down her latex suit, gently cupping her bust, then her navel, then her thighs. Despite your terror, you can\u2019t help but stare and blush at her assets. She flashes a knowing smirk at you. Her thumb slides down your chest, then forcefully pins itself against your crotch, eking an embarrassed yelp out of you. It\u2019s so warm, and damp\u2026and comfy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you\u2019re a little cutie, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She giggles again, watching you relax into her hold. \u201cI almost feel bad. But you <i>did</i> sneak into this facility, and you <i>did</i> come here for intel. I\u2019m not gonna just let you leave.\u201d You gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <i>are</i> going to tell me what you were doing here. But first, we need to go somewhere more\u2026private. I\u2019ll have to hide you on my person; can\u2019t let anybody know this happened, or I\u2019ll be seen as incompetent. Since I\u2019m feeling so gracious, I\u2019ll let you choose where I\u2019ll put you,\u201d Lien-Da moves her hand to her chest, snaking a finger under her collar. \u201cMy breasts,\u201d she pauses, stroking her waist and giving you a naughty wink, \u201cOr somewhere lower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit. Holyshitholyshitholyshit\u2014how did you get yourself into this?! Your heat is pounding, and you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s from fear or arousal. Where should you choose? <i>Should</i> you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you were put in any of the places you thought she\u2019d put you in, you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019d be able to control yourself. It\u2019s almost certainly not a good idea to push it too far, and you don\u2019t trust yourself to not do so. Instead, you look up at her and answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I\u2026think I\u2019d rather you carry me in your pocket, if that\u2019s okay,\u201d you meekly suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since you\u2019ve met her, Lien-Da\u2019s face falls. \u201cOh come on, I\u2019m giving you an exclusive, up-close look at my gorgeous body and you\u2019re asking me to put you in my <i>pocket</i>?\u201d She fondles a breast once more, for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stutter, stumbling over your words as you try fruitlessly to come up with an excuse. You seriously misjudged her; she\u2019s a lot more libertine than you thought. Instead of doubling back, your panicked mind decides to double down. \u201cY-yes! I want to be in your pocket! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLien-Da pouts, obviously not amused by your refusal to play along. \u201c<i>Fine.</i> Since you want to be such a <i>prude</i>, how about you go somewhere even <i>lower</i> then I was thinking\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends down, placing you between her black boots, though not without giving you a warning. \u201cJust so you know, I saw you sprint for your life, pipsqueak. I know you don\u2019t have much left in you. Try not to make this too hard on either of us, and stay right there, okay?\u201d Disturbingly enough, you comply with her orders without question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay on the floor, you try to rationalize your sudden obedience to yourself. Even with the partial rest you got in her hand, you were still wheezing, and your foresight tells you that it\u2019s definitely <i>not</i> a good idea to run through that door. Sure, you\u2019re alone in here but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019d be alone out there. You\u2019d probably get caught by someone the minute you got out there. Not like there\u2019s anywhere to run, anyways. Even if you got through the door, she could just open it and catch you instantly. Instead, you decide to lie down on the cold, feeling pretty numb already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you catch Lien-Da lifting her foot. Oh god, was she going to stomp you into paste?! Wait, no, that doesn\u2019t make sense. She just <i>said</i> she needed to keep you alive for intel. Oh shit...but maybe that means she\u2019ll dispose of you when you tell her what really happened\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by a slam as the echidna\u2019s boot falls to the floor. <i>Phew,</i> you mutter to yourself, <i>That was close.</i> It didn\u2019t dawn on your mind just <i>why</i> she removed her boot, though. Interested by the new development, you look up. Lien-Da\u2019s giant, post-workout foot fills your vision as she scrunches her sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, <i>that\u2019s</i> better,\u201d she sighs. \u201cLike what you see? I hope so; It\u2019s all you\u2019re gonna be seeing for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo paralyzed with fear to move your tiny legs, you accept your fate. Even as the dominant diva\u2019s foot descends upon you, you can\u2019t help but admire its beauty: the sole is long, slender, yet supple. Its shapely contours lowered down to meet you, and you could swear you saw steam rising from its billowing folds. Gradually, your vision was encompassed by the vast plain of slightly-furred skin, and all you saw was red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lien-Da\u2019s long, shapely toes, dewed with workout sweat, came down and grabbed your body. Their intense, yet gradually cooling warmth was\u2014as strange as it sounds\u2014a welcome change from the chilly linoleum floor. The moisture, another immediately noticeable trait of the plush, smooth digits, was much less welcome. In an unfortunate stroke of bad luck, your face was shoved straight into the arch of her big toe, forcing some of the salty liquid into your mouth when you tried to breathe. In an effort to prevent any more of it from inviting itself in, you thoughtlessly inhaled through your nose; instantly the pungent scent of vinegar invaded your lungs, its intensity multiplied at your puny size. It was curbed, if only slightly, by a whiff of grape, presumably from a lotion the echidna had put on before her lengthy workout. You coughed and hacked as the balmy essence of her hard work occupied your entire respiratory system, if only for a moment. Of course, with your mouth being open, the salty sweat poured in once more, defiling your mouth much more thoroughly this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, little guy. Time to put you in your new home for a bit,\u201d Lien-Da snickered, lifting her foot above the entrance of her boot. She loved every second she had you at her mercy. You might\u2019ve been disappointing as a person, but as a stress ball to mess around with, you were going to be a lot of fun for her. <i>Maybe if he holds his tongue, I\u2019ll keep him in here as punishment,</i> she wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as your mouth and nose were being put through cruel and unusual punishment, you didn\u2019t dare move your face from its place under the echidna\u2019s big toe. It might\u2019ve been disgusting down here, but the alternative of looking down at the stark face of death that was your distance from the ground is something that you consider to be far, far worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot lowers you slowly into the shiny black boot, and deposit you onto the murky surface. The first thing that strikes you about the inside is the temperature. It is hot. <i>Really</i> hot. A very far cry from the chilly, rock hard flooring, or the subtle, comforting warmth of Lien-Da\u2019s hand, or even the ebbing heat of her toes. The sounds from earlier had tipped you off, but the sheer <i>sauna</i> that was the inside of her heeled footwear smacked you with the truth. Far worse, though, was the smell; the entire thing reeked of sharp cheddar. Unfortunately, the simple matter was that you had no choice. It\u2019s either inhale the funk or suffocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, light barely coming through the mostly blocked entrance. The five red, sweaty beasts above you scrunched and wiggled, as if they were dogs, eager to play with their new toy. If you stayed here long enough, you were sure to be crushed under heel. Survival instincts taking hold, you make a barely-successful mad dash through the landscape of the insole left you heaving in the sweaty stench at its greatest point in the toe section. Inevitably, you were cornered by the massive, playful digits and dragged underneath them as Lien-Da began the walk to her private quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your body was mashed relentlessly into the moist insole by Lien-Da\u2019s mischievous toes, you fully realized just how stupid you were declining her generous offer. You asked for the safety of her pocket, giving up your chance at riding in a giant girl\u2019s cleavage, only to end up in her toe cleavage instead. God, why did you have to be so fucking nervous around women\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the hot, sweaty toes surrounding you curl up, cuddling your bare body into their slick arches. Your head is plunged nose-first into the crevice between her big and second toes, while your groin is pushed into plush skin between her third and fourth ones. The unexpected stimulation from the squeezing, grinding contact already had you at half-mast, though it didn\u2019t exactly make the experience any more pleasant. Rather, you felt disgusted with yourself and your body for betraying you over a little physical stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to notice that your head specifically was being targeted by the grooved digits. Your head was clenched repeatedly into the muggy crevice, right where 'fresh' toejam was forming; it was almost like Lien-Da was trying to order you to do something about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder and retch, feeling nauseous at the thought of putting your mouth anywhere near the substance. You don't know if you could handle actually accepting it into your mouth. Do you give up and remove the sticky, gooey dreck from between the toes?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You still can't believe the situation you were in, convinced that it was all a dream. You had woken up this morning, very clearly not inside of your bed. You appeared to be inside some sort of museum that housed a lot of valuable minerals. That alone would have been strange enough, but there was also the fact that you were now ridiculously tiny as well! Even the smallest minerals in the museum were massive boulders to you! Fortunately no one had been in the museum when you first woke up, otherwise you probably never would have woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the weirdness of the situation didn't end there. Taking advantage of the emptiness, you started looking around the museum for some of the staff. It was hard to tell at your size, but the place didn't seem that big. You reasoned that it was a small museum. Which was fine for you, that means you had less ground to cover. As you wandered around though, it was clear that no one was out in the main area. You even stumbled upon the main entrance and tried to squeeze under it to no avail. Even your miniscule size wasn't enough to get under its extra tiny gap. Hanging on the handle, you saw a sign that said open on it. Since the open side was facing you inside the museum, you figured the closed side was facing the outside. Which meant the museum was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains the lack of people.\" You mumble to yourself as you turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the museum was closed, you decided to keep looking for help. Surely there had to be someone in the museum who could help you. A security guard or the owner had to be in here. You didn't know how long the museum would be closed and you wanted any kind of help ASAP. Knowing that the common area would be devoid of people, you start looking for side doors. After a while of searching you eventually found a door that said curator on it. Fortunately, this door had a big enough gap for you to squeeze under. The thing you saw when you got on the other side was the weirdest thing yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room there was someone sitting at a desk. But that someone wasn't a human! It was some kind of gigantic colorful insect! One that was wearing clothes! At first you swore that you had gone crazy, but no matter what you did you still saw a giant beetle sitting at a desk! Something about her looked vaguely familiar, but you didn't understand what that was until you thought a bit. Eventually it hit you that she looked just like a character from Sonic the Hedgehog! So apparently you were shrunk, trapped in a different dimension, and your only help was from a character you didn't recognize. You guessed that she was from the comics, but you had never kept up with those so you didn't know who she was. You could tell that she was a female beetle at least but that was it. No matter how strange it was, you had decided to approach the giant beetle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you were at the foot of her desk, right by her feet as she worked. You still don't want to believe your situation but you had no choice at this point. In your new spot you finally noticed some details about your potential savior. She was definitely a beetle, well a Sonic beetle, but a beetle none the less. She seemed to have primarily light blue skin. Her exoskeleton was an even lighter blue with pink, yellow, green, and blue highlights that gave it a rainbow like shimmer. Honestly her exoskeleton looked like it could be one of the minerals in her museum. Her two antennae were light blue like her skin and strangely cute with their small size; still bigger than you unfortunately. Even though they were just barely showing right now, the interior of her wings seemed to be cream colored. Finally, she had pink eyes and a white muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed how you would expect a professional person would, but it seemed strange on her beetle form. She was wearing a pink jacket with a matching pink miniskirt that didn't go past her knees. She was sitting at her desk now though, so it might go further down when she was standing. On her hands she wore white gloves with navy cufflinks, probably for when she handled any files or sensitive materials. Of course all sonic characters wore gloves anyways so it figured she had them. To your surprise, she had some navy stockings on and pink heels that matched her dress. Her heels were currently discarded a few inches away from you, leaving her feet free to hang above you. It was weird to see a Sonic character without their shoes on. Apparently they just had normal, somewhat cartoony, feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetles foot hung above you precariously. You don't know if it was the stress of the situation or something else but her feet seemed odd to you. Their movements felt like they were taunting you. The scrunching of her toes, the way she flexed her soles, or whenever she scratched one foot with the other, it felt like a taunt. You were smaller than the foot of a bug girl and they could come down and crush you at any time. The movements of her feet seemed to purposefully emphasize that. Shaking those thoughts out of your head you back up to make some space, and end up near her discarded heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind you, you see that you are at the entrance of one of her heels. Looking inside you could see that the heels were somewhat worn but still a little fresh. If you wanted to, you could go inside and rest. The beetle seemed plenty busy, so you could probably get a quick rest before she leaves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you shake your head. \"What's gotten into me? I must be really tired.\" You groan as you get ready to make your next move. Taking a deep breath you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You could only watch as the giant, stockinged soles blotted out the ceiling lights, sealing your fate underneath them. You cringe, waiting for the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or at least, what you <i>thought</i> was the end. It turns out that the beetle girl's feet were soft enough to cushion any pain that you might've felt from being pressed under them. Even when you were rolled onto and between the fabric-covered arches of her feet, you didn't feel awkward, or hurt, or panicked. They were so soft, in fact, that you almost felt...comfortable in their presence. Sure, it's a bit damp down here, and warm, and, er, <i>fragrant,</i> but compared to both the chill of the air-conditioned foyer and the complete lack of contact with another person you've felt for the past few hours, it's pretty nice down here. You squeeze yourself further into the sole above you as it drags your form across its calming warmth. If you weren't currently being rolled around, you'd almost say that you could fall asleep against these things. A nagging sensation told you that it <i>really wasn't normal</i> to think of being squeezed into someone's sole as pleasant, but you try your best to ignore it. <i>I'm just tired,</i> you told yourself, <i>that's why I enjoy this so much. Definitely.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJewel was recovering after a long, tiring day of leading tourists around the Mineral Museum. Running her business solo (barring the occasional help Tangle provided, both with cleanup and finding new artifacts on her travels) was a veritable chore. It was nice to see people so enamored with the exhibits she painstakingly put together, but standing and walking around all day was killer on her feet, especially in her stockings, which she refused to go without. <i>There's always a price for the virtue of beauty,</i> she'd always tell herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, business hours were over, and she could rest. She had taken her heels off a while ago to just relax. Sighing and closing her eyes, the beetle leaned back in her chair and spread her feet onto the carpet, cooling them off. After a while of resting her head, she felt something new under the sole of her left foot. The sensation of scrubbing it against her foot was actually somewhat pleasant, so she continued to mess around with the object, squeezing it, rolling it along the ground, and even between her soles. Jewel shivered in pleasure; it was so cool against her tired feet. She could spend hours just massaging them with her tiny toy\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. What <i>am</i> I rubbing my feet against? It could be one of my missing pens, or something from when we reassembled the museum\u2014oh no, did I just spend an hour defiling a precious gemstone?! Oh, I just <i>knew</i> we missed something in the cleanup,\" the beetle mumbled. \"Well, what's done is done. I better clean it up before I do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in the middle of being smothered in the blissfully warm, comfy fabric of the beetle girl's soles when you suddenly felt everything stop. Her feet parted from one another, forcing you to steady yourself on the subtly-wrinkled flesh of her instep. You almost lost control and snuggled yourself further into the irresistible skin, but your survival skills took hold, and you stood perfectly still. This time, a dainty, gloved hand came down to meet you. Your body was gripped in the gentle embrace of its fingers, and you felt the tension leave your body again. Obviously, whoever this girl was, she didn't want to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jewel held you closer to get a better look, she sees:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not possible, it shouldn't be possible; or at least, there's nothing <i>here</i> that could ever do such a thing! And...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, goodness <i>gracious</i>...have I been...squashing you with my feet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetle girl felt a boulder sink in her stomach. Quickly looking over your body, she's relieved to find that you're not seriously hurt. You <i>do</i> feel a bit disoriented, though; enough to not respond with much other than a woozy nod, at least. She takes notice of your queasiness, and slowly, carefully lays you out in her flat palm. You lie on your back, pushing yourself off the comfy, velvety ground of her glove, and stare back up at her, giving her clothed finger a firm squeeze, as if to say 'it's okay'. An incandescent blush completely covers her face, and the sheer guilt in her eyes almost makes <i>you</i> feel guilty for making her worry (even though you really didn't have any control over the situation).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes and looking like she's about to cry, Jewel sighs, puts a hand on her forehead, and mutters, \"I should get you cleaned up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod again, much more cognizant this time. As much as you weirdly enjoyed your time with her warm, inviting stockings, it's probably for the best that you don't spend your entire time with this beetle girl smelling like her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, I'm such an awful person,</i> Jewel groans in her head, <i>This little guy probably had to trek around for hours, if not </i>days,<i>to find some help, and the closest thing he gets to actual contact is a face full of my post-workday feet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother side of her mind couldn't help but raise a counterpoint: <i>Well, he hasn't brought it up, has he? Besides, you really deserve a nice, relaxing massage once in a while. It's not your fault his body felt so good under your soles...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing stopping her from smacking herself across the face is the worry that you might find her even stranger than you do now. For now, she just keeps her head parallel with the ground and walks to the public restroom with a steady gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you both arrived at your destination. Thankfully, both the locals and most tourists are polite enough to clean up after themselves, so the sinks were relatively clean. You're feeling a bit uneasy about how you were going to freshen up, but you don't let it be seen, lest you make your cautious savior feel even worse than she does now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there was an actual marble counter top that you could stand on, unlike the uneven, wobbly sinks that you so often saw at restaurants and small movie theatres. Jewel gently tilts her hand forward, letting you steady yourself before you leave the warm, comforting touch of her gloved hand. You turn around, waiting for her response. With an embarrassed smile, she states:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, little guy, looks I'll have to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
