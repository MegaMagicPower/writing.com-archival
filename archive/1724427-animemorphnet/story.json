It said you'll never see your favorite anime characters the same way again . A fellow anime fan that you frequently talk to via email had heard of it. He said not to go there , it was dangerous . He was probably trying to trick you though. Like when he said that Death Note was about musical notes that kill you. You clicked the tab and looked at the page . It was just an image sharing site . A but load of anime computer wallpaper was there . You found a cool one of Edward from FMA and clicked view image . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Words appeared on the screen it was a question . \"Is this your choice?\" you clicked yes . \"Are you sure? You will not be able to chose another.\" you clicked yes. The screen started to glow with an intense light , you were blind for a few seconds . Your vision cleared and you felt sick . You shut the computer off and went to bed . As you lie in bed you couldn't sleep . You tossed and turned , the feeling starting to become an intense pain . You screamed into your pillow , then once you were done screaming flipped over . Your had looked different , but you were unable to stay awake . You fainted , you eventually woke up . You placed your hand on your head and heard an unfamiliar sound . It sounded metalic , like metal clanking together . Your hand was cold as ice . You moved your had off your face and sat up . Something was wrong , your clothes which had fit perfectly . Were now lose as heck . You jumped off your bed and looked in the mirror . Your mouth dropped . You did stare back at you . Edward Elric however did . You stood there in shock , what shall you do now?</span></div></div>",
