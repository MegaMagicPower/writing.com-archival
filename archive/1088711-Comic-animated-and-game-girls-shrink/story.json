Stargirl smiled and nodded, but huntress could see that she was crying. \"Come on honey its fine\", Huntress said. \"Well your not, but don't worry.

Helena screamed as she tried to push through her vertigo in order to stand, but stumbles and falls again.<br>\r\n\"Huntress!\", Helena felt a large hand on her back. Stargirl grabbed helena, and lifted her to her feet. Stargirl turned and called for atom, as huntress gathered herself. \"Oh my God! I have to look up just to see your huge ass!\", huntress said. \"Its not that big; is it?\", Stargirl asked with worry.<br>\r\nWhile Stargirl worried over her ass, Helena began shrinking again just outside of Stargirl's line of vision. \"I think it's fine, Huntress?\", Stargirl looked down further. There, she found her. Kicking her boot, desperate to get noticed, stood a 5 inch tall Helena Bertinelli; butt naked. Stargirl got down on one knee, and reached for her.<br>\r\nHuntress looked up to see two things; one was Stargirl's hand, reaching for her. The other was the great wall of Stargirl's crotch, outlined by her skin-tight shorts. Said crotch apearred wet, as though Stargirl were horny.<br>\r\nStargirl drank in the view of the nude huntress as she reached down, realizing how beautiful huntress is. Question had told Stargirl that huntress was bisexual, as she occasionally looked at other women for odd lengths of time. As she herself was bisexual, Stargirl realized that if she played her cards right, huntress might fall for her!<br>\r\nStargirl was now standing, with the fully shrunk huntress in her hand. \"Since I'm maskless now, I guess I should say it. My real name is Helena\", Helena told Stargirl. 'Oh my gosh! This is the first step, I can't blow this!', Stargirl thought. \"I'm Courtney!\", Stargirl stated almost a little too loudly. Although thanks to courtney, that got Helena thinking.<br>\r\n'Lets see; sweaty, loud, shy behavior, small smile. Question has talked to this girl before, and judging from her wet crotch and odd behavior; obviously she's bisexual and knows I am also. There is only one thing to do, play the cards of oblivious and hard to get. It won't be easy, seeing as she is herself gorgeous. But I need to know if I'm worth it to her', Helena thought. It was then that the two bisexual girls were interrupted, as somebody came in through the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Possibly forever\", Batman said. Stargirl gasped, as she looked down at the broken heroine who was losing hope fast.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Helena, we've pulled through the impossible before.

Although I have plans tonight, so we won't have alone time til tomorrow. Unless I get some time before leaving the watchtower', stargirl thought as the boys left. Helena noticed Stargirl's crotch get wetter through her shorts, and wandered what could be going through the teens mind.<br>\r\n\"What now?\", Helena asked Courtney. \"Well, I have plans tonight so I have to get in my civvies. Then make a stop at the store, before I go home\", Courtney said. \"What plans?\", asked Helena. \"I'm having a sleepover with Supergirl and Batgirl. Supergirl decided we needed a normal teen thing to better bump our relationship from 'work associate's' to 'friends'\", Courtney said as she opened the door to her bedroom on the watchtower to get clothes before heading to the lockerroom.<br>\r\n\"Keeping personal belongings to a minimum, makes it hard to get to know the girl behind the mask you know?\", Helena told Courtney. \"I prefer my civilian life stay on earth where its needed\", Courtney said as she removed her mask and top; exposing a white sports bra, which also came off. She then took off her boots and socks, and Helena's eyes bulges as Courtney reached for her shorts. Those shorts came off slowly, revealing white cotton panties that Courtney also removed.<br>\r\n\"Care to join me for a shower?\", Courtney asked Helena. Helena nods as the also naked giantess grabs her nude body, and heads into the women's shower area. The girls are both very horny as they walk to the , Courtney Then sets Helena on the sink for a moment. Helena gets an incredible view of Courtney's butt, as the blonde bended over to turn on the hot water. \"It never ceases to amaze me that we can get warm water in space\", Courtney said.<br>\r\nHelena was hot, and not from the shower water. As Courtney carried her in a firm grip into the steamy shower, her eyes wandered downward. As soon as the water began cascading down courtney's body, Helena began touching herself. Courtney's giant crotch was in sight; with a running start followed by a jump, Helena could reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does she try?</span></div></div>",

We're lucky she isn't bleeding\", Courtney said as she was close to tears. Barbara and Kara exchanged a slight look of concern, had they really done that?

With it I can shrink down to Helena's size long enough to patch her up\", batgirl said as she disappeared in a flash of light. Moments later, a tiny batgirl was tending to huntress's injuries that she and Supergirl inflicted. Of course huntress did not trust her, and tried to get away; only to aggravate her injuries. Batgirls heart sank a little at the look she was getting, one of a cornered animal. Of course batgirl didn't regret her fun, well maybe a little bit.<br>\r\n A minute later, batgirl was back to normal and the girls tried to lighten the mood with movie time. Kara and Courtney cooked dinner, which left batgirl alone with huntress. \"Please don't hurt me again. Please\", huntress whimpered. Batgirl felt her heart break a little, she wondered how Kara was feeling. She looked towards the kitchen, where the scent of Kent family recipes was coming from.<br>\r\n Kara understood what Barbara thought, she felt some shame also; but not enough that she wouldn't try again. She loved feeling huntress under her ass, it was better than sparring with Clark.<br>\r\n \"Kara, could you set the ta-- Done!\", Stargirl had started but Supergirl finished the job before she completed her sentence. \"Barbara, Helena; dinners ready\", Courtney called. Barbara walked in seconds later, Helena held firmly in her hand.<br>\r\n Courtney decides to share her food with Helena, so she lets her eat off her plate. \"Isn't that romantic?\", Barbara says as she sees Courtney use a napkin to get mashed potatoes off Helena's face. Courtney and Helena both blushed, waving off Babs' comment simotaniously. \"They deny at exactly the same time? Definitely a couple\", Kara said. \"Um, I'm gonna check the pie\", Courtney said leaving for the kitchen. \"You care for her; so the more reason not to talk\", Kara said, giving huntress a half-hearted glare.<br>\r\n That night the girls all slept in sleeping bags in the living room, Courtney of course kept Helena with her.

Then all of a sudden, light fills the void. \"Oh look Kara; the bitch is awake\", came the familiar voice of Barbara. Helena looked up at the faces of her tormentors, and glanced around her prison. \"Oh God, why?\", Helena realized she was in the back of Batgirl pants; there was a buttcheek securing her on each side.<br>\r\n \"Stargirl help me\", Helena shouted. \"Silence, she cannot help you here\", Supergirl said; oddly with a deep, distorted voice. \"What do you want?\", Helena asked. \"We want you to suffer\", Batgirl said in the same voice. Suddenly, Helena's pants prison began to fill with blood. \"Oh, am I on my period? Bad for you, I'm also gassy\", Batgirl said. Suddenly, streams of fire appeared and the blood started boiling. \"Am I in hell?\", Helena asked out loud. The blood burned her skin on contact, and the blood rose faster and faster. As soon as it went over her eyes, she blacked out.<br>\r\n When she woke, she was chained to a stone slab. Everthing appeared to be dungeon-themed, bringing a chill to her spine. Suddenly, Bab's and Kara appeared dressed as executioners; towering over her like usual. They bent down, revealing a lack of underwear; and started peeling on her. The pee burned her skin off, causing Helena to realize it was acid. As she burned to a skeleton, she black out again.<br>\r\n This time she woke on a giant cage, with the massive figure of Stargirl holding her. But Stargirls hair was torn and bloody, and someone had ripped out all her teeth. Her eyes were gone, and it was like she was crying blood; her body shook with sobs. Someone had carved into her midriff, bats and shields all over. \"You talked, so she suffered as our toy\", came a sinister voice. Helena turned around and saw Kara and Bab's, covered in blood. A knife came at Helena, she blinked.<br>\r\n Helena looked around and just saw Kara and Bab's, Kara had a shrunken Stargirl in her hand; she held her right over Helena, and crushed her into a bloody mess. As the blood dripped onto her, Helena screamed.<br>\r\n Helena woke up in a cold sweat, breathing deeply before breaking into tears and sobbing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n However her crying was not unheard, as a large hand grabbed her then later flat.

Thatch loves superheroines, so much so that he has devoted his life and considerable means to collecting them.  And today, his sights were set on the darling of the Titan Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a difficult trap to set, one that required he stage five consecutive crimes to assure that the Titan forces would be divided down to individuals.  Then it was a matter of determining where Starfire herself would be deployed, and ambushing her there with a crazy-ass piece of technology that you frankly have no chance of understanding.  The end result of this was that one moment the alien girl was rushing her mysterious new foe with her energy-blasts flaring, and the next moment she was roungly seven inches long and being scooped up in a thermos that smelled of old milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark, but it was immediately apparent that Starfire was not Thatch's first collection for the day.  She found herself packaged up in uncomfortably close proximity with what felt like two other forms.  After a few delicate attempts at conversation with these two infuriated individuals, she managed to gather that one was Bumblebee of Titans East, and the other was off-and-on enemy Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls were finally dumped out of the thermos back at Thatch's lair, which appeared to be nothing more than a basement that probably didn't belong to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelous!\" said Thatch, snatching up each girl one by one and admiring her lovingly.  \"Some of my favorites right here.  I'm not just saying that because you're the ones I caught today, either.  You three are [i]awesome[/i].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you brought us here?\" demanded Bumblebee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you intend to interrogate us, you're wasting your time,\" said Jinx.  \"I don't respond to torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heaven forefend!\" said Thatch.  \"No harm will befall any of you here.  It is my intent to keep you in as near mint condition as I can, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Near [i]what[/i] condition?\" said Bumblebee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This condition of the mint of which you speak,\" said Starfire, \"Is it painful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  Classic.  No, I wouldn't be much of a collector if it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're like, what, some kind of giant dork?\" guessed Jinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute when you're mean!\" said Thatch.  \"Don't lose any of that.  Really.  I want you all to remain your delightful selves for the duration of your captivity here.  Try to enjoy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls exchanged several glances between them, not entirely sure of what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I am going to be taking off your clothes,\" said Thatch.  \"Academic curiosity, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" said Bumblebee, as she was the first to be picked up and plucked of her outfit.  \"Oh, [i]hell no![/i]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see how this would be of interest to me,\" said Thatch.  \"Nobody's ever seen you ladies naked before, and we've all been wondering how you measure up for a long time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed aside Bumblebee's top and pants.  The tiny girl, now clad only in a plain white pair of panties, grabbed her breasts and made a dash for it.  She didn't make it far before she was back in his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the main event here is clearly your ass,\" said Thatch, removing her last scrap of modesty and turning her over under a magnifying glass.  \"My compliments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire and Jinx looked at each other, then took off running in opposite directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[i]No![/i]\" Jinx screamed as she was caught by the hem of her skirt.  This garment was quickly pulled up over her head, leaving her naked and mysteriously purple body to double up on itself in mortification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, now underwear for Jinx?\" said Thatch, snapping a photo.  \"The forum's not going to believe that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast came Starfire.  He caught her again as she tried to fly through a closed window, then set to work on her tiny skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the body I'm most interested to see, no offence to your peers,\" said Thatch.  \"As an alien, just how close are you to humans?  I heard a rumor about sideways vaginas, but I'm pretty sure that guy was full of shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkirt, top, panties, bra... there was nothing Starfire could do to avert it.  Soon enough she was butt-nekkid in Thatch's hand as he took up his magnifying glass and nodded at her boobies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best breast award goes to this little lady,\" said Thatch.  \"I believe these officially qualify as 'tits'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThusly denuded, the three girls were deposited in some sort of hamster cage.</span></div></div>",

Someone has broken in and the alarm is going off!<br>\r\nRon is in the bathroom and can't go right now so Kim leaves without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrives and goes inside. She goes inside to find the female security guard is missing. Or she thought, the security guard is there, but, s-she is only the size of a doll!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stoops down to look at her. The guard steps back at the sight of a giant size Kim.<br>\r\n\"Stay, stay away from me!\", she told Kim.<br>\r\n\"Who did this to you?\", asked Kim as she tried not to frighten the little woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know, it was some woman in a green jumpsuit\", she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A green jumpsuit, why there could only mean...Shego!\", said Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was me!\", said a voice from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim turned to see Shego holding somekind of weird ray gun. Before Kim could say a word, Shego fired the ray gun. But before it could hit, Kim jumped out of the way. Shego fired again.<br>\r\nKim said, \"you can't hit me, I'm too fast for you. Give it up Shego and come with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim did the same and jumped before the ray made contact.<br>\r\n\"So, you want to make game out of it do you?\", said Shego as she tried a new trick. She pretended to fire to the right but didn't. she aimed to the left and fired. This time Kim jumped right into the beam!<br>\r\nThe green beam engulfed Kim and Kim began to shrink!<br>\r\nSlowly at first, but then faster! In no time she was the size of a doll! Kim stood in shock as Shego looked down at the diminutive Kim.<br>\r\n\"Well, well, Kim, it looks like I was fast enough and you're coming with me!\", said Shego as produced a birdcage.<br>\r\nShe opened her hand and started toward Kim. But as before, Kim jumped out of the way before Shego's hand could catch her!<br>\r\nNext Shego pulled a butterfly net from a bag she was carrying. Kim gulped. Shego started toward Kim with the net and as she jumped Shego easily caught Kim Possible.<br>\r\nShe held it up as Kim fought at it! With her hand, Shego reached in and pulled out a kicking and screaming miniature Kim Possible!<br>\r\n\"Let me go, put me down!\", screamed Kim as Shego held the prize she had been after.<br>\r\nQuickly she put Kim in a birdcage, then she scooped up the shrunken security guard and placed her in the cage as well.<br>\r\nShe held the cage up and admired her evenings work.<br>\r\nDrac is gonna love this when I show him what I did with the new shrink ray he developed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the net Shego easily caught Kim as she jumped</span></div></div>",

I can't believe there's a mini-mom..\" she was at his mercy now that Steve was curious, going silent as he pressed her into his chest with one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was slightly scared seeing him grab body wash from the side and open it- Closing her eyelids shut the freezing lavender soap poured over her body, she shuddered in fear as Steve started rubbing her hands over her. He would make her heavily soapy while rubbing between her ass and breast, Francine regrudgingly feeling high pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dick scared her when he held her body firmly, smiling wide as his thin six-inch sprung up. \"Please don't, Steve!\" He still held her firm, \"Why? This is so cool, I can help later!\" With Stan out it'd be difficult for her rescue, no luck for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she couldn't see a thing and felt Steve's cold-warm skin rushing over her, barely being pleasured while Steve had a fun-ass time. Trying not to squeeze her hard he rubbed her over his chest and neck, Francine yelling in the pain at the bending she did but he continued to use her to soap his back up.<br>\r\nThe water washed it off as he turned around, Francine trying to break the grip on her to have him just hold her somewhat tighter. He got <i>more</i> soap and she looked dreadful, sadly enough she got soaped up all again and his small laughs barely were heard over the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave up when he brought her down to his crotch, the warmth increased- then she felt his dicks vein press against her and his tip push on her head, Steve holding her against his dick and looking down lustfully. \"I hope this last for a bit..\" He slowly stroked her against it while increasing the grip,  Francine grabbing on tight so he wouldn't squeeze harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning quietly as he stroked slow, his speed would increase while she yelled in pain with him carelessly squishing her ribs. \"Oh.. my..\" his dick twitched against her and he moaned louder, suddenly yanking her down, her chest pressing against his rather softer genitals and relieved the pressure crushing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ajh-!\" His grip on her made her scream, Steve cumming into the shower stream which quickly went down the drain, Francine breathed heavily as he held her there, not so thrilled smelling her son's cum and body. The shower stopped with him holding her body in one hand, smiling at her wet body with her just staring angrily at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Boy, do I have a good idea! </i>\" she only got out \"Stop pl-\" before being dropped on a cloth, Steve's genitals took her vision and then her senses, the air becoming damp and the feeling wrinkly as she struggled against his mammoth weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve felt a rush of pleasure from her movements under him, thinking of what crazy things he could do to his look-alike-mom toy. Suddenly barely able to breathe as he put pants on, she fit under his nuts tightly and couldn't be outlined from it. This made her calm down as she had to preserve air, fearing that she could suffocate if not let out, now truly at his mercy, going to her needy son wasn't a good choice.</span></div></div>",

There was Tessa and Kaname, doll sized and naked as the day they were born. Kurz's lip soon curled into the giddiest grin his face could ever managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhistling, he said \"Wow, Captain, Kaname, you ladies sure look great today! Now, be honest, you did this just for me, didn't you? Yeah, it's too early to be my birthday, so that has to be it! You girls have the hots for me, don't you? Well, good for you for finally coming clean about how you feel about me! Especially you, Kaname. Finally ditched that clueless bonehead Souske for a real man like me, is that it? Don't worry, I'll promise him I'll take good care of both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer infamous temper hitting a boiling point, Kaname cried out \"You know damn well we'd never do anything like that for a jerk like you! Now, don't just stand there, you dumbass pervert, help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, that voice is friggin' hilarious! You sound like something from out of a damn Mickey Mouse cartoon! Hey, real quick, sing the theme song with me. C'mon! M-I-C, K-E-Y\" Kurz sang out, causing Kaname to growl and flip him off in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I wanted to grow you back, how in the world could I do that?\" Kurz asked, still leering at Kaname, who fumed and covered up her body. \"Sergeant Kurz.\" Tessa spoke in the voice she used to give orders, which sounded pretty silly in her current situation, given that her voice was tiny and high pitched, not to mention to fact that she was giving commands to someone more than 10 times her size while completely in the nude. \"We were put in this condition due to that ray gun. It's an experimental weapon meant to produce the effects that you currently see before you. If you look closely at the gun, you should find a reverse function on there meant to grow us back to normal size. At this time, set it on reverse and return us to our normal sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurz took a look at the gun, and indeed found the reverse function on it. Looking at it, he wondered: did he really want them to go back to normal size? Seeing the two girls naked and completely powerless before him was a dream come true! Now he has to end it so soon? Yeah, okay, the higher-ups in MITHRIL would have his head if they found out that he had taken advantage of them in a vulnerable state, but maybe, just maybe, he could keep it a secret from them? Yeah, he probably couldn't, but damn, they were so hot! He had to have some fun, right?  </span></div></div>",

Setting the gun to the reverse function, he aimed the gun and fired, holding down the trigger until the girl were back to normal. Back at their right sizes, both Tessa and Kaname breathed a sigh of relief. This moment of relief was cut short, however, by the realization that they were still completely naked. Blushing in embarrassment, Tessa and Kaname quickly grabbed the nearest source of coverage they could find (For Tessa, it was her old clothes, which were still lying in a heap on the floor after she shrunk herself. For Kaname, it was a nearby sheet) and ran to the bathrooms to change properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely alone in the empty room, Kurz just sighed. \"I can't believe I gave up on that chance! Ugh, I'm a damn idiot!\" he said in anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he noticed that the gun was still in his hand. \"Hmmm...\" he thought as he stared at the gun for a few moments. \"Should I give this back to the higher ups...

Not very eager to start the day off as a busty readhead, Ranma decided to first dry her clothes a little and then go look for some hot water. She sneezed and was probably going to get a cold in the near future.<br>\r\n\"Just my luck\", Ranma muttered. \"This day can't get any worse.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, but it can!\"<br>\r\nRanma recognized the voice and instantly dodged an attack from behind. It was Happosai, Ranma's self-proclaimed \"Master\", holding a strange brew-like bottle in his right hand and a jar in the other.<br>\r\n\"Seriously Old Freak, I don't have time for this! Go grope something in your own size!\"<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...just let me pour this little magical wonder on you and it will be exactly what I'll be doing\" said Happosai, pointing at his brew.<br>\r\nRanma did not really understand what Happosai meant by that, but she had no plans of being splashed by it anyway. Happosai immediately began to throw small doses of the strange brew towards her. Ranma tried to jump and dodge the best she could, and did so without problem thanks to the extremely agile body she possessed as a woman.<br>\r\n\"Curses! Stand still! Just for a second!\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Old Geezer? I thought you wanted to hit me with that?\" Ranma said giggling. At the same time she forgot about her surroundings for a second and jumped a little to high, hitting her head hard in the ceiling. Happosai saw an opening and splashed Ranma with the liquid. As they landed on the floor, Ranma felt her entire body start to tickle. Happosai watched the red-headed girl with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Ooow... w-what... what did you just hit me with?\"<br>\r\n\"Hoho! You will see in a second, Ranma dear!\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ranmas clothes felt bigger. They usually felt bigger when she turned from boy to girl, but this was something completely different. As time passed, the tickling became more and more stronger. The room looked bigger than before. Even Happosai looked awfully huge! Ranma finally understood what Happosai had meant.<br>\r\n\"You little... you're shrinking me!\", Ranma screamed, just before vanishing under a big pile of her Chinese clothes. Ranma could not believe it. She blushed, as she noticed she had become a naked 3 inch girl. Happosai let out a evil laugh and opened the jar, ready to capture his tiny student.</span></div></div>",

Her zanpaktou spirit explained that she will shrink once year and will remain shrunk for a week. Her zanpaktou also explains that she will possess the ability to shrink females by stinging them and only females, but they will shrink slowly within 3-4 hours to 8 percent of their height and will remain shrunken until Soi Fong\u2019s time is up. She can only use  Her zanpaktou will turn into a bracelet with green crystal on it. The females shinigami\u2019s zanpaktou will be gone during time and non shinigami\u2019s  special abilities will also be gone as well. The women\u2019s ability use their Reiryoku will be extremely difficult due to their reduced size and power, however, they will remain unaffected by spiritual pressure so they won\u2019t die due to very powerful presence. She   was lucky that Retsu Unohana was there there when it happened. Soi Fong\u2019s will still be able to tap her power even though her power would be reduced to 1/10 while the  other women\u2019s power  would evenly be reduced  or sealed to that of an average shrunken low ranking seated member.  She can only use her shrinking sting 2-3 times will require 8-20 hours for her power to completely  recover and during that time her power may reduce to below that of a shrunken low ranking seated member. Her crystal would turn yellow when after turn yellow after 1st sting and will turn red which will indicate that she won\u2019t be able use it again 8-20 hours before it turns green.  The bracelet gathers the energy for her while her power is reduced to below that of a shrunken average low ranking seating member and won\u2019t regain her 1/10 power until it turns green . Plus she won\u2019t be able to basic shinigami abilities after first shrinking sting and her power won\u2019t completely recover until her 2nd or 3rd sting, so she has strength for power after her   1st sting. The head captain is aware of this and several women were aware of this, but the men were left out of this beside the head captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head captain would allow Soi Fong and some or several women to take a break for 1 week or a month. The women\u2019s association would sometime use her ability to take pictures of girls in their reduced size for fun and for money. Some will use it for sexual pleasure or fun. They have used 1 or 3 photos order to make ads, placed on calendars, and other products, since they don\u2019t want to make it suspicious if there many photos of small women. Rangiku wanted to sell a whole bunch of photos, but Retsu said the men will suspicious of their activities. The girls even made short films. Soi Fong refused to have her photos placed on any product, but she does get does get 1/5 of the profit that woman\u2019s association make due to her ability.  She doesn\u2019t want filmed. She doesn\u2019t want her pictures nude or any ecchi picture. Soi Fong  would wear something plain or wear  her uniform. She also refuses to be partaking in pleasure activity which Retsu prevented anybody from taking too much advantage over Soi Fong and everyone knows that she can very scary and not to be messed with. Retsu was the only member that she had never used her shrinking sting on. Soi Fong did wonder if she could use her ability on Yoruichi who doesn\u2019t know about her ability.

Chisa was confused by the lack of a proper label, but it WAS the ink she was supposed to, so she carried it slowly but assuringly and headed for the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for poor Chisa, she tripped and spilled the ink all over her body. Then the girl felt funny all around her body...she looked at the nearby tables and noticed everything getting bigger and bigger. Chisa picked up what little ink was left in the container and slowly headed for the printer, but the girl noticed the container was almost the size of herself now! A few seconds later it was even bigger than the girl, and Chisa slipped once again on the ground, dropping what little ink was left on her body. The girl, barely a foot tall, proceeded to shrink even more to a height of only 6 inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" a worried Chisa cried frustratingly, afraid of not only being smaller, but now she wouldn't even get the printing job finished on time!

Oh, Chisa's in trouble now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chisa began to cry, she heard loud footsteps on the ground. She then looked in front of her to see what was causing them..it was Kazuki! The girl furiously waved on the ground to him to get his attention, and fortunately he did. But Kazuki, needless to say, was very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chisa??\" was the first thing that came out of his mouth, slipping on the ink himself and letting straight flat on his stomach, now seeing the girl better with his head on the ground. \"What happened?? Why are you so tiny!? Am I dreaming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChisa was having a hard time trying to talk to Kazuki. She tried to explain what happened through hand gestures, and occasionally tried to speak to the boy, but notihg came out of her mouth.

Before doing that, though, he asked Chisa if he wanted to wash her clothes for her. The girl shook her head left and right, and Kazuki proceeded to get cleaning utensils to clean up the ink spill. Just then Chisa's cell phone began to ring! It was in her purse, located on the other side of the table. Chisa quickly ran up to the phone and was successfull in getting the call through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my special edition manga!?\" the voice blurted out, annoyed. \"Youonly have 3 hours left to deliver my shipment, or I'll be really disappointed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh\", squeaked Chisa. \"I know that voice.

Kazuki, trusting Yuu, allowed her to scoop up the tiny Chisa in her hands, but the tiny girl lay quite the death grip on Yuu's fingers as she did so. Slowly Yuu lifted Chisa near her face, allowing her to get a better look at the 6 inch-tall girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's sooooo cuuuuuuute\", Yuu said in a cheerful, sing-song type of voice, pressing the tiny girl into her face. \"Can I keep her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", bluntly replied Kazuki, with Chisa giving a thankful, \"thank goodness\" type of sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you use what caused it?\" asked Yuu, placing Chisa on top of her own right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might have something to do with the ink\", Chisa said, her tiny voice barely getting to Kazuki, but rang loud and clear to Yuu. \"When it spilled on me, it made me shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you bought it in Akihabara. Was it from a store?\" Kazuki asked Chisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. A vendor. It was a special sale, and I thought to myself, 'If Chisa can save her family money, she'll do so.' And so I ended up taking 10 gallons or so hope with me in my arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BY YOURSELF!?\" asked a shocked Kazuki and Yuu, both at once. Chisa nodded her head up and down in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we just have to find that vendor\", Yuu said to Kazuki, walking back inside and to the area where Chisa dropped the ink, Kazuki not too far behind her. \"I'll go see if there's any proof near the ink..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inagawa-san!! Don't go in there!!\" a worried Chisa tried to explain to Yuu, but it was too little, too late. Yuu accidentally slipped on top of the special ink and fell flat on her butt. The fall parachuted Chisa into the air, who was then rescued quite quickly by Kazuki. The duo looked in shock and horror as Yuu slowly began to shrink in size, though at the moment she could only notice the stains of ink on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man!\", Yuu moaned, standing up from the fall, covered in ink all over the place. \"Hey Chisa, do you have some tow...\" Yuu proceeded to stop right there when she saw the taller Kazuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuki! When did you get so tall?\" Yuu asked in a worried tone of voice, unaware that she had just then shrunk to 3 feet in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inagawa-san, Kazuki-san didn't grow! You're shrinking!!\" Chisa yelled to her friend, who freaked out upon the news. Unfortunately for her, Yuu slipped again on the ink and started to shrink to an even smaller height of about 2 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! Everything looks so tall now..\" Yuu said to herself as she saw the machinery around the printing area. \"By the time I'll be be done shrinking I won't be much taller than the comic books here..\" A few moments then passed as Yuu start the world growing even further still to her. She finally stopped at 6 inches, though she was still  little taller than Chisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to figure out what it said on the label\", Yuu said to herself, as Kazuki and Chisa watched her proceed 10 feet in front of them, which was the size of a football field to Yuu. She carefully read the label and noticed something quite shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ink is from Eimi!!\" Yuu yelled. \"I bet this was a set-up to get me out of the way! She wanted to use the fumes of the ink to shrink me and get rid of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How terrible\", Chisa said, shocked by the deed that Eimi done. \"We have to find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do\", a confident Yuu said in agreement, placing her left hand on her chest. \"In the name of all that is good in doujin. Kazuki, go call Eimi up right now. You know her number, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use my phone, Kazuki\", Chisa chimed in, pointing to her cell phone on a nearby table. \"Her number's on speed dial.\" Kazuki quickly through the menus of Chisa's cell phone, a Samsung phone with a decent amount of features to its name, including camera, the ability to store 100 names and phone numbers, and other features. He quickly found Eimi's number and pressed the button. He waited anxiously for a reply when he heard Eimi's voice. But was it Eimi herself, or her voice message?</span></div></div>",

May also looked down at her skirt, stockings, and shoes and noticed they were getting bigger! May quickly put two and two together and realized that the virus was making her shrink. After another 15 seconds of struggling, May got her charger plug out from the computer.  The plug did not shrink with the little maid, so she had to tug on it with all her might to take it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she pulled her charger plug from the computer, May decided to compare her tinier height with a naerby inch ruler.

The hungry college student decided to head back to her place to heat up some leftovers she had from the day before. Either that, or order some pizza or something. Fortunately it was a walkable distance and after only 20 minutes Lei Fang was back in her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked into her dorm she saw that she had one new message on her answering machine. She decided to let it play and heard a familiar voice: it was Hitomi. The girl sounded like she was warning her about something, but Lei Fang was currently changing into different clothes. As she changed, she felt odd...like her clothes were growing. She then looked in the rest of her drawers, and noticed that not only did her clothes get bigger, but so was the distance from her hands to the drawers. Lei Fang quickly put two and two together and noticed she was shrinking! She quickly ran to her phone, now barely over 3 feet tall, and replayed the message she heard before. The message from Hitomi told her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lei Fang, this is Hitomi! I heard about your accident at work, and I have to warn you about those potions that spilled on you. They're shrinking potions! The man who runs the shop says he knows a way to fix your height, so call me when you get home. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the call, the shrinking Lei Fang, now barely over two feet high, grabbed her phone after struggling to climb up to the table it was on to get it. By the time she started dialing Hitomi's phone she was already shrinking even more, now barely over a foot tall. Fortunately Hitomi answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hitomi!?\" shouted Lei Fang on the phone. \"It's me, Lei Fang! I got your call as soon as I could! Please come over to my place as soon as possible!\" The shrinking college student waited for a response from her friend, but only heard chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Lei Fang\", Hitomi replied, still laughing a little. \"But you sound so funny at your height. I'll be right over!\" With that, Lei Fang lifted the phone up with both of her hands and placed it back on the hook. She then slowly climbed down the table, to where she reached her final spurt of shrinking, now 6 inches tall. Unfortunately the clothes she had on did not shrink with her, but Lei Fang was more worried over whether Hitomi would arrive soon enough. Would she?</span></div></div>",

That fact was comforting to her somewhat, but it wasn't enough to take her mind off of what had just happened to her. She glanced down at the capsule in her still shrinking hand and remembered how she had gotten it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a week ago at the Delta Red's base, when Cammy and the team had learned of Bison's movements and recent evil-doings in the world. Hearing of her long time nemesis made Cammy want to fight him right away, and the team agreed to set up plans to take down Bison and his gang once and for all.<br>\r\nCammy got ready to take off for the fight, but the team's resident computer expert/scientist stopped her just before she left. He told her of a newly developed drug that would enhance any fighters latent fighting skill tenfold, and also boost their overall strength as well. Cammy was, of course, eager to try it herself. So she took several capsules of it with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her assault on Bison's new base, Cammy used the capsules, to great success. They had worked perfectly, making Cammy ten times the fighter she already was, and making it easy for her to put Bison's forces to shame. But she soon noticed that the effect only lasted for a few short minutes. Cammy wasn't too worried about that little side-effect though, she had plenty capsules to spare and there were no other negative side-effects that she could see. So she kept using them to keep up the fight, until she ran down to her last capsule. Cammy tucked it away for later, thinking to save it for her big fight with Bison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the rest of her fights had been easy enough for the accomplished woman. That is, until she came face-to-face with Bison himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, having been forced to use her last trump card after a long battle with Bison, and only to have it backfire on her immensely. Cammy was rightly scared of being captured, or worse! She watched in fear as her long-time foe steadily grew before her, appearing to become bigger and stronger, while she got smaller and weaker. The process stopped a moment later, leaving the shrunken Cammy at only 3 inches tall. She'd now have a hard time fighting just one of Bison's fingers, let alone the man himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I've given you time to realize your mistake of coming against me, you must understand that you will never defeat me.\" Bison taunted her. Oh how Cammy wished she could just knock that smirk of his face right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, back off if you think this is all it'll take to bring me down!\" Cammy shouted. But to her surprise, her voice came out more like a high-pitched squeak. The British woman felt her face turn a little red from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBison just laughed. \"You see, Cammy. I knew of your little capsules beforehand, and have spent time adjusting my psycho powers accordingly. And, thanks to the little 'kick' that your capsules have in them, it, combined with my psycho powers, was enough to pull off this little move!\" Bison explained. He moved closer to her. \"I've told you before I have no use for you... but now that I think about it, there may a use for you in your new state after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment made Cammy sick, she could only imagine what Bison and his thugs would do to her at her reduced size. But Cammy didn't have long to think about it, as Bison suddenly reached down for Cammy, his huge form moved so fast the tiny woman barely had time to react. Cammy...</span></div></div>",

Bison was a little surprised that the shrunken Cammy still had any fight left in her, and it took him a moment before he tried to grab her tiny form again. But it was too late, as Cammy had already dashed down the side of the wall and was making her escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy ran as fast as her tiny legs could carry her. She was thankful her shrinking hadn't reduced her body's athletic capabilities out of proportion, so moving with at her shrunken size was just as easy as when she was normal sized.<br>\r\nAs Cammy ran, she knew in the back of her mind that she'd not make it out of Bison's grasp without a plan. It was then that she noticed a, quite conveniently placed air duct on the wall just ahead. It was open, thankfully, and low enough that Cammy could jump into it. So when the three-inch high Cammy came close enough, that was just what she did. She felt Bison's hand knick her as she just barely made it into the duct in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse you, Cammy!\" Bison shouted, his psycho powers flaring up around his body. \"I will get you! You'll never make it out of this base!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy smiled as she pulled herself up into the duct, glad to be away from the psycho, and also taking a little pleasure in making him so angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's the little things.</i> Cammy thought. But then winced as she realized the implications of that thought. She shook it off then fixed her beret on her head, it slipped off a bit when she jumped. Touching it now, it made her feel a little more safe to have it still fit her at her new size. <i>Well, whatever. It's time to get out of here... but, oh my...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy's surprise came when she finally got a good look at the inside of the ducts. It was dark and, even at her shrunken size, tightly cramped. Cammy had to crawl around in the ducts, as she did she found things were worse than that. The duct Cammy was in wasn't just a single straight tunnel, no, there were many turns the shrunken blond had to make as she made her way through the ducts. She felt like a mouse in some kind of test maze, it was humiliating, to say the least. All she wanted right now was to get out of this place and back to her team, hopefully they'd find a way to restore her to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wish was granted when Cammy finally made it to the exit of the duct. Luckily for her the exit wasn't sealed off with anything, so it was just a matter of crawling the last foot or so to her freedom. Once Cammy was out, she found that she was...</span></div></div>",

She was banking on escaping through the vents, but it seemed that plan was now sunk. Although being trapped in enemy territory wasn't exactly a new situation for Cammy, but being trapped in enemy territory at only 3 inches tall? That made Cammy worry.<br>\r\nBut she was trapped, so she had to think of a new strategy now. Being only 3 inches tall made her vulnerable, but also hard to spot, and Cammy knew using this to her advantage was the way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking her head out of the vents, Cammy saw that the room wasn't as large as where she had fought Bison, it was more of a hallway. She was grateful that the vents hadn't looped around and lead her right back to her hated enemy. But she knew Bison wasn't going to let her go so easily, and she then noticed a camera on the ceiling, pointing right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bison's probably watching the exits. He's probably watching me right now!\" Cammy muttered to herself. She thought Bison might show up any moment to grab her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Cammy through caution to the wind and leapt down and out of the vent tunnel, a small jump at her size. Cammy ran along the walls of the hall when she noticed that the camera on the ceiling was following her, thus confirming her suspicions.<br>\r\nShe also thought that this area of the base didn't look familiar to her at all, she hadn't passed through it when she stormed in earlier. But Bison's base didn't connect to any other buildings, as far as she knew, so she thought she must still be in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also had to stay on guard. So far, Cammy had only been beating up Bison's lesser goons before, so running into a stronger opponent such as Vega or Balrog was a possibility here; one that she hoped to avoid, even being seen by a regular soldier could be deadly for the shrunken woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two doors on either side of the hallway, and eventually Cammy made it close to one of them. She didn't have anything to go on in this unknown area, so she had just picked one at random. But then she came to a problem, the handle was way too high for her to reach, she could never open the door at her size! Crawling under the door was an option either, as the door was too low to allow for even that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of these unfortunate circumstances, Cammy still made her way towards the door, hoping she'd find some way to get out of here by the time she made it over. Luck was on Cammy's side as the door started to open just as she made it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Cammy cheered. Now all she had to do was sneak past whoever it was coming in through the door...</span></div></div>",

The door opened and one of Bison's soldiers came in. No one that Cammy recognized, it must have just been one of his many \"nameless\" goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goon was alone, and from the way he passed right on through the hallway, he didn't seem to know about Cammy's reduction and escape from Bison. The tiny Cammy took the chance and snuck behind him, and ran through the doorway. The door slammed behind her just as she made it through, knocking a gust of air at the tiny Cammy that nearly threw her off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\" Cammy squeaked as she collected herself. \"Okay, that's done... Am I out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy looked around at the new room she was in and saw that she wasn't out of the woods just yet. She had entered another large room, this one was lab-like. There were lab desks and lab stools ordered throughout the room, they were very high up so even Cammy could see the beakers and other scientist stuff on top of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just what is Bison planning here</i>? Cammy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cammy walked further into the room she saw that it wasn't as empty as the other one, there were a few people in lab coats talking amongst themselves. They were far away enough that Cammy wasn't worried about being seen by them, but it still unnerved the shrunken woman to be this close to a normal sized person, especially ones that worked for Bison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy darted across the room and hid under one of the nearby stools. When she was sure she was safe, she took another look around the room, but with the desk in front of her blocking most of her view she couldn't see any exits, other than the way she just came. All she saw was the scientists, they were still quite a ways from her, but their conversation seemed to have just ended and one was coming her way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cammy could react, the giant sat down on the stool she was hiding under. The tiny fighter froze, hoping she hadn't been seen by him somehow. Seconds ticked by as she waited to be captured, but nothing happened. The scientist hadn't seen her after all. Cammy relaxed, and she thought that she was far too small to be seen so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that staying here would not be a good idea, Cammy got ready to move, hoping that the scientist wouldn't see her running along the floor. But the scientist's huge feet then started to move, and Cammy saw that this guy was shaking his feet, blocking her path!<br>\r\nCammy looked up, but couldn't see anything past the seat of the stool. She groaned. If this guy didn't stop shaking his feet, not only could she not escape from under the stool, he was liable to hit her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy knew she had to do something...</span></div></div>",

Her whole body ached, but she didn't have anything broken. Her legs ached the worst, they must've taken the brunt of the impact when she hit the desk. Cammy found when she stood that just walking around was hard to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... That bloody scientist..!\" Cammy groaned. \"I swear I'd knock his block off if I could! Agh! If only I wasn't so bloody small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy's revenge would have to wait though, and she knew it. So instead of plotting her revenge she tried to focus and regain her bearings. She had been knocked out, and she didn't know for how long. But she did see now that she was still in the same lab from before, under one of the many desks in the room. She exhaled in relief, she may be 3 inches tall, but she was glad that at least she wasn't in Bison's hands. Cammy started walking, more of a limp really, around the lab. Hopefully she'd find the exit somewhere around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Cammy could make any real progress, a huge pair of feet passed right by her, startling the shrunken woman, who froze in her tracks. Cammy looked up to see that it was one of Bison's men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Vega</i>!? Cammy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed Vega, the masked man was now a giant to the tiny blonde. He stopped several feet away from Cammy, and pulled out a handheld transceiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing here either, boss.\" Vega said. \"Another look around? Fine. But if find her, I'm keeping her!\" Vega hissed, and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy gulped as she heard the giant get angry. Vega was looking for her, that much was sure, and now he was saying he was going to keep her if he found her? Cammy couldn't bear to let that happen. So she ran, or rather, limped from the giant. She had gotten far from her cover of the desk, and now she just wanted to get back and hide until Vega left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she make it?</span></div></div>",

Dammit!\" Cammy screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide when she realized her mistake, and she covered her mouth to quiet herself. But it was too late, as she then heard a huge foot slam down behind her. Terrified, Cammy slowly turned around to see Vega's monstrous form looking down at her. The masked fighter never looked so threatening. She tried to get up and run away, but her legs wouldn't let her, and she could do nothing but watch on in horror as Vega's massive hand reached for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, finally.\" Vega said breathily, as if he had worked so hard to capture his tiny prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega laughed as he picked up the tiny blonde. The masked man was glad to be the one who found her. He knew he couldn't really keep her, like he threatened before, but he could still have some fun with her before turning her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cammy White.\" He started. Then slowly turned the tiny, defense woman over in his hand to check her out. \"You've always been one of the more, beautiful fighters in tournaments. Not as beautiful as myself, of course, but you're definitely no slouch. I can see why the boss wants you so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up! Do you find pleasure in taking advantage of a helpless woman!?\" Cammy shouted, and spat on Vega's hand. She was trying to keep up appearances of being tough, but it was hard to do when her body, and voice, were so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega had laughed at the tiny woman's cries, but then got angry and growled at her when she spat on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little puta!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega then spat down at the shrunken woman, but Cammy managed to avoid most of it. But Vega wasn't pleased with just that. Using his free hand, Vega buried Cammy's little hard in the area he had spat on, humiliating the tiny brit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like it!?\" Vega barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more seconds of torture, Vega let up on Cammy. He delivered a quick flick of his finger to her tiny body, making the 3 inch tall woman scream and recoil in pain, before finally letting her rest in his hand. Cammy's head hurt a lot afterwards, and she had to wipe the spit from her face, but it was her legs that still hurt the most, she rubbed them to ease some of the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hurt your legs?\" Vega asked. \"That's why you didn't run before, I thought it was strange. Ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega laughed at the pathetic sight of the one of the world's former top female fighters, now reduced to a mere plaything for him, as he thought of what to do with her next. While Cammy was in hell, being caught by this madman was worse than she imagined, and with her entire body reeling in pain, she couldn't do anything but wait and see what the masked man had in store for her next.</span></div></div>",

She landed into the soft space of his pants pocket. \"Ugh...\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy was miserable. As if being 3 inches tall wasn't bad enough, breaking her leg, being held captive by an evil man like Vega, covered in his spit, and kept in his pocket, made it all the worse for the shrunken woman. Cammy had half a mind to break down and cry, but she knew she couldn't give up just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy's ride wasn't a soft one, as her tiny body bounced and shook slightly with each step Vega took. The masked man had told her he was taking her to his room. Cammy wondered what he meant by that, had Bison and his gang built living spaces for themselves, and what did he plan to do with her once they reached his room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy shook her head, that wasn't the important part here, her mind was wandering from trying not to think of how much she hurt right now. What she needed to do was escape from Vega somehow. But at her size, and with her broken legs, it didn't seem very likely she would be able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo her legs were out, Cammy knew, but she still had her arms. She thought she could climb out of Vega's pocket and make her escape without him noticing. Grabbing onto the fabric of Vega's pants, Cammy pulled herself up. The tiny blonde found it to be rather easy, and her legs weren't so hurt that she couldn't use them, so she was able to use almost all her strength to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can do this!</i> Cammy assured herself in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a determined grin on her face, Cammy climbed higher and higher in Vega's pants pocket, until...</span></div></div>",

Slowly at first, until she saw that Vega was entering another building, the living quarters, Cammy assumed. Her giant captor was only a few yards from the building.

In almost an instant, her tiny 3 inch body landed roughly on the hard ground in the worst possible way, right on her already hurt legs. She yelled out in pain, but only for a moment before controlling herself, she couldn't risk having Vega hear her cries. She covered her mouth with her hands, as little tears started to well up in her eyes. She thought that if her legs hadn't been broken before, they were now, that's how badly her legs pained her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny woman lay there for a while as she tried to collect herself.

But out in the open, 3 inches tall and with her legs shot, she was far from safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Cammy only another moment before her fighter instincts kicked in and she started to pull herself away from the scene. There was a lot of grass nearby that Cammy thought would make for good cover at her size. So the shrunken woman slowly and excruciatingly moved into the tall grass, her legs aching all the while. But even so, something told her that she wouldn't be safe getting only a little bit away from the front door of the building, she knew she needed to go farther, in case Vega came looking for her. So she kept up her crawl, and moved further into the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of this, her body gave out, and she could go no further, and she passed out again.

The tiny woman sat down at the edge of the table, and then asked the giant before her hesitantly, \"What needs to be done to cure me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the tests we ran on you determined that it was Bison's powers that made you shrink in the first place, counteracting the strength increasing capsule I gave you.\" The scientist explained. \"You're not going to like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" Cammy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way you can ever be restored to your normal size again is if you get Bison to use his psycho powers on you again.\" The scientist explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Cammy shouted. The tiny woman got up and stomped her little foot on the table. \"Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, listen!\" The scientist tried to get Cammy to calm down. \"When we extracted you from Bison's base, we also picked up something on our radars. Bison's got a lab in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy remembered the lab, it was where she had been knocked out cold by a careless scientist - one that was much like the one in front of her right now. Cammy was intrigued to hear her scientist comrade bring it up. \"I was there. What about it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We noticed on your tracking device.\" The scientist said. \"Now, the lab appears to contain a capsule, much like the one I developed. But this capsule has the opposite effect of mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes you weaker?\" Cammy asked. The scientist nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes you weaker.\" He replied. \"We think Bison was trying to mass produce them to take down his many other enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that help me? I'm already weak enough!\" Cammy shouted, motioning to her tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. We believe that if Bison was to use his powers on you after you ingested this capsule, then the resulting effects would make you grow!\" The scientist explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Cammy asked, skeptical of this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're ninety-nine percent sure, so yes.\" The scientist stated confidently. \"But there's one other thing..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Cammy asked, shaking her head. She couldn't believe this plan would really work, but on the off chance that it did, she'd risk anything to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the capsules are in Bison's lab, you'll have to break into the base again.\" The scientist explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, maybe not anything...</i> Cammy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cammy found herself reluctantly agreeing to do the plan after her team explained it to her further. Since she was so small, Cammy would have to break into the base by herself, steal the capsule, and trick Bison into using his powers on her. The risk was huge, but the rewards, Cammy thought, were worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Cammy was prepped and ready to go back into Bison's base, 3 inches tall and all by herself. The tiny blond tried not to let it get to her, and focused instead on what her team had told her to do. She'd been given special equipment as well to make her mission easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Cammy found herself standing in front of Bison's base once again...</span></div></div>",

Nothing was set off when she touched the grate though, much to Cammy's relief, so the tiny brit pulled with all her strength to get the thing off. It was hard work, but Cammy managed to pull it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... That wasn't easy.\" Cammy said, breathing heavily after her little workout. She wiped the sweat from her brow. Then, she heard a short static sound coming from her earpiece, given to her before the mission started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in?\" The voice on the other line asked, it was Delta Red's scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm going in.\" Cammy said, sounding confident. \"I'll update you in a minute. Over and out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother short static noise buzzed in Cammy's ear, telling her that her teammate was off the line. She pushed the grate aside and crawled into the ducts.

Where, thankfully, there was no grate blocking her way in. She peeked her little head out of the duct to see that she was now in a hall. She ducked back into the duct and put her hand to her ear and called her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great work, Cammy!\" Delta Red's scientist congratulated her. \"You should be in a hallway now..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's a hall.\" Cammy told him. \"I'm looking at it right now. The lab's on the left, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Go left from there and the lab should be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Cammy replied. \"You know, not that I'm complaining, but couldn't you have given me some more of those power capsules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Cammy. But you used up all of the strength increasing capsules I made on your first mission to Bison's base.\" The scientist said. \"And we can't wait around to make any more, since we don't know if Bison will be on the move after your initial assault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I know.\" Cammy groaned. \"It would be nice to have some backup though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you already know why we can't offer you that.\" Her ally replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm going in further now. Wish me luck.\" Cammy told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\" The scientist replied. There was a short static sound, and the line went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy sighed, this was not a great plan. But she was already well into it, and doing well so far. So she pressed on wards into the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny woman made sure there wasn't anybody in the room before she jumped out of the ducts and onto the floor of the hall, where she started to run across it as fast as her tiny legs would allow her to. Above, there was a camera following her movements like before. Cammy was well aware of it, but hoped her speed would allow her to escape without incident. Then, as she ran, the tiny woman in the green leotard couldn't believe her luck when she saw the door to the lab was already open. It was like Bison wanted her to break in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have much further to go to get to the lab.</span></div></div>",

There weren't any scientists around this time, as far as she could see from her bugs-eye viewpoint, but since it was night she didn't think it was too odd.<br>\r\nCammy looked above herself and saw her target, the weakening capsule, kept held up by three prongs on one of the desks. Cammy ran under the desk, then called her support team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the lab.\" She stated. \"And I see the capsule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Cammy.\" Her ally congratulated her. \"You'll have to climb up one of the desks to get the capsule. Do you still have the equipment I gave you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm about to use it now.\" Cammy said. \"It's amazing you were able to make this thing so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well, thanks. I'll let you know how it goes.\" Cammy said and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy grabbed the secret item she'd been saving for just this moment, a miniature grappling hook, kept holstered on her back. The thing was just the right size for her to use, and it felt good as she tested it's weight for the coming toss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this works.\" Cammy said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed to grappling hook up to the top of the desk, and waited for a moment. She heard a \"click\" sound a moment later, confirming to her that the grappling hook had caught on the wooden surface above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Cammy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken fighter wasted no time now, she started to climb up the rope of the hook as quickly as possible. Luck had been on her side so far, and she wasn't about to blow it by being too slow now, near the end of her mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb wasn't tough at all for Cammy, her years of training had well prepared her for such things, and the 3 inch woman made the 2 feet high climb in mere minutes.

The shrunken woman knew she had made him mad, but now she felt confident that she could beat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega smashed his hands down on the desk Cammy was on, not even caring to see if he was hitting her or not in his rage.

She worried he might still have some fight left in him. But he stay lying on the floor, knocked out. Cammy waited a moment and made sure Vega was really down for the count before getting off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bigger they are...\" Cammy mused as she jumped off of the giant's unconscious form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, Cammy saw her earpiece and grapple hook gun not to far away. She ran over to her useful devices. She first tried the gun, but soon discovered that it wouldn't work no matter what she did, Vega had broken it in the fight. Next she put her earpiece on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Cammy. I took care of Vega.\" She spoke, and waited for a response. But she didn't get one. \"Is anyone there? Over?\" She asked. Again, no response. \"Great.\" Cammy groaned, taking the earpiece out and throwing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of her specially-made gadgets had been broken. She was now alone and without any helpful devices, just a tiny, 3 inch tall woman in the enemy's base. Cammy looked around, seeing Vega's unconscious body still just lying there. She grinned, thinking that while she may be small, she had managed to take out one of her worst enemies even with the incredible handicap. And she decided to continue with her mission and get that capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy rushed over to Vega's hand, where she expected to find the capsule, but his hand was closed. So she had to pry open his huge fingers to get it. But even that wasn't enough, as they'd just go back to their resting position when she dropped them. She could see the capsule inside though, and so she just knew she had to get it out of Vega's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy quickly devised a different strategy. This time crouching down in front of the giant hand and lifting up the huge fingers with her whole 3 inch tall body, similar to how she'd lifted weights before. To her delight, it worked, and she simply reached in and pulled out the rather large capsule while keeping the weight above her held up with her other hand. Cammy panted and mustered up all her strength to throw the capsule out of Vega's grasp and onto the floor nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy jumped back and took a rest, breathing heavily, as Vega's hand closed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this just to get something that'll make me weaker!\" Cammy panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Cammy recovered a few minutes later, she went over to the weakening capsule. It was huge by her size, but she knew she didn't have to ingest the whole thing, only a little would do the trick. Or so she was told by her team before the mission started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the tiny fighter a good amount of her strength to pull the capsule apart, it spilled its contents on the floor when she did. Cammy bent down and picked up a handful of the stuff. She took a moment to look at it, and to brace herself for what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This better not make me so weak I can't even move...</i> Cammy thought grimly as sweat started to form on her brow. But she had to shake such thoughts from her mind, now or never, as it were. So before she could convince herself further that it was a bad idea, Cammy took the handful of the stuff and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy felt the effects of it take hold immediately...</span></div></div>",

A horrible side-effect of the capsule, that neither she nor her team could have predicted. The already tiny fighter got even tinier, reducing in size until she was only a single inch tall. Cammy was horrified by the transformation, by her point of view she had just lost two-thirds of what little height she had left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, her well-defined muscles were reduced as well. Making the formally tightly toned woman look less like a fighter, and more like someone who'd never worked out a day in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy lamented the loss of the tiny amount of strength and size she had left, and the now even smaller woman felt like crying. But she held back when she heard the door to the lab slam shut. She shot up and looked behind her. Her heart sunk when she saw Bison standing there, eyeing her tinier form menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, B-Bison!\" She squeaked. In the back of mind she knew the mission was to trick Bison into using his psycho powers on her while in her weakened state, but looking at the giant now, Cammy wasn't sure it was going to work. Her mind panicked, and she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah. Not this time, little mouse.\" Bison said. He used his psycho powers then, but not on Cammy, instead he used his strange teleportation move to appear right in front of the tiny woman. Cammy gulped, and quickly turned around to run the other way. But it was no use, Bison was too fast, he picked up the inch tall Cammy effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice of you to deliver yourself back to me. Cammy.\" Bison chuckled, looking Cammy's smaller form over in his hand. \"You were always a disappointment. But now, I think you're better suited for being my personal little pet. A trophy, if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy growled at the giant, but this only amused Bison further. He took a step over Vega's unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you managed to defeat Vega. No matter, he served his purpose.\" Bison said, and then delivered a deft kick to his subordinate. \"And he thought he could have you all for himself. Well, my little pet, you don't have to worry about that now.\" Bison laughed, and walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy knew that however bad Vega was to her, he most likely wouldn't kill her. But Bison didn't seem to have any qualms about that, provided she stayed on his good side she hoped he wouldn't resort to it. But as Bison walked closer to the door, Cammy's hopes of escape got further away from her. She started to sniffle, she couldn't help herself, the thought of being the tiny slave of this madman was mortifying enough, and she was so close to having to live it...</span></div></div>",

The door was burst open, and footsteps could be heard as someone stepped in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, Bison!\" A male voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Bison said, turning around to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was none other than Cammy's radio support, Delta Red's lead scientist himself! He was alone, but not without help. The scientist looked nervous as he held up his pistol, aimed at Bison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let Cammy go!\" He shouted, his hands shaking on his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here!?\" Cammy squeaked, not sure if her voice could carry to her ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. A friend of yours?\" Bison asked the tiny woman in his grip. Cammy was too shocked by this turn of events to reply, not that it mattered. \"You want her? What are you going to do to get her?\" Bison asked smugly, and took a step towards Cammy's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back! I will shoot!\" The scientist shouted, gripping his pistol tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist was afraid at this point in time, but he had to do something to save Cammy. After communications with her went down, he insisted on going in to save her, but the rest of the team told him to wait a little longer. Now, with his shrunken friend and Bison in his sights, he knew he made the right choice. But he was all alone, and there wasn't time to call for backup. He wondered what he could really do to save Cammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy couldn't believe this was happening, but she was happy that her team hadn't given up on her yet, she hoped the scientist could pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBison, meanwhile, wasn't taking the scientist's threats seriously though, and instead kept walking towards him slowly...</span></div></div>",

Bison took the bullet in his hand, literally, as he used his psycho powers to catch it in midair. The scientist gasped at seeing Bison's power in action. The evil man's eyes flickered as he 'shot' the bullet back at the scientist, hitting him in his right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAGHH!\" The scientist screamed out in pain, and clutched his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought you could best me? Ha ha ha!\" Bison taunted. He walked over to his newest victim and grabbed him by his shirt collar. Forgotten for a moment, Cammy was dropped to the floor. Then Bison made his move and punched the scientist in the stomach, and then tossed him to the floor again. \"What a joke.\" Bison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy recovered on the floor quickly enough in time to see her ally get beat. She winced as she watched the scene. Bison was going to kill the man if she didn't do something, but at her smaller and weaker state, what could she do?</span></div></div>",

So she threw caution to the wind and ran over to the giant of an ally. She immediately noticed how much slower she was now that her muscles were gone, but she adjusted quickly and climbed up her ally, hoping her gambit payed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bison was pummeling the poor man. The scientist was nearly unconscious by the time Bison stopped and noticed a tiny, speck of a woman ran up the scientist. He got down next to her, making the inch tall fighter stop in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Cammy. I haven't forgotten about you.\" Bison said. He stood back up. \"Wait a minute for me to finish this fool off, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBison raised his arm up and, using his psycho powers, lifted up a nearby stool as well. The object glowed with Bison's psycho powers. Bison thrust his arm forward and the stool followed suit, slamming into the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..\" The scientist moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're worthy to be killed by my hand. So I'll just use this to end you slowly.\" Bison said. He hit the scientist with his 'weapon' once more, then again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cammy watched the scene unfold form her position on her ally's leg, she felt bad for her friend, but knew that if she were to be hit by Bison's psycho power controlled 'weapon', the plan would work at last! Cammy started to climb her ally's body again. Her idea was risky, and she might get seriously injured or worse, but it was the only way she was going to get Bison to use his psycho powers on her again. Cammy just hoped she could make it there in time!</span></div></div>",

Agh!\" The scientist's cries sounded more blood-curling as Bison's relentless attacks continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy was currently climbing her way up to the point of impact, hoping to stay unseen by Bison as she climbed higher. So far he hadn't seemed to notice her, but his constant blows to her larger ally was making her climbing hard to do. Cammy pressed on though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBison slammed the stool into the scientist one more time, this time making his victim cough up some blood. He laughed and stopped his assault, holding the stool in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must see now that nobody can defeat me.\" Bison told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What about me!\" Cammy squeaked. She was just inches, by her view, away from the stool now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cammy!? What are you doing!?\" Bison shouted, his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy smirked and jumped on top of the psycho powered stool. Instantly she felt the psycho powers effect her body, and, much to her relief, she started to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Cammy cheered as her body stretched higher and higher, until the british woman, and her signature costume, reached her normal height at last. \"Yes!\" She repeated, overjoyed to have her plan work, and to finally be returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?!\" Bison shouted, looking rather shocked by this turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy grinned and turned to face her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't even know the extent of your powers? How pitiful.\" She said. \"Let me show you mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy rushed Bison, and delivered blow after blow to the villain. Taken off guard for perhaps the first time in his life, Bison could do nothing to defend himself from Cammy's quick attacks. In no time at all, Bison was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I beat Bison!\" Cammy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You did it...!\" She heard her scientist friend and ally say. Cammy turned around and saw the brutal damage Bison had done to him, she rushed to his aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god... I'm so sorry this happened to you.\" Cammy said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..\" The scientist coughed up a bit of blood. \"I-It was worth it..\" He sounded like he was going to say something more, but passed out from his wounds before he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few days later in Delta Red's base, when things had finally calmed down. Cammy and the scientist were talking in his lab. Cammy sitting on a stool, and the scientist in a wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Cammy. That was some week, huh?\" The scientist asked. He had recovered from his wounds, thanks to Cammy's efforts, she had dragged his unconscious body out of the base by herself, normally she'd have just carried the man, but with the weakening capsule still affecting her, that was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, don't remind me.\" Cammy groaned. \"I just wanted to check up on you and see how you're doing. I don't need to be reminded of the time I was little more than a bug crawling on you!\" Cammy laughed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I'm fine, I'll have you know! The doctors tell me I'll be back on my feet in a few weeks.\" The scientist replied fast. He paused, and looked up at Cammy from his wheelchair. \"You know, you're a lot more scary when you're big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, am I?\" Cammy asked. She stood up to her full height, which after getting back to the base, she found out was actually 2 inches shorter than normal. Her lost height an effect of the weakening capsule. \"I'm not as big as I used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. That can't be helped. But...\" The scientist said, touching Cammy's arm, as if to examine it. \"This can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Cammy sighed. Ever since she took the weakening capsule, it's effects hadn't worn off. Her team told her that she'd never get back her lost height, but that if she worked out like she had before she shrank, her muscles should return. So far, no progress there, but Cammy wasn't giving up. \"I just wish that capsule didn't have permanent effects!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't stand being a little smaller?\" The scientist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don't like it!\" Cammy replied with a pout. After a moment, she relented, and smiled at her ally. \"But you know, I'm just glad we both made it out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy then looked puzzled about something. \"But I wonder, why didn't Bison know that his powers would counteract the weakening capsule and make me grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" The scientist started with some hesitation. \"We didn't really know if it would work either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Cammy shouted. \"I lost two inches because of you! Not to mention my poor muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. It was an educated guess though, if that makes you feel any better.\" The scientist replied meekly, shrinking into his wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, don't think you're getting off that easy!\" Cammy shouted. She wasn't too upset though, things had worked out in the end after all, but she'd give her team hell for lying to her!</span></div></div>",

Shortly thereafter she saw the green materia shine once again and felt the tingling sensation within her body and moaned from it. After the transformation she noticed that she was lying in Aerith\u2019s palm, and everything was just so big. Tifa was at the moment not taller than 2,5 inches. Yuffies size was probably not even measurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith poked and rubbed one of Tifa\u2019s breasts with her finger and giggled. The femme fatale martial artist blushed and tried to cover her treasures the best she could.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my! So huge but still so tiny\u2026what irony, eh Tifa?\u201d<br>\r\nThe flower girl started moving her hand down towards her lower parts. Seconds later Tifa was facing the biggest gates of flesh she had ever seen. She felt scared and even ashamed for putting Yuffie in her own vagina. Aerith took her other hand and started opening the gates with two fingers, thus revealing her cave for Tifa.<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck Tifa. Please make it comfortable in there\u2026 for both me and you\u201d said Aerith and smiled. Shortly after that, the flower girl started to push Tifa into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa screamed of panic at first, but it was later replaced with moans. It was so amazing. The walls and fluids of Aerith\u2019s vagina was touching Tifa\u2019s body almost everywhere as she entered her \u201cfriends\u201d most sacred zone. With Yuffie moving within her own vagina as well, it was a pleasure beyond imagination. So tight, warm, dangerous and erotic \u2013 all at the same time. She was indeed afraid, but at the same time Tifa was having the time of her life. The pleasure of being fondled everywhere was just amazing, and being this tiny was a turn-on too.

She remembered what had happened before and looked down to see herself nude rather than in possession of little Aerith. She looked around again, thinking Aerith had turned the tables back on her, but became aware of the jar she was in and the other jar beside it. \"Aerith, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith slumped against the wall of her jar, \"You shrank me, you $@!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud interrupted, \"And she came to steal my Transform materia in turn.

As far as Tifa knew, Transform Materia would also shrink clothes, which meant Cloud had removed hers at some point. Seeing her childhood friend and secret love interest as tall as a giant staring down on her was very embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...what do you mean Cloud? Stop toying with us and grow us back to normal! And give me back my clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about your clothes. I think you have to find new ones, so I'll just leave you like that for the time being. You two need to cool off. Besides, you're both kind of cute in your tiny forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was suddenly interrupted. Someone was calling for Cloud outside the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I better go check what's going on. You girls stay here. Try to behave nicely now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Aerith and Tifa tried to protest, but Cloud was already on his way. As he left the tent, a silence fell over the room. After a while, one of the girls stood up and walked over to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerith...\" Tifa started, facing the flower-girl's back. \"I'm sorry it turned out this way. I never meant to mistreat you or make you angry. You appeared tired and I only wanted to take care of you for a while. I was going to turn you back, promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm sorry too. I guess shrinking and becoming tiny got the better of me. I overreacted due to the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being naked the girls hugged each other, leaving all grudges behind them. Tifa felt relieved. Aerith was her friend after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so Cloud wants us to remain small and toy with us. We're not exactly helpless little girls, so we'll see about that.\" Tifa said with sudden confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, easier said than done now that he put the Transform Materias in jars!

Aerith held on to the jar tightly as Tifa held on to lid and walked around the jar, effectively twisting the lid off. In no time at all, their efforts paid off and the jar was open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it!\" Aerith cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Tifa said happily, joining her friend in her cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tifa and Aerith saw their next problem, the jars were a little bit bigger than they were! Getting inside to get the materia would require some effort. Luckily, the tiny girls happened to be on the same page at the moment, and came up with a solution. The shrunken women both pushed the jar with all their strength and caused it to topple over onto its side, knocking the lid off and allowing them to get the materia easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa ran over to the opening of the jar. \"I'll go and get it!\" She said, and crawled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa made it to the materia, but noticed something strange about it. It looked like there were small cracks in materia. Tifa hefted up the large, to her at least, sphere and took a moment to look it over. The cracks were more evident now, and Tifa wondered if that would have any effect on the spell it cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the jar, Aerith heard loud footsteps coming towards Cloud's tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry! Cloud's coming back!\" Aerith whispered with urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!\" yelled Tifa, the shrunken fighter returning her thoughts to the more immediate situation at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa crawled out of the jar as fast as she could.

They were love rivals after all, fighting for the same guy that had left them stuck in tiny form on the table. Then again, Tifa had apologized for her behavior at the lake and both had made peace with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't mind.\" Aerith said, choosing to put trust in Tifa. \"You better hurry and use it before Cloud comes back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa nodded as a sign of gratitude.

I don't want to crush you, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe materia started to swirl with energies as the tiny martial artist activated its powers. She closed her eyes when it began emitting a light almost as bright as the sun. Tifa once again felt a familiar tingling sensation rushing through her body, from her feet all the way up to her finger tips. She gasped as transformation began and within seconds it was all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I did it!\" Tifa said, feeling dizzy and somewhat weak in her legs. She almost lost her balance and quickly sat down on her butt in order to rest for a moment. At the same time, she tried to find Aerith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerith? Are you down there? I hope I didn't land on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...oh my... No, I'm up here...\" a powerful voice said in response. Strangely enough it was coming from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa turned her head to the skies. Behind her stood a towering figure. A giantess that was none other than Aerith. Somehow the materia had shrunk Tifa even more, instead of making her grow big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith, overly protective by nature, got down on her knees and carefully grabbed Tifa by the waist. She then moved her to the palm of her right hand. The brown-haired flower-girl was more like a flower-goddess now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Tifa. I don't know what happened, but it seems that something went terribly wrong. I think the materia broke somehow!\" Aerith said with a worried voice, not knowing what this would lead to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa felt embarrassed. For a girl relying so much on strength and brute force, being only a few millimeters tall was a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Darn it! I don't want to be like this! Oh well, I guess it's up to you now Aerith. There's still one Transform Materia le... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was suddenly interrupted when she and Aerith felt small tremors through the table. Cloud was most likely on his way back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In less than 30 minutes, she had gone from one of the world's most powerful martial artists to nothing more than a helpless speck, not even big as an insect, and these vibrations felt almost like an Earthquake. It was simply too much of an experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both girls could hear footsteps coming closer from outside the tent, Aerith didn't hesitate to act. The tiny flower girl quickly closed her grip around her tinier friend. \"Don't worry Tifa, I got you!\" she said with a firm voice. There was no longer time to try open the second jar, especially when the strongest of the two had become more or less powerless. Instead, Aerith quickly scouted her surroundings on the table for a good place to hide. Whatever Cloud was up to, it was no longer funny, and she had a bad feeling about this whole situation. Why would Cloud even toy with them like this, and even ruin Tifa's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table in Cloud's tent was full of items - everything from a small pouch to Tifa's massive sports shirt that he had brought back as a trophy. Having spent most of her life running from both Shinra and the Turks, as well as hiding at various spontaneous locations, Aerith had plenty of experience for a situation like this. She drew the conclusion that both the shirt and the pouch seemed like too obvious spots. Instead, she set course for a group potions and phoenix downs at the far end of the table, which was on the opposite side of where the jars were. Just as she managed to slip in between some vials, the giant ex-SOLDIER member entered the tent once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's see how you have...\" he said, suddenly stopping mid-sentence as he discovered both of them were gone. Aerith couldn't resist peeking a bit, trying to catch a glimpse of Cloud's reaction. To her surprise, he seemed rather surprised himself, like he had expected them to fail the challenge he had provided them with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" a tiny voice asked. It was Tifa, standing on all four in the palm of Aerith's hand while doing her best to cover her most intimate parts. The black-haired Avalanche member had seen better days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Cloud. He's back and he seems to be looking for us,\" the flower girl replied. \"I don't like this Tifa.

Staying hidden sounded as good an idea as any, especially right now when they had a giant searching for them to do who-knows-what to. The terribly tiny Tifa wished again that her materia had worked properly earlier and returned her to her full height, but unfortunately she was stuck feeling pretty much less than useless in the hands of her bigger(but still shrunken) friend Aerith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith watched Cloud's movements from behind one of the vials on the table. It was frightening to watch someone so huge and powerful scour the place for any signs of her or Tifa, but somehow Aerith wasn't all too worried. After all, Aerith was still quite sure she had not done anything wrong in this situation. As far as going around and shrinking other people without their knowledge or permission, unlike Tifa and Cloud had done. Sure, Aerith and Tifa had buried the hatchet by now, but Cloud was still without forgiveness, or any reason for her or Tifa to forgive him. Perhaps he was due to spending some time at finger-size? Preferably, the size of one her normal-sized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you gone?\" A loud voice echoed, belonging to the titan Cloud. He was clearly looking for the two girls he'd left tiny and helpless. He kept his eyes to the ground as he walked further into his tent, carefully moving so as to not step on either of them by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girls stayed as quiet as possible. Tifa gulped nervously. She had no fear of being seen by Cloud at her newest, smallest size. Thinking on it now, Tifa thought it was kind of funny that she'd initially wanted to use the Materia to return to her original height to put some clothing on, when now it was not likely that Cloud or anyone aside from Aerith would be able to even see her, let alone perv out on her still naked body. Meanwhile, Aerith, being the bigger of the two, summoned all her courage to not freak out when Cloud got nearer to her hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud's huge face loomed over the table. The simple act of him walking up to where he'd left Tifa and Aerith was almost enough to panic to the shrunken ladies. Aerith kept her cool though, and moved in line with Cloud's line of vision behind the bottles to keep both herself and Tifa safe from his view. Her heart was beating miles a minute, but her steps were taken with such deft carefulness that it was almost like she'd done this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"chase\" went on for a good minute or so before Cloud got tired of looking there. He sighed loudly, seemingly wanting to say something to his unseen small stowaways, but not doing so. Giving up, Cloud reached over to grab the jar containing the other Transform Materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table, Aerith and Tifa were both beyond relief when they noticed Cloud was appearing to tire of this game. They were sure that as far as he knew, they'd both made it off the table and were long gone. Aerith slumped down and sat behind the jar she'd last hidden behind. She was extremely grateful that Cloud had decided to keep their inventory in his tent that day, otherwise she and Tifa would have run out of cover long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what neither Aerith nor Tifa were aware of was that the jar they were hiding behind was actually...</span></div></div>",

Tifa covered her eyes and could hear her friend gasp. As the light started to disapear, Tifa opened her eyes again, prepared to face a giantess. That was not the case however. Instead of a tall flower-girl, Tifa saw nothing. Aerith was totally gone from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...Aerith?\" Tifa said as she approached the materia. The usually green magic stone had suddenly lost all its color and some sort of smoke was seeping out of it, like all of its magical powers had been drained from it. Suddenly she heard something coming from beneath, between her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa! Down here!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa turned her head down to locate the tiny voice and she couldn't believe her eyes what she saw. Down there was Aerith, only a few millimeters tall waving her arms in panic. Tifa leaned down and picked her up as gently as she could. She then raised Aerith close to her eyes, holding her in the palm of her hand. She was as tall as Tifa's pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear Aerith, how did this happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been broken or malfunctioned somehow.\" Aerith said while covering her breasts with one arm.

At least I didn't turn into a frog, hee hee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa smiled a little, but only for a moment. She had seen the cracks in the sphere and felt a little guilty for her friend's situation.

Slowly but surely it was getting out of hand, and the busty martial artist felt a responsibility to protect the tiny Aerith from Cloud's odd behavior. First she decided to try divert any attention from her feet and Aerith by drawing Cloud's gaze elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where Aerith went. I think she was still pretty mad at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some hesitation Tifa, removed her right arm from her chest, exposing her bare breasts before her giant captor. The act immediately got Cloud's undivided attention and it made her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's a small price to pay. Cloud would eventually get to see them anyway...</i> Tifa thought to herself. In any other situation this would've been her dream. She loved him after all, and she loved playing around with the Transform Materia. This was a completely different scenario though and she didn't want to end up like some toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa slowly sat down on top of Clouds palm, as close to Aerith as she could. She hoped she could hide the flower girl beneath her legs until she would be able to grab her and pick her up. She just hoped that Aerith wouldn't misinterpret the situation since her sex ended up just next to the tiny one. Meanwhile, she looked up on Cloud again, this time with an angry yet sad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't like you Cloud! Stripping me of my clothes and putting us in jars, just because I shrunk Aerith? Why are you doing this? Am I a doll to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look in Cloud's eyes changed. Tifa's words had reached him somehow, like he was struggling with his inner self what to do and what was okay. Tifa looked worriedly up on him, awaiting any kind of reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud...</span></div></div>",

Where are we going!?\" Tifa asked worriedly. The tiny fighter still couldn't get a read on him, and he was starting to scare her. When she next saw just where Cloud was going to she gulped, he had brought both her and Aerith to his bed, although he was still unaware of the smaller passenger on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud then lowered his hand down to his bed, and Tifa knew what he had in mind. The hand she was on started to move though, he was gently tilting it, causing the shrunken women to tumble and fall off. Tifa and Aerith screamed as they fell the short distance to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the landing was soft. Tifa quickly got herself up and scanned the bed for any sign of Aerith, she spotted the smaller woman just a few inches away from her, although at her size, inches were quite a ways to go. Tifa broke out into a sprint towards her smaller friend, but was stopped in her tracks just after. Cloud had sat down on the bed, right beside Tifa, and seemingly on top of Aerith!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cloud! W-What do you think you're doing!?\" Tifa shouted up to the giant. She was now extremely worried, not just for herself, but especially for Aerith. It looked like the poor girl had just been crushed! Tifa prayed that wasn't the case. \"Cloud, please! You don't know what you're doing!\" She pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Tifa...\" Was all Cloud said. His voice was beginning to sound monotone. Making Tifa think something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud just stared at her blankly. Tifa looked up at him, sweat forming on her brow. This went on for a while. Until Tifa could take no more, she couldn't just wait for Cloud to do something, she knew he'd most likely do something she would not like anyways, no, she had to do something, even if it meant giving up Aerith's whereabouts!</span></div></div>",

Aerith was right below you and you sat on her! Move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cloud heard what Tifa said, it seemed he had some sort of internal struggle whether to obey or not. To Tifa's relief he chose to do as the tiny martial artist told him. This of course meant that he would soon know where Aerith was located, but Tifa cared little. All she wanted to know was if her friend was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Aerith!\" Tifa yelled as she ran to the area were Cloud had sat, in order to locate the smaller flower-girl. It didn't take long for her to find the naked brunette. She got down on her knees and gently picked up Aerith with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerith! Speak to me! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinier girl moaned, but eventually sat up. \"I've been better. Bless the spirits, I think the bed saved me, as well as my size. The mattress was so soft that Clouds weight just pushed me down. Then again, it was kinda difficult to breathe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're alive! I'm so glad!\" Tifa said as she, to Aerith's dismay, squeezed her super-shrunken friend against her breasts in an attempt to hold her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine!\" Aerith replied while trying escape Tifa's fleshy prison. \"We have other things to worry about.

She was just about to turn around and face Cloud when she suddenly heard a strange sound, almost like pants dropping to the floor. Suddenly she hesitated what to do. Her heart raced and her tummy felt funny. Not sure if she was ready she looked down on Aerith, who already had seen what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... at least I saw it first...\" the tiny flower-girl mumbled while blushing like never before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tifa set down between the flower girls legs and let the materia give her footing on ground. she walked toward the 'undersea cave'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe kneeled down to be about level with the clitoris, then raised a hand and slid it inside. It was warm, and had it's own moistness much different from the water. Aerith didn't so much as flinch, maybe just puting in her arm wasn't enough, so she started to move it up and down and pushed in deeper. This caused a shudder up the sleeping Aerith's body, she was on the right track, but not effective enough. she put her hand on the clitoris, that light contact caused the wall of flesh around Tifa that  were Aerith's legs to jump slightly. Tifa started to rub it which caused more spasms throughout Aerith's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure is a deep sleeper.\" Tifa thought, she pulled out her hand. Aerith's fluids were diluting into the water, making it a little murky around Tifa's arm. Then she grabbed the sides of Aerith's womanhood and opened it. the water became murky as more of her fluids diluted into the water. Tifa went in head first, pulling her way in, and stopping with her knees still outside, she could feel Aerith's body writhe with bliss. Tifa then turned about inside Aerith, rubbing everything she could. She reached up above her head and probed deeper. Noticing the water was thick with Aerith's fluids, she guessed she was approaching climax, but then, Tifa felt herself being pulled in by the muscles that held her in place. She bet her knees, using them as a hook keep her from being sucked deeper into blackness above, but they were slipping against the flower girls soft skin, and wouldn't anchor her for much longer, she tryed reaching down, but the muscles were too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not like this.\" she thought. Tifa's shins had just been sucked in and only her feet still remained outside, they each pushed outward, providing one last lifeline for Tifa to pull herself out. Using all the strength in her body, she pulled with her legs to escape her fate. She pulled down until her knees couldn't bend anymore and she pushed her legs straight, her knees were once again outside and they hooked once more, but this time, they pushed against whatever flesh they could find. finally her knees were out and they pushed against the opening pulling Tifa ever closer to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her knee stroked the clitoris and a massive shudder caused a gush of thick fluids to stream down from above Tifa, and a massive contraction of the muscles around her pulled her in with greater force than before. \"Is this it?\" she thought as she felt her knees be engulfed my her friends vagina, but then, she stopped. The muscles around her were still pulling, but she felt a greater force pulling her by the feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she was in the water, and the oh so welcome light of the sun was refracted from under the surface, but then she was pulled above the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa?! Tifa, are you okay?\" she heard a voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and saw the red and panting face of Aerith, looking very worried.</span></div></div>",

Carrying her to the shore where their clothes lay, Aerith reached down and found a spool of thread from her own belongings. One end she tied around Tifa's waist, then she measured out a few feet and cut the line. Too afraid to fight the thread, Tifa looked up in silence, terrified what her friend might have in store. Aerith simply kept her smile and returned to the water. \"Now, you have a lifeline so you won't get stuck in there this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time?\" Tifa replied nervously.</span></div></div>",

Aerith was almost waist deep when she was propping herself with her hands to go in, but she felt Tifa's vagina beginning to get wet, which would hinder her from entering by being lubricated in Tifa's fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa could feel Aerith's little feet wiggling some, probably as Aerith moved her knees while she was trying to handstand into her.

True in a respective scale, Tifa's breasts outstripped Yuffie's by a longshot, but as  the tiny shrunken fighter continued to flurry around she noticed her breasts were barely the size of Yuffie's nipples, which seemed to become more erect with each struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes in silent bliss, Yuffie clutched her hands across her chest, binding Tifa in tightly with her chest, and kneading her across her left breast. Arranging Tifa so that her now marble-sized breasts rubbed against her giant nipple, Yuffie continued to firmly squeeze the tiny woman into her breast, flicking her other nipple with her spare hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as her ecstacy was hitting it's peak however, she sensed footsteps approaching. Taking quick shelter behind a tree, Yuffie observed her companion Aeris looking out calmly at the lake Tifa had been in only so long before Yuffie arrived. Waiting patiently, Yuffie observed what could be Aeris' next move, though she hoped she would leave quickly, as Tifa was still struggling violently and Yuffie was warming up fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinned with her chest against Yuffie's firm nipple, Tifa continued to attempt to prise herself free from her grip. Eventually frustration drove her to sink her teeth deep into Yuffie's sensitive nipple. Taken completely off guard, Yuffie flinched slightly and trod on a small twig, which shattered the ominous silence. Aeris' head turned to see just a tree, no other presence visible, but Yuffie was nervous, had Aeris seen her? would she investigate? she decided upon one of two moves....</span></div></div>",

Elena's non-intended stimuli made the unconscious tiny martial artist dream about having a intimate meeting with the love of her life, a certain soldier with spiky hair. The dream did not last long however. As Tifa started to wake up from Elena's special treatment, she saw the siluette of a blonde. Tifa smiled, thinking it was actually Cloud who had found her. Soon, when Tifa's sight adjusted to the bright light, the silhouette turned into that of a naked giantess. Tifa did not recognize the girl at first, but after a few seconds her eyes widened as she saw who it really was. Not only was it Elena - Tifa also noticed a giant finger stuck between her legs. The tiny martial artist's face turned as red as Summon Materia and she let out a scream, taking the giant Turk by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-keep it down! I only wanted to wake you up. If you don't want my colleagues to see you you'd better stay quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena quickly removed her finger from Tifa's womanhood. To a surprise the motion triggered a feeling of reluctant pleasure for her, like her body had become more sensitive, perhaps compensating the loss of size. The tiny martial artist did not particularly enjoy the embarrassing situation and tried to break free, but Elena was holding her in a tight grip. The giant Turk smiled with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mighty Tifa turned doll. That must mean this materia is Transform Materia. Hee hee, this is so perfect! Tseng will be so pleased with me once I return to Junon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Junon? This is bad</i> Tifa thought to herself. Junon was on the other side of the continent, which meant Elena had the intention of taking the boat back from Costa del Sol. This was far worse than being toyed with by Yuffie, and Tifa had to think of something fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky for you I was this small then. I would've totally kicked your ass if we were the same size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I'm a TURK! The hell you would! Is that a challenge?\" Elena asked, squeezing the tiny girl with a steadfast grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghn... y-you bet it is!

But then, she began to seriously contemplate taking up Tifa's offer of a fair fight. She wanted to prove herself somehow, even it was to her enemy. And besides, she couldn't just let that tiny woman talk to her like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa watched with abated interest as Elena seemed to think things over. She smiled, thinking that she was getting to the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine!\" Elena shouted. \"If that's how you want to play it, then that's what we'll do! Just don't regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think I'll have to worry about that.\" Tifa said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! I could just crush you like this, if you prefer?\" Elena asked, tightening her grip on Tifa once again, eliciting a moan of pain from the shrunken fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh! N-No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" Elena let up. She then bent down and put Tifa on the ground beside her, the tiny woman coughed for a few moments before catching her breath and becoming more relaxed. Elena watched her tiny foe for a few moments to make sure that she wouldn't just run off, but Tifa seemed true to her word about wanting a fair fight, standing still and looking up at her and tapping her feet, waiting for her to shrink herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smirked at the tiny woman before her, she couldn't wait to take the overly busty fighter down a few notches, well, a few more notches that is. Elena chuckled at her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to do this or what?\" Tifa shouted up to her, growing more impatient. \"Or are you just going to stand there and laugh to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh, shut up!\" Elena shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's it.</i> Tifa thought with a sly grin. Despite being smaller, Tifa was sure she was the one in control of the situation right now. <i>Get mad...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena then picked up the transform materia and activated its powers. The giantess Turk shrank down in size quickly, while the materia stayed the same size, soon she was all the way down to 6 inches tall. Elena was surprised to see that Tifa was still smaller than herself. Elena wanted to intimidate the smaller woman, she walked over to her and stood over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now, hold on...\" Tifa started to say. \"We agreed to a fair fight, you have to shrink yourself again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena laughed at her tinier opponent's fear, showing quite clearly on her little face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" Elena said. \"Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena then went back to the, now large-sized to her, materia and activated it again. She shrank once more, becoming Tifa's size exactly at only 2 inches tall. She would have been shocked to see how big everything had gotten, but all of her attention was on Tifa, the well-endowed woman stood quite a ways from her now that she had gotten smaller, the distances seemed farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for this?\" Elena raised her hands in front of herself, assuming a fighting pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I am!\" Tifa replied with confidence. \"I'm just surprised you agreed to this in the first place, you Turks are usually so underhanded..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" Elena shouts, throwing her fist to her side. \"I'm going to show you the power of a Turk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena charges at Tifa...</span></div></div>",

All that mattered was to take down that cocky Avalanche once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe charged Tifa head on as fast as she could, trying to end the fight quickly with a well-aimed kick to the stomach. Tifa was as fast as her opponent and dodged it easily with an elegant aerial flip, landing a few feet away. Elena turned and charged again, attacking Tifa with all her power. Soon they started trading blows with each other, trying to find an opening and claim victory. Most of the hits were blocked and inflicted only minor damage to them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe setting of the battle was absurd in a way. Two tiny girls fighting each other in the nude, at the edge of a stream. Both of them were at least very skilled fighters. The difference between them was that Tifa had been trained by the legendary, world-traveling martial artist master Zangan, and therefore slightly better than the Turk. However, Tifa's bouncy pair of pillows was a clear disadvantage to her. Her balance was suffering from the lack of her white sports bra, and it could eventually cost her the battle. Fighting naked was obviously not the most ideal situation for her, but Tifa had an idea how to use it to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's and Elena's skirmish had initially started off as a classic martial artist's battle with kicks, punches and a lot of blocks. But with Tifa changing strategy, the fight slowly turned into that of a wrestling match. As it went on, the somewhat prude Elena started to realize both that she was in her birthday suit and the downside of fighting in it. Being a less developed girl in comparison the her opponent, she started to feel a little intimidated by Tifa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly 10 minutes of non stop fighting, Tifa managed to grab on to Elena, locking her in a trap she wouldn't break free from easily. While trying to perfect the lock, Tifa accidentally grabbed one of Elena's breasts, groping the prude Turk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEK! What are you doing!? S-stop that! Let go of me this instant! D...don't you have any feminine modesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Modesty?\" Tifa chuckled. \"Don't be ridiculous. We're both girls and we're having an honorable duel. I don't see the problem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa had taken Elena by total surprise, and it felt exciting. Involuntarily rubbing her own chest against Elena's soft back actually felt kind of nice too. It made her recall a specific incident from their meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...besides, you were the one who started it! Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena struggled with all her might, eventually managing to break free. Her body had already reacted to the treatment and she could feel goosebumps all over herself. She quickly turned around in order to face Tifa head on, and they both got into a deadlock with their hands. Once again Tifa seized the opportunity, as she gently started pushing her bosom towards Elena's. The blonde Turk gasped as she felt her nipples dock with Tifa's, creating a strong tingling sensation in both of their bodies. Elena \"suffered\" the worst, and she felt her arms and legs weaken as her strength started to leave her. Tifa on the other hand was enjoying herself more and more. She felt extremely confident, which was nice for a change considering what she had been through lately. All this excitement and tingling had to be some side-effect from the Transform Materia, or perhaps from Elena's fondling of her earlier. It did not matter. The duel was coming toward an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, don't come near me! Keep those over-sized melons away from me!\" Elena said terrified, closing her eyes as she started to panic. Her face was dead red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An opening!</i> Tifa thought. She quickly put her leg behind Elena and pushed her chest towards her even more, and by doing so tripping Elena. The Turk fell backwards and landed on her back. Tifa immediately followed and landed on top of her opponent. She had managed to defeat her enemy!</span></div></div>",

Reluctantly, she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better...\" Tifa slowly got up, being cautious as to not let her guard down, and let Elena get in a sneak attack. When she was standing on her feet again, she continued, \"Now, stay there. Unless you want another beating!\" Tifa threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Elena just continued to lay there limply, Tifa was satisfied that she wouldn't try anything and made her way back to the materia. It was only a short distance, and once there, she began to really think about what next move should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she thought about it, Tifa had enemies at both camps. The Turks, of course, were Avalanche's biggest rivals, but Tifa suspected that with the materia in hand she might be able to spy on them, and if she got caught she always had Elena as a bargaining chip. And then there was Yuffie, her former friend who shrank her and stole her clothes and materia, Tifa guessed that the thief must've headed back to camp by now, so she had that to look forward to there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa quickly devised a plan for both options. She figured that if she wanted to tackle some espionage at the Turks campsite, then she should stay small and out of sight, but shrink Elena even smaller. On the other hand, going back to her own campsite would be best taken on at her normal size to better prepare for Yuffie and maybe tell the others what transpired at the lake, she'd have to keep Elena at the size she is now, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What to do?</i> Tifa contemplated her options.</span></div></div>",

Using her own arms to restrain the woman beneath her, Tifa held herself up. Staring at her, she felt another odd tingling sensation come over her, her cocky expression slowly changing to one of pleasure. Whether that was from happiness over winning the fight, or something else, Tifa wasn't sure, but she did know one thing, and that was that she liked the way Elena looked under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena though, was in hell, suffering another humiliating defeat at the hands of her enemy. She grimaced and struggled to get up, but Tifa was too strong for her to budge. Eventually she gave up resisting all together. Instead, she glared up at Tifa with much anger, but when she saw how Tifa was starting to look at her, she started to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay..! Fine! You won, now what are you going to do with me!?\" She demanded to know, trying to sound strong, but failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Tifa lowered herself to just above Elena's face, and kissed her! Elena gasped through the kiss, her already beet red face somehow turned even more so. Elena struggled more ferociously, trying to pull away. She didn't have to worry about too long though, as Tifa pulled herself back a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!?\" Elena cried. Slight tears starting to form in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I don't know what's come over me..!\" Tifa said, sounding both strangely calm and hasty at the same time. There was a pause between the two, an awkward moment where neither spoke, they simply stared at each other. Tifa tried to read the Turk, from their earlier interactions it seemed that Tifa was not alone in feeling \"sensations\" during the fight. She asked, \"But don't tell me you don't feel this too..?\"</span></div></div>",

Tifa was right, she knew, after Elena had shrank herself she knew there was something wrong, she couldn't tell at first, but now it was clear. Her thoughts were interrupted though, when Tifa planted another soft kiss on her cheek. She looked up at the other woman, who smiled back at her warmly and with more than a hint of lust. Elena thought that this was not the same woman who challenged her to a fight at a tiny size, indeed, the dark-haired beauty was almost a different person altogether now. Someone who Elena wanted to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena returned Tifa's kiss this time with one of her own. Tifa was glad that the Turk finally came around, and she let up her hold on the other woman as the two embraced on the ground. Taking advantage of her newly freed arms, Elena grabbed at Tifa's large breasts with sudden confidence, massaging them. The objects of her affection were so shortly before an immense annoyance, and while they were still immense, Elena didn't think them annoying at all now. Tifa moaned at Elena's touch and pressed her chest lower for her lover, she broke off the kiss and smiled in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Elena was less experienced in love, she had effectively taken charge over Tifa. Part of the materia's side-effects, she assumed for the split-second she thought about it in their passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa didn't mind it though, it seemed the side-effects had hit her harder somehow, possibly from being exposed to the materia for longer. The fighter selfishly absorbed herself in her pleasure, sliding two fingers into her wet, waiting vagina. She fell over onto her side, from the lack of support of her other arm. Now on her side, she moaned louder from her own self-stimulation, while Elena got up and hungrily began to suck on her breasts, eliciting further sounds of pleasure from the busty fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena..! Elena..!\" She moaned loudly, over and over, fingering herself faster and harder until she could take no more and at last, she burst into intense pleasure. She recoiled, hardly believing that she reached such a state with the help of one of her biggest enemies. She looked at her to see that Elena was caught up in playing with herself now, as well as still keeping her head buried between Tifa's own prodigious cleavage, which created more muffled cries of pleasure from the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa decided to help her out, lowering herself to Elena's crotch. Elena was sad for a moment, now that those delicious breasts were gone, but her sadness didn't last long when she felt Tifa's tongue work it's way into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god! Tifa, you're..! I'm..!\" Elena's words were soft. She put a hand on Tifa's head, while keeping the other massaging her own breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having never been with a woman before, Tifa licked, and lapped like a pro. It didn't take long for her to bring Elena to orgasm, Tifa licked that up too. Tifa got up and smiled, licking her lips clean. She saw Elena was all tuckered out now, all that fighting must've worn her out, not to mention the second round just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa plopped down next to her, then lay at her side. The heat of the moment over, both women returned to their relative normal state of mind, for the most part, the lust they had for each other still lingered. Tifa took another look at Elena and smiled. Even without the materia's effects clouding her judgement, she still thought Elena was quite cute. So she gave her another little peck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they...</span></div></div>",

The urge to kiss, cuddle and explore her even more was still lingering in Tifa's body and the young martial artist felt that it required a lot of willpower to resist the feeling. This intense lust was both a blessing and a curse. She settled with another hug and drew Elena closer to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe we did it. Our friends would never believe us even if we told them about this.\" Elena said, somewhat enjoying her position. \"Hee hee, I would probably get fired!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we don't tell them! This little adventure will remain our secret!\" Tifa replied. She smiled at Elena and started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the way you moaned earlier... it was kinda cute. Was that your first real orgasm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde Turk hesitated at first, but then nodded in response. Her shrunken and sensitive body had made it happen. Tifa continued to smile and just patted Elena on her head, trying to comfort the newly blossomed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! I enjoyed it too! I have never been with a woman before. At least you resemble Cloud a little, which makes it okay!\" Tifa said, trying to justify their act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well I could totally see you as a gender-bent version of my boss Tseng!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls laughed from the remark they'd just made, and then they fell silent again. Both of them understood that this act wouldn't last forever. They had obligations, but at least none for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa... I know it's... erm... awkward to ask and not really my nature, but do you think we could stay in this form just a little while longer?\" Elena asked while blushing. \"I-I've never experienced pleasure like this and it would be shame if it went away so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena's subtle plea for more rekindled Tifa's lust. Suddenly she felt her body tingling and this time it was impossible to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Elena? Let's play around with the Transform Materia some more! I want to see what it's capable of and if we can shrink even further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? What if we lose even more control? And do we really trust each other that much? What if I decide to betray you?\" Elena asked. It was a fair question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we make a promise here and now not to!\" Tifa replied. \"Then we're simply forced to follow what our previous self's decided! You would honor that no matter what, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa got up on her feet and helped her newly found lover to do the same. Their bodies once again met in a symmetrical docking. Elena just blushed and nodded in response to Tifa's offer. The 2 inch tall girls took each others hands and then walked over to the big green materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... who do we start with?\"</span></div></div>",

I don't think it's a good idea if we both shrink further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" Tifa said with sudden confidence. \"I'm already having a difficult time containing myself and I'm bursting with excitement. Also, I want you to be able to trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both smiled at each other. No one would know of this. It would remain their secret for as long as they lived. Tifa released her grip on Elena's hand and started to approach the big sphere-like materia. The tiny girl put both of her hands on it and closed her eyes. Once again the materia activated instantly and soon its green light engulfed Tifa. It was no doubt now - its magical powers did indeed allow her to become even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena! I-I can feel it! It's working!\" Tifa said, sounding almost overjoyed. Little at a time she shrank more and more. The high grass around her became forests and trees grew to the size of mountains. She didn't want to settle with a mediocre transformation and therefore continued to use the materia's power until she were only a few millimeters tall - tiny enough to fit in Elena's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was finally done, Tifa couldn't believe her eyes. Everything had changed and the world was suddenly so different. She looked up at Elena who had started to approach her. The Turk resembled a giantess and Tifa could only dream what a normal person would look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Elena asked the tiny Avalanche as she gently picked her up from the ground and placed her in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. I don't think I feel any different? I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was suddenly interrupted. Elena, who was already very curious about the smaller woman's sensitivity, begun to blow gently on her with her lips. A subtle wind swept over the minuscule girl and gently caressed her between her legs, continuing up over her large breasts with the same effect. What was only meant as a tease made Tifa react in ways she was not prepared for. It immediately filled her with newborn lust and desire for more. It felt like her body was lit on fire, like it had cravings she couldn't fully understand. It made her confused. Was this simply something she wanted herself, or was it just pure instinct, like a new bodily nature gained from her transformation? Nevertheless, Tifa moaned in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Elena, this was an opportunity to finally give something back, so she acted accordingly. She quickly raised her hand to her mouth. Before Tifa had the chance to recover, the blonde girl reached out with her tongue and started to lick the tiny brunette's naked body. Pleasure coursed through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my body... noo... Elena I can't... aahn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Tifa tried to resist the pleasure of Elena's tongue, afraid of what would happen if it escalated. But the more the Turk licked Tifa\u2019s most private parts, the more she gave in to the pure ecstasy of it. Elena was like a goddess and Tifa her subject. Tifa\u2019s trip to 7th heaven continued for several minutes. Now she wanted to shrink even further to see if it would make her pleasure even more enjoyable. She was just about to have the orgasm of her life when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elena quickly pulled out of Tifa, much to the smaller girl's chargin, and shot up. Being bigger made Elena not as susceptible to her own pleasures and able to realize, with some effort, that being found at this size would be very dangerous. On the other hand, Tifa was too small to think of anything but her own release, especially now that it had been taken away while she was on the verge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena, pleeease..!\" Tifa moaned. \"I-I want it! You have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" Elena hushed her tinier partner. She did feel bad about leaving Tifa in such a state. But if they were to get found out by an enemy, she thought, things would be much worse for the both of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yooo, Elena!\" A male voice called. Elena instantly recognized it as her fellow turk, Reno! A red-headed young man with a penchant for being reckless. Elena thought that it wasn't so bad as her being found by an AVALANCHE member, but with Reno's somewhat unpredictable nature, it was still not in her best interest to be found by him. She knew what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena held on to Tifa and ran back to the transform materia. All the while having to hear Tifa moan and egg her on about finishing the job, and the thought was extremely appealing to Elena thanks to the materia's mind fogging side-effects, but she still had enough of her head to block those thoughts out as she made it over to the materia.<br>\r\nEven though she was able to think more clearly than her smaller lover, Elena's mind was still fogged up by the shrinking she did undergo, and as such her next move might have been a badly thought-out one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena placed the tinier Tifa on the ground, next to the materia. \"Stay here! If Reno sees you, it won't be good for either of us!\" Elena told Tifa, who either didn't seem to hear her or just plain didn't care, as the shrunken fighter just schlicked herself furiously. Elena had to look away, lest she be tempted into stayed small with Tifa and continuing their play session. \"Just keep doing that then!\" She shouted, and then activated the materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena quickly shot back up in size, back to 6 inches tall. This wasn't enough of course, so Elena used the materia once more and finally grew back to normal. She sighed in relief that she made it in time, and looked down to see if she could still see Tifa down there, but she was far too small to make out clearly at Elena's normal size, so Elena just hoped that Tifa would be okay for a little while longer and than she'd fix this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena then felt a strange feeling in her head, like it was being cleared of the fog that had pervaded it whilst she was shrunk. Elena could think more clearly now, and as a result, was able to quickly come up with an excuse as to why she was here, and also trick Reno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Reno!</i> Elena thought. He'd be here any second, she had to be ready to play her part. Then, as if on cue, Reno shuffled through the bushes of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yooo, Elena! Are you-\" He called, but soon found the words caught in his throat when he finally did see Elena. His fellow turk was completely naked! The two locked eyes for an awkward moment that seemed to last minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyaaaa!\" Elena shouted, once she seemed to have got her bearings. The blond covered herself with her hands and backed away from Reno. \"Get out of here!\" She screamed at the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReno gulped, and looked away real fast, his face beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry!\" He apologized, but didn't try to leave. \"Everyone's wondering where you were, I thought you might have been eaten by a monster or something, so I came to look for you! That's all!\" He shouted, his words came out very quickly in his hasty, apologetic explanation, making him a bit hard to understand for Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's fine.\" Elena said sternly, anger seeping in her voice. \"Stay there while I put on my clothes, but don't you dare turn around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, ma'am...\" Was all Reno could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smirked a little at how well her plan payed off. Sh wasn't as mortified from being seen in the nude as she thought she might have been, she briefly wondered if her newfound confidence was a result of the transform materia's effects. So instead of actually being upset with Reno, although she was still a little mad at him for peeking at her, she played along with what she thought her reaction should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena quickly got her things and dressed herself in her normal suit attire. To her surprise, Reno was able to stay still for this long, she thought to take advantage of his obedience and check up on one last thing, the still shrunken Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down on her knees, Elena searched the area immediately next to the transform materia, looking for the still speck-sized woman. It took awhile, since Tifa was so small it was hard to distinguish her from the other specks, but eventually Elena found her tinier partner.<br>\r\nShe smiled down at her minuscule new lover, and could just barely see that Tifa had her hand hard at work keeping herself on the edge. Elena wondered how long Tifa could go like this, and if at her size, Tifa might ever tire out. It was an interesting idea, she thought, keeping Tifa at her insect-sized form, at least for a little longer, it would make taking her back to the turks camp a little easier as well.<br>\r\nAlthough Elena also knew that it was dangerous for Tifa to be this size, something she realized that she'd not even thought of the heat of the moment when they took turns shrinking each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena wondered what to do with Tifa...</span></div></div>",

Because of her shrunken and hyper-sensitive body she had reached a state of mind were she was nearly lost in her own ecstasy. Despite Elena urging her to stop and despite being nearly drained of all her stamina, Tifa couldn't contain herself. She wanted to reach yet another climax and experience even more euphoria. Even without Elena's help she was still enjoying herself like never before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers moved with grace over her lubricating gender, gently caressing her clitoris with her middle finger while the rest either played with her labia or entered her wet cave. Tifa felt so wonderful and insignificant at the same time. It could go on forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Elena was watching the whole show. The fact that Tifa was the size of an insect and Elena the size of a goddess made her even more sexually aroused. Tifa did however not care much about the size difference. She hadn't even considered the dangers of being so minuscule, probably because of the immense pleasure taking up her every thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena could do nothing but smile. She knew that Tifa's pleasure way exceeded what she herself had experienced, but still understood how addictive it was to be so tiny. By growing normal she had freed herself from the \"cursed\" state Tifa was experiencing, but letting Tifa stay like that was out of the question. She was just too tiny for Elena to handle safely. She decided it was for the best to grow Tifa back to at least 2-3 inches tall. That way she could keep the martial artist in her pocket. She soon reached down and grabbed the green materia next to Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now fully dressed Turk smiled gently at her lover on the ground as she once again activated the materia. \"Sorry to interrupt you Tifa, but I'm afraid playtime's over for now.\" Elena said and targeted her victim. The materia started to emit its green light and instantly hit Tifa with magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the magic only meant to make Tifa bigger, its energies also gave her a little extra push in her quest to reach new peaks of pleasure. As they mixed with her nerve cords she felt a strong sensation between her legs. It felt like her body was burning and shivering at the same time. As the femme fatale martial artist grew bigger she experienced an amazing squirting orgasm, all in front of a blushing Elena. After a few seconds of continuous moaning, Tifa's body started to relax. She took deep breaths and then started to feel ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... I can't believe I just did all that! I...I'm so embarrassed Elena! I just couldn't control myself, acted all on instinct. My body moved on it's own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa, listen, you don't need to be!\" Elena replied. She lifted Tifa and glanced into her eyes. \"You deserve all pleasure you can get, but right now I need to hide you so Reno don't see you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Elena put Tifa in one of her pockets. As Tifa's vision of her surroundings all vanished, the tiny Avalanche started to feel a little bit insecure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena? Where are you taking me?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena couldn't hear her very good, but Tifa already had a slight idea of where her female guardian was taking her...</span></div></div>",

The tiny Tifa was securely tucked away in her breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haired young man slowly did so, afraid of eliciting Elena's rage if she wasn't truly ready. He relaxed upon seeing his comrade in her Turk suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god. I thought you'd never finish!\" Reno complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up! You interrupt my bath, and now you wanna complain I'm not fast enough!\" Elena scolded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!

A few minutes of walking later, he got suspicious of how long she took again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey, what took you so long anyway? It sounded like you were talking to someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena blushed nervously at Reno's comment, she looked away quickly before he could see. Scratching the back of her head, she tried to deny his claims, \"I-I was not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Then you were talking to yourself?\" Reno snided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid. I didn't say anything.\" Elena again denied Reno's accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReno shrugged and the walk back to camp continued. Occasionally, Reno would pester Elena about what he heard, and Elena would deny it, telling him to get his ears checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa, hidden tightly in Elena's pocket, couldn't quite hear the conversation just outside through Elena's clothes. But she didn't care, still shrunken, Tifa was still horny from the effects of being so small. Being so close to one of Elena's erogenous zones only made her that much more turned on. The tiny woman began to press herself against Elena's breasts, rubbing herself into the giantess's large nipple, feeling the oh-so-slight bump of it between the fabric. At Tifa's reduced size and enhanced arousal, this proved enough for the shrunken woman to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring another accusatory fight between Elena and Reno, Elena felt Tifa's little ministrations on her nipple, eliciting a soft moan from the girl. Elena couldn't quite catch herself quickly enough to stop it from being obvious something just affected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Reno asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing..!\" Elena yelped. Her thoughts turned to Tifa. <i>Damn it, Tifa</i>! <i>Can't you control yourself for a little while</i>!? Elena felt another, minute but still strong enough, sensation thanks to Tifa, and squeaked out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReno stood by confused. When it came to sex, he was much more naive of it than his fellow turks, as such he wasn't able to tell what was going on with Elena's sudden reaction. Elena wasn't giving him much to work with either, what with her constant refusal to speak. So he, perhaps absentmindedly, let his eyes wander over Elena's body. He noticed something \"off\" about her chest, was it bigger somehow? No, that wasn't it, it seemed to him that there was something in Elena's pocket, and it was moving around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena noticed Reno staring at her. \"Stop that!\" She shouted at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReno didn't oblige though. \"Wait, I think you've got a bug or something in your shirt, Elena.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a bug!\" Elena shouted quickly. A moment later she realized what she had said and gasped, covering her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..? You mean, you're smuggling some little creature on purpose!?\" Reno asked. He then got eager. \"Let me see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it</i>! Elena mentally scolded herself for letting herself get caught up in the sensation's Tifa gave her, maybe if she hadn't she wouldn't have let that slip. She had to get a fix on this situation, turned bad so suddenly. She couldn't let Tifa, or herself, get found out!</span></div></div>",

If Tifa was to be discovered it would mean the end of her, and perhaps even Elena's own career as a Turk. She quickly turned her back towards him and went into a defensive stance, letting out yet another high pitched scream while pretending to be afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReno stopped instantly, realizing he might have gone too far. \"H-hey, what's wrong Elena? What's with the girly routine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Girly, eh? Good boy Reno. Think of me as weak and fragile!</i> Elena thought as she continued her act while discretely relocating the horny doll-like martial artist to one of her pants pockets. \"What has gotten into you Reno? First you peek at me and now this? All I did was moan a little. If this continues I will report you for sexual harassment to Tseng!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W..whaat? Geez Elena, I'm sorry. I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena didn't stop there. She somehow enjoyed toying with Reno and wanted to rub it in even further with her new-found \"power\". Her sexual experience was fresh, but outperformed her colleague by a long-shot. She turned around and walked straight up to her partner and looked him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I got in my pocket is none of your business. I bet it was just an excuse to look at my breasts anyway, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReno flinched. \"N-no, ya got it all wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena continued, adding more salt to the wound. \"I bet you think they've grown? Are you really that desperate to see me naked again? I mea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay I get it! Man, you talk too much. Let's drop it and forget this happened, okay Elena?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled over the outcome. She new that Reno wouldn't drop it so easily since she had not explained her squeaks and moans. But for the moment she and Tifa were safe. Besides, she now felt extremely confident in herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Reno and Elena reached the Turk camp. Once Elena was done reporting to her superior Tseng she was free for the rest of the evening. She home to her own tent and checked that no one was following her. As soon as she entered the tent, Elena carefully removed Tifa from her pocket and put her on a small table next to her bed. The tiny Avalanche member was soaking wet and looked like she was about to faint at any given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...Tifa! what have you done to yourself?\" Elena said, both chocked and somewhat intrigued by the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... aahn.. can't help myself.

Tifa was still having the time of her life, but it wouldn't be worth it if it was endangering her well-being. She couldn't grow Tifa back to normal, not while in a Turk camp, so the only solution would be to tie her up, disabling her possibilities to fondle herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond Turk had a small golden necklace she could use. After removing it, Elena gently picked up Tifa and pushed her against a table lamp. She then placed the necklace chains against the small girl, while locking the two ends of it against each-other on the other side of the lamp. The procedure effectively restrained Tifa from any sexual actions. With her arms disabled, the little fighter desperately tried to grind her thighs against each-other for some extra pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena!! No! Please, release me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for your own sake Tifa!\" Elena said while also feeling a little sorry for her playmate. \"If you are to stay small and remain my little secret you need to learn to control those urges of yours. I know it's tough but you'll thank me later... I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena had yet another trick up her sleeve. She opened one of her drawers and picked up a small materia. Like Transform, it was green to the color.<br>\r\n\"This is Seal Materia.\" Elena said while first inspecting the small sphere before activating it. \"It contains the magic \"Sleep\" and I think it will help you through the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Elena, please! I just need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince being so small, the magic had an immediate effect on Tifa, to Elena's relief. The nude little lady fell asleep instantly. The Turk sighed and then started prepare herself for the night. She switched from her dark suit so a comfy pink night gown, then dove right into her own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an adventure I had today, and I bet there is more to come...\" Elena mumbled and closed her eyes. \"I need to get her some clothes, otherwise I'll be drawn back into that pleasure as well...\"</span></div></div>",

The tiny woman was starting to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa yawned and tried to rub her eyes awake, but the restraints on her arms didn't allow for it. The shrunken fighter gasped as she remembered her predicament, and the events leading up to it. She struggled to break free from her binds, but it was no use, she was far too weak at her size to do it. She gave up after a few minutes and slumped down as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt awful, not because of what she had done with Elena. But because she wasn't able to do it again! Her giant lover, if she could indeed be called that, slept peacefully in her bed. Tifa could see the content look on Elena's face as she slept. She thought Elena looked cute in her sleep, but that wasn't enough to stop Tifa from wanting to be free from this rather humiliating binding the giantess had put her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena! Let me go! Please!\" Tifa cried. Her tiny voice didn't seem to carry to her captors bed, not more than 10 feet away from the 6 inch tall woman's prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa tried to call out to Elena a few more times, but the Turk didn't seem to be waking up anytime soon. So Tifa resigned to waiting for Elena to get up to free her. The shrunken woman's mind started to wander, and feelings of lust and pleasure overcame her again. Then, the tiny woman felt a burning between her legs building, and memories of how good her new size felt returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Tifa moaned as the feelings continued to grow. She started to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got so bad that Tifa wanted nothing more than to relieve herself of this built-up sexual frustration. This in turn renewed Tifa's want to release herself from her confines. So the shrunken fighter tried one more time to break free and used all her might to do so. She soon heard the necklace's chains crack. She gave another push and the chains gave out, breaking into smaller pieces before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa fell forward onto the desk. Her hand seemed to have a mind of it's own as it went to relieve her as soon as she was free. Tifa lay there for a moment, touching herself furiously to bring herself to orgasm. It didn't take long since she was so hot already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Oooh!\" Tifa moaned. Satisfied at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's body spasmed as the aftershocks took her body. She kept a hand massaging her left breast, and one below frisking herself, for continued \"relief\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tifa was fully satisfied, she stood up, her legs a little shaky. Now that her mind wasn't so clouded by thoughts of pleasure, she could think a little more clearly. She looked back at Elena, still sleeping soundly in her bed. The Turks were her team's enemies, she remembered, but not Elena, not after yesterday. Tifa wondered what do to with her when the time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though, Tifa wanted to get back to normal size. While her mind still allowed her to think of it. She'd need the transform materia for it though. Tifa scanned the room for it, and hoped Elena didn't put it too far. At 6 inches tall, a trek was the last thing Tifa wanted to have to do. She spotted the materia soon though, and saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

Tifa walked over to the magical orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Elena must not have thought I'd get free before she'd wake up.</i> Tifa thought. <i>Big mistake!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny woman was confident as she strode over to the two materia. Tifa grabbed the transform one and activated it's powers. In an instant, Tifa was back to her normal height, and sitting on Elena's desk. The busty fighter noticed now that she was still nude as a chill blew in from outside the tent. Tifa just shrugged at this though, not minding being naked as long as she was alone with Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restored fighter picked up the transform materia and got off of the desk, then took a moment to look around the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow. It's incredible to be normal again!</i> Tifa thought with a grin, as she saw the objects that seemed huge to her in her shrunken state now look more regular again. <i>And my mind seems to be back where it was before I shrank too.</i> She noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to take in the tent, when she saw that Elena was still soundly sleeping in her bed. Tifa went over to her lover, and carefully sat beside her on the bed. The small movement made Elena shake in her sleep, and Tifa worried she might wake up, but the Turk stayed asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Elena...</i> Tifa thought. She brushed back the blond's hair gently. <i>What am I going to do with you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tifa watched Elena sleep, she thought of things to do to the woman. She knew she couldn't really leave Elena's tent at full size, and sneaking out at tiny size meant she'd have to leave the materia behind. And she didn't really feel tired either, otherwise she'd have just jumped into bed with Elena. So her only option, she assured herself, was to mess with her new lover. Nothing too bad, of course. Just something \"fun\" for her to do to Elena while she waited for the sun to come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Tifa had planned to get some revenge on Elena for tying her up. But now, looking at her beautifully sleeping lover, Tifa started to reconsider. And even though she was now her normal size again, Tifa's mind started to wander back to sexual deviancy. She briefly wondered if that was another side effect of using the materia for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's mind then went to two places. First, she imagined shrinking herself down and giving Elena the wake up call of her life. And second, she thought again about revenge, shrinking Elena down and putting her in the same position the fighter was in just minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa made up her mind...</span></div></div>",

All of these thoughts made the voluptuous fighter ever more excited. The sexual excitement that once again grew in her was not close to that feeling she had experienced when she had been doll-sized, but it was still a wonderful feeling. It felt incredibly tempting to once again just shrink down to a few inches and snuggle in between Elena's chest, maybe even disappear down her legs and explore a certain dank cave. Then again, Tifa had not been in control for a while now, at least not since she made herself smaller than her new-found Turk friend. Being big and normal again also felt liberating in a way, though she eventually would have to shrink back again to avoid being caught by other Turk members. Another point was that Tifa still had no clothes. Running around in the nude for everyone to see was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally deciding what to do, Tifa reached for the Transform Materia. As soon as she got hold of the green sphere, she aimed it at Elena and activated its magical powers, focusing the energies at the blond girl's feet so that her nightgown wouldn't shrink with her. Tifa smiled as she watched Elena diminish in size, eventually becoming so small that she disappeared into her pink cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa gently moved her hand into the garb to find the shrunken little girl. She absolutely didn't want to wake her and therefore picked her up as careful as she could. The sight of Elena lying there naked in the palm of her hand sleeping soundly made Tifa smile like never before. She had almost completely forgot about her mission with the others in Avalanche. All she wanted to do now was to play with this little doll like there was no tomorrow. She had a plan all figured out and it would be one heck of a \"revenge\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing Elena next to the table lamp that Tifa herself had been tied to, the young martial artist started to search for tools she could use in her upcoming little game. Since she had already shattered Elena's golden necklace, Tifa needed some sort of replacement to tie Elena with. Luckily she found it in the form of a shoelace from one of Elena's shoes. With a little creativity she also decided to pick up some other items she managed to find - a cell phone set on vibration, some cotton swabs, as well as a very delicate pencil brush. Her whole body was tingling from the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her preparations Tifa noticed that Elena was slowly waking up. She quickly tied the shoelace to the Turk member's arms. As a final act before everything started, Tifa dressed herself in the same nightgown Elena had slept in. It was way too small for her - especially around the chest - but Tifa wanted to tease her little lover as mush as possible. With a giggle she approached the table and leaned towards it, observing Elena as she was waking up from her sleep. The tiny girl moaned quietly and slowly opened her eyes. Tifa felt like a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, little sunshine...\" Tifa said with a sensual voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena looked confused and was all dizzy at first. Realizing she was both tied and naked made her regain her conscious faster, but she was still not sure if this was just a dream or not. All that Elena could see in front of her was two gigantic mountains of flesh - Tifa's towering chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...Tifa?\"</span></div></div>",

Unperturbed by her bondage, and still she close enough to enjoy Tifa's chest, Elena ignored her entrapment and began to play. The tiny girl stuck out her tiny tongue and began to lick Tifa's bountiful breasts, greedily tasting every inch she could reach. A soft moan came from above, but was not heard by Elena, who hadn't payed the rest of this goddess's body any mind since waking up, though she somehow knew in the back of her mind that it was indeed Tifa's gorgeous breasts that she was now enjoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa, for her part, enjoyed the tiny girl's touches. She had intended to do a whole \"revenge\" speech and instill some fear into her little prisoner before manipulating her little body, but the shrunken Elena had gotten the jump on her. Despite being smaller Elena somehow had taken control of Tifa again! But Tifa didn't mind as she loved the feel of the smaller girl's tiny ministrations on her large, sensitive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena didn't care about being small or tied up or anything else, or she might have, but her shrunken state of enhanced ecstasy combined with her half-asleep brain left her reeling for pleasure anyway she could get, or give, it. So Elena continued to lick and suck and play with the soft, malleable and giant treasures before her. Her reach was limited by her bindings, which so far had only been a nuisance in restraining her fun, and not the torment they were intended for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa could only take so much before her nipples started to harden. Elena smiled wildly at this and wanted to give her attention to the pink nubs before her, but the poor girl was blocked by her own shirt, that Tifa now wore. Tifa moaned and looked down at her tiny lover, seeing her distress and feeling her own, the larger girl opened her far-too-small shirt and allowed the shrunken woman access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh... Here you go, Elena!\" Tifa whispered sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this should been rational to the shrunken woman, but in her dreamlike state of mind, Elena didn't care for being \"rational\", She just wanted Tifa's massive breasts all to herself, and she was going to take her time enjoying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa moaned softly from above her little pet. The tiny girl was working her tongue expertly on her nipple, nearly bringing her to a state of ecstasy not unlike the one she had been in when their roles were reversed. Even though Tifa had been the smaller one for their whole relationship so far, Elena was proving herself to be quite skilled while shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Elena..!\" Tifa blurted out between moans.</span></div></div>",

The blonde girl seemed to have a talent for both perfect fondling and how to stimulate Tifa's nipple in a way that shouldn't be possible for a person her size. Maybe Tifa still had some sensitive energies left in her from her latest shrinking adventure, or was it simply just Elena's delicate handling that made her feel so extremely good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer it continued the harder it got for Tifa to resist Elena. She begun making movements towards her own gender and let her fingers gently caress her labia and clitoris. Soon, she was both wet and very aroused from the intimate handling of her private parts, and her look once again fell upon the Transform Materia. How tempting it was to shrink down to a few inches again and just give in to all the pleasure. The urge to become as small as Elena was so overwhelming that Tifa started to reach for it, but right before touching the magical green sphere she stopped. She tried to resist it with every part of her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No... I... I need to focus. I can't be this submissive to a doll-sized Turk! I can enjoy myself when I shrink again later. I just have to endure.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new-found strength, Tifa managed to suppress her strong desire. She switched from the materia and instead reached for two different objects - the brush and the cell phone she had prepared earlier. Before using them, she pushed her enormous breasts towards her tiny friend, regaining the initiative. She then pushed them against each other and gently squeezing Elena in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aah... playtime is finally over you little rascal. Here comes your punishment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena gasped with excitement. If this was her punishment she didn't want it to stop. Being pushed against Tifa's soft, fragrant breasts was pure 7th heaven. It all felt like a really good massage which made the naked shrunkette even more horny. Just when she was getting used to it, her goddessly lover stopped. The tiny Turk looked up at Tifa with disappointment and a feeling of intense craving for more. Tifa did not waste any time and immediately placed the huge cell phone under Elena's butt. Tifa smiled when she saw just how clueless her little prisoner was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you will get it eventually little one. Are you ready now? Make sure you don't pee yourself!\" Tifa said with a grin. Without saying anything more she spread Elena's legs apart with two fingers, grabbed the brush again and slowly moved it towards Elena's body. She could only imagine how good it would feel for her blonde partner.</span></div></div>",

The small bristles of the brush only added to the feeling as they explored her most sacred of places, and doubly enhanced by the shrinking materia's effects, well known to the girls as they played with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! Tiifaaaa!\" Elena squealed in delight as a powerful orgasm shook her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa had a satisfied look on her face as she watched the tiny girl's body spasm on the desk below. Tifa slowed her pace with the brush to a teasing speed. Her little lover seemed to enjoy it as she tried to grind herself into it even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was caught in the most powerful orgasm she had ever experienced and could hardly stand up. But with her wrists tied tightly to the lamp, Elena was forced to stand and take it as wave after wave of pleasure erupted and shook her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, Tifa withdrew the pencil brush and allowed Elena to relax. The poor shrunken girl was left standing limply after it was over, her little sweat-covered body heaving with every deep breath she took. Elena just hung there and let herself be supported by her binds. She kept her head down to the desk below, almost as if she were ashamed of what had just transpired. But Tifa could see from the look on Elena's face that the tiny woman enjoyed their little playtime together. Tifa smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope you enjoyed that, my little doll...\" Tifa said airily, as she reached over and released Elena from her bindings, making the tiny blonde plop down on the desk. Tifa paused for a moment to enjoy the sight of the shrunken Elena collapsed on the desk, and started to really enjoy taking charge like this. \"Because now it's my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena jolted her head up, a big grin adorning her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, mistress!\" Elena cried ecstatically.</span></div></div>",

Her skin had become warm from the little game they've had with her breasts, and the idea of having a tiny girl crawling around on her body made her even more excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant martial-artist decided it was time to remove the night gown she was wearing since it had played it's part. With a little poke on both shoulder-straps, Tifa's pink clothing fell to the floor and once again revealed her naked and almost goddess-like form to her plaything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like when Tifa had been small, Elena had a difficult time controlling the incredible desires of her minuscule body. The view of Tifa standing there in all her towering glory was such a turn-on for the tiny Turk that her sexual desires rekindled in a flash. Since her mind felt no shame or limitations she immediately started caressing herself, with one hand moving over her left nipple and the other playing passionately over her soaking gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all just pure lust. Elena had developed feelings for Tifa, and just thinking about how they had kissed - and even embraced each-other - made her cheeks all red. Right now, in this tiny form, Elena loved that voluptuous girl, and being a doll was far better than being a Turk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa smiled as she observed Elena's cute little reaction to her naked form. It made her feel both beautiful and powerful, while at the same time also caring deeply for the tiny one. It made her happy that this was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you a little rascal...\" Tifa said as she put her open hand down in front of the blond woman. She gently pushed her on to her palm and then slowly started walking towards the tent's only bed. The tiny little girl felt both warm and wet, and Tifa was sure she would feel the exact same way in a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... not even in my wildest dreams would I think I'd be sharing bed with the enemy and playing with one like I was a goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pruh... PREVIOUS enemy... mistress...\" Elena moaned in response, almost feeling worried for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sorry sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avalanche fighter crawled down into Elena's bed, laid on her back and started to make herself comfortable. She grabbed her lover in both arms so that Elena was hanging loose in the air, deliberately denying her any possibility of caressing herself. Tifa giggled and carefully kissed the tiny one over her belly and breasts, before finally moving her down between her legs. Tifa's heart was racing. She was getting so excited now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Elena. If I moan too loudly I'll just shrink myself too. Hopefully your... associates... won't find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena herself was in awe. Her body skyrocketed into excitement as soon as she made contact with Tifa's enormous and wet labia.The giant woman's scents was so seducing and slowly pushed Elena towards a trance-like state. Within seconds she managed to find Tifa's clitoris, and as soon as she started to stimulate it with her lips, tongue and breasts, Elena could hear her owner moan quietly in the distance. This was heaven.</span></div></div>",

Tifa did her best to cover herself even more, trapping the poor little Elena between her labia as she closed her legs. Wearing her nightgown really made Tifa's figure more defined. Her chest felt tight and the cloth barely covered the lower parts of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what... h-hnn.. are you even doing here?\" Tifa whispered while trying trying to suppress her strong desires. The situation was extremely embarrassing for her as she had been caught right in the middle of her act. She could still feel every move Elena made down there, bringing her even closer to yet another wonderful orgasm. How much had Yuffie seen exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to steal ma... I mean.. here to rescue you!\" Yuffie said, suddenly shifting the subject and not sounding the slightest bit truthful. She had already caught the attention of the Transform Materia at the desk. This meant trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing with her mouth open and removing sweat from her forehead, Tifa realized she had forgotten Avalanche for a moment. After being hit with something in the head and swept away by that river, she hadn't given Yuffie much fought at all. The little trickster probably had all her shrunking clothes in her pocket, including the underwear she had played with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rescue... m-me? Hnn.. that's funny,\" Tifa mumbled. \"I recall you... ahh... shrinking me to the size of a \"Shinra doll\" when I was bathing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, weeell... you were kind of threatening me so I just took precautions!\" Yuffie said with a smile. \"Are you still mad about that? Let bygones be bygones!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent feel silent, with only Elena making noises beneath the bed sheet, still doing everything to reach Tifa's peak. The two Avalanche members had a quick look at the Transform Materia before they stared into each-others eyes. Then suddenly they both lunged forward towards it, hoping to be the first one to grab it. Tifa was at a major disadvantage since being both dizzy, so close to her climax, and in bed, but she was committed to reach it before her female \"friend\".</span></div></div>",

So she ran along the upstream of the river, her large breasts bouncing slightly underneath her arm, to get back to the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I get back to camp, I'll give Yuffie a beating she'll never forget!\" Tifa thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa hoped to be able to get inside her tent without being seen by the guys, so she could get some clothes on. But then she remembered something, she still had some clothes that were still by the lake! At least, she hoped they were, she never did see Yuffie take them with her, the little thief probably just ran off with what little materia Tifa had left on her equipment at the time. With her mind made up, Tifa made her way back to the lake to get her clothes back, and then it was off the teach Yuffie a lesson!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Tifa, the forest she was in was rather densely packed with trees and shrubbery, which provided the nude fighter with some good cover, so she could easily hide herself if anyone showed up. But another stroke of luck for the naked young woman was that nobody did, she didn't even run into any monsters on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tifa was almost back to the lake where this whole ordeal began. Being extra cautious in case of a hiding Yuffie, Tifa snuck up to the lakeside, hiding behind a large rock. Tifa scanned the area, looking for any sign of Yuffie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was sure it was safe to, Tifa ran out from her cover, without bothering to cover herself anymore, and was about to snatch up her clothes when she realized something, they were still tiny! Tifa picked up her miniature shirt and held it in front of her face, ready to grow it back to her size. In its current state, the tiny shirt looked like something only a doll could wear. Tifa laughed at the sight of the tiny thing, to think that she was actually small enough to wear it not even an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, it does look pretty cute, though.\" Tifa thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa realized that the more she looked at the shrunken clothes, the more she just wanted to shrink herself back down to 6 inches tall and wear them again. It was as if she had forgotten about the dangers, or she just didn't care. She even went so far as to think that it'd just be faster to shrink herself and put them and then grow back to normal, instead of just growing them back one by one. Eventually her mind was made up, and Tifa held the materia in front of herself and activated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, materia! Make me small again!\" Tifa said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe materia flashed a bright light and soon Tifa was a nude, shrunken woman once again, standing only 6 inches tall. Tifa quickly gathered up her shrunken clothes, now normal size to the tiny fighter, and put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. That's better!\" Tifa happily chimed, now fully dressed again. \"Alright then, time to get back to normal!\"</span></div></div>",

So she activated the materia again and quickly shot up to her normal size. With her clothes and size now back to normal, Tifa gathered her things, but noticed that all her materia were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuffie..!\" Tifa thought, knowing the culprit. \"You'll pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of getting her sweet, sweet revenge on Yuffie ran through the busty brunette's mind as she headed back to camp. It was a short walk to get there, and Tifa didn't waste any time. In almost no time at all Tifa was looking at the little campsite the party had made. But Tifa knew how Yuffie thought, if there was place where she would ambush her, it would be just outside the camp. A risky move for the materia thief, but one she might just be able to pull off. Keeping a look out for the young thief, Tifa cautiously approached the edge of the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No games, Yuffie?\" Tifa thought as she crept up to the campsite. \"Fine then. We'll settle this soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa relaxed, taking a deep breath, and entered the camp.

So she searched the camp for any signs of Yuffie, while being extra careful not to be caught by one of her sneak attacks. Asking around the camp, she found out that nobody had seen Yuffie since around the time Tifa had gone to the lake earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding no help from her fellow party members, and no sign of the treacherous thief anywhere else, Tifa realized that the only place she had yet to look, was her own tent. Tifa slowly peered inside her tent, looking for Yuffie, when she didn't see her anywhere, Tifa cautiously entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyaah!\" A female voice suddenly cried out from above Tifa, who was promptly knocked down to on the ground. She was now pinned down, locked in a submission hold, by none other than Yuffie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!

Yuffie clumsily tried to break free, pushing her hands into Tifa's face, but this only seemed to enrage the fighter even more. Soon both girls were grabbing at each others faces. But Tifa had to use on arm to keep Yuffie down, and now Yuffie saw a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa, you stupid..!\" Yuffie shouted, taking her chance. With a nimble kick to Tifa's arm, she managed to knock the fighter down. Yuffie quickly got to her feet, and Tifa did the same. \"... Just give it up, you overinflated cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa twitched in rage at the insult. \"Grr..! Do you mean this?\" Tifa sneered, holding up the shrinking materia, which started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" Yuffie gulped, realizing that Tifa was activating the materia's powers. She quickly rolled out of the way. Her dodge worked, and one of Tifa's item chests ended up taking the hit of shrinking energy and reducing down to 6 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little brat!\" Tifa shouted. \"Let's try again, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa tried to activate the materia again, but this time Yuffie was already onto the fighter's plan, and charged right into Tifa, who dropped the materia before it could activate. Tifa reacted by quickly throwing the younger girl off of her and made a break for the materia. But Yuffie wasn't out yet, she grabbed at Tifa's leg and tripped her up at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they both heard someone outside the tent, \"Hey, Tifa, are you okay in there?\" The person asked. Seems their little quarrel had got the attention of someone after all. But the two mostly ignored whoever it was outside and continued their fight. Which was about to come to an end, as they both knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out Yuffie's tripping of Tifa proved to not be completely in her favor, as the well-endowed fighter had landed right next to the materia.

She recognized the person as none other than Cloud, the spiky blond haired leader of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuffie?\" He asked. \"What are you doing in Tifa's tent? And where is Tifa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Cloud's voice, Tifa tried to shout and tell him where she was, but unfortunately, her cries were muffled by Yuffie's cleavage. The six inch tall fighter tried squeezing her way out of her fleshy prison, but her squirming only caused her to get even more stuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Cloud, I was just... Um...\" Yuffie nervously said, giving her chest a quick, hard pat to silence to shrunken woman buried beneath inside her cleavage. This didn't go unnoticed by Cloud, who gave her a strange look. In an attempt to divert his attention, Yuffie quickly scanned the area to make up some sort of reason she would be in Tifa's tent. \"I was just... Looking for this!\" She exclaimed, picking up the chest that had been shrunken in her fight with Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that? A little treasure chest?\" Cloud asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yep! That's what it is!\" Yuffie awkwardly laughed. \"Tifa was just keeping it for me for a little bit, its got a lot of my materia and... Stuff in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud didn't look convinced, but was more concerned with where Tifa was at the moment. \"So where's Tifa?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" Yuffie said. \"Haven't seen her since she went to the lake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lake? What lake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doh! Cloud didn't know about, did he?\" Yuffie thought. \"She, uh, said she was going to go to some lake nearby for awhile. Heh, didn't she tell you?\" Yuffie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she just told me she was going for a walk.\" Cloud replied. \"You know, Yuffie, you're acting suspicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Yuffie thought. \"He's onto me! What do I do!?\" Yuffie was panicking in her head, her mind running wild with thoughts of what she should do, although she kept a somewhat normal demeanor on the outside. She wasn't sure what do to, but she knew she couldn't dare shrink Cloud too, lest her secret <i>really</i> be revealed.

She couldn't, but feeling her struggling in her cleavage didn't make Yuffie feel very confident about getting away with shrinking her \"friend\".

I better go look for Tifa, incase something happened to her.\" Cloud says. \"You be on the look out for her as well, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Cloud.\" Yuffie said, giving Cloud a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Cloud left the tent to search for Tifa. Completely unaware of the fact that the fighter was currently shrunken down to 6 inches tall and stuffed inside Yuffie's cleavage. Something that Yuffie was well aware of, because Tifa wouldn't stop squirming in there, and Yuffie could feel every little movement of hers. She thought that it would be a pleasurable sensation, feeling Tifa rubbing all over her breasts, but Tifa seemed to be making sure Yuffie wouldn't be able to enjoy it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie had half a mind to take out her little doll right then and there, but then she thought it would be better to leave the scene of the crime and head back to her own tent for some \"fun\" with Tifa. Then again, she could make things more comfortable for herself first. Yuffie reached into her cleavage and pulled out the shrunken Tifa, who immediately began kicking and screaming at Yuffie to make her big again. Yuffie rolled her eyes at the tiny woman and clenched her fist tightly to shut her up, it only took a few seconds of this torture to leave Tifa gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making me very upset, little Tifa doll, not to mention uncomfortable! I think I'd better shrink you to a more manageable size!\" Yuffie threatened the shrunken woman, holding up the materia for greater emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Yuffie! Not again!\" Tifa begged, not wanting to go back down to 2 inches tall again. \"I'll behave, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Yuffie pretended to think about it. \"I don't think so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" Tifa cried as the materia activated, quickly shrinking the already small fighter to an even smaller 2 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Yuffie cheered. \"Much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa fell down in defeat on Yuffie's giant hand, which now seemed to be even more so to the twice shrunken woman. She'd been so small before, but the last time she wasn't being held captive so high in the air, an escape from such height didn't seem likely to the 2 inch tall fighter. So she sat, quietly whimpering in the normal size, but giant to her, thief's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and if you ever try to escape again...\" Yuffie coldly began. \"Well, let's just say we'll see what happens to people shrunk by the materia three times in row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first things first.\" Yuffie thought. \"Time to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie again stuffed Tifa into her cleavage, although this time Tifa didn't bother screaming or doing much really. At Tifa's new size, she fit snugly and discretely between the young thief's breasts. With her tiny slave kept neatly in place, Yuffie happily strolled all the way back to her tent, anyone who saw her was none the wiser about what she was currently hiding inside her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Yuffie was back at her own tent, she removed Tifa from her cleavage again and placed her tiny doll and held her on her hand. Looking down at her tiny captive, Yuffie reveled in at how pathetic and completely defeated she looked at her tiny size. She loved having Tifa in the palm of her hand, literally! Yuffie smiled grimly as she thought about all the things she could now do to the shrunken fighter.</span></div></div>",

The flowers stems are much stronger at this height, so they don't break as easily when you hug...er...squeeze them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie had a quizzical look at first, then she stood up, \"At your height, you'd still break them of you jumped on or kicked them right?\" she stepped away and retrieved the materia and Aerith's clothes. \"Then that means I'll have to get smaller than you,\" She put down the clothes and found a stick about 2 feet long, which she drove into the ground. then she took her arm shield and placed to stand against the stick, this is so we can find our way out if we get lost.\" she said to Aerith, who now had the same look of surprise that Yuffie did only moments before. Yuffie held the Materia and she dwindled away in its light, even smaller than Aerith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Aerith looked down to see Yuffie had stopped shrinking at just above her knee. \"Hah, at two inches tall, this field of flowers is the greatest forest ever!\" she looked at Aerith, \"And just so you don't feel uncomfortable, I'll undress too!\" she took off her clothes quickly and flung them by Aertih's next to the stick and materia.

If she had to guess, she was about five hundred feet from her normal sized arm shield, which would equate to about 15 real feet.

It moved so fast, she thought she imagined it, and went back to the flower. There, it moved again, she turned her head to follow it, but she saw nothing. Tifa clenched her fist, glancing amongst the flowers. \"What is it?\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So she's looking for me, eh?' Yuffie thought to herself, hiding behind a clump of flowers. Yuffie scanned Tifa's positioning, Her knee was on the ground, a perfect boarding ramp. \"Heh heh, time to test my prowess.\" she shot from her hiding place, and a split second later, the ground quaked, Tifa had planted her fist from the spot Yuffie had came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa pulled her hand back from the spot she saw the thing move. \"I must have just missed it,\" she said examining her glove covered with merely dirt. Her eye caught movement and she zoned in on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie lunged to the right as another fist crashed down at her, she slipped through the grass without disturbing it as to throw off her extremely dangerous target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa pulled her fist back again and tried to see where the thing was going, but she didn't see the grass moving at all. Had she gotten it? She decided to stand up and back away from the meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie saw her getting up, and took that oppurtunity to dash towards Tifa's rising knee. she leapt nearly 8 whole inches before making contact with the surface, then took off as fast as she could up the slick leather of the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa slapped at her knee. Whatever was in the grass, it was now on her! grabbed at the little devil as quickly as she could. then she felt it crawling up her back. She stood up and threw her shoulders side to side, trying to it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie was hanging on to the largest, most dangerous, and buckingest Chocobo in all of existance suddenly it stopped and every thing was covered in shadow. she looked up and saw the green and brown earth getting very close, very fast, she used the wind sheer to launch her over Tifa's shoulder just as a massive THUD made her sprawl for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa thought she had gotten the thing for a second as she started sitting up, but then she felt something tumble down into her shirt. she reached in and tryed to find what it was, she thought she felt what might have been a leg, but she got fed up with trying to blindly grab some tiny creature. she pulled her suspenders off her shoulders and pulled off her shirt, throwing it to the ground, revealing her rather full white bra. she saw that whatever it was was still in the shirt. she lifted her foot, bringing her knee as high as it would go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TIFA, NO!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream caught her so off guard, Tifa pushed off with the foot she was standing on and stamped at an angle, launching her into an awkard front flip over her shirt. she landed with a thud and quickly sat up, looking this way and that for the origin of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith ran forward, hoping Tifa would recognize her before striking. \"Tifa don't do it! It's Yuffie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa heard the voice, but didn't hear what it said until several seconds later. Even then It was still registering as she saw Aerith standing next to her elbow at six inches tall, and quite nude. \"Aerith?\" the words started to click, \"Oh my god!!\" she spun around and picked up the hem of the shirt and reached in. She found somehting solid and pulled it out. In her hand was a two inch tall Yuffie. Also quite nude. Tifa's mind went blank, she had almost killed her own teammate. Unless, she was already dead from being thrown to the ground at a relative 70 miles per hour. she brought her palm to her face and examined the tiny girl. there didn't seem to be any blood, but spinal damage was just as lethal. Then she noticed her abdomen rising and lowering slightly. she gave a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa! Let me see her!\" Aerith took a step back as Tifa's hand descended with the injured, miniscule ninja to her level. Aerith held out her hands in front of her, \"Breath of Life.\" a strong wind picked and seemed to circle Aerith as Yuffie's body glowed with a green light.

Her joy was reduced somewhat when she noticed the now huge materia orb lying near her, now unusable for her. She appeared to be about 10ft in real terms from her garden bed. From her small height she struggled to judge where her house was from there, but she decided that she must get there to await aid. Aerith aimlessly walked in one direction, keeping ever alert in case a bug thought it could get a free meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith heard faint tremors in the distance and she soon identify them as footsteps. She turned towards the direction of the sound and futily stood on her toes to try and see above the mass of grass swamping the area. \"Maybe its Cloud,\" she thought, \"He'll help me get the materia back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck. The figure came closer and the tremors became more intense until Aerith was knocked to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got the first glimpse of her savior, the first thing she saw was the large black boots. Following the legs upwards she saw the person was wearing very tight black shorts. Further up was a stretched grey t-shirt struggling to hold two immense breasts of ridiculous proportion. When she finally saw the face of this mysterious person she identified her as Tifa, her competition in the battle for Cloud's love but also your companion. What could she be doing here? Aerith wondered. She passed Aerith while she pondered Tifa's reason for coming, and she chase after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone could help me now.\" she thought. \"I just need someone to know I'm here.\" Tifa was knocking on the door when Aerith finally emerged form the grass. She hid just in the grass by her front door and watched her. \"Aerith!\" she called. \"Are you there? I need to see you about something really important! I need to borrow some of your materia for a mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Tifa gave up on yelling and decided to wait for her return. She now had a choice...</span></div></div>",

As she was about to leave she spotted the tiny Aerith shuffling forward out of the grass. Tifa quickly got on her hands and knees and stared at the shrunken girl. Aerith began to think maybe that this was not a good idea. The voluptuous body of her comrade hung over her head and she turned to run back into the grass. Tifa quickly snatched her up in her hand and brought her up to her face. Dangling the tiny woman by her top she looked carefully just to be sure it was Aerith. \"TIFA!!!\" Aerith cried. \"TIFA! YOU MUST HELP ME!!\" Tifa heard this and a shiver went down her spine. To think that she had complete power over Aerith and that with one movement of her finger, she could end a life. \"This could be some good entertainment. A little slave for my own. Before I have my fun, i must find out how this happened. I don't want her returning to normal. Then I'll finally get Clouds attention\" These thoughts ran through her head as she cradled Aerith (Who had now huddled up at the edge of her palm. \"Aerith,\" she soothed, \"I'm not going to hurt you. Tell me what happened and I\u2019ll help you.\" Aerith looked up at the smiling face of Tifa. She smiled back and explained about the materia. Tifa listened intently and then went to fetch it from the garden bed. Aerith sat patiently waiting for Tifa. \"She's really not such a bad person,\" She thought \"I hope after this ordeal we'll become good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa returned with the materia in her pocket and she carried Aerith inside. Placing Aerith and the materia on the table they both examined the materia. Aerith approached the materia and as she extended her hand to use it, Tifa grabbed it and held it up in the air. \"Tifa! What are you doing!\" Aerith yelled. Tifa smirked and crushed the materia in her hand. The glowing green shards hit the floor and faded to nothing. Aerith gaped at this act of betrayal. She tried to run but Tifa pinched her foot and dangled her in the air. Tifa laughed at the flailing creature and carried her over to the bed. Tifa layed on the bed and put the screaming Aerith in her mouth. She fondled the tiny woman with her tongue; pushing her against the roof of her mouth and coating her in saliva. When Tifa finally released her from her mouth, she dropped Aerith on the bed sheets. Aerith lay panting, drenched in saliva. Tifa smiled at her prize. \"Awww, lets get you out of those wet clothes. Tifa carefully stripped Aerith of her sopping wet clothes and put them on the bedside table. Aerith tried to cover her body but Tifa pinched her arm and playfully stroked her with her finger. \"Let me go!\" Aerith screamed. \"You just want Cloud all for yourself. The only reason anyone would like you is because of your big tits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa frowned at her. \"You may regret that later sweetie\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ideally Cloud would pass them by, they would recover the materia and restore themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud noticed three distinct pairs of clothing piled in the campsite, and of course unique dress style allowed him to identify the owners of the garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm\", he mused, \" i suppose they may have gone for a bath in the lake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe pondered a moment whether it would be tactful to...

He picked it up and studied it, curiously he found himself unable to determine it's purpose from observatin, and being a SOLDIER had taught him not to be foolish enough to test unknown materia at the drop of a hat.

During a mission to enter the mysterious Magitek Factory in the city of Vector they had all been captured by the Empire's soldiers and thrown into prison. Their friends would not know anything about it. Not wanting to wait for their punishment, the three desperately tried to come up with something in order to get out. Locke worked on the prison doors lock, without any result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use\" Locke said. \"I need better tools to get this door open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Locke, at least you tried!\" said Terra with a sigh while comforting the thief and self-proclaimed treasure hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the two sat Celes on a bed. She had been observing Locke's efforts to get the door open. She got up and walked towards her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you require to get the door open Locke?\" said the blonde ex-general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, basically a lock pick, but the guards took that from me. This door lock have something similar to buttons, but without a tool to enter the keyhole, it's impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let me try something. I know a spell that might just do the trick!\" Celes answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, be my guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles went further back into the cell, away from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, stand back. I need some space to perform this one...\" Celes said. She closed her eyes and raised her hands towards her body with open palms. She began to concentrate and started to channel magic. Her hair began to blow in different directions, even though there was no wind. At first Locke and Terra had no idea what kind of spell it was that Celes was casting, but moments later it was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Celes... you're shrinking!\" Terra said in shock.</span></div></div>",

Tiny!\" Terra gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra got down on her hands and knees to get a better look at the shrunken woman. Celes looked up at her, at her viewpoint Terra was a relative giantess. She could see a look of wonder and surprise on Terra's face as the green haired girl examined her shrunken friend. With childlike curiosity, Terra reached out and gently poked Celes' tiny form with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Celes cried, and backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" Terra was quick to apologize. \"It's just, you're so small... It's almost unreal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke walked over to see the tiny woman as well, and to said tiny woman he was an even bigger giant than Terra. But their sizes didn't intimidate Celes, because even though she didn't use the spell often, she had used it enough to become used to seeing normal sized people from this height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Terra.\" Locke started. \"After all we've seen, this is what surprises you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra stood up and looked Locke in the eye, she said, \"Well, I've never seen such a spell before! Have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I've heard of such spells being used in old times.\" Locke answered, then turned his attention to Celes. \"Anyway, Celes. It's an impressive spell, but why would you do such a thing to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you needed something to pick the lock, right?\" Celes shouted up to the \"giant\" people above her. \"I just thought that if I was small enough, then <i>I</i> could get inside the lock and open it from there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see!\" Locke said. \"That's not a bad idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke crouched down next to Celes' tiny from, and lowered a hand for her to get onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's try it!\" Locke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles smiled and nodded up to the giant. She ran up to and climbed on top of Locke's hand, where she was raised up into the air. Sitting in Locke's hand was an interesting experience for her, she'd been around people at this size before, but was never held. She found it was actually quite a comfortable ride.<br>\r\nLocke on the other hand, was eager to open the cell door and escape. He pay too much mind to the fact that he was holding Celes in his palm. He was quick to offer his hand to her earlier, but even so, he caught his face turning ever so slightly red now that she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke carried Celes over to the lock on the door to get it open...</span></div></div>",

It was all pretty simple, or so Locke said. Then Locke put the hand Celes was on next to the lock, and she crawled in to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke and Terra waited for their tiny friend to do her thing outside. They couldn't see her from there, but they heard a click sound whenever she pressed the buttons. One click after another until finally, Celes came out of the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that did it..!\" Celes shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work!\" Locke said, he held his hand out for her to climb back onto, which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the lock fell from the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

She ran to the doll-like blonde in the green swimsuit and also got down on her knees in order to tend to her friend. \"Are you alright? Are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... no use.\" Celes said panting. \"I'm okay, but I used too much power when I made myself this small. I'm all out of mana! For the moment, I'm stuck like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke looked worried, but for a different reason. He was still standing at the door keeping a close eye on the corridor outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Footsteps. I hate to say this girls, but I think someones coming! We got company!\"</span></div></div>",

She knew the guard would be at their cell soon, and she worried about Celes being discovered at her tiny size. Terra glanced back to Celes, who had recovered most of her strength, but was still stuck small. Terra looked at the tiny ex-general with a look of regret, she hoped that Celes would understand why she had to do what she was about to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Celes..!\" Terra whispered quietly to her shrunken friend. \"I have to hide you somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean..?\" Celes asked, worried about the way Terra was looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra said nothing. She quickly snatched up the tiny woman and opened her shirt. Celes looked down and saw this, but had no time to say anything or really react at all before Terra dropped her. She screamed as she fell the short distance to Terra's cleavage and landed snugly between her larger friends breasts. Celes barely had time to look up at Terra's large face before the green haired girl closed her shirt, effectively hiding Celes' tiny form in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" She heard Terra whisper from above. \"But this is the only way I could think of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Terra's outfit had no pockets, so she really didn't have a better place to hide the inch tall Celes.<br>\r\nTerra turned her attention back to the outside of the cell. The guard was nearly at their cell, she hoped that he hadn't seen her hide her tiny friend in her bra. But it soon became apparent that he was there for another reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Enough talking in there!\" The guard shouted as he approached the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, boss.\" Locke said. \"Didn't mean to disturb your nap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch! You little..!\" The guard shouted. \"Don't get smart with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard then grabbed Locke by the collar of his jacket, and held him up to the bars of the cell. The thief struggled in his grasp. The guard seemed to enjoy his agony and held him up for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, stop!\" Terra cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked at the girl and grimaced, then he let go of Locke, who fell to the floor and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" The guard said. \"You'll be getting yours soon enough anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard then turned around and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Locke!\" Terra cried, running to the thief's aid. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Locke said, still a little winded. \"Good thing he's not too observant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra wondered what Locke meant by that, but then Locke stepped away from the door. He then gently pushed the door, and it opened. He motioned for her to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why thank you!\" Terra said, and was about to walk though the cell door when, \"Oh?\" Terra said, she had felt something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra felt Celes struggling around between her breasts. She had almost forgotten to take her out! Terra opened her shirt and gently grabbed Celes out from her cleavage. She held the tiny woman in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry!\" Terra apologized profusely. \"I didn't have a choice, the guard was coming and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Celes shouted, interrupting Terra. The larger girl looked at her apologetically. \"I understand, but please give me a warning before you do something like that again..!\" Celes said, but still looked a little upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Terra softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke watched the scene, he stifled a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext..</span></div></div>",

Time to move and seize this opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra hesitated and looked down on the tiny Celes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's for the best if you stay down there for the time being.\" Terra said while blushing slightly. \"As long as it's okay with you, that is.\" In a way she kind of liked having Celes between her breasts. It was a tingling sensation, somewhat exciting, and it felt good protecting a friend like this. Or at least as long as it wasn't the womanizer Edgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles were blushing too. After all, she was trapped around warm, soft skin that smelled kind of nice. She felt safe in a way, but was too proud to admit it. She was a warrior and not used to being treated like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I dunno...\" Celes stuttered. \"Perhaps it would be better if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts!\" Terra interrupted with sudden confidence. \"You'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the half-human half-esper closed her shirt again and started running, paying no attention to the tiny girl under her clothes. It became somewhat of a bumpy ride for poor Celes. During her time between Terra's breasts she got to experience how bouncy they really could be. Outside there was a lot of stuff going on - running, jumping, crawling and fighting. Celes was thrown around without control. The warm skin became even warmer, and somewhat sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time passed it became more and more difficult to remain in the cleavage. Celes had nothing to hold on to and were beginning to slip down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate I'll fall out!\" Celes thought with panic. \"I need to grab on to something fast!\"</span></div></div>",

Emitting a soft moan from the green haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" She squeaked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra had felt something brush up against her sensitive nipple and she suddenly halted her running. This small movement jerked Celes from her position in the larger girl's cleavage and caused her to fall out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful in there, Celes!\" Terra whispered to the girl she thought was still in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Celes, Terra didn't have time to bother checking on her. Celes screamed as she fell out of Terra's modest cleavage and further down her shirt. She knew she had to grab onto something or else she'd fall to her doom! So she clawed around in the air, and luckily, was able to grab hold onto the bottom of Terra's shirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles breathed a sigh of relief, she was glad that she didn't end up falling to the ground. She tried to keep a hold onto the bottom of Terra's shirt, but with the larger girl running around, it was difficult to do. She looked way up at Terra, the green haired girl's face loomed far above the tiny Celes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra, I've fallen! Help me!\" She shouted at the larger girl, but to no avail, her voice was to small to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra was oblivious to Celes' little plight as she and Locke escaped the prison. They had been running for a while now. But Locke insisted that they were almost out of the place, she wondered if he was right. Then they came across a ladder that they'd have to climb to get out. Locke went up first, and Terra followed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles meanwhile, was still holding onto the bottom of Terra's shirt. It had only been about a minute or so since she had fallen there, after her shouts had gone unnoticed, she was now ready to try climbing the shirt to get Terra's attention. So she reached up and started her climb, but just as she made her first ascent, Terra was climbing something of her own! Terra's sudden movements combined with Celes only holding onto her shirt with one hand caused the tiny woman to fall even further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles screamed as she fell again, this time...</span></div></div>",

She desperately tried to grab on to something, without success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not what I signed up for!\" Celes yelled while falling fast through the air. She had thought that shrinking herself wouldn't be that big of a deal. She had previously used it during spying missions and other kinds of operations - but in the size of 3 or 4 inches. Being only an inch tall had proved a greater challenge than she ever would have thought, and now she was risking her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer salvation came when Terra suddenly leaned against the ladder for a pause, catching Celes with her own skirt without even knowing it. Celes herself was still screaming and her salvation came as a huge surprise. She felt herself slide in under Terra's skirt and into a much darker domain. She could not believe that she had been saved by such subtle and sudden movements. But without knowing it, the skirt was not the only thing Celes had entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Empire, that was close.\" Celes said as she sat up to regain her composure. She tried to look around, but was still shaken after her near-death experience. After a brief pause, Celes felt that she had slipped into something quite soft. The ground felt like cotton, and the surroundings smelled of a somewhat familiar scent. The space was limited and hard to move in. At least she felt safe for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew. It's even warmer here than between her breasts.\" Celes thought as she started to remove some of her armor to deal with the new damp environment. \"I wonder if I landed in her pocket or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles didn't get to rest for long. After removing both her cape and her shoulder armor, her surroundings started to shake. As Terra started to climb the ladder again, the movement from her legs made Celes tip from one place to the other inside her panties. The tiny general felt helpless as she got pushed into something even more soft, and rubbed against it against her will. It had the shape of a mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles now understood where she was, and she got shivers when she realized it. It all made sense! First of all, Terra had no pockets, which could only mean one thing. She had slipped into Terra's most sacred zone. The mound-thingie was none other than Terra's own womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhn!\" Terra gasped as she felt some unusual activity between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong Terra?\" Locke asked and looked down, briefly halting the ladder climbing. He thought that she was tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no. I'm fine. It's nothing.\" Terra answered. \"Just an odd sensation, that's all.\" She mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends continued to climb and finally made it out into the streets of Vector, the Imperial City. They tried to blend in with other residents as fast as they could. Locke seemed focused, but Terra was thinking of something completely different.</span></div></div>",

She slipped around the damp space trying to get out, but the more she struggled, the more wet and difficult it was to escape. And she could feel Terra's twitching, which made it even harder for the shrunken woman to move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra has to know I'm here by now!\" Celes thought as she continued to try and escape. \"Why hasn't she got me out, yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs bad as Celes had it, Terra was feeling it too. Every little movement she made caused the larger girl to shiver. Sometimes Celes would move just right and it would make Terra's knees bend and she'd be left in an awkward position, and Celes would left in one even more so! The green haired girl wanted nothing more than to let her tiny friend out, but she couldn't dare to do that without some privacy first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Terra tried to stay focused and follow behind Locke, she couldn't quite keep up with him though. But that didn't matter soon, because Locke had stopped in front of a building. Terra, though, was still a ways away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra!\" Locke yelled from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes..?\" Terra muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an inn here.\" Locke replied. \"We should be safe there, for a little while at least. I think we should stay the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" Terra said, not really paying attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Hey, how's Celes doing?\" Locke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's doing good..!\" Terra softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke nodded, none the wiser about what Terra <i>really</i> meant. Him and Terra then went and got a room at the inn. Locke got the room while Terra fidgeted about awkwardly, she had to try and ignore Celes' tiny struggling about in her privates. Terra sighed in relief when Locke finished his transaction, and she ushered him to hurry along to the room. As soon as the two got inside their room, Terra ran to the bathroom, insisting she had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra quickly shut the door and locked it. Now that she was away from Locke she could finally take a moment to let Celes out of her panties. Terra pulled down her skirt and reached into her panties, grabbing the inch tall woman inside them. Celes was sticky and covered in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Finally!\" She heard Celes squeak. Terra felt sorry for the poor woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles looked around, she'd just been jerked out of her fleshy prison, she was relived to be out of there. She looked up and saw Terra, who held the blonde haired woman in her hand. Celes tried to stand up speak to her, but she was all wet and couldn't quite get a grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so, so sorry, Celes!\" Terra apologized. \"I can't believe that happened to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Let's just forget about it...\" Celes said. \"Can you get me cleaned up, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hmm!\" Terra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra ran Celes under the sink. It was cold and the water pressure was strong to the inch tall blonde, but she washed her off well enough. Next, Terra handed her a little towel. Celes took some time to dry herself off. Then, both girls heard Locke's voice coming from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra!\" Locke shouted from behind the door. \"I'm going to try and contact the rest of the group. So I'm going out for a little while, you stay here and keep Celes safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay!\" Terra quickly shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra then heard Locke's footsteps as he walked out the room and she heard the door open and shut. Terra slowly opened the bathroom door and peered out, Locke was indeed gone now. It was just her and the inch tall Celes. Terra looked over at the tiny ex general, who was still drying herself off with the oversized towel, and thought how helpless she looked in her tiny form...</span></div></div>",

Luckily, she still had the skirt on to cover her private parts. She didn't notice the tiny armor left in the panties and just threw the fabric into a warm bucket of water so she could wash them later. She then picked up Celes and held her in the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how cute you are in this form!

She was not good with words, but tried to comfort her the best way she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't say that Terra. Shrinking can be both a blessing and a curse. Depends on the situation I guess. And it drains a lot of mana, that's for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra smiled at Celes. Silence fell on the room again. She looked over at the bathtub and remained silent for a while.

Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean... We both need to get cleaned up anyway..\" Terra replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Terra reply, but what she really wanted was to just spend some more time with the shrunken Celes, in a more intimate setting. Celes being so small was very endearing to the green haired girl, she thought Celes' tiny form made her look cute. But it was something more than that too, something that she couldn't really understand herself. She just knew that she wanted to experience Celes' every tiny move, there was something about her friend being small that, intrigued her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" Celes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?\" Terra asked, she had caught herself staring at the tiny woman before her, and wasn't really paying attention to what she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need a bath.\" Celes repeated. Both girls didn't say anything after that, they just stared at each other silently. Finally Celes spoke, \"But, I'd like to take one with you...\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Terra exclaimed in joy, Celes told her just what she wanted to hear. \"Wait a second, I'll get it ready..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra placed Celes back down onto the sink, and then walked, almost skipping, over to the bath like an excited child. She was excited though, she knew that much. Celes watched her from the sink as she filled the tub with water, and smiled. Celes had to admit she felt more affection for the green haired giantess, ever since she had hid on the larger girl's person. Even with the still rather embarrassing to think about scene before. Terra was just a good friend to her though, one that was just taking care of her. Even now Celes just thought of the bath as her way of taking care of her shrunken friend, and she appreciated the sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ready!\" Terra exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles was ready to take the bath with her bigger friend. But somehow she was somewhat surprised to see Terra strip off her clothes. The green haired giantess was soon standing before Celes in the nude. Celes turned red at the sight. Terra could see her reaction, and tried to make things less awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it...\" She softly started. \"You've seen most all of me already... Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles had to admit that Terra was right. She had seen almost all of her larger friend before, but not like this, not intentionally. Celes didn't know what she expected, they were going to take a bath together after all. After she rationalized that, the mood was lightened somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready...\" Celes said, holding her arms up for Terra to grab her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not.\" Terra said. \"You've still got...\" Terra hesitated, and blushed a little, before continuing, \"Your clothes are on..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles looked down at herself, she was still wearing her clothes. \"Oh... Right..\" She said. Her clothes were wet from her earlier bath in the sink. She had been a little shy about taking them off then, but now it didn't seem like as big of a deal. Celes slipped out of her one piece outfit and stood before Terra naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra blushed deeper from seeing her tiny friend completely nude. Celes was beautiful, Terra could see. She oh so wanted nothing more than to be in that tub with her right now.<br>\r\nTerra kept her cool and went back to the sink and placed her hand down flat next to the tiny Celes. The smaller woman got on. Terra carried her tiny friend to the bath and she stepped into the bath, Celes in hand.<br>\r\nShe slipped down into the warm water and relaxed, it felt quite good after being held up in the prison for so long. Terra then gently lowered Celes into the water. The smaller girl was hesitant to leave Terra's hand, she looked up at Terra's face in the distance, the larger girl smiled warmly at her. It was enough of a confidence boost to make Celes take a dip into the lake-sized bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext..</span></div></div>",

She could hear arguing from the floor below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that?\" she asked Celes. She got down on her knees and put her ear against the floor, paying close attention to the commotion. She put her tiny companion next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I hear it too...\" Celes answered with a low voice, trying to focus on the other conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both tried to listen they could hear at least three voices talking to the owner, all male. They sounded angry and serious. They could also hear something about a threat and the word \"rebels\". The two girls gasped as they looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know we're here!\" Celes yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra got up on her legs again, momentarily exposing her pantyless privates to Celes since the tiny one was standing below her. She ran to do the door to lock it, but it lacked any kind of mechanism to do so. She started to panic and ran back to Celes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do Celes?! They will be here any minute! I'm going to get captured again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to hide somewhere Terra, and fast! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I'm too small to get noticed anyway!\" Celes answered while trying to calm her friend in the best way a tiny girl could in this dire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small... THAT'S IT! I'll try copying your spell and shrink myself as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too dangerous Terra! Do you even remember the spell correctly?\" Celes asked worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any other option.

She was a talented magic user, mostly thanks to her Esper heritage and the Empires training. If anyone could memorize a spell on the first try and flawlessly recreate it, it was Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles hid under one of the beds and looked at the giantess.

But the spell was different for Terra though. Because unlike when Celes shrunk herself, Terra became very disoriented. Her head was spinning as she got smaller and smaller, the longer the process continued the harder she found it to stand up. It got so hard for her that, by the time she was at only half her height, the shrinking green haired girl fell over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra!\" Celes cried. Seeing her friend suddenly collapse was a shock to her, she didn't expect Terra to get the spell down perfectly on her first try, but never expected it to harm the poor girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra was out, she lay on the floor not moving, but still breathing. A fact that eased Celes' worries. But then the tiny blonde heard the footsteps of the Gesthallian empire soldiers louder then ever, and she knew that they were close. She also knew that she'd need to get Terra to safety before they came into the room. <br>\r\nLooking at Terra now, Celes could see that she was only about a foot tall at this point, and rapidly getting smaller. If she ran out now, she'd make it in time to drag a one inch tall Terra under the bed with her. Suddenly, there was loud pounding at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up!\" A deep voice shouted from outside, one of the soldiers no doubt. \"We know you're in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles had to act quickly now. She ran out from her cover under the bed and frantically made her way over to her friend. Her previous estimates were correct, by the time she made it to Terra, the green haired girl was only inch tall, exactly the same height as herself. This made it easy for the tiny blonde to carry her to the hiding spot under the bed. But at almost 10 feet away, at Celes' scale, from the bed, the room's front door burst open and soldiers barged in. Celes picked up her pace, knowing that if she was caught now, it would be near impossible for her to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

She felt terrified and ran as fast as she could back towards the bed, with Terra in her arms. It felt like a minor earthquake when the soldiers suddenly marched into the room. With only a second from being discovered she managed to hide both herself and Terra behind one of the bed's legs. She squeezed Terra close to her chest and tried to make them as small as possible while staying quiet as a mouse. Just the thought of being captured in this size was enough to send shills down Celes' spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing what she did. The soldiers were no slackers. They started searching the place immediately for any sign of rebel activity. They turned the place upside down, checking every corner of the two rooms. One of the soldiers laid down on the floor to check if anyone was hiding under the beds. His face was just inches away from Celes and Terra. The ex-general could almost smell the soldiers foul breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't find us, please don't find us.\" Celes prayed like a mantra in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come and have a look at this!\" one of the soldiers yelled. The man that had been so close to Celes suddenly got up on his feet and went over to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles could hear them talking about the panties in the bucket. Apparently they discussed whether the garment was to be considered evidence or if one of them could keep it as some sort of trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perverts...\" Celes mumbled, relieved that she and Terra hadn't been found. After a couple of minutes it seemed that the soldiers were about to leave room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Search the other rooms! They can't have made it far!\" was the last thing Celes heard before the room went silent again. She immediately turned to Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra! Terra wake up! The soldiers are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely Terra started to wake up. When she saw that she and Celes were about the same height she could do nothing but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it Celes! I managed to cast your spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did sweetie!\" Celes said and gave her now equal tiny friend a warm hug. She then whispered to Terra. \"I think they took your panties...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra blushed a little, then started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...

She had to make her understand how dangerous of a play that was for her to make. Terra had left the cover of the bed and was now taking in the now seemingly giant sights of the room around her. Celes caught up with her and placed a hand on her shoulder, Terra looked at the tiny blonde, when she saw how serious she looked, her own smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a risky thing to do, Terra!\" Celes scolded the green haired girl. \"Shrinking yourself can be extremely dangerous! I'd have never done it to myself if I'd have known I wouldn't be able to grow back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm sorry.\" Terra apologized. She really did understand already about the dangers. As she contemplated them over again, she took another good look at the hugeness of the room. \"This is pretty incredible, tough..!\" Terra exclaimed as she took in her enlarged surroundings with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Celes agreed. Then sternly added, \"But it's also dangerous. If those soldiers had found us, at our size, there would be no way to escape them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...\" Terra softly said. \"It was a reckless act, and I'm sorry. I put not only myself in danger, but you too. But it worked out, so there's nothing to worry about.\" Terra finished with a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles smiled back warmly, stifling a laugh. Terra's confidence and understanding had impressed even the former general. She also had to admit that Terra was right, her plan had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, as long as you understand how risky it was.\" Celes conceded. \"Now then, can you try the growth spell? I don't think it'd do to have two tiny girls running around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, yeah. Imagine the look on Locke's face.\" Terra laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles laughed.

She started mumbling the magic words while trying to attune herself to the magical energies around her. Once she established a connection, Terra tried to visualize the spell and execute it just like Celes had told her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was harder than she thought. but Terra remained focused all the time. Suddenly she let out a gasp. Her body started growing fast and the room lit up in a bright light. Within seconds she was her old self again. Celes looked up at the green haired giantess and held her breath in awe. She was highly impressed of her friend, but couldn't help but to feel a little jealous. Terra had such a greater mana pool to draw from compared to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Terra recovered she scanned the floor for the tiny blonde and then picked her up once she found her. She could see that Celes was a little bit sad over the fact that her mana was so limited. In fact, it wasn't limited at all, Celes had just been unlucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Celes. You'll be big again in no time! Just hang in there!\" Terra said with a comforting voice. The tiny ex-general sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are right. I just makes me grumpy that I can't handle more mana...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles' and Terra's conversation was suddenly interrupted when they once again heard footsteps. Someone was walking up the stairs, but this time it was only one subtle person. The person stopped outside just their door and knocked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me...\" a voice said that could only belong to Locke. Moments later he carefully opened the door and entered the room. He let a sigh of relief when he saw that Terra was unharmed. He gave Terra a hug, making Celes even more jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god you're alright Terra. I began to worry when I saw all those soldiers enter the Inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay Locke. And so is Celes.\" Terra answered and revealed Celes in her hand. \"She helped me use some magic to fool the soldiers. It's all thanks to her that we're still free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Good work Celes! I knew we could trust you!\" Locke said with a big smile, making Celes blush big time. Earning Locke's trust felt nice. Ever since he had freed her from the prison in South Figaro, saving her life, they had both been fond of each other. It was a weird mix of feelings, being both tiny, wearing only a swimsuit and being a life-saver at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three rebels then sat down on one of the beds. Both Locke and Terra kept their voices low, while Celes didn't need to because of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, it's too dangerous to stay here now.\" Locke said to the two girls. \"We better get out of here and leave Vector as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me then?\" Celes asked.</span></div></div>",

Her face became a little flushed when she thought about what had happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure?\" Locke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra nodded, and she held out the hand that Celes was on to the thief. Locke looked down at Celes, she seemed to agree as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's for the best.\" Celes said. \"After all, you have... Pockets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so.\" Locke said, still not getting why the girls looked embarrassed to talk about it. Time was of the essence though, so he wasn't about to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Locke took the tiny Celes from Terra. Holding the shrunken woman in his hand still felt a little strange to him, especially since it had been so long. He didn't want to linger around though, for he knew time was short, and they needed to get out of the town. So he pocketed Celes' tiny form, at her size she fit nicely inside the pocket, and helped Terra get ready to leave. Once everything was ready, the two normal sized people snuck out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles was comfortable inside Locke's pants pocket. There was much more room here then inside, say, Terra's cleavage. And unlike that enclosed space, this hiding spot didn't bounce her around every time her comparatively giant-sized protector moved. But like it, she still couldn't reach the top of it at her size, so she couldn't see where Locke going. But she trusted him to get her and Terra to safety.  She only had a minute or so to take in her little accommodations though, before she felt Locke suddenly stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the pocket, Locke and Terra had just gone down the stairs of the inn. When they came to a corner Locke slowed down, he put his hand out behind him facing Terra, signaling her not to follow. He hunched down and crept around the corner, where he took a peek of the lobby. Guards could be seen just outside the window. His suspicions confirmed, the thief turned back to Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are soldiers out front.\" Locke explained the situation to her quietly. \"We should leave from the back exit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lead the way..!\" Terra whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke and Terra snuck towards the back exit of the inn, there were no windows to see through from this exit though, so they had no way of knowing if there would be any soldiers around. Terra was nervous by this, but Locke chose to push his luck, and...</span></div></div>",

The back exit was their only option, but he still wanted to take the chance and escape Vector as soon as possible. He opened the door and scanned the surroundings. The back door led to an empty quiet back alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see any guards here. The coast is clear Terra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles could barely hear them from the inside of Locke's pocket. She tried to say something, but it became obvious that her tiny voice couldn't reach them without her screaming loudly. She instead chose to remain silent and trust her two friends, even though she wished she could be more useful to them. Then again, being so close to Locke felt like a bonus. Perhaps it was the pocket itself, but she felt a warm sensation in her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Terra and Locke spoke about what do to next, they decided to barricade the exit with some trash cans and garbage, just to be safe. When they were done, the half-human half-esper looked at her thief friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to leave right now Locke. The longer we wait the greater risk we take of getting caught again!\" Terra said with a low voice. Locke seemed to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Let's try to leave this city while we still have a chance then.\" he said and looked down at his pocket. \"Hang tight Celes, we're gonna make a short run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke and Terra started to run as fast as they could. Celes tried to prepare herself the best she could, grabbing on to the fabric of Locke's pocket. But being so tiny was still a disadvantage, even in a big comfortable pocket. As long as Locke was walking there wasn't any problem, but as soon as he started to run, Celes discovered the disadvantages. She was thrown around from one side to the other, which also made her quite dizzy. She screamed from all the bouncing and cursed her situation, wishing for her mana to return to her as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still a lot of people out in the streets, which made it easier for the two rebels to blend in with the crowd. They kept a low profile the whole time and eventually managed to sneak out of the city. As soon as they were a safe distance from Vector, Terra and Locke took a breather. They hugged each other closely, happy it was all over. Then Terra remembered Celes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Locke, you better check that Celes is still in your pocket...\" she said, remembering everything about the \"cleavage incident\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you're right!\" Locke said and looked down on his pocket again. \"Celes? Are you still down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles was all too dizzy from the shaky travel to be able to respond. When she didn't respond it made Locke nervous. He stuck his hand in his pocket to make sure that his friend had not fallen out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles was still recovering from all the shaking and was trying to stand up when she suddenly saw a big hand coming at her. She was totally unprepared for it. She felt an enormous finger touch the front of her body. The force from it was so strong that it dragged her green leotard down to her feet, fully exposing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke thought he heard something that resembled a scream. There was also something stuck on his finger. Curious about what it was, he removed his hand from the pocket to check it out. What he then saw was stuck on his finger made him blush immensely.</span></div></div>",

As she discovered that she was now without clothes, Celes panicked and let out a loud scream. She looked around, desperately trying to find something to cover herself with, but besides herself, Locke's pocket was all empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smart enough to realize that it had all been a terrible accident, but it was still extremely embarrassing for her, as being tiny wasn't enough. Even though she wore something so closely resembling a swimsuit she didn't like the show off her feminine sides. Being totally naked was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered herself in shame and felt anger rise within her. She stood up on her feet and looked up towards the opening of the pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back my clothes you big klutz!\" Celes shouted while blushing like a tomato. When she received no answer, she raised her voice and tried again, but nothing happened. At first it seemed like the poor girl would stay naked for quite some time. To Celes' surprise that wasn't the case. Suddenly she saw the pocket opening up. At the top she could see Locke's finger slowly lowering down her leotard towards her. Just as she thought she would get it back, a gust of wind grabbed on to it, blew off Locke's finger and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for crying out loud!!\" Celes yelled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being tiny was tough enough, but adding involuntary nudity to the mix just made things that much worse for the poor woman. She considered her chances of survival if she just up and jumped out of Locke's pocket now. But for all the troubles of staying in Locke's pocket, she had to admit that it was better than what had happened when she was with Terra, just thinking about it still made the tiny woman twitch. It was that and the high chance that jumping out now would leave her not only stranded, but still tiny and completely nude. Celes sighed. The embarrassment would kill her, but she'd have to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please don't let anyone else see me like this</i>! Celes thought. ...<i> And don't let anything else bad happen</i>... She prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, above Celes' current residence, Locke's pocket, Terra and the thief were still running farther and farther from the city. Locke was thinking about how Celes was holding up down there, he'd have to make it up to her later for sure, thinking that he'd only accidentally removed her clothes, and not lost them as well.<br>\r\nAs the two ran along, Terra was beginning to get a little winded from all the running. She was slowing down, and Locke noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take a break.\" He said. \"We're almost there anyway. Or at least, we should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra nodded in agreement. She stopped running and took a moment to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Locke...\" Terra started. \"Just where are we going anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I haven't told you yet, have I? Sorry about that.\" Locke said. \"We're headed for the Blackjack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" Terra asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I managed to send a message to Setzer and the rest in town.\" Locke explained. \"I told them to wait for us outside town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank goodness!\" Terra exclaimed. \"So they're just around here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" Locke shook his head. \"Be it shouldn't be too far now, but then again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Terra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke was taking a moment to look around, he noticed how dark it was getting, and how tired Terra seemed to be. He also thought about how Celes was doing, wondering if taking a rest would be enough to get her magic back up, at least enough for her to restore herself. The meet up point was still a few miles out, so their airship would not attract the attention of the empire. He wondered if it might just be better to set up a camp around here, he was sure the rest of the group would understand and wait for them until tomorrow. He'd ask Terra first before making a decision though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to be honest with you Terra, the meeting place is actually still a few miles away.\" Locke told her. \"And after all the fight and running we did today, it might be best to take a long break, you know, set up camp somewhere around here. I doubt the soldiers will look for us here, so it should safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Maybe you're right...\" Terra said. \"I'm not really tired though, and it's only a few miles, right?\" Terra paused, she took a moment to consider how Celes was doing. \"But I am worried about Celes, maybe we should set up camp for tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

He was still somewhat embarrassed about the incident with her clothes. He tried to change the subject. \"Anyway, you're right. We should set up a camp. It's getting dark and we're not close enough to finish the walk today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra noticed that Locke was acting strange, but she decided to let it pass for the time being. She just nodded in response.<br>\r\n\"Fine, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke started to look around. They lacked most of the necessary camping equipment, such as beds or tents. He also needed an excuse to get away and check on Celes. He needed guidelines from the tiny girl what to do next. Having her in his pocket was enough to make his heart race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to make make a campfire with your magic.\" Locke said. \"I'll go and see if I can find some water. And don't worry, Celes is safe with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Be careful Locke!\" Terra said in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Locke found a small stream. The water was fresh and tasted incredible. He filled his water bottle and then turned to a more serious matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Celes, I'm going to pick you up now...\" the thief said as he slowly put his hand down into his pocket, hoping she wasn't mad about the earlier incident. He carefully grabbed on to little creature and removed her from her involuntary confinement, unaware of her current state. Celes' skin was extremely soft. Just the touch itself was enough to make Locke all red. Even though he grabbed Celes by the waist, he accidentally touched other parts of her as well, due to his large fingers. It was almost as she was struggling, but it was hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Celes was panicking. She tried to yell all she could about not being ready, but all in vain. There was nothing she could do now to prevent Locke from seeing her in her birthday suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke opened his hand, turning the grip into a platform for tiny Celes. There she was, in the palm of his hand, covering the most intimate parts of her body. So timid and beautiful in her cursed state. Yet, furious for something so small. And... naked? Locke's eyes turned wide by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celes...? You... you're n... I mean... your leotard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Locke, you clumsy dolt!!\" Celes yelled, catching the giant by surprise. She tried to cover her the best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... uh... I...\" Locke stammered in response. His face was turning all red too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert! Womanizer! First you rip off my clothes and then you fail to return them to me! This treatment is unacceptable. I'm a general for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke smiled a little. This was Celes' way of dealing with her situation, trying to be authoritarian. She had acted the same way in the Opera House when she was forced to sing and wear a dress. \"I'm a general, not some opera floozy!\" was her exact words back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celes I... I'm so sorry. It wasn't on purpose! I thought I returned it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't. My leotard blew away with the wind before I had the chance of putting it back on. You realize I can't grow back now, right?\" Celes continued. \"Even if I had the magic I couldn't, because everyone would see me! You better take responsibility for this Locke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles was blushing immensely. She was still embarrassed about the whole situation. On the other hand it was a relief to be out of Locke's stuffy pocket. The air was so fresh and clean compared to Vector's smoggy environment. They both became silent. Locke didn't know what to say. After all, he liked Celes a lot. After a short while, she broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something to cover myself with... can you give me a handkerchief or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke did not have anything like it. He quickly scouted his surroundings and noticed a plant next to him. He ripped off two leaves from it and handed it to the small general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, perhaps you can wear these? T-tie it around you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles hesitated. She would probably look more like a fairy rather than a general with those on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they'll do for now. Turn your head away and don't peak!\" she said as started to dress herself in her new flower clothes. The color green really suited Celes and made her even more cute in her current state. Locke was chocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celes... you look amazing...\" he mumbled, taking Celes by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... y-you think? A...anyway, I'm kind of dirty from being thrown around in your filthy pocket. Put me down on the ground. I want to have some privacy and take a dip in the stream.\"</span></div></div>",

He watched as the tiny woman stepped off his hand onto the hard surface below, entranced by how cute she looked doing the simple task. Celes went and tested the water by dipping a tiny foot into it. When she was ready to get in, she turned back to Locke to ask for some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Locke.\" She said in a loud voice for the giant to hear her. \"I've got it from here. Now, if you'll please allow me some privacy, I'd like to take a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke nodded slowly, his face still quite red. \"I'll leave you to it, then...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Locke turned and left Celes by herself. Once she was sure he was gone, Celes removed her makeshift clothing and stepped into the stream. The water was quite shallow by any normal person's standards, but to the inch tall Celes, it was like a deep lake, perfect for swimming and bathing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles enjoyed some alone time in the stream. Even though the dangers of being alone at this size were still in the back of her mind, Celes didn't really feel worried about anything bad happening to her, the water felt fantastic on her skin, it was easy for her to forget the dangers, and also use it to wash away the grime and dirt that she had accumulated while in Locke's pocket. She had herself feeling clean and refreshed within a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was feeling satisfactorily refreshed, Celes decided to spend the rest of her time in the stream swimming around. Being cramped up in little spaces all day made her restless and uncomfortable, although she tried not to show it to her friends, so being able to move and stretch her body felt great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes had passed as she swam around freely. Celes was starting to feel tired though, and swam back to the rocky bank to take a break. She found it somewhat hard to walk across the rough stones, they were nearly as big as she was after all! So she was glad that she had left her leafy clothing close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles paused. \"What was that?\" She thought she heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later her suspicions were confirmed, she could it hear it clearly this time, there was someone, or something, moving nearby, and it sounded like they were coming to where she was! She couldn't see who it was over the tall grass and shrubbery, and with her leaves were still a few comparative meters away, she made the quick decision to hide herself back in the water. She made a mad dash back into the stream to hide from whatever it was coming her way. Slipping back into the stream, still in the nude, Celes watched as a person appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

She even found him somewhat handsome from time to time. Sadly, he was still a part of the enemy, the same enemy that Celes now was fighting on a daily basis. Lucky for her she was only an inch tall and somewhat hidden in the water. Fighting was of course not even an option. For the moment she just continued to observe him. What was he doing out here in the middle of nowhere? Was he tracking them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two!\" General Leo said, addressing two soldiers accompanying him, while filling his water bottle and almost dragging poor Celes into it. \"I think we've lost the trail. Find us a good spot and set up a camp. We're staying here tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need to get back to the camp.</i> Celes thought. <i>Leo is one if the finest swordsmen alive.

She looked up at the giant general, only to see his huge face looking down at her. <i>There goes any chance I had of spying on them!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking herself found out, Celes thought fast and began swimming away from the giant as fast as she could. Above her, Leo was simply just trying to figure out if he actually heard anything, or if it was just in his head. He didn't see anything below him, at first, until a tiny figure about an inch big started to move, it looked to be swimming in the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world..?\" Leo said softly as he watched the tiny being move about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo looked closer and could hardly believe his eyes at the sight, it was Celes, a former fellow Gesthalian general and unfortunate enemy of his.

Indeed, Leo simply reached out his hand and grabbed the escaping tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles squirmed and struggled in Leo's grasp, shouting at him to let her go.

The two stared at each other for a while, until Leo broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celes... it really is you...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles was a little scared facing the giant foe, she wasn't sure if he was going to be cruel, or more gentle with her.

She was indeed a very beautiful girl, almost looking like a fairy in her current form. Celes herself did not particularly enjoy it and curved herself to a ball in order to cover her parts the best way possible. Being naked was obviously something she had to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, my sincere apologies Celes.\" Leo said with a laugh as he gently patted her on the head with his forefinger. \"It was not my intent to make you uncomfortable, but I didn't want to risk hurting you.

The Emperor refused to let me see you. So please tell me, I got time. I won't show you to my soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles hesitated, but decided it was best to tell Leo the truth. She knew that he had his own set of rules and standards, and would judge her accordingly based on them. She told him about how her view on the Empire's goals had changed, how she had used her magic to shrink herself, and how she had managed to escape together with Locke and Terra, leaving the embarrassing parts out of the story. Leo listened carefully while keeping an eye on his soldiers further away. When Celes finished he just nodded in silence, contemplating his next decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've sided with the Rebels now?\" Leo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I'm afraid so.\" Celes responded, not daring to look Leo in the eyes. \"Or at least Locke and Terra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had a rough ride Celes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her size, Celes ran as fast as her legs could carry her, through the tall grass that grew around her like a forest. Her heart was pounding fast, both from the sprint and the unexpected meeting with General Leo. Even though it had been embarrassing, Celes was glad she have had the opportunity to meet him again. Sure, she was in her birthday suit, but at the same time free and alive. Eventually her magic would return to her and make her normal again. Perhaps things wasn't so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long run back to the camp took more time than expected and made Celes once again realize just how tiny she really was. Being naked was a disadvantage and she was forced to run with one arm pushed against her fleshy treasures in order to keep her balance. When she finally arrived close to camp, she had been running for 20 minutes straight. Sweaty and tired, the young general sat down on a small rock to catch her breath. It was not long until she heard voices, but something was amiss. There was at least more than two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, can you believe it? Of all the places we manage to find two rebel scum it's out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles decided to carefully approach the area and was surprised to find her friends tied up on the ground. Next to Locke stood two guards and a couple of yards away was Terra, pleading to the guards to stop harassing her thief friend. This had to be General Leo's men, acting without their commander's knowledge. Celes panicked. There was no way Leo would be able to help Locke and Terra liked he had helped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This isn't good!</i> Celes thought. <i>I need to help them somehow... but... oh well here goes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny blonde decided to act quickly while she still had the opportunity. When everyone seemed focused on Locke she ran up to Terra, in between her legs and - without her knowledge - into her skirt. Celes was not very fond of returning to this familiar place, especially not in the nude, but at least she had a plan. She sat down to catch her breath, next to Terra's huge wall of panty cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not the best hiding spot, but I cannot afford to lose them if they start to move.</i> she thought.<i> Once my magical powers return to me I'll shrink Terra, and then perhaps she can shrink Locke as well...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Terra was looking helplessly at Locke. The two guards was preparing to leave the area with their prisoners and she realized she had to do something before it would be too late. She remembered the shrinking spell Celes had taught her and thought that if there was a moment to use it, now would be the time. While the guards were occupied with Locke, she closed her eyes and started to concentrate, silently whispering some of the proper sentences. The spell did not go unnoticed, at least not by a very tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wha...what's going on?\" Celes asked herself as magical energy started to swirl around her body, as well as Terra's thighs.</span></div></div>",

Terra was shrinking herself again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra was happy her spell was working as she noticed everything around her start to stretch out and get bigger before her eyes. It didn't take long before she was back down to an inch tall. She smiled to herself, thinking that Celes would be proud. Though at the moment, Celes was anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Terra was now only an inch tall, Celes had become an inch tall to Terra, making the tinier blond not much more than a millimeter in height! The idea of being so small frightened the twice-shrunken woman, and she felt more vulnerable and helpless then ever. To make matters worse, Terra hadn't seemed to notice her presence yet. Thankfully, she was still lodged in the larger girl's skirt, being in there was humiliating for the former general, but she did feel safe. If only she could get Terra's attention, then it make things a little better for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the freshly shrunken Terra got up and ran as fast as she could away from the soldiers, ducking into cover behind the various camping supplies that were now much bigger than her inch-tall self. She stayed in hiding until she was sure that she hadn't been seen, then ran behind the large tent she had set up and out of the immediate campsite. Finding some rather tall grass that she thought she could hide in, Terra made a dash into her green cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowed down and sighed in relief once she was safe. She smiled halfheartedly, for she was happy that her plan had worked, but felt bad about leaving Locke behind. As she enjoyed her freedom, she recalled that some of the soldiers had mentioned a general by the name of Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Leo...</i> She thought. The name sounded familiar to her. Could he have been the kind general that she had met before? Terra wasn't exactly sure, but if thought that if that was the case, perhaps she could convince him to let her friend go. Now that she thought about it, Terra remembered Celes talking highly of him on their journey as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Celes!</i> Terra thought with a gasp. She had almost forgotten about her tiny friend, although she and her were now the same size once again. Terra would have to find Celes and warn her about the soldiers, and general Leo. But first, she'd have to find her. Locke had told her that he left her in a stream nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra made it her first objective to get there and find Celes before the tiny blond made it back to camp, and possibly ended up getting captured as well. And so, the once more tiny Terra made her way through the towering blades of grass that surrounded her on her quest to find Celes before it was too late. All the while, not realizing that the woman in question was currently only about a millimeter tall and stuck in her skirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the soldiers who raided Terra's camp in the first place had finished loading Locke onto their magitek vehicles, and were left wondering where their other prisoner had disappeared to. Without a trace of her at the camp, they set out to find her in the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Terra was busy trying to find General Leo as well as staying hidden from giant guards, Celes was once again having a struggle of survival between the larger girl's legs. She had been safe for a while, until her green haired friend had decided to start running away from the camp as fast as possible, turning it to a quite shaky ride. The millimeter tall Celes had initially been able to remain in the skirt thanks to its tightness pushing her against Terra, making her almost stuck, but now she had started to slip. She needed to act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles yelled as loud as she could in hope of getting attention from the 1 inch tall giantess, but her voice failed to reach Terra who didn't notice her even tinier friend. She desperately tried to grab on to something that she could hold on to, but it was almost impossible with all the shaking. She was weak after a long day's adventure and was not suited for this kind of exercise. Night was also approaching which made it darker and therefore more difficult for Celes to see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is bad! If this continues I'll fall for sure. I need to do something!</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles realized her only option would be to try enter Terra's underwear again, a plan she didn't like at all. Last time it had ended with her being covered in fluids, and just thinking about it made the blonde embarrassed again. With no other choice available she made a daring jump from the skirt to what she thought would be the upper edge of Terra's panties. To Celes happiness she did indeed manage to grab on to something. It was just strange, because this something tickled her body upon contact. It almost felt like fur or... hair. Come to think of it, it didn't feel like panties at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Celes started to slide down in order to find somewhere to enter, her legs came upon something soft, and at the height of her chest she felt something resembling a ball. At that moment Celes just remembered something that made her whole body freeze. The guards at the inn! They had taken Terra's panties, which meant Terra wasn't wearing any underwear at this point. This, in turn, meant that the thing Celes was climbing and holding on to was Terra's own gender. The \"ball\" Celes was pushing her chest against was a giant clitoris, and the soft stuff beneath her was the labia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden realization made Celes scream. She was still a somewhat prude girl and even though she had plan to enter Terra's panties, this was a little too much. She tried to climb up again, but soon noticed that her legs had got stuck between the labia due to Terra's constant movements, and now it was involuntarily sucking her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the effect of Celes' chest rubbing an erogenous zone resulted in Terra taking notice. It came to her as a strong sensation between her legs, which made her shiver in sudden pleasure. The young human-esper almost lost her balance. She immediately stopped in order to identify the source, and after listening closely she could hear sounds of a girl coming from the lower parts of her sex. Terra blushed intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me... i-is that... Celes?\"</span></div></div>",

Light shined on her world once more as she was raised up to Terra's huge face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celes, is that you!?\" Terra shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, it's me. Please, be more gentle!\" Celes yelled, covering her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... H-How did this happen? I mean, how are you so small?\" Terra asked, honestly not knowing the answer. This surprised Celes, she thought Terra would have figured it out by now, she answered her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you cast the shrinking spell just now, I was hiding in your skirt and got caught in the magic, causing me to shrink even smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I can't believe it, I had no idea you were there! Is there anyway to reverse this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Celes answered truthfully, still struggling to get into a good position in Terra's huge hand. Terra tried to help her into it, and make her feel more comfortable, but Celes had stickied up her hand. Upon realizing what the sticky substance that covered Celes was, Terra instantly knew where her smaller friend had unfortunately ended up at again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you ended up, you know, down there... again...\" Terra apologized, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles didn't say anything, as she'd rather not think of it. She finally managed to get herself into a more comfortable position in Terra's hand though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry...\" Terra repeated herself softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence in the air after that. It was during this that Terra noticed something, Celes was completely naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What happened to your clothes?!\" Terra asked. She looked away from the smaller, naked woman in her hand. \"Was that because of me too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. It's... a long story.\" Celes replied, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, um, why don't I try and grow back right now? If we do it together again, we should both grow, right?\" Terra asked, now looking back at Celes, who was waving her arms in protest of the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! If you do that now, the guards will see you for sure.\" Celes warned her. \"As much as I hate to say it, we both have to stay small for a little while longer. Some of us a little smaller than others...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" Terra apologized profusely. She really did feel awful for causing Celes to shrink again, she couldn't imagine what it was like being so small, but she guessed that it must be terrible for her smaller friend. Her eyes had started to well up because of the shame she felt. \"I had no idea the spell would work like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No, I'm sorry. It's all right.\" Celes replied, she sounded strong, but really was a little terrified. Seeing Terra up close, having the green-haired girl appear so huge to her, while knowing that the young woman wasn't more than an inch tall herself really drove home how small she had become, and the thought frightened even Celes. But she also of course understood that Terra had not done this on purpose, and that the girl's reason for doing so was, in fact, just, softened the blow somewhat. That, and knowing that Terra was now her only hope of surviving this crazier ride made her want to keep Terra strong and confident, for both their sakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Terra, you know I cannot defend myself at all now that I'm this small. I'm relying on you to protect me, okay?\" Celes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course I will! You can count on it!\" Terra assured her, wiping her eyes with her free hand. Despite being small herself, Terra wasn't afraid of anything, she couldn't be, now that she had someone else to worry about. Having Celes so much smaller than herself also made Terra feel bigger than she actually was, it was comforting somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Terra. I know you'll do a fine job.\" Celes smiled at her comparatively giantess friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra smiled back at Celes, then started to look herself over. Celes wondered what Terra was doing. Terra then looked at Celes, with more than a hint of regret on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry about this, Celes.\" Terra's face said it all, and Celes didn't like where this was going. \"But I'm going to have to put you somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles sighed, \"I understand.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you choose this time though!\" Terra hoped that that made it a bit more comfortable for her tinier friend. \"Um, would you like my, uh, panties, or do you want to ride in my cleavage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, neither option thrilled the tiniest woman, but she understood that they really were her only options. She groaned having to basically choose the lesser of the two evils, and picked...</span></div></div>",

It doesn't get as... hrm... wet... as in certain other areas.\"<br>\r\nCeles remark made Terra extremely embarrassed. She half-human half-esper couldn't control her body's reactions any more than Celes could control hers. In her mind she cursed her clothes for the lack of pockets and wished she hadn't lost her panties to the guards at the inn.<br>\r\n\"I-I said I was sorry...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know. It was my fault as well so don't worry about it!\" Celes said with a smile. \"Just promise you'll be more careful with me this time! Last time was a very... bouncy experience.\"<br>\r\nTerra didn't know what to say anymore. Her face was already red from so much blushing, and Celes soon realized how clumsy her comment had been.<br>\r\n\"B-but I'm sure it's going to be very comfortable and that they will protect me well! Also... you're my friend Terra. I trust you.\"<br>\r\nThe comment made Terra smile again. She carefully moved Celes closer to her shirt, opened it a little and tipped her hand over so that the naked ex-general fell right down into her cleavage. The landing was soft and Celes started to slowly sink in between the larger girl's breasts.<br>\r\n\"I promise I will be very careful. You are... precious to me Celes and I will protect you no matter what!\"<br>\r\nCeles didn't know how to respond. As the tiny blonde fully entered her friends cleavage, she got shivers all over her body. This time it felt even more embarrassing due to her naked state, almost like a baby close to its mother. But without any clothes to cover herself with, Celes started to adjust to the situation in a different manner. The feeling of Terras warm skin and the sound of her heart beating was actually pretty cozy and made her feel more and more comfortable, at least for the time being.<br>\r\nAs soon as Terra had made sure Celes was safe and secure she immediately started to move again. It was getting darker by the minute, but the 1 inch tall girl didn't want to take any unnecessary risks and expose herself. Quiet as a mouse she moved through the tall grass towards a lightning source in the horizon. With a little luck that would be where General Leo was.</span></div></div>",

The soldiers that took Locke mentioned a man named Leo, and over there.\" Terra pointed ahead at the light in the distance. \"I'm betting that's where his camp his, and they've probably got Locke there too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo? General Leo?\" Celes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think so.\" Terra said. \"You know him, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" Celes said, sounding reminiscent for a moment. \"Good thinking, Terra! Leo's a good man. I'm sure I convince him to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Let's get going then, it's getting dark.\" Terra said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the sun was down, but Terra had now reached Leo's makeshift camp. The place was swarming with guards, evidently all the ones who had captured Locke and tried to get Terra too came back here now that it was dark. There were several tents set up, and a campfire in the middle of the circle they made, and a few boxes, probably of supplies, placed at seemingly random spots. Other than that, the camp was pretty simple in design, Terra guessed that Leo and his men didn't intend to stay here very long. But it's lack of cover made things difficult for the shrunken girl, with few places to hide she might get spotted and captured, even at her smaller more discreet size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra, look!\" Celes shouted from in Terra's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Terra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there.

There are soldiers all around.\" Celes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra wasn't thrilled with the idea of waiting. What if they hurt Locke, or something else?

Celes nodded her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shrunken girls waited, and waited in the tall grass until the guards were all tired and had gone back their tents for the night. Neither Terra nor Celes saw any sign of Locke throughout the night, but they guessed that he was being held one of the tents the whole time. Although they did see Leo come out of his tent, the one Celes had pointed out before, so they now knew where exactly they had to go at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their chance finally available, Terra ran across the field as fast as she could. Her lack of food and sleep were more evident to her as she ran, and the shrunken girl wished she could get this over with soon, and hopefully get Celes back to normal as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking into the tent, Terra saw Leo sitting at a desk, and wondered how to approach the man. But didn't need to worry about that for long. The perceptive Leo noticed as soon as his tent opened up the tiny bit that Terra had moved to get in, and he looked for the source of this movement, he spotted what appeared to be a tiny person standing by the entrance. This sight startled him for a moment, but he remembered his earlier meeting with the inch-tall Celes, he wondered if she might have come back to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celes...?\" He whispered to the tiny figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo got up from his chair and went over to the tiny woman on the ground, as he got closer he could tell that this was in fact not Celes, but another tiny woman just as small. She looked familiar to Leo, but he couldn't quite place her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra had gotten worried as the comparatively giant General approached her, and then picked her up. But he was gentle, a trait she thought nobody in the empire was capable of having. The tinier Celes assured her that Leo could be trusted, so Terra tried to do just that as he brought her back to his desk for further examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Leo asked her after settling back into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My name is Terra Branford... sir.\" Terra said. Even though she tried to believe she could trust Leo, that didn't mean he still didn't make her nervous, he was a giant to her scale after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra!\" Celes called out from her position in Terra's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celes?\" Terra said, pulling the tinier girl out. Leo saw this and wondered what this tiny girl on his desk was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell Leo I'm here! I'm sure he'll trust me and help us out!\" Celes told Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Terra nodded. She then turned back to Leo and held up her hand, the extremely tiny Celes stood on it. \"General Leo, please, look at my hand!\" Terra implored the huge general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo wasn't sure what was going on, but he decided to humor the tiny girl and obliged. He thought of how he found Celes, just a mere inch tall, at the stream before, but he wondered if it were possible that she had gotten this much smaller. Looking in close, Leo could only see but a tiny speck on Terra's hand, one that did not resemble his former comrade at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Leo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Celes! She shrank to this size by... accident!\" Terra shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, please! Hear me!\" Celes shouted as loud as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her voice was far too quiet to be heard by the normal-sized man. Leo shook his head and went back to sitting in his chair. \"I don't know what you think you're doing here, young lady. But if this is some kind of trick-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a trick! Please, you have to believe me when I tell you that Celes is here, right here!\" Terra pointed at the speck in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra... I don't think this is working..!\" Celes said to Terra. The tinier woman now getting a bit worried about this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just give up!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Terra nervously looked up on the towering general in front of her. His facial expression had changed, as if he was starting to see her in a different light. Even though she had been honest with him, the tiny half-esper could see that Leo was doubting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're trying to pull here young lady, but you've certainly picked my curiosity to why you are here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra started to feel uncomfortable about the whole situation. The Gestahlian general seemed like a good person, but she had bad memories of the Empire and didn't want to be caught again. She started to walk backwards with Celes close to her chest, almost as she forgot she was standing in Leo's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-general Leo, you must understand that I have no ill intent! Why would I otherwise approach you and notice you of my presence in this form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is something I want to find out as well...\" Leo replied and leaned over the table. \"So I'm sorry, but that is why I can't let you leave for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls gasped when they heard it. There was no way they could save Locke if they were to be held captive. Celes herself got shivers all over her body. Being so minuscule made Leo appear almost like a god. She looked up at her green-haired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra! Don't stay here! Get off his hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra looked at Celes and hesitated, but as soon as Leo moved his other hand towards the girl she decided to act. She jumped off his palm, down to the table beneath her. As soon as she recovered she swiftly ran towards the edge of the table. Maybe she could jump down and then crawl under the tent to escape into the dark night and the tall grass? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escape was of course a futile one and didn't last very long. Terra suddenly felt something grab on to her ankle. The sudden grip made her fall forward and land on her chest. As she hit the ground of the table, Terra felt how she lost her grip of Celes. The naked magitek knight was cast off Terra's palm and landed in front of her bigger friend after a short flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celes!\" Terra yelled worryingly. She immediately tried to crawl towards her tinier friend, but without success. Leo still had a gentle but steadfast grip around her ankle. Without a second of hesitation he lifted her up from the ground while holding her upside down - much to Terra's dismay. Clearly irritated she threw her legs around to show her dissatisfaction while also trying to kick at Leo's fingers. It didn't have the effect she hoped for and, without knowing, instead revealed her pantyless privates to a surprised general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm, listen... Terra. I'm not going to hurt you.\" Leo said while moving his catch to a nearby glass. \"I just want to keep you here until I fully know your intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra gasped. After being put down on top of a big map she saw how Leo placed the big glass over her, effectively turning the drinking tool into a prison. Terra started banging on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you listen! That really was Celes and because of you I just lost her!\" Terra said with frustration in her voice. \"She fell right off my palm because you made me trip! She really is there General, and for her sake you must believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo fell silent, pondering Terra's words. He couldn't deny that the tiny girl in front of him sounded trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have the voice of a liar, I'll give you that.\" he said. He stood up from his seat and scanned the table with his eyes. \"Celes, if you really are down there I beg of you to take cover. I don't want to hurt you by mistake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Celes had just begun to recover from her bad landing. She moaned a little while listening to Leo, then looked at him in awe. Her extremely small size made both Leo and the room itself all look like a different world. A world she had no words to describe with. It made her feel strange, like a mix of anxiety and wonder at the same time, calm yet frightened. Being in the nude also added to those feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What... what do I do now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles looked down at herself. Her hands were shaking, but despite her situation she knew she had to do something.</span></div></div>",

But neither Terra nor Leo could even make out this pitiful attempt. Leo walked away with Terra in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles shook, she understood how insignificant she had become. No one could see her, no could hear her, and she couldn't even do anything to save her friend.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Celes awoke sometime later that same night. She groggily got up, and wondered how long she had been out. From the darkness seeping in outside, she could at least tell that it was still night, so she figured she wasn't out too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen upon seeing that she was still just a millimeter tall on a desk the size of the Blackjack to her, Celes remembered the events that had transpired before and became depressed again. But the shrunken former general wasn't going to let the numerous setbacks she had faced so far keep her down. Terra was most likely locked up away somewhere, and so was Locke, and she had no idea where Leo was, or if she could make contact with him at all at her tiny, tiny size. Things looked bleak for the shrunken woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Celes shook her head to rid herself of such negative thoughts. \"I'll help them! I have to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully awake and thinking more clearly now then the sad night before, Celes started to think of some way, any way, she could help her friends. She scurried across Leo's massive desk for anything to help her, but at her size there wasn't much she really use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Curse this size of mine!</i> Celes thought, getting more frustrated the longer she spent at her current miniscule height. For the first time since being shrunken again, Celes was really starting to wish she was at least an inch tall again. <i>At least then I might be noticed by the general. But as it is now, I'm but a speck to him. If only there were some way to, perhaps, leave him a message...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!\" Celes gasped and her eyes widened, a plan now forming in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot up and looked around Leo's desk again. Books, pens, and the like were neatly organized on the general's desk. Most everything on the desk was bigger than Celes' millimeter tall form, but there was one thing in particular that she looked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank goodness!\" Celes said, relieved. She had spotted the container of ink on the front of Leo's desk. Celes smiled now that something had turned out right for her at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I can cover myself using ink from that jar, then I might be able to write a message to the general!</i> Celes laid out her plan in her mind. It wasn't the most proud thing she was going to do, but to help her friends, Celes would do it gladly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe micro-sized woman ran up to the ink container, not wanting to spare a moment of time. Since she didn't know when Leo would be back, she didn't want to risk him entering the tent and possibly removing the ink, and any chances Celes would have of being noticed by her former comrade. But when Celes made it over to the ink jar, she found her first problem. The jar was only about 2 inches high, but at Celes' size, it was a veritable mountain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles sighed, and scolded herself inwardly for almost forgetting her biggest problem, her own size. Her one plan to make contact with general Leo was shot. Defeated by the 2 inch jar, Celes hung her head in shame and turned around. As she did, she noticed a giant pen near the ink container. Her heart nearly skipped a beat when she saw that it had been freshly used, it still had fresh ink on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith newfound vigor running through her, Celes went over to the pen and quickly covered herself in its ink. She had to do it quickly, lest she start to feel humiliated and disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is for Terra and Locke.</i> Celes reminded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was covered in the sticky black stuff, Celes moved across Leo's desk to a paper he was reading and got to work. She got down and rolled across the vast white plain of the paper, slowly, but surely, jotting down letter after letter. Celes knew that at her size she'd have to make the letters much bigger than herself to make sure they'd be seen. She had to make the trek back to the pen for some more ink occasionally, since she would run out. But she did it all as effectively as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished about a half an hour later, Celes stood up on the paper and looked over her work. She tried to write the words: \"CELES IS HERE\", and a small arrow pointing to where she would wait to be noticed by Leo. But to her horror, the letters were all disjointed, and her constant running across the paper had made them sort of mash together, it looked almost illegible. Not to mention how small her writing would come across as to a normal sized person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles wanted to buckle down and try again, but before she could, the tent flapped open and general Leo came back inside. Celes panicked. She wasn't sure if he would be able to make out her writing, but she had no choice no but to wait and see. The shrunken woman ran to the spot where the arrow she drew was pointing and waited.</span></div></div>",

In her diminished size he was miles away from her, taller than anything else, but still approaching her faster than she was prepared for. Just the thought of him seeing her so small and insignificant, not to mention naked, made her body tremble. For a moment she almost wished that he wouldn't discover her at all because it would probably feel all too humiliating. All the respect she had gained over the years would be swept away in an instant, or that was at least what she thought would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on Celes, you're a soldier, not some love-starved twit...</i> Celes thought, trying to cheer herself up and gain some courage for the upcoming confrontation. She observed how her former comrade walked around in the room for a while, like he was contemplating over something. Her heartbeat was slowly accelerating and it was difficult to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a reflex of female modesty Celes immediately covered herself when Leo approached the table. She was dirty from the ink bath and sweaty from her half-hour long body-writing session. How she wished she had not lost her green leotard earlier when she had been in Locke's pocket. The minuscule girl watched with nervousness as the gigantic Leo sat down at the table and started going through some papers. She remembered how he had asked her to take cover earlier, but now it was like he didn't believe what Terra had said to him earlier. He was simply not paying attention. The feeling of hopelesness was slowly returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leo reached for his writing pen he suddenly noticed something in his periphery. Next to his ink container he spotted something appearing to be incoherent scribbles on a paper, but after a closer inspection he saw that it actually was a written message. Though the letters appeared to be written by a young child Leo could slowly but surely interpret the letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C... e... les... is... here. Celes is here. Wait... Celes!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles had to struggle not to be blown away by the sheer force of Leo's voice when he spoke her name. His breath felt like a small hurricane. As soon as the winds calmed down she got on her feet again and quickly realized that she had been blown away a couple of inches from her special spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no! I need to hurry back. This is the only chance I'll get!</i> Celes thought as she started to run back while her chest bounced heavily. She could see how Leo was searching the area, and when she saw his eyes suddenly lock on to her area, the almost microscopic Celes started jumping up and down, waving her arms as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo!! I'm down here!! Please notice me!\" Celes yelled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo himself was both chocked and surprised by the message. He leaned slowly towards the area where the message said Celes would be located on. First he didn't notice anything in particular, but just a few moments later he could make out a tiny speck an inch away from the pointer's head. Since he couldn't really see what it was, he reached for a nearby looking glass and focused it upon the area. When Leo saw that it really was Celes, jumping frenetically while involuntarily showcasing her beautiful body, he couldn't believe her eyes. Celes had really become even tinier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it! It's really you Celes. Your friend wasn't lying!\" Leo said. He could see the tiny girl starting to cover herself, but to hear what she was saying was impossible. He started to analyze the situation and what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Being seen at her current size and state of undress made her feel embarrassed to be seen, being covered in mostly ink only added to that feeling. Still, she knew she had to get Leo's attention not only for her own sake, but for Terra's sake as well. Now with Leo looking down at her through a looking glass, she had achieved that goal, at the cost of her modesty. But she still able to relax a little and even tried to explain the situation to Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo! You have to get Terra! Please!\" Celes shouted as loud as she could. Leo looked like a giant to her, far bigger than Terra or even Locke had ever been. Celes wondered just how little she appeared to him, and if her voice could possibly carry to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Celes. But I can't hear what you're saying.\" Leo said to the tiny woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the older man had spoken softly, the force of his voice was still enough to cause some discomfort to the tiny, tiny Celes, who covered her ears in response. Leo apologized quickly and quietly, this time not hurting poor Celes with his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles recovered swiftly and held her hand up towards Leo's imposing face to signify she was okay. Still, she was disappointed to hear Leo's response. If the comparative giant couldn't hear her she wondered how she was going to convince him to release Terra from whatever confinement they had put her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Leo started to say. Celes looked up at him hopefully. \"I assume you'd like to help your little friend, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles smiled and nodded up at Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Leo whispered to the shrunken blonde. \"It's for the best that you two are reunited. After all, communications between you and I are all but impossible. You'd probably be much more comfortable with her around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Please release her!\" Celes shouted, well aware that Leo could not hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you like the idea. Well then...\" Leo sat up from his chair. He placed the looking glass down next to the speck of Celes. \"Wait here so I can find you when I return. I'll go and get this Terra now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Leo walked out of the tent, leaving tiny little Celes alone. The tiny blond was glad that Leo was going to let Terra go. Celes clasped her hands together by her chest and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Leo.\" Celes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed as Celes paced around the area Leo had told her to wait by. The gigantic looking glass was like a building to her, it was intimidating a little, but Celes stayed by it in order for Leo to find her when he came back. As she paced, the ink on her body started to fall off, only small splotches of the writing material still remained. But still Celes waited for Leo's return, the longer she waited the more she worried. Being stuck so small on Leo's desk was starting to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Leo, where are you? I hope nothing bad has happened to him, or Terra...</i> Celes thought. She watched the flap of the tent expectantly.</span></div></div>",

And they're not going to let this go so easily!\" The caged young man smirked. Though in his position of having his arms cuffed behind his back, it didn't have quite the intimidating effect he was going for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Very well.\" Leo said sternly, having to remind himself that he was here to help Locke, however inadvertently, so he and Celes and Terra could go free. Though he could just as well tell Locke the situation, he decided it was better to keep it to himself, just so he could get to Terra sooner. \"If you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke scoffed and slid onto his back, looking like he was going to catch some sleep for the night. Leo, however, just ignored him and walked on to the place Terra was being kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had caught her earlier, he had kept her in a small cage meant for a bird, but a good fit for the shrunken girl. He then put her in a drawer in one of the desks of the makeshift prison tent.

In fact, the green-haired girl had used her magical powers to transform herself into an esper, not only granting her more magic and an all pink body, but the ability to fly and the strength to open the drawer in which she had been trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry General, but I really need to find my little Celes!\" Terra thought to herself as she hovered high up in the air with a pounding heart, close to the tent's ceiling. She had eavesdropped his and Locke's conversation, but for the moment she had decided that it was for the best to not involve Leo based on previous experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes had magically disappeared as she had transformed into her pink esper-form, leaving her in an elegant naked state and a curvy body. She was still tiny however, and that would be a disadvantage in any sort of confrontation with the Empire's soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to do this and endanger Locke, but there's no choice. I got no time to waste, and I need to find Celes before it is too late! She could be blown of the table, or found by some insect!\" Terra thought to herself as she tried adapt to flying while not feeling ashamed about her new form. In fact, she was still new to it and had only experienced it a handful of times. She had even been called a monster be some. Had anyone seen her in her current tiny form though, Terra had more likely been called a pixie rather than a monster. Still, she had no wish of being discovered. She flew silently through the air over to Locke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Locke! It's me, Terra! Don't worry, we'll get you out of this. I just need to go find Terra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocke could barely believe his eyes at first, and started to blush heavily as he saw the tiny little esper-human in front of him, hovering not far away from his nose. Terra seemed so elegant, delicate and fragile. He nodded towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me you will be careful. Don't let the guards see you, please!\" Locke whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra nodded in response, turning her back against the young thief to then fly off on her mission to retrieve her tiny friend. She didn't exactly know the way to General Leo's tent, but Celes couldn't have left that place even if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you escape once I'm back with Celes. And I'll talk to Leo again if I have too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her nimble form, Terra flew out from tent to tent, trying to navigate her way through the camp, immediately beginning her search. With no memory of the area, she went from tent to tent, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

That same dark of night that was cast over the camp would normally have given her a great cover to be stealthy in, but thanks to the bright pink glow of her Esper-form, Terra was sure to catch the eyes of a guard if she didn't move carefully, looking to any on-lookers like a pink firefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this one either!\" Terra was starting to get frustrated with her lack of success. The camp wasn't that big, but Terra's luck was just not on her side right now. So the shrunken girl was forced to go through each tent until she found the one that belonged to the General Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra doubled down her efforts and quickly flew back through the tent's curtains to go back outside and look for another tent to check, but in her haste she flew right into something huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Terra squeaked as she recoiled in the air, rubbing her head as she had smacked it right into whatever it was she flew into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what have we here?\" A loud voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra collected herself, floating in mid-air, and looked up to see that it was a guard that she'd just run into. A huge, giant guard that was at least fifty times bigger than her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Terra cried out and tried to fly away, but before she could the big guard's hand caught her mid-flight. Suddenly, she was thrust upwards by the swift motion of the huge hand. In the next moment, the mini girl was face-to-face with a bewildered guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... I thought you was just a weird little bug, but, you're a tiny little...\" The guard hesitated, seemingly needing time to gather his thoughts. \"... Little wingless fairy!\" The guard surmised after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra twitched at the comment. It was bad enough to get caught again, but to now be subject to examination by the uncouth guard was a bit humiliating. For the moment though, Terra stayed in his hand, wondering whether or not she should struggle or fight back against the comparative giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What you got over there?\" The call of another guard came from afar. Terra looked and saw that a couple more guards were coming over the her captor, no doubt curious about the pink glow of the \"Wingless Fairy\" he'd found. Terra shook her head, she knew now that she couldn't simply let this go on any further, she had to get out of here now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra concentrated her magic power together to form a spell strong enough to let her escape, and...</span></div></div>",

So, without even thinking about how powerful she should go with her next move, Terra recited a spell she thought would be able to help her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firaga!' Terra cast her spell. She aimed her hands like arm cannons and blasted powerful(albeit minute) fireballs at the soldier, hitting him in his forehead dead-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeow!\" The soldier yelled and reflexively grabbed at his head. His flinch inadvertently made his other hand holding Terra loose, giving the shrunken half-Esper ample time to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew!\" Terra sighed, and the miniaturized girl quickly jetted out of the soldier's hand and flew towards another tent to find Celes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree again, Terra flew straight for the closest tent. However, her little interaction with the soldiers had made them take notice of the tiny purple-glowing figure flying about the campsite, and the soldiers that had seen one of their own get blasted by sudden small fire spells were able to follow her even at her one inch size, thanks in part to the small glowing trail she left behind herself as she flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get that thing!\" One of the soldiers shouted. The others followed his lead and chased after the tiny Terra, thinking now that it was some kind of wild beast capable of casting magic somehow, not one of them thinking it could possibly be the infamous Terra Branford, reduced to the size of a bug by her own magic and using her 'true' Esper form to fly around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, darn it!\" Terra groaned. She looked behind herself and saw that many giant-looking soldiers were now hot on her trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If they keep following me, I'll end up leading them right to poor Celes!</i> Terra thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she knew Celes was probably way too small for the soldiers to see, she didn't want to risk her micro-sized friend's safety. On the other hand, she could tell she only had a few more minutes of Esper-power left in her, so leading the soldiers away from Celes could end up in her having to find her friend in her normal, shrunken state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra thought about it for a moment...</span></div></div>",

She was anxious and a bit self-conscious from her body's current state, minied and nude, pink and busted. The shrunken girl gulped as the seconds began to feel like minutes. Then, finally, the bright magic dissipated to reveal the whole set of soldiers simply standing there, looking quite unawares all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. What were we doing?\" One of the soldiers asked, his voice droning on like he had just woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember...\" Another replied, looking forward at nothing in particular but seeming transfixed on the empty space anyway. In fact, all of the soldiers had stopped and adjusted themselves to staring with eyes glazed over and mouths agape just looking at various spots in the scenery. They stumbled around aimlessly, not a single one of them taking any notice of the tiny, glowing pink speck that was Terra flying in her mini esper form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes! Perfect!</i> Terra cheered inside her head. She smiled at her handiwork, then flew off towards the tent she last recalled seeing Celes in. She knew her magic power was failing fast, and that last spell didn't help matters. Time was even more of the essence at this point, but Terra kept her wits about her and focused on saving her teenier friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hold on, Celes, I'm coming!</i> Terra thought. She reached her highest flight speed and thrust herself into the tent. She sighed in relief upon entering it and seeing that it was indeed the good general's tent and not some random low-level soldier's bunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering where she last saw the tinier Celes, Terra made a bee-line towards General Leo's desk. Floating just inches above the wooden surface, Terra scoured the area for any signs of the millimeter-tall blond. She spotted a paper with some scribbles that seemed to read \"Celes is here\" on it, although it was hard to tell for certain because of how spotty the penmanship was. Terra was smart enough to put two and two together and deduce that this was how Celes had contacted General Leo before, which surely meant that Celes was still stranded in this spot somewhere...</span></div></div>",

Celes only wore her green swimsuit now, and the cold water had made certain parts of her body even more revealing. For a 18-year old, she had a great body. She was nothing close to resembling a mighty general now, just a cute tiny girl in a beautiful swimsuit. Terra just couldn't stop looking at her, and it was more than just curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she tried to shake it out of her head, Terra couldn't forget about what she just had experienced together with Celes. Her cheeks were still red from all the tingling excitement, and the more she thought about what had passed the faster her heart was racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so strange. The warm sensation between her legs was still there. Without doubt, she felt some sort of attraction to her blonde friend. She already adored her for several reasons, but this feeling was something new and completely different. Was this love? Lust? Terra wouldn't know. She had been controlled by the Empire her whole life and never gotten to experience things like other girls did in her age. Not even getting to know her own body. At least until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra? Why are you looking at me like that?\" Celes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" I-I...\" the giant girl mumbled, returning to the real world efter being lost in deep thoughts. Her heart was still racing and she was desperate to cherish the energy she felt. She wanted to pick up Celes and play with her, but hesitated. What if Celes got angry? Then again, Celes was not a powerful general anymore. More like a helpless little girl without magical powers. A little poke wouldn't hurt her, right? She made the decision and suddenly reached for Celes and grabbed her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-terra? What are you doing?\" Celes asked with a nervous voice. \"I'm not a doll. Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra obeyed, but only to a slight degree. She put Celes in the middle of her right hands palm and went out to one of the beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be frank you're even smaller than a doll...\" Terra giggled and smiled. \"Don't be scared Celes, I only want to look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles was about to protest, but not quickly enough. With newborn confidence, Terra moved her left hand close to Celes and carefully touched her with the tip of her finger. With a gentle touch she ran it over Celes' left breast, continued down to her navel, and then up again towards her right breast. Her chest was big, even for a tiny creature like her. Celes gasped and her eyes widened from the touch. She even got goose bumps. No one, boy or girl, had ever touched her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra did not stop there. She wanted to deal with the sexual tension that had arisen. She continued to fondle Celes with her pinkie, thoroughly examining her every spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't deny it Celes. Your presence down there... I really felt it. Never felt anything like it in my life. I-I don't know, but it was kind of nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles did not answer. She was breathing heavily and her body seemed to have responded to the treatment. One could even think she was starting to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The streets laid silent as three warriors of Mana emerged from a dark alley, currently on their way back to the tavern at which they were staying. The port town of Beiser was normally bustling with activity, but since it was way past midnight, most citizens were now sleeping soundly in their homes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a good reason why Angela, Riesz, and Duran was awake at this late hour. They had just paid a visit to The Black Market, a shady establishment that was open only during night time. It was a place of secrecy, where people would sell all sorts of items and services: from delicate elixirs and deadly weapons, to private shows with exotic dancers \u2014 even magical objects. The latter had been especially important for the trio, as they were on the hunt for a particular object that could aid them in their quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how cheap it was! Now we can finally go meet that Sage Domperi figure!\u201d Angela said as she triumphantly swung the newly bought object, the Minor Mallet, back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minor Mallet, or the Chibikko Hammer as some called it, was a magic item with the ability to shrink anyone hit by it. By using this object on themselves, the warriors of Mana could become tiny enough to meet the Koropokkur people and their leader, Sage Domperi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow this Sage could be a master strategist was something Angela failed to understand. How could someone tiny as a mouse advice armies? Finding the Koropokkur would also be tricky. No one in the party had ever seen one, and rumour was that they were less than 3 inches tall, no bigger than a teaspoon. As for their village, all they knew was that it was located somewhere in the Rabite Forest, south of Jadd, but finding it would be a problem for a later time. For now, the trio had at least managed to secure the mallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful with that thing, Angela,\u201d Duran said to the mage as he dodged one of her reckless swings. \u201cYou sure it\u2019s a good idea that you hold on to it?\u201d he asked, not feeling confident in her companion\u2019s way of handling such an important object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy of course Duran dear,\" Angela responded. \"Not only am I the leader here, which makes me the de facto holder of this item, I\u2019m also a princess and the most beautiful member of our party. I have all the right to wield it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish things off, Angela teased her companions by wiggling her butt a bit, something she normally did against her enemies, flirting with them to confuse them. Thanks to her risque red leotard that revealed a big portion of her soft round cheeks, it was usually pretty effective. \"Did I say I'm charming as well?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a princess too you know\u2026\u201d Riesz grumbled, not impressed by Angela's act. The young amazon from the Kingdom of Laurent had reason to be sceptical. After all, the whole reason for seeking out Sage Domperi was so they could seek his advice on how to get Laurent back from its occupants, the sand-nation of Nevarl. For now, Riesz and Duran just looked at each other and shrugged, deciding it was best to let Angela be Angela. The purple-haired Altenan could come off as selfish at times, but she had proven she had a good heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe certainly doesn\u2019t lack confidence, that\u2019s for sure!\u201d Duran replied with a chuckle. In the end, he was happy to be in the company of these two girls. Angela had become a quick and talented learner of magic, and Riesz skill with a spear was just as good as Duran\u2019s own swordsmanship. The brown-haired knight was also sure that his companions' stunning looks had played a part in the obtainment of the Minor Mallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after his remark, the party arrived at the tavern inn. As the trio parted ways to go to their separate rooms, Angela went towards her room located on the second floor in the far corner, which was just next to Riesz\u2019s. Tomorrow, the would meet up with the other's and set off for Jadd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this sure was easier than exp\u2026\u201d Angela\u2019s words were cut short. As she opened the door, her foot suddenly hit the door threshold, causing her to lose her balance and fall forward, gasping by the sudden turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened too quickly. As she fell, she lost her grip on the mallet, and as she landed roughly the floor, Angela felt a strong hit on her backhead, followed by a magical sensation that was felt through her entire body. Moments later, she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany hours later, Angela woke up\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She waited until the idiots had to reload, and then she whipped out her Desert Eagles and took both of them out with a shot from each gun. She stepped forward, ready to enter the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strode through the ruins, Lara noticed a lack of traps or guards...it was almost too easy. Lara hates it when it gets too easy. As she stepped forward, even her trained senses didn't notice the slight depression of one of the stones her foot had stepped on. Not even her trained hearing could discern the silent whirring of gears inside the temple walls. The one thing she could discern was that a huge trap door had opened in the floor a foot ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really all they got,\" Lara groaned. This was the easiest temple she had ever broken into. At this moment there was a rumbling sound behind her and she turned in time to see a stone wall swing into place, blocking her path backward. At the same time, another wall swung forward until it was even with the other ledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's more like it,\" Lara smirked, \"Now I just have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall behind her swung forward again, sending her tumbling into the pit. Lara fell for what felt like ages, unable to do anything but scream in terror. Finally, she splashed into a pool of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time i'll bring C4...\" Lara promised herself. She swam out to the mouth of the cave, finding herself back in the temple. A light shiver, almost a tingle, ran through her body. She started out in a brisk walk down the tunnel path. It was strange, however, that everything seemed heavier on her body. Brushing the thought aside, she continued walking. Then, right in front of the entrance to the room, it happened. The tingles came with a vengeance, and she fell out of her own boots. The tingles intensified, and she shot down, shrinking? Lara screamed once more as she literally shrank into her clothes.</span></div></div>",

The warning sirens boomed through the ship, it was loud and annoying but it worked. Because slowly but surely, bounty hunter Samus Aran regained consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounty hunter's mind was foggy as she wondered what was going on. Slowly she opened her eyes to the familiar sight of her starship's dashboard. The room was bathed in a dark red light, the emergency light, Samus realized. On the ship's main screen she saw a timer ticking away, 58 minutes, or was it seconds? It was hard for her to make out with the pain in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively she tried to rub her aching head hoping to relieve the pain, but when she did so it felt like a cold, metal thwack instead, which only increased her discomfort. Samus groaned. She looked over herself and saw that she was wearing her power suit, or rather, what was left of it, it was ripped apart in several spots and severely damaged in most of the others. She was missing major areas of the suit, such as her helmet, which explained the earlier thwack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from her unfortunate self-inflicted hit, Samus tried to make sense of what was happening. Though, one thing she already knew was that the power suit was a lost cause at this point and she decided it would be easier just to remove it from her person. She'd have to fix it later, she thought. Pressing a button on her suit caused it to seemingly disappear, of course, she knew that if she wanted to get it back, all she had to do was press the button again. Now clad only in her zero suit, moving was much easier for the bounty hunter.<br>\r\nShe took another look at the main screen. The timer she saw before still counted down, a little over 30 minutes left now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thirty minutes.</i> Samus thought, <i>That doesn't add up...</i> Samus stared at the screen, it now read 28. She shook her head. Either two minutes had passed while she stared at the screen, or... <i>Wait, this timer isn't running on minutes, it's seconds!</i> Samus realized at last, she'd have recognized it sooner, but with her pulsing headache it was hard to even think. She thought about what this meant, and she wasn't completely sure but, if her history with timers was anything to go by that meant the starship was going to explode in about half a minute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdreneline coursed through her veins at this sudden realization, Samus jolted out of the pilot's seat she was in and out the room. With her unmatched athleticism she quickly reached an emergency escape pod. She got inside and pressed a large button, launching herself to freedom. The pod shot up into the air at the proper angle and almost just as quickly flew back down to the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escape pod landed with a loud thud. Inside, though, the ride was smooth as could be and Samus barely felt a thing. The door opened automatically. Stepping out Samus finally got a look at the planet she was currently on. A lush, green valley, not unlike the landing site of one of her previous adventures, Tallon IV, with some differences of course. Namely the towering forest that surrounded the exit of the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took some time for herself to recover, her head still felt horrible, she felt like she might pass out at any moment. When all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samus did her best to ignore the pain in her head, and instead surveyed her surroundings. When suddenly, she got the strangest feeling of deja vu. Looking at the planet it all came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet was S1Z3, a planet that was largely covered in vegetation but mostly devoid of life. But it was actually perfectly inhabitable by most species, including humans, due to the fresh air, drinkable water and many edible foods. She remembered now, seeing it all in the debriefing files she received after accepting this mission. And while she appreciated those facts, she hadn't come here to vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come in response to a distress signal sent by a human research crew, who were on site studying local plant-life. A safe task if there ever was one, Samus had thought at the time, so why would they need to send a distress signal at all? That added to the fact that the first responders who went to help never reported back was enough to get her attention.<br>\r\nSo she set off to find out what was going on down there. But as soon as she entered to planet's atmosphere her ship started to malfunction she lost control of it and, realizing that she was going to crash, she quickly donned her power suit and braced for impact. But had been tossed about so violently inside her own ship that she was knocked out momentarily. Which all led up to how she ended up here, stuck wearing just her zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion nearby pulled Samus away from her thoughts. She quickly took cover behind a nearby rock, waiting a few moments before poking her head out to see what just happened, she found that  the cause of the explosion was her own starship. She sighed and came out from behind her cover. She examined what was left of her ship and found that the internal damage was too severe, there was no way it was going to fly without extensive repairs. The starship was equipped with a self-repair mechanism, so she wasn't too worried about it. But with it's current state the repairs could take days, possibly even an entire week before completing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew there was no point in standing around and waiting. She had a mission to do after all. Finding the research crew and the rescue crew were top priority right now. And if she were lucky, they might have a working space craft of their own. One they just haven't used to escape the planet yet for whatever reason. Samus wanted that to be true but luck hasn't exactly been on her side since she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her thoughts back to the facts of her more immediate situation, Samus thought to do a quick self-exam.<br>\r\nNo major injuries on her body, just one mild headache that was steadily getting weaker. No tears on her zero suit. Her stun gun was in it's holster on her waist, she checked it for damage and found nothing wrong. But not everything worked though, her map and HUD weren't responding at all. She walked up to her starship and tapped on the side of it, opening a \"hidden\" emergency supply compartment which held some medical supplies, small weapons and a few other helpful items. Samus took what she thought she needed and placed it all neatly in a decently sized bag which she then tied around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything ready, Samus set off into the forest to find the research crew...</span></div></div>",

Her first priority was to scout her surroundings and figure out exactly where she was. S1Z3 was not really a hostile planet compared to others in this and neighbouring solar system, but it was still home to several dangerous life-forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily enough it seemed that Samus' ship had brought her to the right coordinates. After climbing a tree, the bounty hunter saw something resembling a base camp a couple of miles away. She returned to the ground and immediately started heading in the base's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing without her power suit was not something that bothered Samus. She was not only a skilled warrior, but also an enhanced human with Chozo DNA, capable of wonders. The suit however, would have protected her from what would come next. As Samus approached the perimeter of the base, she quietly took cover behind some rocks on high ground. It was not the best spot in terms of camouflage. The zero suit was basically a beacon of attention, but she needed information of the area. Her headache was gone, and without making much noise she carefully removed a pair of binoculars from her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked through the binoculars. There was no movement at the base. No movement at all. Almost like the place was empty. After assessing the situation Samus felt that the best option was to go down to the base and check all the houses. Perhaps they were sleeping, but something felt amiss. As Samus was about to move, she suddenly discovered an alien life-form close to her feet. Samus had never seen anything like it. The creature resembled something of a forest spirit, or the monkey-like Etecoons living on the planet Zebes. The little being just stood there, looking at Samus with huge eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus didn't want to scare it. However, she had to leave this place before someone discovered her. She moved slowly in order to get up on her feet. The creature appeared to be quite friendly, not scared at all, and curiously moved towards Samus's backpack. Samus was not amused by this and and moved her hand towards the animal to make it go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little guy, I need tha..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was suddenly interrupted. As soon as she moved her hand close enough to the animal it let out a scream and released a pink gas at her and then quickly ran away as fast as it could. Samus started coughing, and for a second she feared for her life. After a couple of seconds however, the coughing stopped. Besides a small tingling and almost comfortable sensation she felt just fine. Then again, she knew nothing about the alien and the gas it had released on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus decided to...</span></div></div>",

When she felt no real change in her body she changed her mind and decided to continue with the mission. Her physical condition and immune system were both far more superior than any other human, and whatever she had inhaled it seemed fine. Perhaps the gas wasn't so toxic after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus put the binoculars back in her backpack and left her hiding spot. She had decided to go down to the base and investigate it more closely. She readied herself for combat by removing her stun gun from its holster, and then started to run swiftly through the terrain. Once again, Samus moved with grace. Being without her power suit made her quicker than usual and it kind of suited her mission well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus got down to the base she decided to start investigating one of the barracks within the perimeter. The barracks was almost as big as a truck and had most likely been dropped there by a larger spaceship. It appeared to be something of a research facility. Inside it looked like a combined office and laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Anyone here?\" Samus asked while securing the perimeter. She got no response. The place really was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus started to search the barracks for any kind of information regarding what had happened here. She was still on high alert and prepared for anything. Well, almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aah..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came from nowhere. Suddenly, Samus felt the odd tingling sensation from before return to her body. It swirled through her from high to low. The feeling was so intense that she was forced to lean against a table. She moaned quietly and tried to endure it. It lasted only a short moment before disappearing again. The blond bounty hunter was in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just... happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt dizzy and raised her head. Something felt different, somehow. She looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the room just... grow?\" Samus thought. No, it couldn't have. Was this an illusion? Was it the gas? While thinking about it, Samus noticed her stun gun. It was both bigger and heavier than before. It wasn't the room that had gone bigger. It was Samus who had shrunk several inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus gasped and felt uneasy. She had never experienced anything like this before. She quickly regained her composure however, and tried to focus on the situation at hand. It was a good thing she did, because suddenly...</span></div></div>",

It was an odd feeling to suddenly shrink, she found that she couldn't shake really it, it was like a bad cold or something, it stuck with her. But she soon found the reason for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Agh..!\" She winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling sensation came back, she felt it all over her body once again. This time though, the jolt that coursed her body felt stronger. It was enough to knock the accomplished bounty hunter to her feet, knocking the table she leaned on over in the process.<br>\r\nSamus groaned when she hit the floor, and she shivered from the jolt for just another moment before the feeling subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn..!\" She cursed before getting back to her feet. Without really thinking about it, she also pulled up the table that she had knocked over by accident. When it was up, she noticed that it looked strange somehow, like it was bigger. Samus gasped when she realized it. \"I... I am shrinking...\" She said, thinking out loud. Which was odd for her, but then again, this was an odd situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking had happened to her again. She was even shorter now. She hadn't been completely sure about it before, but it was now easy for her to see that she had indeed shrunk. Several more inches had vanished from her height, just like that. She dreaded to think what might happen to her if this kept up, would she disappear entirely, shrinking into nothing? She cleared those dark thoughts from her mind, thinking about such things would do her no good.<br>\r\nShe could still feel it inside her, whatever was causing this had stuck with her since her first bout of shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A virus</i>? She wondered about the cause. She tried to think about how this was happening to her, and she remembered that little alien creature she encountered just minutes ago, and the gas it sprayed her with. <i>Could it be..?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Samus could think about it anymore, she felt the familiar tingling sensation building up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Ah, uugh..!\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus started to shake again. The strong, coursing sensation was just like before. But this time she took precaution, taking a seat in the chair next to the table before she fell over again. Reeling in pain in the chair, she managed to keep her eyes open and she could see it happen this time. The world grew around her slightly as she lost even more height. When the shrinking was over, mere seconds later, the intense tingling passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Samus knew she had to do something and fast! Otherwise she was just going to keep shrinking away. She had lost too much height already, she didn't know for sure how much, but she couldn't risk losing any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she was sitting in the chair, Samus realized she couldn't feel the floor anymore. Her legs were too short to reach it due to the shrinking. She noticed a mirror and could clearly see in its reflection that she was the size of a child now, and this made her really worried. She was a very capable woman, but this was beyond her control and something that would most likely not go away anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it, this is bad!</i> the bounty hunter thought to herself. <i>My mission will be over soon if this continues!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Samus heard noises. It sounded like items falling to the floor followed by a gasp. She immediately grabbed her stun gun and aimed it at what she thought was the source \u2013 a nearby closet. The stun gun was awfully heavy and Samus was forced to hold it with both hands in order to keep a steady aim. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I know you're in there. If you're not an alien, show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell over the room and soon the closet started to open slowly. Out came an elegant young woman, looking mighty scared. She appeared to be a scientist, or perhaps some sort of researcher. She wore a classic white lab coat together with an aqua-colored top and something that appeared to be either shorts or a skirt. Her hair was almost the opposite of Samus - brown and kind of short, ending around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm unarmed. Please don't shoot me!\" the girl said with horror in her voice. It was obvious she was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, listen. I...\" Samus started, but was once again interrupted by another powerful shrinking seizure. Samus did everything to focus, but the more she tried the more pain she felt. The feeling was too intense for her. The stun gun soon became too heavy for her and she was forced to drop it. The scientist girl was quick to notice this and immediately ran towards the table and grabbed it. With shaky hands she aimed it at Samus, who now was only 20 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you and what are you doing in this laboratory? Answer me!\" The girl said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your enemy. My name is Samus and I'm a bounty hunter. I got your distress call, but I ended up crashing with my ship. I... a-aah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt another seizure, and she was sweating now. She managed to remain calm, but spoke fast as she tried to endure it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... I don't know what's going on... help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl hesitated, but as soon as she made her decision she acted with haste. She dropped the gun and quickly went to a cabinet to grab a small canister. When she returned to Samus, the young scientist sprayed the bounty hunter with some sort of gas. Whatever it was it felt really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. This should halt the shrinking for the time being, or at least slow it down.\" the girl said, now with acting as she was a lot more calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been inflicted with a poisonous gas from the gindyni. You will need to take some medicine at specific intervals for the shrinking to completely stop, but you should be alright. I'm Claire by the way. Are you sure you are a bounty hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It may not look like it but I am. And thank you for stopping it. Tell me Claire, what happened here?\" Samus asked, trying to ignore her new size, which was probably around 12 inches. The girl was already a giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question made Claire uneasy, but soon she started explain. She was the daughter of two scientists that was part of a team of researchers and bio chemists. They had come to S1Z3 in order to study its unique plant-life for the benefit of mankind. During their stay they had made some amazing discoveries, which had all been reported to their superiors off-planet. However, the transmission had been intercepted by space-pirates, and soon thereafter the pirates had attacked the small colony and captured the scientists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to hide in that closet and was too afraid to come out until you appeared.\" Claire said, trying to hold back her tears. \"Samus... what should we do? You might be a bounty hunter, but you can't do anything in that size!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm...\" Samus mused over Claire's words. She took a moment to stop and take a good look around the room. The last few minutes were so frantic for the tiny bounty hunter that her ever diminishing size hadn't really caught up to her yet. As such, looking at the room now was a huge shock to her, she still had her never-give-up bounty hunter instincts well intact, but seeing the room and everything in it, especially Claire who now looked like a giantess to her, made Samus finally realize how small she truly was, and how helpless she could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see?\" Claire asked, seeing the shrunken woman's reaction. \"It's not safe..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her head, Samus agreed that it would not be safe. But when was any mission of hers ever safe anyway, she rationalized to herself. \"No.\" She said in a confident voice that surprised Claire. \"My size doesn't matter. I will handle this... alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" Claire exclaimed, genuinely worried for Samus' safety if she were to go out at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Samus shot back with a determined look on her face, but eased up a second later. \"Look, I can't just stay here with you and do nothing. Thank you for worrying, but I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shook her head. \"No, you won't.\" She said. \"There's something I haven't explained to you about this place yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This planet, S1Z3.\" Claire chuckled. \"Heh, that name must be some kinda joke or something.\" Samus wasn't amused, looking like she didn't understand what was so funny about it. \"S1Z3.\" Claire repeated to her. \"You know what it looks like written down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Size.\" Samus answered, finally getting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Claire said. \"Size. I don't know what it is about this place but the creatures here, although there aren't many, all seem to have various abilities to change the size of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the Gindyni from before?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Claire answered. \"Although our research has found that most of the animals native to this planet are immune to the effects of size change, the plants are not. Which explained why they were so unique, we thought it was something in their nature or the soil around here that caused them to grow so quickly, but as it turned out it was the creatures living here that were the cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing and shrinking food?\" Samus asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You catch on quick.\" Claire said, sounding a little more relaxed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but-\" Samus started to say, but she suddenly felt another shrinking seizure coming on. But this one was different, much smaller and less effective. She shrank an inch after it was over, leaving her at a tiny 11 inches tall. \"Not again!\" She complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Clarie said, reaching for the spray she had used earlier. \"Like I said, you need to take this at certain intervals to completely stop the shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sprayed Samus with the medicine again, and the tiny bounty hunter's shrinking seemed to slow to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that enough to stop it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately not.\" Claire explained. She put the canister of medicine on a nearby table and sat down in a chair. \"It'll take a lot more than that to completely cure you. In fact, you're still shrinking even now, but at such a slow rate it's hardly noticeable. Well, actually, I can't see it since you're so small and shrinking so slow, but can you see it happening before you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus paused for a moment to be sure. She could just barely notice everything around her growing larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but just barely.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Clarie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Claire.\" Samus said, returning to her confident and commanding tone. \"Thanks again for all the help. But I really must be going now. The space pirates might be planning their escape already, and there's no time to wait around here so I can take the cure. Besides, with all that you've told me I think I'll be fine if you just let me have that little canister, I think I can handle that.\" At that, Claire nodded. It seemed a fair enough point to let her have it. But she still wasn't convinced that it would be safe, she told Samus as such again, and the bounty hunter replied, \"Don't let my *cough* reduced size make you think I'm helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Samus, please-\" Claire was cut off again by Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. I've been in worse situations than this before.\" Samus said. Although she knew it wasn't really true, she knew she had to convince Claire somehow. \"I'll find the pirates and rescue the research crew. Really. I'm telling you it'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's response...</span></div></div>",

She handed one to Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Communicators?\" Samus asked, examining the tiny thing in her hand, it was small even to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Claire said. \"We can talk to each other over these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Samus said, placing one into her ear. \"How'd you get them so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, that's the normal size for them.\" Claire explained, she showed Samus the one in her hand, it was the same size as the one in Samus' ear. \"See?\" Claire put the earpiece in her ear. \"They're more like microchips for, um, regular sized people. But I guess it's like an earpiece to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how bizarre.\" Samus said. Thinking about how odd her reduced size made things seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, here's the spray.\" Claire handed Samus the little canister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took the small canister with ease, putting into her stun gun's holster, which, unlike her stun gun, thankfully <b>had</b> shrunk with her. It fit rather well in there. Samus taught it much better to keep it there for quick and easy access, in case she started shrinking faster again, she could pull it out and apply it much faster than if it were inside her supply bag, which had also shrunk with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Claire.\" Samus said. \"You've been a big help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled at that little size pun. Samus didn't quite catch on though, and just started at the larger girl quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, Samus. You say you've come here to help us, so the least I can do is give you a <i>little</i> help.\" Claire said, keeping up the size related puns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, right.\" Samus said flatly. \"I'll be going now if there's nothing else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" Claire exclaimed as if she'd just remembered something important. \"The pirates base! I think I have a way to find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" Samus asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Wait a second, please.\" Claire got up from her chair and hurried to find something in the back of the room. When she returned she was holding another device, this one looking like a circular tracking device. She handed it to Samus. \"Our research crew always wear tracking devices in case one of us gets lost. This device lets us find them. And this is one of our smaller models. Oh, and since they were captured...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it.\" Samus said, not looking away from the screen. \"If the pirates took them to their base, this should help us find it easily..!\" She looked up, and up, to Claire. \"This will make things much easier. Thank you again, Claire, I'm glad I found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.\" Claire said, with a slight blush at the compliment. She hadn't known Samus long, but she already felt like she'd made a good friend in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus put the tracker into her bag. With everything finally set for her big journey, Samus tied up the bag. She looked up at Claire and smiled, giving her a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Keep yourself hidden, in case any more pirates come back here.\" Samus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded. She went back to the closet she had been hiding in when Samus first arrived, took a last look at the diminutive bounty hunter, and stepped inside and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus watched until she was sure Claire was safely hidden away in the closet. She turned to leave, when she saw her stun gun laying on the floor, she lamented the loss of her only weapon, but continued on. She got up and left the barracks, at last setting off to find the captured research crew.</span></div></div>",

I never would've guessed you'd come back after all those shots you gave me. I was even beginning to think you were just someone in disguise trying to sneak into the castle\" Peach complemented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling you,\" Daisy replied, a slight agitation in her voice. \"I was just off my game until then. I've told you before that true competitive side doesn't show on the off season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really gotta give me some pointers some time,\" the pink princess continued. \"Especially how you pick up on where the ball's going to be before I even hit it! That would definitely help me during the tournament!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just in my blood,\" Daisy explained. \"And it's also something I'll take to my grave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls continued their conversation as they walked back to Peach's castle. Back inside, they continued to talk while a Toad servant handed them each a glass of lemonade. The conversation ended when Peach reached her room, the princess entering her chamber while Daisy went on to her guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her room, Peach entered the bathroom, carrying some fresh undergarments and one of her signature dresses. She removed her sweaty clothing and entered the shower to freshen herself up. A few minutes later, Peach emerged, entirely clean. She then put on her fresh clothes, applied some more makeup, and exited the bathroom, ready to get on with her day. However, she then noticed on the nightstand next to her soft, pink-sheeted bed a tray with a mushroom on it. It looked like a normal mushroom, but had a green cap with pink spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... Never seen this type of mushroom before... Well, I am hungry after that, so I guess this'll have to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she bit into the mushroom. However, immediately after taking the first bite, she was overjoyed by the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've never tasted anything so good in my life!</i> Peach thought, as she bit took another bite out of the mushroom. Seconds later, she noticed that it had entirely disappeared from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow... I don't think I've ever eaten so fast in my life either...</i> She thought, somewhat embarrassed that she had devoured the strange mushroom like wolf to meat. <i>Well, at least nobody saw me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach then began to advance toward her door, but immediately noticed something was wrong when the walls suddenly began moving upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she asked herself, as she looked down and the ground was suddenly moving closer. She then looked toward the nightstand, and saw that it was increasing in size. At this point, her head was about at it's level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrinking!\" Peach shockingly cried out, as she continued to decrease in size. A few seconds later, Peach was a mere inch tall in height; just about the size of a chess piece. However, as soon as she was over the shock, she looked in wonder at her surroundings; everything was much bigger then it had been before; her bed and nightstand appeared to be skyscrapers compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was brought out of her trance by a sudden knock at the door, followed by a voice saying, \"You done in there, Peach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Daisy! But can I really let her see me while I'm like this?</i> Peach thought out in worry. <i>I could attempt to crawl under the door and sneak out... but also risk being squashed... but the same thing could happen anyway if Daisy came in here...</i> However, after a few more seconds of thought, Peach finally made her decision:</span></div></div>",

Standing about twenty feet (from her height) away from the door, looked down at the space underneath the door, and began to wonder if her plan would even work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked herself, <i>Am I even small enough to be able to squeeze under there? And what if Daisy notices me when I leave? Would she recognize me at this height? In fact, would anyone else recognize me?</i> The thoughts crept into her mind one by one, and Peach began to doubt that she could survive in a gigantic world. However, her thoughts were interrupted by another bang on the door from Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Peach! Are you dressed yet or not!? C'mon, answer me already!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Peach fell over onto her rear in shock and fear, surprised not by the knock itself but by how loud and impatient Daisy's tone was, especially at her current height. She grabbed her crown, which had fallen off her head when she fell over, and placed it back on top of her thick blond hair. The tiny princess then stood up, walked the rest of the distance to the door, fell onto her stomach, and began to crawl under the gap between the door and the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully Daisy won't barge in while I'm under here...</i> Peach thought, her heart racing with each moment. Finally, she emerged from underneath the doorway and stood in the halls of her castle. She immediately stood up and smoothed her dress; however, when she glanced upward she was greeted by a wall of orange. The shrunken princess looked upward, and her eyes widened in shock when she saw how massive Princess Daisy was compared to her now. Currently wearing her usual princess attire, Daisy was about the size of a skyscraper from Peach's perspective. Her arms were folded over her chest, and her face showed her impatience. Daisy stood about four feet away from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the princess in orange finally lost her patience. She took one step forward, and banged on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" she yelled. \"I'm coming in there whether you're done or not!\" Daisy then grabbed the doorknob and thrust the door open. Upon first glance, she saw that the room was unoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach? Are you in there?\" she asked, taking another step forward and peering inside her bedroom. However, her foot was directly where Peach was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, the shrunken princess cowered and fell over onto her back again, shrieking as Daisy's foot descended from above her. Peach shut her eyes and braced herself for the worst as the heeled shoe came down over her. <i>If it has to end, at least it was Daisy...</i> she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a few seconds, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I'm not a Peach pancake?\" she asked herself, opening her eyes and noticing not only that she was still alive but that there wasn't a giant foot smearing her tiny, delicate form against the ground underneath it. She then looked up, and was once again surprised by what she saw: She was under Daisy's heeled shoe, but the arc of the shoe was over her instead of the sole or heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess let out a sigh of relief. \"Way too close...\" she said. She then watched as Daisy entered the room to check for her presence. Peach stood up and smoothed her dress once more. \"My first few couple of minutes shrunk and I'm almost stepped on...\" she told herself. \"But now that that's behind me, what should I do now...?\"</span></div></div>",

The cosmic princess was having fun playing tennis, racing karts and doing all sorts of things with Mario and the gang. After the last match of tennis against Princess Daisy, in which Rosalina was the victor, she decided to take a rest for awhile. She found a nice spot under a tree nearby where she could sit and rest. Her star-shaped friend, Luma, followed and hovered beside her, holding a stone he found behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, it's quite nice here. Are you having fun, Luma?\" Rosalina asked the star child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Mama!\" Luma exclaimed, but then looked distressed. \"But I'm worried about the others on the observatory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to be worried.\" Rosalina said, patting him. \"We've only been gone for a few hours, I'm sure they can manage on their own for a while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but still...\" Luma said, he wasn't used to being away from home for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Okay, Luma.\" Rosalina started. \"Why don't you go and check on them for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Mama? You'll be all alone!\" Luma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, I've got Mario and the others here with me.\" Rosalina said with a reassuring smile. \"Now, go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mama! You can count on me!\" Luma said, giving Rosalina a salute. \"I'll be back soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Luma floated off. Rosalina watched the young star go, keeping a watchful eye on him as long as she could, he seemed to get smaller and smaller as he flew away from her. When she could no longer see him anymore, her attention turned back to the tennis court, where she saw that a match between Yoshi and Toad was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina watched the match for a while before she noticed something on the ground. A glowing yellow stone, it was about the size of a tennis ball and at first that's what Rosalina thought it was, but it's ominous glow and star pattern made her think otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Luma leave this here?\" Rosalina wondered, she did see him trying to hide something behind his back. But she was intrigued by it, and she reached down and picked up the mysterious object. She felt a strange energy emanating from the stone as she held it. \"I wonder if someone here knows what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust was she was about to get up and ask, she suddenly felt very weak and tired and in a moment, she collapsed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke sometime later, Rosalina found herself in an area surrounded by large trees, which looked more like huge blades of grass to the cosmic princess. She thought it was odd, but what really made her think was the huge stone next to her, with it's familiar yellow glow and star pattern, she thought it was the same stone she had held in her hand earlier. The only difference was that it was now almost as big as she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the same stone from before? But it's so much bigger now.\" Rosalina wondered, then had a sudden realization. \"Oh no, could it be..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the worst, Rosalina stood up and saw that everything really was bigger, and she immediately knew what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've shrunk.\" Rosalina said in her usual monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had experienced shrinking before, when she helped Mario and his friends rescue the sprixies from Bowser, but she had never gotten this small. Comparing herself to the stone that shrunk her, She estimated herself to be about 6 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get some help.\" Rosalina said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina set off to find somebody to help her get back to normal size, but she didn't get very far before she tripped and almost fell over, she then looked down and saw...</span></div></div>",

She kept her calm demeanor up, but really, she was quite worried about her situation. Despite this, she didn't attempt to cover herself, not that there was anyone around to see her tiny, nude body anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that her magic just might be able to help her right about now, Rosalina walked over to her wand, which had fallen from her hand when she shrunk and was now lying on the grass. As she had expected, it hadn't shrunk, and the magic tool could now tower over her, if it was upright, that is. But as it was lying flat on the ground Rosalina, even at her shrunken size, could still easily grasp her hand around the wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the base of the wand and focused, trying to cast her magic, any magic that could help her. She had hoped the she might be able to use it to grow herself back, as she's grown to giant sizes with it before. Or maybe just make another, much smaller, dress appear so she wouldn't be so exposed. But to her dismay, nothing she tried worked. It was as if all its magic had been drained, as it was, the wand was now basically just another stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my clothes don't fit me, and my magic isn't working. Hmm...\" Rosalina thought about how she could get out of this mess. \"If only I hadn't sent Luma away, he could get the others to...\" Rosalina sighed. She knew it was pointless to worry about the past, right now she was shrunk and naked. She'd have to resort to her original plan, she needed someone to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the cosmic princess, she didn't have to wait long, as she heard footsteps approaching her location.

Although she did see a strange glowing stone near the dress, she bent down to examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina ditched her cover from the dress and ran, really more of a fast walk for her, towards the princess. She saw that Peach was looking at the mysterious stone that Rosalina knew must've been what shrunk her, and now the same thing was about to happen to Peach if she didn't act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach examined the strange-looking stone some more, taking note of its unique star patterns and low glow. She reached down to grab it, when she saw something crawl by.

Rosalina was more cautious of the new, seemingly giantess-sized princess though, telling Peach to wait and watch. But Peach could only wait so long before shouting up to her huge friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy! Down here!\" Peach shouted. Of course, to Daisy, her shouts only registered as tiny squeaking noises. Peach saw Daisy bend down, and she thought Daisy had heard her cries for help. When she felt Daisy grab onto her dress that she was currently standing on, she wasn't sure what Daisy was doing. Then all of a sudden she was knocked off of her feet and sent flying onto her back! She only had a split second to see Daisy's confused face before her dress softly floated over her, covering her tiny form completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy had reached down and quickly flipped the bright pink dress over, never noticing the shrunken princess standing on it. She thought there was a mouse or something under the dress making those squeaking noises she heard, so she was puzzled when she didn't see anything under it at all. Then she heard another squeak, this time it came from the blue dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're a sneaky little thing, aren't you?\" Daisy commented, thinking the \"mouse\" had scurried under the nearby dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach!\" Rosalina cried again, worried about the other princesses fate. She was watching the scene, carefully watching for any sign that Peach was okay. As such, she had no time to react when she felt the floor beneath her quickly jut out from under her. And she soon suffered the same fate as Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Daisy was really confused, she had flipped both dresses over, rather quickly and unceremoniously to boot! But she never found out what was making those squeaking sounds. She wondered about that, and also about what could've happened to Rosalina and Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd you go, you little vermin?\" Daisy asked, looking at the ground. \"Really weird! I was sure I heard something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy wasn't sure what was going on, but she was more determined to get to the bottom of this then ever. She looked around the area again for any sign of her fellow princesses, when something got her attention...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What's this?\" Daisy wondered aloud, looking at the strange glowing stone nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy got closer to the bright yellow rock, somewhat entranced by it low shimmer. She didn't waste any time in picking up the tennis ball-sized stone and examining it. She thought the stone was odd on its own, but she noticed that the longer she held it the weaker she felt, and she was having a hard time standing. She put two and two together and realized that this strange, glowing stone must be what is making her feel so tired. By now though, it was all too much, even for the tomboy princess to take, and she dropped the stone to the ground and sat down by a nearby tree to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just g-give me a... minute...\" Daisy mumbled to herself. She tried to keep herself awake for a little longer, hoping to get her energy back now that she wasn't holding the glowing stone. She had just noticed that everything seemed to be slowly getting bigger, and that was the last thing she saw before she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rosalina had just managed to crawl out from under her dress. Turning around, she saw Daisy slumped up against the tree, and the glowing stone on the ground beside her. She thought Daisy might've touched the cursed stone. Her suspicions were confirmed when she saw the brunette giantess shrink into her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Daisy... Not you too!\" Rosalina thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that!? Daisy's shrinking too!\" Peach shouted from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina turned around again and saw that Peach had also escaped from underneath her own dress. The two girls met up with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to help her!\" Peach insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Rosalina agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shrunken princesses then went over to Daisy's yellow-colored clothing pile. They spotted a little lump in the giant pair of shorts Daisy had worn, and they knew that it must be Daisy herself. Hurrying inside the giant-sized clothes, Rosalina and Peach worked together to grab their newly reduced friend and drag her outside. Soon, all three shrunken women were outside, on top of Daisy's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Peach exclaimed, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Peach?\" Rosalina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you see?! Daisy's naked!\" Peach exclaimed, and ran off towards Daisy's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to make some more clothes?\" Rosalina asked, giggling a little at Peach's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Peach shouted back, but not daring to look back at Daisy's nude body. \"Are you going to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm coming.\" Rosalina replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy woke up a few minutes later. The last thing she remembered was resting up against a tree, and then she passed out for some reason. She felt something covering her though, and she looked down and saw a big yellow blanket. In fact, the whole floor she was on was yellow. Then she saw Princess Peach and Rosalina sitting nearby, wearing some rather poorly made clothes that didn't seem to fit them so well, and they also looked like they had been watching her for awhile, like they were waiting for her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Rosie! She's up!\" Peach exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach!? Rosalina!?\" Daisy shouted, getting out of her covers and standing up. \"What are you doing here? What happened to your clothes? And where are we anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach had quickly looked away when Daisy got up. Daisy wondered why, but then she felt something off and looked down, she was standing completely naked in front of the other princesses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why am I naked!?\" Daisy screamed and tried to cover herself up with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, put this on.\" Rosalina said, holding out a rather small two piece outfit, it looked similar to the one Rosalina had on, except this one was yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy grabbed the clothing from Rosalina and turned around to put it on, it was very tight, but she got it on nonetheless. She spun back around, facing the other princesses. She saw Peach give her a little thumbs up, and she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Would somebody tell me what's going on already?\" Daisy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina then went over all of the events leading up to now, including the unfortunate incident where Daisy had flipped the other tiny girls under their own dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's wild.\" Daisy said. \"Heh, sorry about throwing you guys under the dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it!\" Peach assured her. \"We just want to get back to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I!\" Daisy said in agreement. \"This stuff doesn't wear off, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it does, it takes a rather long time.\" Rosalina answered, she been had shrunk first after all, and that was almost an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So we really need to find someone to help us.\" Peach explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. But, uh, what about that stone?\" Daisy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" Rosalina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what if somebody finds it, and they shrink like we did?\" Daisy asks. \"I think we should try to cover it up. So nobody'll find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a point, Daisy. I never thought of that!\" Peach says. \"What do you think, Rosie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... \" Rosalina says, weighing the options in her head. She knew the stone was dangerous, and she was worried about getting close to it again. But Peach was right, Daisy did have a point...</span></div></div>",

And it might also help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. But how would it really help us?\" Peach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's say that maybe, if we ever need to find the stone again. Then keeping it hidden under cover would make it harder for someone to find, and possibly take.\" Rosalina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha! Of course!\" Daisy said. \"I hadn't thought of that other bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking, Rosie!\" Peach cheered. \"You've got it all figured out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you two.\" Rosalina smiled. \"Now, I also thought about how to cover it. And I thought using my dress would be best. It's the closest to the stone, and it's certainly big enough to get the job done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So, who's going to do it?\" Daisy asked. \"And don't say me! I don't want to go anywhere near that thing again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but Daisy, wasn't this your idea?\" Peach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. But I'm really more of an idea person, somebody else should do the work!\" Daisy said. \"How about you Peach? Feeling up to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, not really..!\" Peach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll cover it.\" Rosalina said confidently. She picked up her dress, and made her way over to the stone to cover it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Brains and bravery.\" Daisy whispered to herself as she watched the cosmic princess walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all going well, until Rosalina accidentally dropped the dress. She went to go pick it up, but she tripped over it, almost falling over. Luckily, she found something to hold herself up and keep from falling completely over. Thinking that was a close one, she then got her bearings again and lifted herself off of the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rock?\" She thought. It was then that she realized that she had just used that strange, glowing stone to keep from falling down. She was worried about what might happen to her, now that she had touched it again, and then, she felt it happening again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shrinking again! This time though, it all happened so fast, her shrinking only took several seconds before it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina hadn't passed out like before though, possibly because she was already shrunken, she wasn't sure why. What she was sure of was that she was now smaller then ever! Peach and Daisy ran up to the incredibly tiny princess. Rosalina was shocked when she saw that she didn't even reach the other girls' knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosie, you're so tiny!\" Peach exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Rosalina! This is all my fault!\" Daisy cried. \"Me and my bright idea..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Daisy. It's my fault.\" Rosalina assured the bigger girl. \"I accidentally touched the stone again. That's why I shrunk again, not because of you. I... Should've been more careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rosalina.\" Daisy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach suddenly picked up Rosalina, easily holding the twice shrunken woman in her hand. Peach examined Rosalina closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Peach exclaimed. \"You're really little now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Peach, I know.\" Rosalina said, with the slightest hint of annoyance in her voice. \"Comparing myself to you, I'd say that I'm only about 2 inches tall now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach held Rosalina while Daisy watched, and the scene continued for sometime as the girls adjusted to Rosalina's new size. They had forgotten about covering the stone for now. They didn't even notice as someone approached them. It was...</span></div></div>",

That night in camp she tested it, expelling a large amount of magic and focusing on the small bird she'd been studying she released the spell. There was a large drop for Morrigan as she fell to the ground, her new instincts activating just in time for her to flap enough to not crash to the ground.

''We came home and you were wasted, you wanted me to shrink you and do 'things' your exact words were 'make me small babe, i want to be wholey within you, I want to feel your walls contract around my entire being as you come undone from me squirming deep inside you''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke gaped and blushed, she hadn't expected Merrill to find out about her fantasy like that ''Are you sure I didn't want you in ME?'' she asked already knowing the answer ''Nope I asked you last night, you said you didn't want more control you wanted no control for a little while'' ''Ok, well how about you unshrink me and we forget all about this incident...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuprisingly Hawke was grabbed roughly by Merrill, her fingers wrapped around her with her thumb pressed firmly on her breasts ''No! I've waited all night for this, all your touches as you shrunk, your little body so close to my face sleephumping our pillow, I mean you were so close to me and you're a little more than a mouthful of loveliness, I could've just opened my mouth and sucked on you all night long.'' Merril sighed ''I had to resist your advances to protect you, but I wanted to badly to just take you! But I couldn't risk you shock sobering or waking up in an unfamilier place and though you know my body wonderfully, my vagina, ass and even my breasts are completely different at your size. You wanted less power my love, I'll take it all. So listen here Hawke, you aren't getting bigger until I say so, and I'm not going to even consider it until I have you inside me and you make me cum from your squirming'' Merrill ordered, smirking when she felt Hawke's juices dripping onto her fingers and her hardening nipples under her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke couldn't help herself this was a dream come true, sure when they were still new to Krikwall she'd imagined shrinking down and being swallowed up by Isabella's impressive cleavage but as she got to know and later love cute little Merril her fantasies had also moved to the beautiful elven mage; crawling inside her vagina, squirming feet first into her tight ass hole and sleeping contently between her unbeleivably soft, large breasts, even imagining Merrill putting her in her mouth and sucking on her from time to time.

The two had found themselves a space on a warehouse rooftop to observe the activity, and then report back to the rest of the avengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you ready to go Wasp?\" Spiderwoman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\" The Wasp responded. \"How many of them can you see from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I counted about five the first time I looked, but more of them could have arrived with the shipment. I don't think they would only bring five people for something as important as this is supposed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then there's either more of them or the intel wasn't accurate.Comms are working, I'm going in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Wasp shrunk down to three inches tall, and sprouted tiny little wings out of her back. She flashed a thumbs up to her comparatively gigantic friend, who immediately gave one back. She then flew towards the shipping containers to observe.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSpiderwoman sat waiting for the Wasp to report back on her findings. She began to wonder what it would feel like to shrink down the Wasp's size. Suddenly her thoughts were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, there's at least three more guys than you saw in your initial sweep.\" A tiny voice came through Spiderwoman's ear piece. \"They're hanging out inside this container, I'm going in for a better look of what's inside, over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy that, over.\" Jessica responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever they have in here, it just simply looks like your run of the mill smuggling items, it doesn't look like it's related to Hydra, over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like they got some bad intel, alright come back. Careful though, the other five are walking towards the container, if you can hide and manage to get them on mic, we should be able to draw a conclusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy, that I'm going smaller, over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp then shrunk down even further and landed on the collar of one of the guards unnoticed. The men then began to have a conversation in Russian and as time passed the conversation seemed to turn to the crates in the shipping container. One of the men pulled a gun out of the crate and showed it to the other one. This seemed to please the rest of the men and the five left the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you pick up that conversation?\" The Wasp said into the mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear, over.\" Spiderwoman responded. \"Sounds like a dead end. Come on back, Jan we can probably move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that, over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp then grew back to three inches tall, and flew back to Spiderwoman at their vantage point. As spiderwoman looked to pack up her equipment, the Wasp grew back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jan, what's it like to be that small?\" Spiderwoman asked as Wasp grew back to her normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm.\" Jan was surprised at the question. \"It's an exhilarating feeling, while at the same time it feels like your entire body is being squeezed, and then suddenly you're everything else is bigger than you and you're looking up at everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that seems incredible.\" Jessica then looked up and down the Wasp's form that not thirty seconds before was three inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" The Wasp asked looking back at Spiderwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got to thinking after you shrank down--\" Suddenly, there was a crash as if something had been dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two superheroines, each suddenly remembered their mission and looked back at the men loading the truck. The gangsters had begun to load up a box truck with the crates from the shipping container. Two of the men had dropped one of the crates on the ground, and the other men were yelling at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should get on that truck to help track it.\" The Wasp said breaking the silence. \"You think you can follow along on the roofs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can swing it.\" Jessica said while laughing at her pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one.\" The Wasp responded rolling her eyes. \"Alright, I'm moving out. Keep me covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp turned back towards the truck, but just before she shrank herself back down, Spiderwoman had thought of something else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Jan--\" Jessica said suddenly reaching for The Wasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden The Wasp began to shrink and Jesica suddenly felt her whole body contract and she suddenly became light headed and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up she was face to face with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly closed her eyes again, and when she reopened her eyes she was looking into the face of her friend the Wasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnng, Jan.\" She managed to say before wincing. \"What happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you had a little accident and then, you fainted.\" Jan said, clearly thinking of how to better explain her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean a little acc--\" Suddenly, Jessica noticed that Jan's wings were out, something that only happened when she was shrunk down. What Jan had meant by \"little accident\" was now clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, holy crap!\" Jessica said looking around at her suddenly enormous surroundings. \"How? But you can't-- what is happening?\" Jessica began to incoherently ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jessica felt a breeze on her backside and then in between her legs, and she suddenly had the realization that her costume hadn't shrunk with her, and unfortunately for her, it hadn't. She was nude at no more than six inches tall on a rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, we can--\" Jan started to say to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm Down?\" Jessica interrupted. \"You can't shrink people! What the hell happened? I'm butt naked at the size of a freaking pixie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jessica had the realization that she needed to cover her shame so she did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I shrunk you.\" Jan said in her said calm voice. \"This has never happened before. On the bright side now you know what it's like to shrink.\" Jan said with a smile hoping that might placate Jessica a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, where's my costume? Did you strip me nude?\" Jessica said looking at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be ridiculous.\" Jan said almost offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, if me touching you while you were shrinking, shrunk me too, maybe if you try growing back to normal size I could grow back with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that while you were still out. It didn't work. I'm so sorry Jessica.\" Jan's eyes almost began to fill with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Jessica said trying to comfort her clearly distraught friend. \"For now let's--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it?\" Jan said incredulously. \"I just shrank you to half a foot tall! We don't even know if you can still use your powers! I may have just ruined your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica realized that she may not have any more superpowers. She suddenly looked at an attenna on the roof, and shot her web out towards it, and thankfully she still had her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I still have my powers.\" Jessica said to calm Jan down even more. \"Let's just try and get back to base, and see if there's anything else wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Jan agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jan backed away from Jessica and grew back to full size. She then got on the radio to signal base for a pickup. Jessica began to take in the scene in front of her. She then looked back at the now gigantic Wasp signaling for an evac. She then got a clever idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jan had finished the call, she suddenly felt something touching her butt, followed by a tug. She then reached her hand back and felt the tiny figure of a woman, and picked it up and brought her to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth are you doing?\" Jan said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I felt a little cheeky.\" Jessica said with a smile across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the women were interrupted by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then turned her attention to Jan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do, Jan?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apparently shrunk her.\" The Wasp answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really, don't know. One second I'm attempting to shrink to better track the subjects, and then I feel a hand on my shoulder and I turn around to see Jessica's suit lying on the floor without, Jessica in it. I flew over and looked into the suit to find her shrunk to my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, if I touch you am I going to shrink?\" Natasha said while moving back from Jan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha then leaned closer to her again, and poked Jan on the shoulder, before quickly recoiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were afraid I was going to shrink you, by touching me, why on Earth did you try it?\" Jan said moderately annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- I don't know.\" Natasha responded. \"Is she okay? Can she use her powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp then moved her hand so that Jessica was standing in her palm. Spiderwoman stood up, and shot her webs right at Black Widow's chest. Suddenly she pulled on the webs and pulled herself towards the giant Avenger. She did an acrobatic flip while swinging and landed right between her cleavage. Natasha pulled the tiny woman out from between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to stick the landing.\" Black Widow smirked at the woman now in her hand. \"So what do we do now, Jan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we go back to the lab to see if everything is okay.\" Jan replied. \"On top of that, we've got to make sure that I can't shrink anyone again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women then walked towards the aircraft and took off towards the helicarrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived they were immediately greeted by S.H.I.E.L.D Agent, Maria Hill and Tony Stark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, where is the little lady?\" Tony said as Black Widow and The Wasp were stepping off their ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to phrase it like that Tony?\" Jan said clearly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I'm pretty excited to see the Incredible Itsy-Bitsy Spiderwoman.\" Tony said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out, Tony.\" Black Widow said. \"Who are we taking her too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony and Bruce are going to join Jan with the examination, and then Jan will have her own.\" Maria said. \"Jan, if you're ready, we'd like to begin quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tests revealed that all of Jessica's bodily functions were operating normally. Unfortunately, for Jessica, they were unable to find a way for her to grow back to normal size. They were also unable to find any possible cause for why she shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had constructed, Jessica a room for her to stay for a short time while they constructed a more suitable environment. Unfortunately, Jessica would have to remain naked, as they didn't have any doll clothes readily available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica was resting up in her new \"apartment\" she had a visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who came to visit?<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was clear that this room was eventually going to be a bedroom, as there was a closet off to one side and most of the furniture was meant for a bedroom. The bed looked to be about queen size, with a tan comforter. They had placed a couch down on one side of the room so that she wouldn't just have to sit on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked over to her bed and pulled the comforter off and wrapped it around her self, to both warm and cover herself up. She walked over to the closet, or at least where the closet would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, give me a closet that I don't have any clothes for.\" Jessica thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked to the couch in the room, and she sat down attempting to think of something that might take her mind off her situation. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door to the \"apartment.\" Spider-Woman looked at the door confused. Then there was another knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can look into here, why do they bother knocking?\" Jessica thought to herself as she walked over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the door she was greeted by the sight of Jan at the same size as her, which explains why she bothered knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jessica.\" Wasp said sheepishly. \"Do you mind if I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could use someone to talk to right now.\" Jessica said opening the door the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked in, and sat down on the tiny couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for letting me in, I was afraid that since I shrunk...\" Jan started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to you, about this earlier, don't worry about it.\" Jessica interrupted. \"This was a freak accident, and you have nothing to beat yourself up over. This isn't your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is, Jessica! It's because of me that you have to wrap yourself in a blanket because no clothes can fit you! You have to live in an apartment the size of shoe box because of me!\" Jan started to sob. \"I've completely ruined your life, I can grow back but who knows if you even can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica moved to put her hand on her friend's leg to console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan, I forgave you almost immediately after we realized what happened.\" Jan moved her hand on top of Jessica's. \"Besides, why would I ever hate you for something that you never meant to happen? Besides, I'll get some clothes eventually, and I'm sure they'll expand the apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're probably right.\" Jan said wiping away a tear from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, it's nice to be able to talk to someone that's my size.\" Jessica said, grateful that she had calmed her friend down. \"Now if only someone else was naked right now.\" Jessica joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can join you if you want me to.\" Jan responded jokingly. She then made a little gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Jan, I think that would cheer me up.\" Jessica said before she realized what she was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she really wanted to see Jan naked, she couldn't believe what she was thinking, she'd never wanted this before she shrunk.

This of course revealed Jessica's front side and Jan giggled with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think you somehow look better at this size, Jessica.\" Jan said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you.\" Jessica responded. \"You must have a thing for petite women then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you sure are petite.\" Jan said while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky, I think you may have convinced me that I like petite women too.\" Jessica said lying back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan sat down on the couch next to her and the women looked over each other in silence for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jessica, what exactly did they do in the lab today?\" Jan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, just tests of vitals, I don't think they're going to do much else until they make sure all of that was fine.\" Jessica responded. \"So what happened to you, after they took me to the lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I also got a trip to the lab.\" Jan said shifting in her seat. \"They looked for possible reasons that this could have happened, whether or not I could make it happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing they couldn't figure anything out, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not sure they will actually. This has never happened before and it seemingly came out of nowhere. God, I just feel so helpless. I can't help you, or anyone else I might shrink. At least, you're not angry with me I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan pulled her legs up to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what it's like to be this small, and it can feel really lonely sometimes, knowing that you're the only person this size in the world. Even when I had Hank, it sometimes felt lonely. And it really has been since he's been gone. When I saw you at my size, I was immediately terrified, but once I held you in my hand when I was regular sized again, I realized that you were going to feel everything that I once felt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica put her hand on her friend's leg again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as soon as I found out you were okay, I figured I would come by and check on you.\" Jan continued. \"So that maybe, you didn't feel alone in this. Besides after being prodded over by what are basically giants to you all day, you could probably stand to see someone the same size as you. Of course, you know that I feel responsible for this, I just thought that I would come by and talk for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica reached over and gave her friend a hug. Suddenly the two of them found themselves in a passionate embrace. Jan looked at Jessica's lips longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, would Jan actually make a move on Jessica?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jan looked at Jessica's lips longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan then decided that she couldn't resist temptation any longer. She leaned in and planted a big kiss right on Jessica's lips. Jessica leaned in to kiss her as well, but suddenly found herself pulling away from Jan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan realized that Jessica had pulled back, and pulled back herself. She was suddenly petrified that she had done the wrong thing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Jessica!\" Jan said in a panic. \"I'm sorry, you didn't want that. I should have just, came to talk to you, or uh, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan had begun to scramble for excuses and Jessica simply looked at her and smiled. More words were just escaping Jan's mouth but Jessica wasn't listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica leaned back in and kissed Jan again, much to her surprise. This time Jessica wrapped her arms around Jan and began to feel her way around her wings. Jan instinctively wrapped her leg around Jessica's and squirmed as Jessica felt around the sensitive root of her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica could feel that Jan was really enjoying what she was doing, so she kept running one hand around her back while she slid the other one down towards her bare backside. Jan was now on top of Jessica on the couch. Jessica soon moved her hand from Jan's backside and moved her hand through her legs to Jan's pussy. She suddenly slid her finger into Jan's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan let out a little yelp of pleasure and surprise and flashed a devious smile to Jessica. Jessica smiled back at her and slid another finger into the opening. Jan reared back a little bit and her wings fluttered involuntarily. Jessica couldn't help but laugh at her reaction. She rubbed her fingers around the walls of Jan's vagina over and over again. By the time she was ready to cum, Jan's wings were causing her to hover over her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan's moans and and breathing got more frequent and more labored as Jessica kept going. Soon Jan was unable to take it any more and let out one giant moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back arched as she threw her hips forward. Jessica could feel her cum sliding onto her hand. Suddenly, in the throws of her passion, Jan grew to where Jessica now only came up to her chest. Her bodily fluids grew with her, and a giant wave of cum splashed across Jessica's chest and stomach, much to her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan took a moment to breathe and looked down at Jessica. When she looked around she realized that she was now flying just above the couch. She then looked at Jessica and realized she had grown involuntarily. Looking down at the remains of their fun Jan realized that she had left quite the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan giggled to herself as Jessica rubbed her finger over it and stuck it in her mouth, seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go get a towel to help you clean up.\" Jan joked as she shrunk back to Jessica's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan walked into the bathroom of Jessica's \"apartment\" while Jessica stretched out on the couch. She ran her index finger in the Jan's cum and then ran it in between her breasts, which caused her to quiver in excitement. Jessica slid her fingers into her pussy at the thought of all the fun that her and Jan could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan then came back with a towel, and laughed when she found Jessica fingering herself on the couch. She threw the towel onto Jessica's abdomen and walked up to her and began to help her clean up. As Jan was rubbing the towel on Jessica's stomach, Jessica grabbed one of Jan's hands and moved it to her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then rubbed one of Jan's fingers around her nipple. Jan smiled at this and rubbed her finger around it. She took her other hand off the towel and cupped Jessica's other breast. She reached up to kiss Jessica. First on the lips, then on her neck and she looked down at the fluids on her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then licked the fluid from her abdomen up towards her breasts. Jessica moaned and Jan licked it again. Jan then licked the crack between Jan's breasts, before moving on to her nipples. She began to lick her cum off her chest while Jessica still touched herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she found that she had cleaned her breasts, Jan began to suck on on Jessica's tits. Jan used her hand to take out Jessica's and inserted her own fingers into her pussy. It soon became too much for Jessica to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan felt Jessica's cum flowing out around her hand and rubbed faster until it stopped. She then pulled her hand out and looked up at her lover. She gave her a mischievous look and licked the fluid off her fingers while her friend looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now that they've had their fun, what happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jessica scooped some of the cum off her hand before saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna need a little more than just this towel to clean up, Jan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they at least got the hot water working in here, then.\" Jan replied. \"Or else I'm gonna have to take you back to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wiped the goop on Jan's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess, you're just going to have to join me now.\" Jessica said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky you're so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan leaned in and kissed Jessica again. The two of them then stood up from the couch and walked into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as they stepped inside the shower, the two of them were running their hands all over each other again. Soon they were rubbing the soap that had been left for them all over each other. Once they shut off the shower, they simply couldn't keep their hands off each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Jan kissed from the time they got to the shower, until Jessica laid Jan on the bed. Jessica then moved to Jan's other lips, and began to eat her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had never felt anything like this, she didn't know if it was only because she had never done it with a woman, or if it could have been because of her shrunken state. Either way, she didn't take very long to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had reached that point, she returned the favor for Jan. After they had each cum, the two found themselves exhausted. As Jan crawled her way towards the pillows, Jessica got up and got the blanket off the floor by the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crawling into bed next to her newfound lover, Jan wrapped her arms around her and pulled her closer to her chest. Jessica couldn't help but fall asleep. Suddenly, she was woken by Jan's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst! Hey, Jessica! Are you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Jessica replied groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are was this a one time thing, or?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggled to herself. \"I think you already know that this isn't going to be just a one-time thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess your'e right. I just wanted to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggled, and tried to fall asleep again, but she heard a fluttering sound behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down there sparky, I know you're excited but the beats off your wings is making it hard to sleep.\" Jessica joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll, Jan could manage to do was to laugh and stop herself. Soon enough as Jessica was falling asleep again, she heard the sound again. This time however, she didn't say anything. She simply thought about how cute it was that she was so excited to have someone her size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Black Widow walked into the lab to check on her friend before the additional testing began that day. She looked into the little apartment thing that Tony had rigged up for her and noticed the lights were out inside. She knew that the testing wouldn't begin for a while, but thought that Jessica might want some time to prepare herself for the tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicked the latches that kept the roof of the room attached to the rest of the room and lifted it upwards. When she looked into the house, she made a peculiar discovery there appeared to be two people sleeping in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in to get a closer look, and realized that both Jessica and the Wasp were in the bed. She inspected the rest of the room not particularly wanting to wake up the two women. She looked over towards the couch in the bedroom and saw a little black suit lying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down to pick it up and realized that the suit was also accented with yellow, and realized it was The Wasp's suit, the then looked back towards the two women sleeping in the bed, and reached a finger towards the corner of the covers by Jan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeled back the corner and revealed Jan's bare ass and covered her mouth so that the two women wouldn't be disturbed by the sound of her giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was left with a choice. Would she wake up the two women, or would she leave them alone and come back later?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Down here!!\" Haruna further added in exclamation. Rito then proceeded to look below him and saw the tiny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruna?!\" Rito asked, confused, but not surprised. He quickly put two and two together and bluntly asked her. \"Let me guess. Lala?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah\", Haruna shyly told him, feeling awkward next to a boy 50 times her height. \"I borrowed a pen from her and it shrank me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry! I'll find her and return you to normal\", Rito smiled, reaching out his left hand to the ground. Haruna quickly climbed on it, and Rito also grabbed Haruna's stuff she left on the ground when she shrank. As Rito raised his hand from the ground, Haruna held on to his middle finger with a death grip. To her it felt like being lifted over 100 feet in the air as Rito slowly lifted his left arm and placed Haruna in his shirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it will be bumpy, but don't worry. I'll protect you!\" he assured the girl, who blushed a little when he told her this. Then Haruna snapped out of it and told Rito to quickly go find Lala.

We need you to fix this!\" an an angry Rito told Lala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Rito\", a happy Lala replied over the phone. \"The effects only last for 24 hours. Then they'll be back to their normal size. See you at home for diiner, Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the phone call between the two ended then as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"24 HOURS?!\" an annoyed Yui yelled. \"I have homework to do and chores to get done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My older sister will never believe this\", Haruna sadly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sairenji and Kotegawa\", a confident Rito told them. \"You can stay with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" replied Haruna and Yui at the same time, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Mikan already knows about this whole magic stuff, and Lala...well, I'll try to keep Lala away from you two. So what do you say?\"</span></div></div>",
